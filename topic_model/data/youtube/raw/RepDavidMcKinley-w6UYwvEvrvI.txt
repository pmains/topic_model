virginia mr mckinley you would add that thank you mr chairman um and welcome back miss mccarthy um that last question perhaps needed a little bit more but if we have time we'll get back to that but um it's interesting that you just you you said all of the above yes um and you you said i think earlier in your testimony about the the the for sequestration with coal they can go ahead with sequestration but i thought it did i maybe i didn't hear crack did you say there is an existing facility now with sequestration you said there it is going on today there are facilities at a large scale can you can you share with that we don't have any i have no listing to those commercially could you send that to our office or someone to release that most certainly if you would thank you but let's go back to the sequestration again um because in your testimony you're saying you believe in in we should be pursuing the sequestration as a route to continue to use fossil fuels coal particularly administration but yet the doe just cut the netl's laboratory by 41 so you know that's where the research and development for coal that's that's where we have the the the um the the plans for carbon capture and sequestration which didn't get funded at all under this so can you share do you agree with the doe's idea to slash funding for coal research i am aware that there's been significant funding to to uh my question was do you agree with legislation i i am not aware of doa's current plan you weren't aware that they cut it forty one percent um i i just i'm astounded with that that because i think the idea of using it is fine but then then to cut the cut the research for it shows it's disingenuous on the part of this administration uh to have it but try to have it ways let me go let me go to the economic models because in your testimony on on page 2 of 10 you use a lot of statistic you talk about that the model year 2016 the cars will cost maybe only 950 dollars but we have heard from testimony from the epa time and time again that it just i really have to question your economic model if you look at if we could if we could have up on the chart first one you were predicting or the epa was predicting that the um uh the grid reliability was only going to be four gigawatts uh and and everyone else was showing that they were in the 50 to 60 to 70 gigawatts of potential loss we already have one company first energy alone cut four gigawatts out of the system so there's your model there's there's what you're saying and and i've got to question it let me go to the second one having to do with with heavy duty trucks in this in this chart this was from 2014 from 204 to 2010 the compliance you can see it in different years that it it talks about these these charts this one in particular says in 2004 you the epa was predicting that that the cost of compliance was only going to be 900 some dollars or less than a thousand dollars but in reality it was over four thousand dollars and in 2007 you were predicting it might be four thousand but in reality it was closer to eight thousand and then just last two years ago you were pretty you all were predicting it was going to be just over three thousand but the cost was nine thousand dollars uh could i see the next chart here's another one in 2010 this talks about your estimate was three thousand four hundred dollars but look down the list of all of these from freightliner international kenworth mack peterbelt volvo western star are all in the nine thousand dollar range three times the amount that you are predicting i i really question your your your your ability to estimate um and because we rely on those estimates when when the people on the other side of the aisle we're trying to work together on this and if your numbers are good we want to work with them but i come from the construction industry when we give an estimate we live with it are you ready to live with it if your estimates are wrong are you going to reimburse the consumers for the cost that you have incurred because you have convinced congress to adopt these heavy regulations because they're only going to cost three thousand dollars but in the real world it costs nine thousand dollars are you going to reimburse the consumers i i believe that over over the course of the last 40 years that epa has done some of the best economic modeling available to any so you're disagreeing with all you do not have any idea what those chats were who they who they developed them or on what basis those were not charts developed by the epa so if if we reveal if that information is available we're happy to take a look at it and to provide you some input as to whether or not we we believe it's that's it's fair i mean i've got your numbers you've just projected your numbers at 900 and and we can see it's gonna and you're predicting that it's gonna be nine hundred dollars four years from now and the only other thing i would like to clarify is that the the retirement slide that you put up is we took great pains in the in the mercury and toxic standard to do that understanding the impacts associated with the utility industry we knew that there were more than those retirements strictly as a matter of business decisions related to the market what you are seeing closing are inefficient old coal-fired power plants that cannot compete moving forward i'm sorry my times laughed but everyone else had the same information and they used more accurate they came to a better conclusion than you did thank you

hello everybody and welcome welcome welcome to our first we've got a plan from that candidate series warn Democrats is so excited to be launching this new series we've endorsed some incredible candidates from across the country and you can go right now to Elizabeth Warren comm slash endorsements to find out more about them but this series it's going to be our chance to bring folks together to talk to them about their races the issues that really matter to them and how we can all get involved to help them win so today for our first series I'm very excited to actually be able to hand it over to Senator Warren who is joining us today to chat with one of our endorse candidates who is fresh off of his primary win Jamal Bowman so with that Senator I will hand it over to you oh thank you very much Maya and hello Warren Democrats I'm so glad to be here with all of you you know it is such an honor to be with you in community this afternoon and I am also so glad that we have so many progressive champions with us like Assemblymember you lean new representative Cindy polo and Christine Marsh they're all going to join us later in this conversation now I'm gonna get straight to the point here as I always do this is a time of tremendous crisis for our nation and across this country the fight to dismantle structural racism has reached a new threshold we have seen unemployment reach the highest level since the Great Depression and people of color are being infected and dying from the Kovach virus at disproportionate rates the Trump administration's response to injustice into the Kuran virus outbreak has been hateful reckless and incompetent as this administration continues to fall short it is critical that we look to strong decisive leadership not just at the White House but up and down the ballot now more than ever we need new leaders we need new voices we need new people fighting for a government that works for everyone and that is why I was so honored to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Jamal Bowman in his campaign for Congress you know with Jamal whether it's fighting for high quality public schools or fighting for affordable housing or fighting to root out systemic racism Jamal is going to be a champion for working people in Washington his historic victory is proof that the moment for big structural change was never just about winning one election it's about a lot of Elections we came together to fight side by side for an America that works for everyone Warren Democrats is a movement for everybody who believes in the power of bold inclusive reform the kind that we need to root out corruption in government and to put power in the hands of the people and that is exactly the kind of change that Jamal and I are going to be fighting for in Congress all of our candidates who are here today Jamal and you lean and Cindy and Christine all of them know that the kind of change we'll be fighting for is not going to come easy but today I make you this promise whenever the door is open even if it's just a crack for real systemic reform is what we're gonna get done we're gonna shove our shoulders into that door we're gonna push it all the way and we're going to give that fight everything that we've got so what do you think Jamal are you ready for it I am ready for it absolutely it's a fight I've been a part of for the last 20 years in education if for my entire life as a black man in America so I'm ready let's go I think that's great so Jamal let me ask you just a little bit about your camp and about why you ran you saw a need for change in your district can you just say a little bit about what was broken and what issues motivated you to run you know to put it simply our children were dying I mean they were literally dying in the streets of the Bronx and throughout the 16th district you know during the 2017-2018 school year 34 children died within the K to 12 school system in the Bronx and 17 died via suicide and right here in our district a young girl a ninth grader after being bullied in high school went to the top of the building in co-op city and jumped off a building and in New Rochelle which is also a part of the district one young girl murdered another young girl during the dispute during a lunch break and as an educator we see the connection between bad policy poverty the trauma our kids go through and their outcomes not just in terms of economic and health care and education but literally life-or-death situations and working in education for twenty years and seeing how underfunded our schools are and under resources our communities have been and how neglected they've been this is not a matter of people who don't work hard this is a matter of institutional neglect and discrimination and racism because I've worked with black and brown kids my entire life so I got to the point where it where enough was enough I got to the point where you know our school was doing great work and we wanted to do a lot more we felt we can have a larger impact if we explore the run for office the people seemed excited about it we got in and they they showed out for us on Election Day so I actually I want to ask you a little bit more about that because I'm glad you talked about this you are an educator a principal you've served your district and the children in your district for many many years as I watched your campaign it was clear to how strong your ties to your community are and how important it was for you to ground your campaign in your community so can you tell us just a little bit about how community played a role in your successful campaign and also how it plays a role in the grassroots movement that were building yes so community was everything you know I was very lucky because I've served this district for ten years as the middle school principal so we came in with thousands of positive relationships from former students and families but that connection wasn't just with my students that connection was with young people all across the district so our district is incredibly diverse but it's also incredibly segregated both economically and racially so the goal was to connect to the people who have been mostly ignored throughout our political process for decades the goal was to connect with them first and bring them into the conversation from the very beginning this was not about targeting those who vote all the time in primaries this is about this was about those who are disengaged and disconnected and that's why we went with a triple voter turnout on Election Day that's unheard of for primary particularly in the middle of a pandemic so we're very proud of that and today I met with someone in a part of the district Mount Vernon who wanted to take a selfie so I got my Elizabeth Warren or that's it selfie with them the same way you love to do it and she said to me said my daughter's gonna be so excited and asked - how old is your daughter she said 15 so to have a 15 year old be excited about this campaign and leaning into a primary that's the America we are all trying to build and the last thing I want to say is we were endorsed by over 60 grassroots organizations and individuals in this campaign grassroots organizations that have been doing the work on the ground for decades so to have that support and to build that community diverse community across district was incredible very exciting it is so terrific I just I love hearing this story of the selfie it's perfect you know we all saw how the pandemic hit New York so hard and especially the residents of color can you just say a word about what showing up for our neighbors for our family for our friends looks like for leaders and for our elected representatives and how those who are engaged in campaigns which is what we're talking about today can be sure that they're caring for their communities directly when they take political action that's the key word caring like first and foremost you have to put campaigning on the side and you have to contact people and check in to see how are they doing so that's what we did you know when we pivoted to a virtual world and the phone banking operation the first question was how are you doing how's it going what do you need how can I help those were the first questions we were asking and through those conversations we were able to connect with food pantries and Yonkers and Mount Vernon we were able to make food deliveries deliveries to people in the Bronx we were able to deliver PPE to nurses in st. Joseph's Hospital matzo fury Hospital and a Mount Vernon Hospital so it was about you know getting your hands dirty getting out there and supporting the people who needed to support the most I mean here we were rallying with nurses demanding PPE they also want to mention how it's great that we were able to do that but it's unacceptable that our federal government didn't do more from the very beginning to make sure the resources were in place to help people deal with this pandemic and in this district you know the second case of New York State he landed in this district in New Rochelle and because that community was upper middle class and wider that community got everything it needed within eight days the proper response a testing site National Guard delivering food closing the schools in containing the area but it's a co-op city mostly black community mostly senior community another 23 days to get a testing site it's a young curse Mount Vernon in NYCHA another 53 days to get a testing site so we cannot be shocked about the disproportionate outcomes because the response was disproportionate and unfortunately to be black in America as a pre-existing condition and that's why we're so excited about your campaign because you are doing everything in your power to fight to stop that and I look forward to fighting with you yeah that's what we're gonna do Jamal you know it's so clear to hear you talk that you fight from the heart and that's what people understand you go out and you live your values every day you fight for what you believe in that's how you build the kind of campaign that you built and that's how you pull people in and that's how we make change so I'm just so glad to be here with you today I really do appreciate your taking the time to do this and we've got some more folks we're gonna talk to Maya you you're ready to bring in some more people into this conversation I sure AM thank you so much senator and thank you too so much Tim offer for that conversation so we're living through unprecedented times but elections can't wait and it's more urgent than ever to run successful and creative campaigns that engage voters and convey the urgency of voting in this moment Warren Democrats is so proud to be supporting Democratic candidates who are fighting for progressive change mobilizing people to support those candidates and big structural change for this country and continuing to build on the grassroots movement that Elizabeth Warren has inspired this series that we've got a plan for that series is going to be a conversation between our endorsed candidate and Senator Warren about important policy topics changing politics a number of the issues that folks are sort of facing as they're running for office so today we're talking about campaigning during the coronavirus how things have changed how the progressive how progressive candidates can still reach voters and how we can win we've had to re-examine and campaign looks like honestly in in these months this is not the environment anyone thought that they were going to be campaigning in so how do we keep constituents voters staff and candidates safe how you know we'll supposed to be build relationships right that's how we campaign how do we do that virtually or with minimal physical contact with voters so today we're going to be talking to three incredible women that we're so excited that warned Democrats is supporting and hearing a little bit about how they have sort of met this moment and how they've been adjusting to this sort of new type of campaigning so I will introduce them and give them a chance to come come on to the video and then we'll have a little bit of a panel discussion assembly member yulie a new who represents lower Manhattan in the New York State Assembly and who just won a primary for reelection yes representative Cindy polo from from the Florida House of Representatives who is also running for reelection in November after winning her recent primary whoo um and Christine Marsh the 2016 Arizona Teacher of the Year who's running for Arizona State Senate her primaries coming up on August 4th so welcome thank you all so so much for joining us I'm really looking forward to this discussion um alright Julie why don't we start with you um how did you show up for your community in the early days of this crisis we saw your PPE and direct aid efforts can you tell us a little bit more about about that and about how that sort of impacted how you were working sure um I think that you know that I had to really kind of just separate it out and um you know I didn't get to campaign the same way that I used to and I didn't get to campaign at all really in a lot of ways because we were not only still in session but we were also you know in the middle of a pandemic and so my response was to actually talk about how things need to be in the budget and I know that you know my budget speech has been out there but the thing is it's really important that the actually stop doing austerity budgeting and actually started to invest in our communities because our infrastructure was so it it's it just it was so weak so that you know the things that were hitting were hitting harder and harder and harder it is through years and years and years of austerity budgeting that we have you know such weak infrastructure you know we always pull from the biggest pots right in our budget and it's always like the biggest pots are always the ones that have the most needs whether it's you know education healthcare transportation how can we cut health care during a global pandemic and so you know I wanted to speak up on that and make sure that my constituents had a voice and that's where it's so important for us to actually you know I guess put the fact that you know and and this is the thing that that was the most hard because when you asked if I could do this panel I was just like you know I didn't get to campaign really I just felt like I'm in this seat now and and so I had to serve my people now in their biggest time of need and so you know I basically helped to help my my constituents by getting PPD's I had to find every contact in the book I had my own family was donating masks that you know they could procure from China and like it was just it was it was a whole community effort really and I also knew that Chinatown businesses were suffering so so it was our district that was hit the hardest my district was hit really really hard starting February just due to xenophobia and racism we hadn't even had a single case in New York and definitely not in Chinatown and yet people were you know beating people up in the subway people were spitting on people people were spraying people with chemicals people were doing all kinds of things to asian-americans here in New York and we saw that with the foot traffic that was diminishing the racist posts by other folks saying that not go to Chinatown I mean it was it was ridiculous you know I had people calling my office like literally looking up to find the only Asian can woman in the entire New York state legislature to call and say you eat back and then hang up you know and so this is the kind of stuff that's been going on you know in my district and also you know throughout America because of some of the racist rhetoric that we've heard coming from some of our leaders supposedly and supposed leaders and so I think that it's been really harmful and hurtful and it has impacted our economy in a way that has has kind of Domino affected and I think that you know one of the things that we've been doing just campaign wise has just been you know making sure that folks get the constituent services that they need I don't there's nothing really more important than showing up for your community in their time of you I really I appreciate that I appreciate the way you put that and I think it's important to remember sometimes we talk about these sort of we're facing you know a health pandemic we're confronting a lot of these issues of white supremacy and racism and we can't you know we you're gonna have to respond our economy is gonna have to bounce back and we talk about them like they're distinct and they're really not and I really appreciate how you're sort of talking about that the intersections there I think that's really important to keep front of mind for folks um so let's talk about what New York sort of looks like right now what does campaigning look like what precautions would you advise both in state and to others to other who earlier in their or sort of earlier in the coab in battle like what would you advise for folks who are trying to figure out how to how to campaign in this moment I mean I think the biggest thing right now is definitely you know stay socially distant make sure that you're considerate of other people and their circumstances you don't know who they have at home you don't know you know is waiting for them at home and you don't know you know if they're three generations deep in one apartment you know and I think that it's really important that you know folks are staying socially distant wearing masks making sure that they are considerate of other folks and and their environment and you know I think that you know our my own staff right now we don't have folks you know going door to door and door knocking the way that we you know what happened that was one of my biggest you know campaign tools was to Dornoch and build those relationships but right now it's been like like we're doing on zoom right now it's been a lot of you know trying to make sure that folks are just getting information I think that it's really important that people are actually just staying with all within all the rules and then as well as you know leading by example I think because you know when people see a lot of people out on the street and doing certain things and they think like wow like you know then we can you know do that too and I think that it's really important that we're leading by example on that front because you know even though on Election Day you know every single person that we had volunteering we had to get people at the poll sites because multiple sites were active but at the same time we made sure that everybody had hand sanitizer everybody had masks everybody was staying you know within the guidelines of what was going on and then we you know all would check you know and ask people like do you have any pre-existing health conditions do you have family members who you're living with with the existing health conditions and I think that's really important to ask and communicate and let people know because you know sometimes people don't ask all the questions themselves and I think it's really important that we have our own checklist great thank you so much for that all right I want to turn now Cindy onto you and talk a little bit I mean look I'm I'm in Texas you're in Florida you know these are both states that are dealing with a lot around kovat and responding after things have not been handled um as well as it feels like they could have been um and so as somebody who's you know you're you're in a state that really is at the forefront of this conversation right now and it is a terrifying time what does continued support from elected leaders to communities look like in your district yeah well good evening everybody thank you so much my it's such an important question and before I answer that can I just say that you liens answer we haven't spoken and so I'm I'm just hearing your answer for the very first time and I'm reminded that we're we are so not alone right so as I know for me especially as a woman in elected office I've always sort of felt that I am that my problems are very unique right and then I sometimes can feel like I don't necessarily have like this great support system and then I hear you can speak and I'm thinking how there's so many of us and we're all like in the same in the same position and have so many more similarities and so I really really appreciate that so there might be a few things that I may echo from down here in in Florida but Maya to answer your question you know what does it look like right now in Florida unfortunately you said it we're at the forefront and not for any good reason we are at the forefront because we have had a governor and a republican-led legislature that has not had the courage to make the right decisions they have decided to just pass blame in our case specifically the governor recently was blaming farmworkers with slate it was blaming Hispanics sort of immigrants that were doing it now it's turned to young folks in the media and so here we really now find ourselves at the forefront again for all the wrong reasons and many of us especially the Democrats that I serve with we have found that the place that we can be there for our community is helping them navigate through a broken unemployment system thanks senator Scott for from making sure that you sabotaged us while you were governor and then the people of Florida didn't know that and so they promoted you to u.s. senator so thanks for that one but it we are basically helping them navigate through a lot of the obstacles that have been created for everyday folks to receive the help that not only are they entitled to but that they are in desperate need of and that that looks different for each of my colleagues there's colleagues that I serve with I'm part of this amazing freshman class that you know we're putting in 20 hours 18 hours a day trying to help people navigate through just filing claims we went through and I know became nationally our unemployment system was essentially like you'd apply for it and then you'd have to reapply and if you didn't get a confirmed status then you have to go back in and so we were just adding burden upon burden and so I'm surrounded by an amazing amount of colleagues that have just helped really everyday folks navigate through this I think for me the unique nature of of what my calling I feel is and it's what brought me to run for office is my seat was held by Republicans for decades probably as far as I can remember as a kid and there was a seat that we flipped because we have elected officials that show up for all the ceremonies and they they have a wall of ribbons that they've cut but when they go up to Tallahassee which is eight hours away in driving they seem to forget that they represent South Florida specifically and so what I have found is my number one calling is to make sure to not let the fear of not being light take over and I make sure that every opportunity I get I call out not just the governor and his lack of action but also the the complicit Republicans that have sat by quietly while he just sort of uses our community for photo ops and our community deserves more than that and and so that you know there are food banks and there are so many people that are out there volunteering and they were there you know as Jamal said at the very beginning making sure that our frontline workers have the proper equipment and I think everyone always learns their lane mine as as a mother of your four-year-old and parents that are in their late 70s this is a this is an ongoing theorem I'm a mother and a daughter first I'm a state legislator third but I bring those fears into this job because that is who I represent they are dealing with these with these fears with this uncertainty all the time and so I make sure every morning to just sort of take a deep breath and realize that if I gotta jump in the fight and call people out I will absolutely do that so from my community specifically it has been about calling out calling out the in action calling out the cowardness that many of our elected officials have gotten away with and making sure that they know that this bigmouth in South Florida is going to remember them when they show up here to campaign that sounds fantastic and for somebody who myself is also a bigmouth and who has relied on big Maps to make sure that a lot of the issues that I care about I'm grateful that your community has you love that I love how you put that um but still then what have you found I mean that you know obviously that outbreak is sort of continuing to shift but you're still campaigning you're still reaching voters what methods have you found have worked well and how do you kind of balance staying safe keeping people safe but still being able to show up and have these conversations well so it's an interesting it's an interesting answer because it's very similar to dealing now it's not campaigning time so we we were also in session we were actually in session right when this basically like broke out nationally we were in our last beauties of session in Tallahassee when we had to go through sort of an emergency I guess we'll call it quarantine just because it's the word of the day but like it was an emergency sort of call to action because we had elected officials who had been in Washington DC and had been exposed possibly exposed I think they're one of the conference's and and so we were living it and unfortunately and I think this is always this is so important to to mention because as a girl from Hialeah Florida just never thought I'd first of all be on a panel hosted by Senator Warren I think it's always very important that I mentioned the community that I'm from because there's a lot of folks that right now are from Florida and need to know that I am I'm one of them but in those last few days we had a Republican representative in the chamber that I am very proud to walk into every day on that last day stand up and essentially go into the soapbox speech about how this was just the flu and we're talking about like this was like March 12th March 12th we had an elected official who is believed by all of the folks that voted for him that this was just the flu and that we were essentially just acting we were being hysterical right and and I know that a lot of my colleagues were just as it said as I as I was I think you know some of the offense probably skipped me because as a woman in office I'm usually called either feisty or or too passionate or I'm easily offended just because I take everything personal and I do because all of these issues are personal you know I've said this to my staff recently you know if your next boss or an elected official that you know does not take politics personal it's time for you to find a new boss and a new elected official because the the fear of not having a paycheck and not being able to pay your rent and not being able to send your child to school all of those fears if we are not fighting for them every single time that we go into into session or into the chamber we have a mic in front of us then then we're not doing our job and so right now as you lean said the priority is serving the priority is making sure that people are receiving help and and I have a lot of faith not just in God but sort of in the universe and in karma and that my community will notice I get attacked a lot as you can imagine a seat that was flipped I'm attacked a lot and we're blue seats surrounded by still a stronghold of red seats down here in South Florida we're like the last sort of standing little area and so I'm attacked a lot by the things that I do or don't do but I think that one of the very important things is to just continue to do our job right and and I feel like the votes show up and the and the people will show up for you if they know that each every time you've had a platform you've had their back and I believe that that my constituents and and that South Florida will have mine when I need them right thank you so much for that um all right Kristin I wanna I want to turn to you now your primary is August earth or a fourth sorry August 4th coming up and now so over to Florida it seems like right now the COBE crisis is is right now right where you are um can you talk a little bit about about what that means and what are the challenges it presents on the campaign trail but more broadly when you're thinking about you know sort of your leadership what how did how is that sort of impacted the way that you're communicating with others well first off thank you for having me here I'm quite honored and I really respect that the warren democrats are really working on down ballot races because they are so important at the local level so we are you know fun fact we are right now in Arizona we are the hot spot of kovat in the entire world not just the nation we are the hot spot in the entire world and I think that that has really delineated for people just how lacking the leadership has been I mean the one the person I'm running against chairs the Senate Health Committee and not a word so we've we've definitely got to change things and I think that this crisis has really brought that to the fore as far as how we have been reacting to things changing quite frankly we shifted completely over to be safe in March so as kovat becomes increasingly more prevalent here which is of course so unfortunate from a campaign perspective from the practical sense we haven't had to shift anything because we already had we're making phone calls we are doing a lot of zoom sessions and so on however it has even more into and I'm gonna echo what Jamal said and Cindy talked about it and you leaned it as well really into trying to help voters trying to help our constituents providing resources we brought thousands thousands of diapers to a foster care center we are hooking people up with you know how to apply for an insurance for unemployment and you know food banks and all of that so in the beginning like in March when kovat first started we were very very focused on helping voters and then for a while voters in Arizona anyway seemed to be kind of stabilizing and we were campaigning a little bit but now with this flare-up we are back to very much trying to be a conduit to making sure that voters have access to all of the help and the resources that they need I I love that and I I mean it's not lost I hope it's not lots of people are hearing this is that everyone did echo this a similar theme which is how much campaigning turns into service provision and moments like this which is incredibly important and we're so grateful that we have leaders that are standing up and doing that but it I mean that that shifts the goals of a campaign right and so I mean I think that's a that's a really important thing to highlight is that and especially at the local level that that relationship really does kind of you know it it it becomes sort of a different thing and and that raises issues as you're trying to actually won while you're like trying to serve your community as well correct yes yeah so then what is the one thing you would say you know you want voters to understand that they can do right now to make their voices heard right now you all on the call wherever you are doesn't matter you could sign up to phone bank with us we phone bank every single day really but especially on Saturdays go to mobilize dot u.s. backslash Arizona LD which is legislative LD 28 because okay and at least on a Arizona level and from what I'm hearing from the other people on the call it is pretty widespread as far as having your voice heard at this moment in time we've tried that we've been there we've done that they're not listening I mean that is why I'm running for office I spent my entire year as Teacher of the Year in 2016 trying to advocate for more funding oh by the way which is why I'm wearing red today it's red for IDI Wednesday hey books yes read read but I I spent that entire year trying to convince legislators that we needed more funding that you know we were tired of being last in the nation or almost less than the nation on every metric and they we couldn't change their minds I couldn't change their minds which means we needed to change them hence me being in this race it's a similar mentality here with kovat so as far as getting people voters having their voices heard right now that isn't gonna happen but what they can do is make sure that we shift the balance of power come phonebank with us come and get involved because that is how we're going to shift the balance of power we've got to elect me and a couple of others here in Arizona in order to start moving the state forward and maybe not be last in education and first and kovat that is me incredibly stark way of putting it that's yeah thank you so much for that all right well that's that I think that it's so interesting for everyone to be running in in such different places and so for so many of those themes to kind of rise to the top as similar things that regardless of where folks are there are so many of these shoes that are impacting communities so what I want to do now is just turn for a moment um and actually do sort of a best practices what we wanted to do is you folks a sense of you know what people are doing um in different campaigns um and you know just kind of give like if folks who are listening want to get involved want to run themselves as Christine put I love that if they won't listen to us that you know if we can change their minds we have to change who they are um if people are planning on you know doing that themselves here are some really good thoughts about you know how folks can be thinking about how to campaign in moments like that so why don't we now turn to you you leave if we can get the slides yes great um shared if you wouldn't mind walking us through what you consider the best practices for this particular moment yeah so I mean fundraising is just hard you know and for women it's even harder so one of the things that we've really kind of put together is zoom events that would help to kind of feel like we're still together but not really be able to do things together so one of the things that I actually did it I know this is like something that you know people might want to emulate but we cook together and so I actually had a cooking show in my kitchen which I'm still in and just kind of did that with the downtown women's for change and we actually did a little cooking event together on Zoom and we ate together and it felt kind of good you know you saw a little kids cooking with their dads and then doing it with all of the women that were in downtown women's for change it was really fun and I think that that really helps with that grassroots involvement and they got got to ask me all kinds of questions you know and it was like you know everybody's in their home so in a way it's kind of really great because you got to see all the generations together or you know different kinds of folks gathering in a way to something that was ending to me and so that was something that is you know amazing so I I thought that that was really fun and then also the fact that you know I think because you know my community is very tight-knit we also got to do something that was really interesting which is to tap into our kind of key supporter and building captain network and you know this is this is like my friends my family people who have like bartending with me at winning is you know captain we stayed in such like one term you know a professional term but it was like you know Uncle Eddie was one of my regulars you know he was helping me make sure that you know people were we're getting calls from Uncle Eddie you know and everybody was was getting chickens and and one of the biggest things that my my campaign office and my staff did was to make sure that we actually did mutual aid checkups and this is something that I think is really really key because while people are making calls it's so important to just ask how you are you know I think that more than anything what we were doing is making sure that like the folks that people would you know we're not able to be mobile people who had a hard time getting access to our district office because you know folks when our remote working I think that it's harder I think and and if we were not making those calls we wouldn't have found some of the cases that we needed to actually help and I think that it's really important that we were doing those calls so one lady you know she actually was left without a home care attendant for four days and she was sitting in her own pcs for four days and she had had a stroke nobody was there to help her and her home care attendant had already put in that she was going you know that she was going to the hospital or kovat and and yet you know the person who didn't have koban her patient was left in her home and the only thing she could say was help when we had picked up and so we actually you know went to her home and found her in that condition and so you know these are things that are just really important to do and I think that it's really important that we were actually making those phone calls in that way just because of the service that we needed to provide and I think that it's also really important Maya as part of this but the Twitter organizing is so big and I think that you know making government accessible in all different ways more accessible more transparent is always so important and I think that more and more young people are getting involved more and more people are being social media savvy and I think that it's really important that we're actually using this amazing tool that can reach so many people at once I know that it's not fun to get some of the hey it's not fun to get a glitter dick or whatever in your DMS but it's not that you sorry I'm full of dankness and and so so it's really important that we are actually using a lot of our platform to be able to get the word out for folks because people don't even know you know what the changes are day to day and so it's really important that we're using that kind of organizing to be able to help people to understand what's going on because transparency and accessibility to government is so keep every step of the way especially at a time when we are needed more than ever and I think that you know those are the kind of big things that I would say are the biggest ways to help to organize it thank you so much that is super helpful um all right why don't we bring up the next slide and Cindy if you wouldn't mind walking us through your best practices well yeah you know again I you lean I don't know how we're not the size but we will be actin songkong because we were just on that we're on the same on the same wavelength the very most important thing that we started doing with wellness checks and we had amazing volunteers within and outside of our districts that were helping us call I represented districts that just within within the own house district has almost like four completely different groups and there's one area in Hialeah that we were the leading city in encoded cases and positive cases in the state of Florida and and we are also sort of the center of a aging population with a lot of facilities for for you know our grandparents and so wellness was was the first one reverse zoom townhalls you know we had to all learn sort of all of this all of this new technology you know for some folks but for others of just allowing ourselves to like have conversations right and being able to listen to some of their issues and some of their concerns you know in our districts we are the hotbed of a blasting issue we have a quarry that is within our districts and they've last three to four times a week that and this has been going on for decades and it destroys homes but it usually happens during the day when most folks are at work and so this this is a time that a lot of people are now becoming very familiar with this issue and with this topic and so allowing ourselves to kind of be receptive to what the concerns are the concerns aren't just at least in our districts the the top ones that you would imagine it was um sort of a lot of other a lot of other issues another great idea was the postcard writing parties we're actually going to have one with a woman's organization this coming up weekend where you know we're gonna be able to chat I you know I I echo what you mean talked about with social media social media is sort of my I guess my almost like my therapist and I'm able to just really share raw like how how I'm feeling about things I encourage folks like follow your follow your elected officials on social media so that they can keep you in tune but with these writing parties it is given an opportunity for us to you know see each other's faces and chit chat and laugh every now and then but also sending out postcards you know the our mail service definitely needs our assistance and support these days so I'm happy that we've been able to do that and and not on this slide but one of the other things I had that I found to be very successful was sort of looking for what our constituents were talking about even you know because sometimes they just don't know who you are they don't know that you're their elected official but they will be on those platforms talking about it my staff I have two amazing women Daphne and Monica who had gone on Facebook pages and I you know look looked up hashtags to see if someone was was looking for help but wasn't necessarily coming to our office to seek it and so you know that that's one of my suggestions is that sometimes you know as much as we wish that everyone knew who we were as down ballot candidates we're not exactly as as famous as we would hope to be and so sometimes we have to go out and seek that information and so you know kudos to all of our staff I'm sure I speak for everyone on here we're you know our names are the ones but these pretty pictures but if not for them we wouldn't be able to be here and and they have been fielding many of those phone calls and many of those emails and have listened to many of our constituents crying and I also like to point out and remind everybody that our constituents don't always vote we here in South Florida we represent a lot of members of our immigrant community who may not or who may not be able to vote for me or against me but I still represent them and so sometimes we have to make sure to go the extra mile to look for them as opposed to expecting them to look for us thank you so much for that all right Christine if you wouldn't mind walking us through your best practices as well yeah we are doing a lot of phone banking and really the thing that's kind of not on there really is the army of volunteers I mean the bottom line is to get people to come and help and to meet them where they are so for that first one that's listed some people are a little bit reluctant to make phone calls to voters but we might them to write postcards or to deliver yard sign so really um everything on my campaign I'm sure on everybody's campaign that's on this call really hinges on this army of volunteers but yeah we are making a ton of phone calls to voters we have zoom phone bank launches usually on Saturday mornings but sometimes other days of the week as well where we give a little bit of information about what's going on in Arizona and bring in special guests like we have representative Stanton every week we try to bring in somebody to kind of provide information and also generate some excitement for our volunteers we also are writing a whole lot of phone sorry a lot of postcards often as a second touch to some of the people that we have phone banked so they'll get a phone call and then a week or two later get a postcard and that's an easy sell to vote to volunteers to get people to come and write postcards and then we hope we might be able to move them into phone banking but if we don't we don't we are doing a zoom house party so somebody in a particular precinct or maybe even a couple of people will be the hosts of a zoom party basically and invite their neighbors and friends and we as candidates go on I'm running with Kelly Butler and Aaron Lieberman who are the current representatives in my legislative district and we are doing a lot of rolodex seeing where our volunteers and we have like said so many volunteers they are just amazing they are reaching out to their friends who live in the district to you know make sure that those people are voting and it's always surprising when we do the rolodex seeing how many people come up that the volunteer might not have even realized like oh I didn't know so-and-so lived within this district and then they're able to shoot off a text or an email or whatever and contact those people individually because remember well shouldn't say remember because I haven't brought it up but I lost in the last cycle by 267 votes out of over 90,000 so all these little you know out of our hundreds of volunteers if every volunteer even just found one person that could be very easily be the difference so yeah it's a but really it comes down to the volunteers and I will be forever grateful I feel like there will be no way once I win and for the rest of my life no way I will ever be able to repay the amount of manpower that has gone into this campaign by fabulous people who are like-minded and have a vision of moving Arizona forward instead of backwards so that is but that I think that's exactly how that's why people volunteer right is the to the extent that there's any way to repay it because you're gonna leave the way that you're gonna leave so that's what people are hoping for and that is why folks are going to go up and and volunteer and that's what I actually want to now sort of turn to and just talk to the folks who are on this call with us right now and and really sort of make two points the first is again I think you know in moments of crisis we see people who are ready to lead do things like transform campaign infrastructure into a way of providing service to their communities those are the people who leave leading us to the moments like this um and so the candidates here who've joined us thank you so so much and all the candidates that weren't Democrats are supporting are really ready to make the change to communities and are gonna need your helps oh I want to make sure folks take a look this is how you volunteer here are the websites for the folks who are who are on this call today go take a look at what's happening if you can phone Bakke phone bank if you can chip in what you can then please do it um you know this is these are unprecedented times and I feel like that's become such a cliche but I think that's particularly important when we're talking about campaigning we've relied so much on digital tools and resources which is great but another important thing to remember is that requires a reliable high-speed Internet connection that not everybody has there are you know there there are difficulties and there are ways that folks will be left out of this process if we do not step up and make sure that we are volunteering so that the phone bank also happens and the postcards are also happening and that we're able to make touches with people for whom the digital divide is wider and and they don't feel as connected in these moments so please take a look do what you can let's keep these these leaders people who are looking at change and the future the way that these women today are get them in office keep them in office and let's you know keep winning for progresses up and down the ballot again seriously thank you all so so much for joining us today and thank everybody for our very first we've got a plan for that series we are going to be doing some piece so be on the lookout and again just thank you for joining us this is a fantastic conversation they're really excited all right have a good one bye everybody

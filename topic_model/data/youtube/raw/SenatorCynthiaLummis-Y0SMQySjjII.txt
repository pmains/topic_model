industry that's obviously on a lot of fire to new technology that's also under a lot of fire bitcoin investors may finally be getting some clarity thanks to legislation introduced by my next guest with me now wyoming senator cynthia lummus first of all congratulations senator i know you and your colleague senator jillian brand worked tirelessly to get this done i read that the bill seeks to encourage responsible innovation by crafting common standards so let's talk about that i want to start we just talked about energy so let's talk about that because that's been a huge criticism particularly with bitcoin mining how could this help well in my state of wyoming where we have a lot of oil and gas you can literally pull a trailer full of mining equipment bitcoin mining equipment up to a flared gas operation hook up the mining equipment to the flaring and save that wasting and wasted asset by using it to mine bitcoin you can also use it in a state like texas that has a closed system for electricity to mine bitcoin during times when consumer demand is otherwise low for electricity and then ramp up bitcoin mining uh when uh consumer demand is opposite that of the the bitcoin miners need so in other words it has a balancing effect almost serving like a battery a storage opportunity uh for excess uh electricity that's my that's just we just talk about elegant solutions on the consumer protection side and the right for a person to keep in control of digital assets how would that look how does that how how might that work out well in under our bill we're going to use the existing regulatory structure and lay the crypto currency structure on top of it so uh bitcoin certainly and almost assuredly ethereum will be commodities they would be subject to regulation by the commodity futures trading commission including spot markets and futures markets then things that are securities would be at the sec those would be things that would require sec disclosures in order to protect consumers by disclosing the information behind that cryptocurrency and taxes how would tax policy apply taxes would be primarily capital gains taxes we want to take care of some accounting snafu's that exist today through our bill and our bill covers those issues as well the stable coin issues that have gone on here recently i think left have been allowed the cynics and critics and those who are just simply opposed to this to you know to sort of go on the offensive how does this bill potentially address that make this a smoother more orderly market yeah i think that our bill solves the stable coin issue the stable coin that failed was an algorithmic stable coin our bill would not allow for algorithmic stable coins that are not a hundred percent hard asset bet it would only allow payment stable coins that are backed by 100 percent hard assets or that are issued by financial institutions that are insured by the fdic so that way you are having a dollar denominated and dollar asset backed issuer issuing the stable coin thereby you can't have one of those massive meltdowns like you did a few weeks ago you know i know it's a 69-page bill there's so much more to go through i just want to say this is really remarkable and you deserve all of the credit that you're going to get from a lot of people over the years let me shift real quick away from this for a moment if i can earlier today a man was arrested near justice kavanaugh's home he was armed with a knife apparently reports say he wanted to harm the supreme court justice and it brings me to a headline i read where you are actually rethinking gun legislation our country isn't turmoil do you think all of this means more compromises to try to get us back on on path well i think it what what i'm seeing is there is a a some serious and sincere effort on the part of both parties to talk about the broader set of issues around people that are merging emerging from the covid isolation with mental problems people who have been on their computers using very destructive games for months on end isolated from people getting angry getting frustrated and now emerging from that isolation as a very different person who has mental problems so if there's a chance that we're going to see more of this we need to address the mental health issues not the gun issues and so i have opened myself up to discussions of the mental health components of this as well as the fact that a lot of juvenile records are expunged once that juvenile hits the age of majority and the clock starts over again as if they'd had no juvenile record i think there are serious discussions going on here in the senate about making sure that for a violent young person uh the expungement does not occur uh and so uh when the background check is done uh there is evidence of that previous violence senator thank you very much for for that and also of course all the work that you're doing on the crypto world thank you very much thank you charles folks

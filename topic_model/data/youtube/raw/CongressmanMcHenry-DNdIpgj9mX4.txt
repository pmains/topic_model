>>> THE MASSIVE DATA BREACH OF EQUIFAX FORCING CONGRESS OVERALLING BUSINESS AT CREDIT  BUREAU, JOINING US IS PATRICK  McHENRY, HE'S INTRODUCING A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRES CREDIT  BUREAU USING SOCIAL SECURITY >> I AM SURE YOU THOUGHT OF THE  ALTERNATIVES TO SECURITY NUMBERS, WHAT WOULD IT BE AND  WHAT DO SCIENCE SAY IN TERMS OF  HOW MUCH RELIABLE THEY WOULD BE  VERSES SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS >> YOU GOT A WHOLE VARIETY OF  METHODS. YOU CAN USE DIFFERENT  OPPORTUNITIES AND WE LEAVE IT UP TO THE INDUSTRY TO DECIDE WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE THE DAY AND AGE OF US USING  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IN THE HANDS OF CONSUMER CREDIT BUREAUS SHOULD END MOST AMERICANS HAVE NEVER HEARD  OF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT IS PROTECTED AND CONSUMERS DON'T  HAVE TO CONTINUE THESE BAD BREACHES WHAT'S THE PERCEPTION OF THIS  BILL FROM YOUR COLLEAGUES? >> WELL, A LITTLE CONFIRMATION FROM EQUIFAX OBVIOUSLY SOUND POLICIES AND A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. CONSUMER CREDIT BUREAUS DON'T  HAVE AN ON-SITE CYBER SECURITY EXAMINATION ON REGULAR BASIS OR  ANY BASIS BY FEDERAL OR STATE  AND LOCAL OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  AGENCIES WE CHANGED THAT AND I THINK IT IS A NECESSARY AND PROPER STEP >> DO YOU THINK SOMETHING SHOULD GO FURTHER FOR CONGRESS WHEN I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU SEE THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE DOABLE THAT THEY ARE WITHIN SORT OF THE CONSTRUCTS OF THE WAY THE  INDUSTRY EXISTS NOW. DO THERE NEEDS TO BE CHANGES OF  THE WAY THIS INDUSTRY OPERATES IN THAT YOU AND I HAVE DATA IN THIS COMPANY WITH ALL THESE  THREE COMPANIES, WE HAVE NO SAY  AND HOW COMPANIES USE DATA AND HOW THEY PROFITS OFF OF THE DATA AND HOW IT IS SECURED. >> WELL, FIRST THING, PART OF  VIOLATIONS, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THESE BUREAUS TO PROTECT  OUR DATA WHICH IS PART OF THEIR  CURRENT BUSINESS MODELS. MY BILL SAYS THEY CANNOT CHARGE  YOU FOR A CREDIT FREEZE. I WOULD SAY CURRENTLY DUE. I THINK THERE IS A LARGER  QUESTION OF THE USEFULNESS OF  THE THREE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON  CONSUMERS AND DATA THEY USE AND  HOW THEY COLLECT THEIR DATA. THAT'S A LARGER QUESTION AND THE SHORT RUN OF MY LEGISLATION WILL PROTECT CONSUMERS AND MAKE THE SYSTEM MORE RESILIENCE AND PROTECT US THAT'S THE FIRST STEP. >> YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING THAT  COMES TO MIND FOR ME AND THAT'S  HOW THESE COMPANIES COLLECT THE  DATA THEY ARE GETTING THE DATA FROM OTHER COMPANIES THAT I DO  BUSINESS WITH, WHETHER IT IS A LANDLORD WHOSEAPPLICATIONS IFILL I FILL OUT OR BANK OR AUTOLEASE  OR WHATEVER WHERE THEY MAYBE ASKING MY SOCIAL SECURITY N NUMBERS SO THE TENNTACLES OF THIS GO VES VERY FAR. >> OUR LEGISLATION GO TO THAT. THIS IS WHY IT IS MORE WIDE  RANGING IN EFFECT ON THOSE THAT  DOUSE LENDI-- THOSE THAT COLLECS DATA THERE IS NO PROVISION OF FEDERAL LAW THAT PERMITS THAT. THIS MEASURE SAYS THEY SHOULD  NOT BE COLLECTING OUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AND MAKING IT EASY FOR GLOBAL CYBER HACKERS TO TAKE OUR INFORMATION AND THROUGH THESE BREACHES >> I AM CURIOUS OF WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU ARE HEARING  FROM THE THREE CREDIT BUREAUS, EQUIFAX AND TRANS UNION AND  WHAT'S YTHEIR ARGUMENTS? >> YOU ARE USING MY INFORMATION  AND PROFITING OFF OF ME WITH MY  INFORMATION. LETS JUST STOP THAT. THAT'S ONE AND TWO, LETS NOT MAKE IT SO EASY THAT WHEN YOU  GET HACKED ALL OR TWO-THIRDS OF  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE CONSEQUENCES AND SO, LOOK, THEY GOT PUSHED  BACK AND WE'LL PUSH THROUGH  THIS MY LEGISLATION IS MEASURED AND WE GOT OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND OTHER POLICYMAKERS THAT ARE  LOOKING MUCH MORE DEEPER OF  BUSINESS MODEL OF A REASON O

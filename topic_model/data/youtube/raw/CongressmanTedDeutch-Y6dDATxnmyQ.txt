it's now a member of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committee's Democratic congressman Ted Deutsch of Florida congressman what what happened with that vote yesterday and why did Republicans vote against a bill to fund election security and will Republicans say well we have our own version of that bill that will protect election security just as much as the Democrats well thanks Jeff first of all no they're not going to say they have their own bill that there's no good answer for the fact that every Republican in the House of Representatives voted yesterday against additional funding for election security and a vote that took place at the end of a week when the president started the week by showing that he was with Putin and instead of with America and a week after just a week after came down that showed the extent of this hacking and what the Russians were tried to do what the response the pathetic response I must say to this language that would have added funding to go to our state's to help prevent cyberattacks from the Russians the response from a lot of my Republican colleagues was we shouldn't be doing that if we want to protect our elections we ought to pass more voter ID laws it's tone-deaf it's unpatriotic it is inexplicable and I heard you a little earlier Joe you're right good luck going home and trying to explain to your constituents why the week that we saw the president on stage with Putin the week we discussed their efforts to attack our democracy and the way they did attack our democracy we want nothing to do with preventing it from happening again we've been we've been talking a lot this morning about what the Democrats message could and should be this coming fall in 2020 you know we see with her polling that a lot of Republicans now seem to favor dealing with Planet Putin and they approve of the president's performance this week why do you think this is so important but why do you think is this an issue you guys can actually run on well it's sure we're not gonna run on election security and funding for it but in the the big picture look what's the message people want to be they're proud Americans want to be proud of their government they're not proud of this government and that's not true just for Republican for Democrats it's true for Republicans - it's true because of the way the president talks about women the numbers that the discussion about millennial women who's surprised the millennial women don't like a president given the way he talks about women it's true as they look at that the president's standing on stage people want to be proud and know that the president is standing up for our national security not standing on stage looking like someone who's a pawn for Vladimir Putin sure I want to ask you something because I felt I actually emotionally felt something on the USA USA and it was what I was talking about before and what the message needs to be it's a vote for democracy it's a vote for freedom and I want to we've back to what Patrick said I couldn't agree with him more it's about the women and if you do an air that says to a young millennial woman this is what your grandmother fought for fight for your own granddaughter and what we stand for and it's up to you to protect us know so it's not about voting but it's that emotion that happened in Congress yesterday if you can gin that up in the base and you don't trash Trump and you don't talk about how he treats women it's just about who we are it's the vote of a lifetime that's what I saw happening with the Congress yes I know people are cynical about politics and I understand that a lot of people will watch that and think it's just for show but there is this sense of patriotism you saw it some of my Republican colleagues realized what was going on and jumped to their feet it's impossible not to want to stand up right now at this moment for our democracy I agree with you standing for our democracy making sure that our votes will be protected really matters but also Doni those the same women also care about the fact that this president is tearing kids from their parents that's a border that resonates with they care about the fact that that the administration is hell-bent on taking away health care coverage for people with pre-existing conditions all of that matters to them but it all comes from this deep places of patriotism and frustration I head America they're not there you talked about people being cynical there are people that might look at that video and say well this is grandstanding from Democrats who just wanted to make a show because they couldn't actually pass the bill what is the plan now going forward as president Trump supporters are following him they're saying Vladimir Putin should be someone that we're close to what are Democrats going to do now if you don't have the votes to pass legislation well it's first of all it's really important to point out and I don't know I I think that assertion that if they're falling in line behind the President on his relations with Vladimir Putin not from what I've seen and it if you look at the tweet series I'm talking about I'm sorry I was talking about the Trump supporters oh sure and and I saw that we all saw those polls a lot of Trump supporters think that the president is right on I'm not gonna try to convince everyone that that when the president stands on stage and seems to care more about Vladimir Putin and be there to do his bidding instead of standing up for Americans national security I can't convince everyone I know that the overwhelming majority of people watched the president on stage and were horrified by what they saw I'm going to continue we're going to continue to talk to those people and talk about what we need to do to to address this issue we're gonna look back on this summer I'm convinced we're gonna look back on this summer in history and the way the President did the work of Vladimir Putin not just standing next to him but he attacked the g7 he went to NATO and attacked NATO he stood up and attacked our allies specifically he attacked the EU that's what Vladimir Putin wants him to do it's not about having a good relationship with Russia it's not even just about sanctions we've imposed sanctions we dragged the president kicking and screaming to do it but we've imposed sanctions but when we impose sanctions and then the president goes into a closed-door meeting with Vladimir Putin he has what some conversation that we have no idea that the Director of National Intelligence has no idea what it was about that's something that everyone is nervous about everyone understands the threat that it it provides all right congressman Ted Deutsch thank you so much for being with us and of course the congressman would like us to let everybody in his district know no relation to Donny

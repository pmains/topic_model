hello friends this is congressman patrick mchenry i just want to take a brief moment to say happy independence day 246 years ago our founding fathers came together and signed their name on our key founding document the declaration of independence and in that document it reminded us that god has given us certain unalienable rights among them are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness let's remember that on this special day and while we're at it why don't we thank our law enforcement for keeping us safe as well thanks so much hope you have a great day

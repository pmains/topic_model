yeah let's discuss with a key member of the january 6 select committee republican congressman adam kinziger congressman thank you so much for joining us as you heard and as you know uh at least right now there are a few republicans a few republicans very few like senator romney speaking up but you say this is about the 13th time you've been censured why do you still want to be a member of a party that seemingly all the time now rejects you and rejects the values you uphold yeah it's a good question i'm not sure i particularly want to be a member but i believe you know in what the republican party used to stand for and i believe that the republican party it's going to be around for a while it plays a very important role obviously in politics and very well may take the majority they deserve to have the truth told to them and right now there's just a few of us willing to tell the base voters the truth there's a lot of people hiding in the sand because the truth is hard and it makes their life a little uncomfortable i think we have to fight for the soul of not just the party but the country uh we are in a real dire moment wolf and and i think if we don't wake up and recognize that this is more than just performance art when we lie when we tell people elections were stolen uh this actually goes to the survival of this country in the form we know it it's that serious it's worth fighting for but i tell you i do ask myself that question every day it's a legitimate question uh the rnc uh as you know is also trying to do some damage control after calling the january sixth insurrection uh they called it legitimate political discourse in a formal public statement at their big meeting out in utah but watch just part of this new video just released by the u.s justice department from that day and i need to warn our viewers that this language is very disturbing if pence came we're gonna drag [ __ ] through the streets you [ __ ] politicians are gonna get [ __ ] drunk through the streets yeah because we're not gonna have our [ __ ] [ __ ] stolen because this is the second [ __ ] revolution we're here to take it back from you cut that freaking head off cut their head off how dangerous is it congressman for the republican national committee to whitewash the events of that day and to simply call it legitimate political discourse oh it's extremely dangerous and it's not even it's it's if there was a word even more intense than dangerous i would use that because when you convince people that the person talking there obviously pretty upset probably really believes what he's saying and you can multiply him by hundreds of thousands or millions of people because their leaders tell them the election was stolen look if if the election was legitimately stolen i'd be pretty ticked off too that violates everything i swore to defend and so when you convince that number of people it is not a far thought wolf to think that someday some militia shows up somewhere to do something and then some counter militia shows up and truly at that point that's how you end up in a civil war i never would say that we would ever have ended in that position but i now believe it is a a real possibility that we have to be wide-eyed as we walk into so we don't have that happen again and anybody that thinks that sounds cool or they get to play dress-up because you know they somehow think it's going to be fun to go out and camp with their buddies and have a civil war there are people that really think that well you know the four or five heart medicines you're on walgreens isn't going to have them available when this place fails that's how serious this is am i hearing you right congressman you fear potentially there could be a civil war here in the united states i do and i and a year ago i would have said no not a chance but i have come to realize that when we don't see each other as fellow americans when we begin to separate into cultural identities when we begin to basically give up everything we believe so we can be part of a group and then when you have leaders that come and abuse that faithfulness of that group to violent ends as we saw on january 6 we we would be naive to think it's not possible here and it's not like you know the blue and gray north and the south it just turns into violence like you see in other countries we have to look at this wide-eyed and walk in and say we may have differences as left and right but we have to bridge those differences because our basic survival is at stake the basic survival of this democracy wow those are really strong words uh and you heard the republican national committee say it was just legitimate political discourse uh congresswoman kinsaker thanks so much for joining us on a very very different note i want to show our viewers this beautiful picture this is little christian your newborn son i think he's about three months old now we just want to congratulate you the uh it's really really sweet and we're really uh happy for you uh very very uh lovely lovely young young little boy thank you appreciate it thank you

the taliban can't be trusted this is such a major strategic blunder that we've engaged in and i'm not sure that we can recover from it i think the only thing we can do right now is recover our people and what we need from the binding administration is simply standing up to the taliban on that front the unfortunate reality is that biden's national security team uh invited himself have long been on the wrong side of history they're long they've long been on the side of appeasement they they still have this world view that if you appease the enemy then they'll be nicer to us now this is not true this is not living in reality it is not how the taliban function um they will harbor terrorists we're already we're already seeing uh signs of that they will hunt down americans we're already seeing signs of that they'll hunt down our afghan allies there's bipartisan outrage on this bipartisan support for extending that deadline and saying look we're not leaving just because you say you want us to leave we're going to leave when we feel that we've gotten everybody we want out out

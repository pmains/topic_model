RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I APPRECIATE IT. I WANT TO THANK DHS BEFORE I GO TO EXTEND MY CRITICAL RELIEF TO FAMILIES IN NEVADA, THOSE FAMILIES APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH. WE KNOW THAT CONGRESS MUST TAKE ACTION TO ENACT IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT SCARES AND PROVIDES A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR TPS RECIPIENTS, DREAMERS, AND OTHERS. AS WE WORK TOWARDS THIS GOAL I APPRECIATE AND THE NEVADA FAMILIES APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION. NOW I AM GOING TO TURN TO THE TOPIC OF THE HEARING, THREATS TO THE HOMELAND. DIFFICULT SUBJECT, RISING ANTISEMITISM. EVERY WAY WE SEE MORE AND MORE ATTACKS AND OUTBREAKS OF ANTISEMITISM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY RECORDED INCIDENTS NATIONWIDE I BELIEVE ARE AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. THE DAY GOES BY WITHOUT A ANOTHER REPORT OF INTEREST MEDICAID CRIME ON PROMINENT INDIVIDUALS INCITING ANTI JEWISH CONSPIRACY THEORIES. THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AROUND THE WORLD FACING INCREASING DISCRIMINATION AS WELL AS THREATS AND VIOLENCE, A WHOLE GOVERNMENT APPROACH ARE NEEDED TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS ANTISEMITISM. MANY INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE AND COMBATTING ANTISEMITISM. WE NEED CLOSER INTER AGENCY COORDINATION TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES, SHARE THAT EVERY IMPORTANT DATA THAT KEEPS US SAFER WHEN WE SHARE THAT INTELLIGENCE, THE SAME THING, IDENTIFY GAPS IN OUR EFFORTS BETWEEN AGENCIES, AND STREAMLINE OVERLAPPING ACTIVITIES SO THAT WE CAN BEST COMBAT ANTISEMITISM WHERE WE SEE IT. I BELIEVE EXECUTE A UNIFIED NATIONAL STRATEGY, SO, SECRETARY MAYORKAS HOW IS DHS COORDINATING WITH OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND THE FIGHT AGAINST ANTISEMITISM. WOULD YOU SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL STRATEGY THAT USES THE WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH COHESIVE, COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS RISING THREAT FOR ALL OF US? >> SUMTER ROSEN, THANK YOU. I THINK DIRECTOR SPOKE POWERFULLY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, I BELIEVE, IT WAS IN NEW YORK CITY ABOUT THE RISE IN ANTISEMITISM, AND OF COURSE, WHERE WE BECOME INVOLVED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY IS THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN AN IDEOLOGY OF HATE REGARDLESS OF THE IDEOLOGY IN PARTICULAR, AND VIOLENCE. THAT IS WHERE WE BECOME INVOLVED, AND WE ARE WORKING VERY, VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FBI AND OUR FEDERAL STATE LOCAL TRIBAL, TERRITORIAL, CAMPUS LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS TO ADDRESS VIOLENCE, AN INCREASING LEVEL OF VIOLENCE, BORN FROM IDEOLOGIES OF HATE AND QUITE CLEARLY, ANTISEMITISM IS ONE OF THE RISING ONES. AND IT WAS AT A HIGH LEVEL TO BEGIN WITH. WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR AND COMMITTEE'S SUPPORT OF THE NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM. WE ARE SEEKING, IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2023 BUDGET, AN INCREASE FROM 200 AND 50 TO 300 AND $60 MILLION. THAT ASSISTS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, FAITH-BASED INSTITUTIONS, AND OTHER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO REALLY RAISE THEIR LEVEL OF SECURITY IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING VIOLENCE BORNE OF HATE. THE FBI IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HAVE PUBLISHED AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF ALERTS, BULLETINS, TO OUR LOCAL STATES, LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. ABOUT AN INCREASING THREAT LEVEL BORNE OF IDEOLOGIES OF HATE. >> SO, YOU WOULD SUPPORT A NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COMBAT ANTISEMITISM? >> I WOULD. >> THANK YOU. DIRECTOR WRAY, I WANT TO MOVE OR TO YOU. I KNOW THE FBI, AS HE STATED, FOUND ANTISEMITIC HATE CRIMES ROSE BY 6% IN 2020. IT REPRESENTS THE HIGHEST TOTAL IN 12 YEARS. IT CONSTITUTES 60% OF ALL INCIDENCES BASED ON RELIGION, AND IN YOUR ESTIMATION, YOUR RESEARCH AND DATA, WHAT IT'S TELLING YOU IS WHAT IS DRIVING THIS ALARMING TREND? HOW IS THE FBI WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES, STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, AGAIN, TO BE SURE WE ARE COORDINATING, AND WOULD YOU SUPPORT A NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COMBAT ANTISEMITISM? >> TAKING THE LAST POINT FIRST, CERTAINLY, I WOULD SUPPORT A NATIONAL STRATEGY. SECOND, THE PERCENTAGE IS EVEN WORSE THAN YOU SUMMARIZED IT. I THINK IT'S 63% OF ALL RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE EXTREMISM INCIDENTS ARE MOTIVATED BY ANTISEMITISM. THAT IS AGAINST A POPULATION THAT IS ONLY 2.4% OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. IT IS PRETTY STARK. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IS GETTING IT FROM ALL SIDES, WHICH THEY CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT'S DRIVING IT BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAVE THEY LONG BEEN A TARGET OF FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, AND WE'VE DISRUPTED ATTACKS BY FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AND FOREIGN INSPIRED VIOLENT EXTREMISTS AGAINST SYNAGOGUES, FOR EXAMPLE, BUT THEN, IN ADDITION TO THAT, THERE ARE, OF COURSE, THE TARGET OF DOMESTIC VIOLENT EXTREMISTS. AS YOU MAY REMEMBER, WE'VE DISRUPTED AN ATTEMPT TO BLOW UP A SYNAGOGUE IN LAS VEGAS AREA JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO. >> THANK YOU. >> SO, WE ARE TRYING TO TACKLE BOTH THROUGH THE DOMESTIC TERRORISM LENS, THROUGH OUR JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES, AND THROUGH THE HATE CRIME LENS, THROUGH A CIVIL RIGHTS PROGRAM. WE HAVE CREATED A DOMESTIC TERRORISM HATE CRIMES FUSION CELL, WHICH BRINGS THOSE THINGS TOGETHER TO ENSURE WE ARE PUSHING OUT INFORMATION TO OUR PARTNERS, WHETHER IT'S DHS OR STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE COMMUNITY, IN PARTICULAR, THE JEWISH COMMUNITY, TO BE BETTER ABLE TO ANTICIPATE WHAT MIGHT BE COMING AND PREVENT ATTACKS. >> THAT IS GOOD. IT REALLY GOES TO MY NEXT QUESTION, BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE HATE CRIMES ARE VASTLY UNDER REPORTED, BECAUSE OF FEAR SOMETIMES. SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE COVID-19 HATE CRIMES ACT LAST YEAR, DO YOU FEEL THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT IN LOCAL AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT, REPORTING HATE CRIMES TO THE FBI? AND JUST REPORTING IN GENERAL? HAS THAT BEEN HELPING? >> TWO THINGS. ONE, I THINK, OVERALL, REPORTING OF HATE CRIMES HAS GONE UP. THE JEWISH COMMUNITY HAS BEEN AHEAD OF OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VICTIMS IN REPORTING, HISTORICALLY. SO, WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PREACH THE IMPORTANCE OF REPORTING, AND WE HAVE SEEN REPORTING COMING UP. THE ONLY CAVEAT I WOULD PUT ON THAT IS WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A MULTI, MULTI, MULTI YEAR TRANSITION TO A DIFFERENT CRIMES STATISTICS REPORTING MECHANISM. THAT'S BEEN ANTICIPATED FOR ABOUT A DECADE, I THINK. SO, THIS PARTICULAR YEAR, THE NUMBER MAY BE SOMEWHAT FLAWED IN TERMS OF ON THE REPORTED IN TERMS OF THE RECORD KEEPING, JUST BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION THAT POLICE DEPARTMENTS, SOME POLICE DEPARTMENTS, ARE MAKING OVER FROM THE OLD SYSTEM TO THE NEW SYSTEM. BUT AS I WOULD EXPECT, AS WE GO FORWARD NEXT YEAR AND BEYOND, IT WILL GET BACK TO BEING MORE COMPREHENSIVE, AND I FULLY EXPECT IT TO SHOW EXACTLY WHAT

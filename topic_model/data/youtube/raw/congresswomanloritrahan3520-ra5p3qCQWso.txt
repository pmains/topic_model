it's a great news i've just been accepted to pharmacy school oh stephen we can't pay for that i found the code of federal regulations that deals with the vote redact program title 38 and i basically wrote up a seven page legal brief i saved every email and i had 100 pages of exhibits showing everything that she said and used the federal law and she basically had no choice now the powerful thing was about rory trahan's office in jorge is the fact that i went straight up to the top of the ladder for where i could go and that was the veteran board of appeals in washington dc right underneath the united states frederick quarterback claims however i'm still relatively young so getting it accelerated would have not been an option being 50 years old i was probably looking at five or six years before they would even hear my case [Music] and jorge has done phenomenal he does the congressional inquiries you know he follows up with me he sends out emails um and i think that's really what pushed this from taking five years to take in three months they went from saying we're not going to pay for this to yes no problem we'll pay for pharmacy so it was definitely a blessing you

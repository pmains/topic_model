back mr. speaker gentleman from Florida yields back gentleman from New Jersey reserves gentleman from New York is recognized mr. speaker I'm pleased to yield three minutes to the gentleman from Maryland the Democratic whip mr. Hoyer the gentleman from Maryland is recognized for three minutes I thank the gentleman I thank the gentlelady for yielding mr. speaker we are now four months into the fiscal year and this is our fourth continuing resolution the gentleman says now is the time to work things out every Democrat voted to extend the fiscal year by 90 days nothing was worked out why because you spend all your time on a tax bill giving resources 83% of the resources to the richest people in America Republicans control all the levers of the legislative process the house the Senate the White House they have the votes on their own to keep the government open or choose to shut it down as they did by policy some years ago for 16 days we don't want to shut down the government keeping the government over by passing appropriation bills is the most basic responsibility of any governing majority this governing majority has not sent a single not one appropriation bill to the president in the United States not one Republicans all I have gotten this work done in the spring and summer but they wasted their time trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act that's all they did after failing to do so they asked for more time in September and we voted every one of us to give them that time they squandered it they have to do two more extensions they squandered that time and now they want us to have another time where they can squander more time instead of using the extra time to do the job of governing they wasted it on passing tax overhaul that added 1.5 trillion dollars in new deficit spending and ray taxes on the middle-class so here we are again mr. speaker Americans are right to be frustrated by the inability or unwillingness of the republican-led Congress to do its job and keep the government open you have two hundred and forty one votes get them get them you have the authority to do it and you have the responsibility to do it get the votes even some Republican lawmakers are openly expressing the frustration with their own leadership let me quote representative mark meadows he hit the nail on the head yesterday when he asked what's the plan when are we going to deal with immigration my previous speaker talked about dealing with we haven't dealt with it put something on the floor you haven't done it what are we going to deal with spending this is mark meadows at what point do you quit kicking the can down the road this is mark Meadows Republican not me and passing just another continuing resolution hopes that things get better in a few weeks Democrats don't want the government to shut down we have one additional minute gentlemen that's entirely in the hands of the majority and by the way on that previous CR 90 of your members voted against it did they vote against the military today to vote against the first responders did they vote against education funding and we wring our hands about the military funding you think it's any easier to run a non-defense agency with a CR you're wrong if you think that they undermine our domestic agencies as well and I hope that they are equally worried about the impact doing one short-term funding bill after another has on the domestic side Americans are frustrated that their Congress can't agree on what we agree on Republicans have previously supported the principles of parity when raising spending caps that was the Paul Ryan deal he's the speaker he said yes we'll increase military and domestic the same that was his deal Paul Ryan the speaker that's all we're asking for Paul Ryan make your deal again and he won't do it instead he just wants to keep kicking the can down the road once twice thrice now four times yes we want as the previous speaker said all dreamers to stay in this country we all want to reauthorize the chip program to prevent 9 million children from losing their health insurance I dare you to put it on the floor it will pass with every vote in this house no you want to blackmail us into passing something that we don't like and we don't thinks good for the country gentleness time has expired oh one additional minute gentleman thank you guys for one additional minute we want to address other urgent health priorities at all you want to pass chip but you do not want to pass the community health centers my colleague Betty koa McCollum told us about that many chip children will have no place to go you passed the bill but no place to go so why no Republicans sit down and reach agreement Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues hell don't shut down the government I implore them use your majority not to delay but to govern and I tell them Democrats are still ready to work with you as we have been throughout to sit down and reach bipartisan compromise on our most pressing challenges we voted to give you a hundred and twenty days to do that now you want some more time you come to the door and asked for some cake and your neighbor says come back tomorrow and you come back tomorrow and you ask for the same thing he says come back tomorrow and you go back to the next day and he says the same thing come back tomorrow that's what the Republicans are saying come back tomorrow come back tomorrow come back tomorrow but there has been no divorce I was expelled against this CR gentleman time has expired gentlewoman from New York reserves members are reminded to

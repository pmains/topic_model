- I, Dan Crenshaw, do solemnly
swear that I will support and defend the Constitution
of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same. That was the oath I took 12 years ago. Since then, nothing has changed. The dream hasn't changed. The only thing that has changed is that now I have all of you to
share that dream with. That dream of mine to continue
serving and protecting the Constitution, it became our dream. Watching that catch fire has
been an incredible experience for my wife and I. To be chosen to represent
our Republican Party for the Second District here in Texas is an honor that I will cherish forever, and I have all of you to thank for that. With every vote, with every
contribution, with every effort that our volunteers put forth, there is an element of
trust being placed in me. And rest assured that
I take that seriously. It is a heavy responsibility
to have the trust of the American people, especially Texans, and it will be a responsibility
that I will not squander. As Reagan said, "The greatest
leaders are not necessarily "those who do the greatest things. "The greatest leaders are
the ones who get the people "to do the greatest things." Y'all got me here, and together we are going
to do some great things. So have a great summer, but don't forget we have a
lot of work to do this fall. Stay involved with the campaign by following us on social media, and signing up on our website
to receive email updates. Sign up at the volunteer link
to secure your new yard sign when they are ready in September. And last, get your Crenshaw
for Congress t-shirt on our website. God bless, y'all. God bless Texas.

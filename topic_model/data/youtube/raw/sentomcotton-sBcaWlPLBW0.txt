welcome back America that's Ric Flair referenced by my next guest Senator Tom Cotton on Face the Nation yesterday I do not believe Senator cotton is actually old enough to have watched Ric Flair wrestle am I wrong about that Senator cotton oh you were very wrong about that Hugh Hewitt uh Ric Flair was an icon growing up as was uh Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant and Randy Macho Man Savage in a different wrestling league but yeah the Nature Boy uh said it well well that was you know he's retweeted that this morning Ric Flair I didn't even know Ric Flair was on Twitter he came out he retweeted that with a woo and wrestling and sports and pretty much every other walk alive for you since you declared that no one had declared to run against Mitch McConnell has anyone declared to run against Mitch McConnell not to my knowledge you uh and remember it's not just Senator McConnell there are five uh maybe six leadership elections in total for people like um Joni Ernst and John barrosso John Boone and to my knowledge no one is contesting uh those positions to include the positions that are currently being vacated uh because Rory blunt is departing uh from our one of our positions and Joni is running for that vacating her own position so I don't really understand what we're talking about in terms of delaying an election that is uncontested when we have a runoff in Georgia where all of our Focus should be placed uh and to those who want to have uh what they call a debate about what happened in the election and where we're going I agree we should have such a conversation well we're back in session today and we have our weekly conference lunch meeting tomorrow and these uh conference meetings that are scheduled on Wednesday typically run for several hours before we have votes so there's plenty of time to discuss that especially for uncontested elections but I really think that all of our Focus uh needs to be on Georgia and once again reiterating just how badly Raphael Warnock has failed the people of Georgia when it comes to massive inflation Rising crime open border a weekend military and make that contract clear with Herschel Walker go up reverse all of those tread if he is elected as the 50th Senator and the 50 50 matters a lot Senator cotton does it not uh it does matter obviously it keeps the pressure on uh the Democratic caucus to hold all of their members together and they have a lot of vulnerable members up for election in 2024 who might like to take a walk on legislation to prove their quote unquote Independence when we all know they're truly a rubber stamp for the radical left-wing agenda they pursued over the last two years also matters in things like committee organization uh the Committees will be evenly divided um and uh we've had an effective uh and successful efforts to block for instance the far left-wing chair or nominated uh chair of the Federal Communications Commission so it certainly does matter a lot that we pick up this state but you know if you even more than that it matters for the people of Georgia this is a six-year position and the people of Georgia deserve better than the results Rafael Warnock has delivered them you know they gave him a test run two years ago and he's failed battling those two years and Herschel Walker will help stop the runaway spending he'll help rebuild our military help get American energy production back underway and make sure that we're locking up highlight criminals as opposed to coddling them so even more so than it being 50 50 in Washington or 5149 the people of Georgia deserve someone representing them for six years who will protect their interests and promote their deepest aspirations now Senator I wanted I want it recorded somewhere on the day that we're talking about this I hope someone at the conference this week says you know she is getting ready to invade Taiwan and Tick Tock is sweeping the country and they're collecting data on us and we can't screw around we really cannot screw around does the conference understand and that China is the child it's the number one priority for the country does the conference get that yeah I think most of our Senators do and frankly some of the Democratic senators do as well but we still need more action so I hope President Biden when he sat down with xujin King this morning was very clear and firm uh made it clear that we're going to uh accelerate our arms deliveries to Taiwan so Taiwan can defend itself from Invasion uh by communist China that we will come to taiwan's Aid militarily uh if Chinese Communists go for the jugular there that the the rule that the Bible Administration announced last month about semiconductor technology going to China is only the first step that we're going to take many more steps both uh by the administration and by Congress to stop China's unfair predatory Trade Practices that are stealing our jobs and our uh technology and using them against us I hope the president was very clear and firm on all those things this morning Xi Jinping but one thing that would help him going forward the next two years uh to be stiff and resolved towards China is a strong tough Congressional agenda and I expect to be a leader in crafting that agenda last quick question Senator FTX stole billions from people it's collapsed 39 million of those billions went to democratic candidates in this cycle do those Democratic candidates owe the folks who have been defrauded by FTX or refund would you the FCX collapse appears more and more like not just bad fortune but potential criminal wrongdoing and the Democrats didn't just benefit from Sam bankman freed the CEO of fdx's large yes with a tune of 40 million dollars they also gave him a coveted seat at the table to craft crypto policy so I think they have a lot of questions to answer in addition to accounting for that money and probably returning them I think that let's start with just getting it back for the benefit of the small investors who got screwed because once again the small investor got screwed by fraud Tom Cotton thank you Senator woo as you said that for the quote of the weekend

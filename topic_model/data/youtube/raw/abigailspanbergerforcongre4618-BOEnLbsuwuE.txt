I'm gonna show you a look at what she did and now she's running for Congress [Music] my name is Abigail spam burger and I'm running in Virginia's seventh congressional district I've always been interested in politics I've always been interested in policy but I never thought that I would run for office [Music] dear Abigail spam burger thank you so much for stepping forward for the people of Virginia 7 I think that our campaign is a strong one because I have a background here in the district I'll be on the ballot in November I have a background in national security of a background in law enforcement as a person who loved languages and I love traveling I thought that the CIA would be the right path for me you were like shoulders what you have the stranger in exchange like information actually told the Girl Scouts you people worried because people watch Hollywood movies people don't know how our training is people don't know what it is that you're actually doing I would say that I was people were asking me a lot of questions is it like homeland is it like the movies and usually my response to that is it is a little bit like Hollywood with a lot more paperwork seeing politics as we were living it in 2016 through the eyes of my children was not what I want for this country long term and ultimately it was the day of the house health care vote last year that I decided that I really did want to run it's not just about flipping a seat it's about what that means and so for Virginia that means Medicaid expansion that means a lot of other significant impactful legislation and issues getting debated that previously never could be you typically don't vote for a Democrat right I had a gentleman a man and a woman both say you were really need to be do not be right I said I'm not I'm a Democrat and they said all but we're Republicans and I say that's fine you can still vote for me you don't have to become a Democrat you know in Virginia we're not registered I am a Democrat because I believe that the Democratic Party in being that bottom rung on a ladder for people who need that extra boost so that they can go out and pursue the American dream [Music] the release of this very sensitive document from your time applying as a federal law enforcement officer and CIA officer it was brought to my attention that a super-pac congressional leadership funds a Paul Ryan's PAC was sending around my national security questionnaire to at least one news outlet to a Republican opposition research effort the national security questionnaire it's also informally known as the sf-86 is a long form that anyone who seeks the security clearance has to fill out and it asks you every place you've ever lived every roommate you've ever had every foreign national you know your full medical history just everything spam Berger doesn't want us to know that she taught at an Islamic school nicknamed Terror high as a former CIA officer who worked terrorism cases I find it particularly disgraceful that they would try and make that some sort of leap or claim when I in fact was a long-term substitute teacher for a bunch of kids [Music] associating abigail with terrorism is laughable abigail worked on the front lines a there's a sad attempt to try and get people animated or excited or concerned there's nothing on there that I have to hide or that is anyway concerning I don't intend to lose this race I don't know what I would do next on behalf of my own dear young granddaughters who deserve to grow up in the best America I often have parents will bring their daughters to me with the teachable moment of what you can do anything nice to meet you destiny I'm Abigail how are you if I could be an example for kids across our district that's probably one of the best things I could possibly achieve in the course of this campaign [Music]

our children are in crisis more high schoolers are unhappy and depressed mental health emergencies are increasing last year there was a two and a half fold increase in emergency department visits for suicidal ideation and self-harm among children under the age of 18. it's hard to know where to begin but i can't help but think that society is leading with too much fear fear has been dominating our lives especially during the pandemic fear shuts us down and i believe we've seen too much fear forced on our children fear and government arrogance kept schools closed and made the crisis worse this is what we're seeing in schools in my community and were not alone more screen time during isolation made children more vulnerable to the dangers of big tech and social media leading to more stress anxiety and depression we've seen significant declines in math and reading more school violence increases in obesity children have lost motivation because they were shut out of their extracurricular activities in sports many are so lost in feeling alone that they're turning to the internet to self-medicate we hear the stories nearly every day of into of young people that are taking their lives or or purchasing pills online not knowing that they're laced with with the uh fentanyl fentanyl seizures are up 1100 percent in spokane county spokane county's overdose deaths have nearly tripled every parent i know is is warning their child you know don't take any pill that you don't know where it came from it could be laced in xanax and will kill you instantly we should all be asking why what's making our children and our young adults feel so broken and alone how can hope be restored and how do we stop the this the fear how do we stop fear from dominating so madam chair i thank you for bringing us together today to focus on solutions i want to learn what the existing programs are and how they're working i want to i think we need to focus there i'm proud to be leading with congresswoman laurie trahan young kim and cindy axne to reauthorize the garrett lee smith memorial act it will help bring additional mental health services to places like wsu to support students mental health and suicide prevention but there's a lot more that needs to be get done we need to address the duplicate programs i am concerned about new duplicate programs that are going to compete with existing and effective programs such as hr 4944 5218 7232 running this risk i am especially concerned with hr 7254 and and i'm concerned that it will restrict access to to care to patients with serious mental health illness undermine law enforcement and ultimately hurt local communities we should support not undermine the residential and inpatient treatment options that will be the most appropriate place for certain patients to get help and i look forward to discussing this more as well as the bipartisan solutions before us finally i want to speak specific on a pro problem of medicaid imd exclusion right now right now medicaid cannot pay for inpatient or residential care facilities with more than 16 beds as a result more people are either incarcerated or homeless when they should be receiving mental health care more than a third of the homeless population are untreated with severe mental illness we simply don't have enough care settings for these patients there's also cases of children being kept in emergency rooms for days because they have no place else to go foster care can't access short-term residential treatment these problems with medicaid access for vulnerable groups must be addressed especially before the 988 suicide pipeline hotline is implemented we need to find solutions and i do thank my colleagues for their work in a bipartisan way my hope is that we will build on this here hearing that and will and we will bring hope and healing to the next generation we need and there's one message we need to send them today and that's it's you matter you're not alone you have huge potential in a life worth living so i look forward to working together for a more secure future for our young generation and i yield back thank you madame

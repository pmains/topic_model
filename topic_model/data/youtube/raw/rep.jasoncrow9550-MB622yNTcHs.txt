racism uh in the issues that have taken too many lives of black men in our community so i'm very proud to be voting on that effort tonight uh and i will leave you with the capable hands of the folks

now yes you are active on your screen okay great so again my name is evan kravitz i'm a career and transfer advisor at arapahoe community college um i'm really happy to be here tonight to present uh on some resume tips uh when people find out that i am a career advisor they usually say oh you must love doing resumes and i don't uh resumes uh are no fun but i've learned a couple things over the years some tips some tricks but some basic overall good practices with resumes and cover letters and i'm going to share that with you tonight um i do want to say um you know every career advisor has their own way of doing resumes so what i'm gonna share tonight is really uh the culmination of of a lot of different tips and strategies and guidelines that i've gotten from a lot of different people so um again i'm really happy to be here and just so you know i'm a career changer myself um i originally worked at cnn as a journalist from 1998 until um 2005 and then again and i got laid off from cnn and didn't know i didn't want to work in journalism anymore so um i went back to school got a master's degree at 40 and uh now work as a career advisor for arapahoe community college so for those of you who are in the midst of career transitions i know what you're going through and it will work out i promise so let's dive in resumes what are they for well they tell the reader about your unique combination of skills and experience the abilities that are relevant to the job opening and the keyword there is relevant everything that's in your resume should be relevant to the job that you're applying for because the main purpose of a resume is to get you the interview and that your chances are much better when the resume is specifically tailored to the job you're applying for what a resume is not is a life history it's not an information dump it's not the answer to everything it's a strategic marketing tool so when you are putting together putting your resume together it's really important that you think about the job that you're applying for and that everything in that resume is relevant to that to that job so i can't take a poll but how long do you think an employer the average amount of time an employer takes and spends on an initial review of your resume one minute five minutes 10 minutes how about 7.4 seconds that's the average length of time that an employer is going to take to just simply skim over your resume so everything on that page or pages really needs to count one of the things that you need to watch out for uh when you're putting a resume together is it's called the ats the applicant tracking system and a couple years ago i had no idea what the applicant tracking system was and i was sending out resume after resume after resume and i was getting no traction no callbacks and finally a friend told me about this software that a lot of human resource departments and a lot of employers use so that instead of looking through 100 200 resumes the red the file that you submit with your application or that you email in is put through software called the applicant tracking system and that software is designed or programmed to look for certain keywords so if you if your resume doesn't have those keywords if it's not tailored specifically to the needs of the employer yeah the apple contracting system is going to gloss right over it so it's really important when you're putting together a resume that you have the job posting right next to you that you're using that extensively for putting while you're putting together your resume some things to keep in mind for the applicant tracking systems um you obviously want to write and format with the ats in mind one of the questions i get often is well can i submit my resume as a pdf or does have to be submitted as a word document there there was a time when pdfs i think weren't really getting scanned by the ats the ats software had trouble with pdf documents according to my research that's kind of that's not so much of a problem anymore the safe bet is always a doc file doc i like pdf because pdf locks in your formatting so if you have a really um intricate resume with you know different boxes and things like that when the employer opens it up on their version of microsoft word or maybe they're using pages for mac there's a chance that the format is going to get all mixed up if you save it as a pdf file your formatting is locked in so i'm a big fan of pdfs um keywords keywords keywords that's the way um to not uh to get noticed by the ats software what are the keywords in the job description and are they in your resume because that's what the ats is looking for um key skills core competencies areas of extra expertise we're talking about hard skills soft skills those are also great areas for getting those keywords in um ats software has trouble with images charts and graphics so if you can it's better to avoid those in a resume and avoid complex resume designs a lot of people tend to use templates um templates look great but they make it real tough on you to change things around so if if you're gonna stick strictly to that template and you're not going to move things around you could probably get away with it but if you want to have the freedom of moving things repositioning things then a template might not be the best bet for you so again i keep on emphasizing keywords it's really important when you're looking at a job description like this sample one for a cyber security analyst that you're going through and you're looking specifically for what they're looking for when i work with students of all different ages i have trouble working or helping them with a resume if i don't have the job posting right next to me because the job posting tells you everything it's your roadmap so even if a student doesn't know or doesn't have a specific job in mind even if they can show me a couple of job descriptions for the industry that still helps us get in the ballpark and helps us to see that key terminology so really when i'm going through a job posting i'm highlighting or or circling all the keywords that i see so in this cyber security analyst um job posting i started going okay they investigate security events so they want they want experience with different security software okay um they want someone who knows how to analyze information and threats um how to evaluate security tools uh this is important right here they're looking for someone where the job one of the job duties is to improve the company's ability to detect and respond to malicious activity that's something you should address in your cover letter and you should make sure you can hit on in your resume other keywords here forensic tasks they want someone who can assess risks so again whatever the job description is get the highlighter out and start highlighting the keywords the the key skills they're looking for and make sure your resume and cover letter are speaking to that in terms of resume format and structure um there are three types of resume formats um that are most commonly in circulation um the one that most of us are used to is the chronological resume that is a snapshot of your work experience from most recent to past experience another resume um is called the functional resume um a lot of times job applicants with gaps in their work history might use a functional format in where in which the the emphasis is taken away from specific jobs or or time spent in specific jobs and is more on skills categories it's a harder type of resume to put together and i still recommend a chronological format or better yet a combination format which uses elements of a functional design and elements of the chronological design and it's the format that's most easy that's easiest to read and um that makes a difference because again remember according to the research employers are spending about 7.4 seconds just skimming over your resume so if it's got an intricate design or if the information is all over the place you probably lost them in terms of should a resident night should a resume be one page or two um opinions vary uh from between um career advisors my rule on the page count is if you can justify two pages of information three pages of information if everything in the on those pages is relevant to the job then go for it but if it's three pages of just nonsense that has nothing to do with the job you're going for it's going to be a problem if you can get your resume to one page awesome but if you've got 15 or more years of experience it's really going to be tough to get to one page and my advice to you is don't spend too much time worrying about it again if you can justify the information you're putting on your resume go for it i honestly don't believe you're going to lose out on a job because you had two a two-page resume that had a ton of experience relevant to the position that you're going after but one of the things you can do if you want to if you really want to try to get your resume to one page and it's great if you can is you can change the margins in microsoft word and instead of inch margins go to half inch margins all around and that's going to give you more real estate on the page to work with so just changing the margins and widening it out can really help give you more space and maybe help you get to one page um in terms of format and structure try to use the same font style throughout to the best of your ability don't change up the font styles you can use boldface you can use italics as different ways to highlight different information in some resumes you'll see that the heading is centered and it might be in all caps and it might be in boldface if you can strategically use those types of format tools it can really be effective but again try to stay with a consistent style if your date ranges for the jobs that you have on your resume are always on the right don't move them to the left for something else keep it consistent throughout their resume so that the reader the employer knows that hey there's a job description and look over to the right there's a date range you don't have to spend all this time searching for the information remember 7.4 seconds that's the skim time that you have to make an impression on her on an employer that's the amount of time you have to convince the employer take it take a couple minutes and really look at my resume a question i get all the time from students should i go with a black and white format or should i use color look if the resume is going to be printed out on a color printer great but usually it's not and so if you really want to use color fine but what i advise you to do is print out your resume on a black and white printer so make sure that if your resume isn't printed out in color that it still makes sense in black and white that everything still works you can have an employer who's color blind so but if you're going after a graphic design job yeah using color and different in different styles might be really good to use but if you're applying for an accounting position black and white is probably the way to go but again if you if you do want to use color fine but print out your resume on a black and white printer just to make sure it's going to look okay um try not to focus too much on design over functionality if your resume doesn't have to be fancy it needs to be easy to read and that's why i'm all for simple layouts and we'll look at one in just a couple minutes but you want it to be easy to read and the other thing with your resume is that the top third section of your resume is really the most important part that's why we encourage students but but really all job seekers to have some kind of professional summary at the top they can immediately give the employer a quick overview of what they're about to see of what what your experience is what basically what you bring to the table um so this is an example of a resume format that i like if we look at the top your contact information um for your phone number make sure you have a professional sounding voicemail um if you have something some kind of cute message you rethink it because when employers call you or want to bring you in for an interview you really just went hey this is evan kravitz thanks for reaching my voicemail please leave a message i'll get back to you as soon as possible just something professional same thing with your email address i've had i had one student that her you know his email address was fluffybear92 at gmail.com and i'm like you can't you can't do that well that's my personality i don't want to give up who i am like that's fine use that email address for friends and family but for employers it's free getting up get a new gmail account get a yahoo account that's just your name um that's that's something again we're not trying to take your personality out of it or your character but for job search purposes a simple email with just your name is the way to go um putting a linkedin address is really good too it shows a level of tech savviness that you might have or shows that you're just not behind the times that hey i understand social media and really and you'll be you'll get a presentation on linkedin um i think in another day or so um but linkedin is really important so i highly recommend you adapting your resume for linkedin as well um the profession hang on gotta move this real quick because i can't see you okay um the professional summary should always be tailored to the employer's needs and contain lots of keywords now if every resume that you're sending out is geared towards the telecommunications industry you're not going to have to do a whole redo on the resume for each job you apply for you're definitely going to want to tweak it but for the most part you're not going to have to redo your whole resume if you're staying within the same industry i really like the professional summary on this resume it reads paralegal candidate with recent education and relevant experiences over 17 years of extensive experience in sales finance real estate government higher education customer service insurance and service environments self-starting independent take charge individual she read over the job description that's why you saw her emphasize experience government experience with finance especially in experience with customer service and so what she does is after the professional summary she goes right into her skills section where she has listed soft skills and hard skills and we're going to take a quick look at that hard skills are those skills that um i i guess you know require some kind of formal learning um being able to speak more than one or two languages extend experience with ms office program languages if you're going for design type jobs adobe software that you know how to use database management um they are a lot of times their technical skills and if we jump back to the resume real quick you can see that what norma does is on the left hand side she's listing all the soft skills and we'll talk about that in a second and on the right hand side in the skill section she's listing the hard skills the technical expertise that she has and all of these all this different software that she's listening here she knows from her research are are pieces of software that it's advantageous to have skills with them for the field that she's going into uh in terms of soft skills these are personal habits and traits that shape how you work on your own or within a team atmosphere and those kinds of soft skills can be critical thinking multitasking prioritization teamwork problem solving again take note of the of the job of the um position description the the the job ad and it's going to show you right in there the soft skills they're looking for if they keep emphasizing over and over they're looking for someone who can think critically analyze problems um come up with big picture solutions gotta get that language into your resume i'm gonna take another drink real quick uh in terms of education there's some um i think my opinion on this is a little bit different than than others um the one thing that most career advisors agree on is if you have a college education there's no need to list high school anymore once you have college experience or a college education that kind of takes over for high school um for career changers i recommend putting education near the top simply because if we go back to this example norma is applying for a paralegal position and in the first sentence in her professional summary she says paralegal candidate with recent education and relevant experiences so she's saying i've just spent a year two years however long because i've been knee-deep in paralegal type and paralegal um learning and what she does is she puts her education near the top because she wants to highlight really quickly that she's been immersed in paralegal studies for the last year two years and so she she lists here the uh certificate that she's going after her gpa and then she lists the coursework and you can see she's doing that because that she the the paralegal type of work that she's going after are is in real estate law civil litigation and she wants to show that hey i've taken classes on this i i just learned all about this stuff and so that's why she's putting education ahead of her professional work experience again another career advisor might disagree with me and say no get that experience first but she is again norma is a career changer she's going into the paralegal field so her work experience is related to paralegal work but it's not specific in the paralegal industry so again she's emphasizing education because she really wants to establish herself as someone who is well read on paralegal work okay for a professional work experience um chronological formats the best format to use for this start with the most current job experience you want to list the company name then the job title and the dates you were employed you don't have to use months you could use just years like in this example 2018 to 2020. um if you have a lot of gaps in your work experience omitting the months and just going with years is can sometimes uh help with that um you want to use bullet point format that highlight experience and accomplishments um i it says here no more than five bullet points per job that's i think that's flexible again if if all the experience that you're offering is relevant to the job it could be more than five bullet points but you know a link like 27 different bullet points i don't know if someone's going to read over all that so to the best of your ability really condense that experience into a couple key hitting bullet points um each bullet point or phrase should begin with a strong action verb analyze coordinated managed supervised really strong action verbs prioritize the order in which you describe job duties listing the most impressive experience first and remember you can list internships or volunteer experience if they were relevant to the job you are seeking it doesn't matter if you are paid or not it's the experience that counts um there's a lot of different ways that you can really put out the wrong impression with the work experience you present this is an example of someone listing their work experience but not really being very specific so the company that they work for is a to z accounting their position well we're just putting front desk does that mean you just answered phones was there administrative work associated with that was there were you entering um health information uh codes billing information we don't really know because all this person has done is put front desk and in the in the experience the bullet points are really big front desk work okay well what does that entail answered phones what kind of phone calls did you receive type documents and made spreadsheets awesome what software were you using for that other duties included filing making coffee cleaning office so it's very big and it really doesn't do a great job of really celebrating the experience this person had working at a front desk so if we change it around and we're a little bit more intentional with our experience we can change it to a to z accounting administrative assistant and then you can look at the bullet points now are really specific provided excellent customer service to clients in person and over the phone so in terms of people skills whether it's on the phone or in person i know how to do this i've developed a new organization system better maintaining files to ensure accuracy and confidentiality great mastered use of microsoft excel entering other personnel so now we know the specific program the person used for spreadsheets and that they have training experience that they have supervised other uh created an inviting reception area for clients so to the best of your ability really try to be specific with your job experience one of the um great great websites to use for this is called o net online o net online is a it's actually a government website and you can type in just about any job title and oh net online is going to give you a complete summary of what the job duties are in with that particular type of work and you can use that to help build your resume i've used this for students i have that work in mcdonald's that have no idea how to write cook or how to describe being a cook at mcdonald's or how to describe um working in the front counter at mcdonald's so i really highly encourage you to use o-net online to help you to help you generate ideas um in terms of for how to describe your work experience and on that's incredible it's not only you can see kind of in this graphic it not only lists the tasks that are involved with certain positions but also the technology that you might typically use in that kind of work the abilities the um the characteristics the all kinds of things that you might not be thinking about but that really do encapsulate what you did in that position so again o net online is a terrific resource for that um references the current trend with resumes is that you don't have to put references available upon request it's accepted that if the employer is interested in you they are going to want to talk to people who worked with you or your supervisors so it's not necessary to put that on there um the last two jobs i applied for that i got um i included my references page with my resume with my cover letter what i did was i created one pdf file that had my cover letter resume and then references um i you don't have to do it that way but there's something about doing it that the way that to me kind of signals you know i'm really confident i'm ready to go here are people who you know i'm i've already talked to you that i know will really be able to help you understand my work philosophy and my work ethic um but the most important thing is give your references a heads up that they might get called let let your references know here's the job i'm applying for here's why i think i'd be a great fit for it giving your references that kind of heads up means that they're prepared when that phone call comes in um and then for the actual information that you'll provide for the reference name title uh the name of the company uh and then you know what's the best way to get in contact with this person uh phone or email or just put both on there um a question that i've been kind of grappling with that a student asked me the other day and i really had to do a little bit of research on this is well what if your last job you were fired or what if you were laid off or what if you just didn't have a really great relationship with your direct supervisor the advice i would go with and again people could disagree with this the advice i would go with is don't list the supervisor as a reference instead ask one of your former colleagues or co-workers if they can be a reference for you if they can talk about your work ethic um there's legally there's a lot that the employer can't can't reveal about your job history but if it is at all possible um try listing a colleague or a co-worker that you worked with um who can really speak to you know the way you performed your job or basically what your work ethic is and what it's like to work with you on a team atmosphere you know personality type questions things like that but that's the advice i'll give on references for that um cover letters cover letters i actually really enjoy doing um a couple things about cover letters um a cover letter basically its job is to preview the resume it introduces the reader to you um it's an opportunity to sell yourself and your value as an employer the cover letter is really setting up the resume it's it's it's trying to convince the employer hey i guarantee you that what you're about to see in my resume is exactly what you're looking for really you know give that a shot so your resume um you're going to customize for each job so again if you're applying for jobs all in the telecommunications industry are all within the accounting field you're not going to have to redo your cover letter each time but you still want to tailor your cover letter as best as possible to the needs of the job and again that's going to come from looking at the job description looking at the qualifications needed and making and using that language in your cover letter also really important the employer is going to look at the cover letter as an example of your writing can you put together a complete sentence can you convey a thought clearly and concisely it's really important that when you're putting a resume together uh cut well cover letters and resume together proofread have a friend have a spouse have your child read over the resume and cover letter looking for grammatical mistakes you will be judged on the quality of your writing and in the in the cover letter why are you the best candidate for the position and what is the return on investment when i work with students who are putting together scholarship essays they typically forget to to say to the scholarship committee here's what you're going to get out of investing in me like what is the return on investment if you hire me i'm going to contribute to the vision of this company and help take you to you know the stated next goals for the next couple years it's really important if you can well you should look at the company's website what's their vision what's their mission statement what are their values and how can you help support those values in that mission so again on just about every company website there's going to be an about us page what's their history what are their values what's their mission what's their philosophy get that into your cover letter and into your resume and show them how you can contribute to that uh in terms of format for a cover letter there's usually three paragraphs is the is the um format for a cover letter the first paragraph uh who are you what position are you applying for uh where did you learn about the position and i usually like to include a sentence or two sentences you know of um you know this position is not only a perfect match for my skills and abilities but also matches my desire to be a part of a company with your type of growth plan i'm making stuff up here but you know some kind of attention grabbing statement your second paragraph really is kind of the guts of the of the cover letter and it's providing an overview of what you're going to see in your resume i have students that make the mistake of in their second paragraph saying well in 1982 i did this and then in 1985 i went here but in 1997 i went back to here and then no no no the second paragraph is really an overview of what they're about to see in the resume third paragraph hey you know i think i'd be a great fit for this i hope to hear from you soon it's really summing up your value kind of what you bring to the table um thanking the reader taking the time to for taking the time to review your qualifications and basically in that last paragraph be bold and ask for the interview you know i think i think you know this would be a dynamite um position for me to work in and i think i'd be exactly the type of candidate that can help bring you know your product to the next level i'm making stuff up here i would love to hear from you hope to hear from you soon that's essentially your third paragraph and so um that's actually the end of of my presentation um again um you know resumes are are no fun but if you're applying for a number of different jobs within the same industry you're not going to have to redo your resume from job to job but if you're changing industries you are going to need to tailor your resume and kind of rethink it as i said in the beginning my original career was in journalism at cnn and then all these years later i went back to school and wanted to work in higher education so the resume that i used to get the job at cnn was no longer going to work for what i wanted to do now in higher education but really i just started moving things around and that like i said in the presentation i moved education up because i really wanted to emphasize that hey i've got a master's degree in higher education and i've been doing that for the last two years so um don't don't be afraid to move things around with your resume don't be afraid to be strategic um what are what are what is the job calling for what is the what are the employers needs and tail or your resume your cover letter all of it to the needs of the employer i am more than happy to take any of your questions if you have one okay hang on a second i'm look i'm reading the questions right now okay uh question from donna um what if i was in the airline industry for 34 years do i list do i list i have been there for 34 years or only go back 15 20 years also how would i explain the change of industry i have i have retired from the airlines great question um the question about the 34 years goes to um you know a touchy area on do i want to reveal my age and how long i've been in in the industry my answer to that is always yes if you have 34 years of experience in an industry in the same industry and you can show in your resume that you that over the 34 years you consistently moved up and took on more and more responsibility then i think you should put it on a resume and another you know another thing about the age discrimination part is would you really want to work for someone that would do something like that it's a very touchy area it's a very sensitive area other career advisors may disagree with me but again donna if you've got 34 years of valuable experience in an industry go for it that doesn't mean that your resume should be 15 pages long you can have 34 years of experience in an industry and still be at a one-page resume again it's all on how you tailor the information um and how would i explain the change in entry i've retired from the airlines you're doing something new you're transitioning into a new job if you're a career transitioner that kind of story is really hard to convey in a resume and cover letter but it's perfect for the interview so don't worry about having to create this perfect explanation for why you're you're in the airline industry and now you want to work in higher education a lot of that could come out in the interview and the cover letter can be used for that too to kind of show that i've decided to switch industries now because i'm passionate about whatever it is now um when we get q a please direct okay hang on a second sorry right uh if you go to the bottom in your chat window um you could type in questions for me um forgot to mention that look down here uh from patty my career has stagnated and i want to find a job that is willing to give me a shot at a higher level how can i make my resume or cover letter show that i'm ready for management great question patty i again go back to the job description what are they specifically looking for and how can you how do you bring that to the table um i just lost my train of thought hang on a second let's go back to this if you want to get to a higher level that's fine i mean that that's great but again you want to show in your experience that you can meet the demands that they're that they have set forth and what they want in a person and that you have a history of being able to jump to the next level and take your job to the next level um see

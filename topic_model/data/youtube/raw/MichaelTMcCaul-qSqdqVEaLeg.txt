the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee is in San Diego this morning he and some other members of his committee are inspecting the border situation they're in border security the mr. Chairman I want to ask you about this this threat we're hearing up what precautions are we taking is there anything we're not doing we ought to be doing here well we're on a high state of alert I have been given every assurance we're doing everything we can to prevent this threat from happening I must say this is probably one of the most specific and credible threats I've seen perhaps since 911 and that's why everybody is taking this so seriously in fact the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff called it extremely significant the State Department's warning with respect to the Arabian Peninsula is significant as well because as your commentator mentioned al Qaeda and the Arabian Peninsula is probably the biggest threat to the homeland their the al Qaeda faction that still talks about hitting the west and hitting the homeland and their expertise is chemical explosives hitting the aviation sector as we saw with the the underwear bomber so we are on a high state alert I think the administration's call to close these embassies of the 21 embassies was actually very a very smart call particularly in light of what happened in Benghazi when warnings were not heated in that case I'm glad to see that that in this case they're taking this very seriously and one more thing you mentioned the prison breaks I find that to be very interesting as well because we had it in Abu Ghraib Iraq in Pakistan and in Benghazi literally thousands of terrorists have been broken out of jails and they're all spread out all throughout the Middle East now and that presents a very high threat as well mr. chairman let me ask you what is it can you give me some specifics or or what is it that has caused you to call this one of the most serious threats since nine eleven that you've heard about what what particular makes you feel that way well as you know can find I mean it's classified sure briefings but i will tell you because of the specificity because of where it's coming from the credibility of it the level chatter it seems to be a fairly large operation it's giving the intelligence community had quite a bit of pause that right now and the other thing that that one of your commentators mentions as well Ramadan why is that important because tonight is the night of power it's it's a night that they tried the first attempt in the USS Cole style attack this week 15 years ago they bombed the embassies in kenya and tanzania and then zawa here he has basically set out a decree to the jihadist on his website saying now's the time to attack us interest this warning from za we hear he really comes right on the heels of the State Department warning and so that's a great concern to us you know the fact that obviously this information is coming to us from intercepts is the fact that they've been talking about this on the phone obviously or in some way they must know of the abilities of the United States in this field the fact that they're talking about it does that lead you to believe they're just more confident or could they be just trying to talk about it delete us off in the odd directions or something here well you know I can't talk really about sources and methods as you know however yeah hopefully you know the good news is in this case there may have been some loose intelligence on the part of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and that's a good thing if you know that's happening so I am I have to be very careful about what I say you know on this but i will tell you again the threat is I perceived very imminent the one good thing I think about the State Department issuing these warnings and the administration is that when you let them know that you know you put them on their heels and they oftentimes back down that we've seen that as a counterterrorism federal prosecutor we've seen that happen time over time and so I'm hopeful in this case that you know that will happen as well and I want to assure the American people that we are doing everything we can to protect them and to this from happening all right well thank you so much mr. chairman for joining us this morning in our broker

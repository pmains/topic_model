Congressman House Appropriations Committee Member Tony Gonzalez Congress good to see you this morning you've been out front on this issue and I think voters are grateful what's your take on what the administration is doing now telling Arizona to remove those shipping containers uh thank you for having me this morning Maria it's absolutely despicable what the administration has done to uh to people along the border they've abandoned us and what they're doing is they're they're they're trying to bribe a lot of these local officials by giving them FEMA dollars guess what FEMA's not you not meant to be used indefinitely on this border crisis I've seen it get worse you know I had I had the president of Guatemala call me about two days ago essentially pleading with me to lean on the administration to uh to put some pressure because his country is getting overwhelmed now he's doing Tony there are thousands of people at my border they're going to be at your border here in a couple of weeks if the administration doesn't step in so even the Guatemalan president is upset about what is taking place here I mean there are illegal migrants everywhere in America Congressman we're monitoring New York City for example and Randall's Island this morning more migrants are expected to arrive at this newly constructed tent shelter the city's homeless population is outraged as these tents feature Lounge areas they've got massive TV sets video games they get new phones all of this going on with Venezuelan migrants asking what about us the homeless population has been sitting on the streets there was never a tent for them put up they say that they feel betrayed by the administration who's now deporting them to Mexico under title 42 Congressman your thoughts on what the administration has done in response to this crisis Maria this is what an America last agenda looks like and look this is all systematic and remember about a year ago the vice president uh went to El Paso and there she had the one of the local congresswomen uh Veronica Escobar said welcome to the new Ellis Island well this is what the new Ellis Island looks like people are on the streets Americans are put laughs I was just in El Paso uh about about five days ago and what I saw there reminded me a lot of what I saw in Del Rio a year ago there were hundreds of people under a bridge and there were thousands of people in custody with no end in sight people were just walking over walking back and forth like like there was no border this is what an American agenda last agenda looks like we have to stop this we the Republicans in the house we have a plan with this commitment to America we win back the majority you're going to see things change well I mean you mentioned El Paso the mayor of El Paso is contradicting himself now over the report that the White House pressured him to not declare an emergency over this crisis watch this did the White House ask you not to declare a state of emergency absolutely not the chief of the U.S border Patrol Chief Ortiz and he he does not support declaring the state of emergency at this point our congresswoman is urged for us not to do that in our County Judge does not support that at this point we may have to do that I mean there's going to be a point where we may have to do that but at this point and the White House is asked at this point for us not to do that well I mean there you go it's pretty clear what the White House has asked the mayor of El Paso he you know pulled it back because he probably got a call from the White House to say don't go with this publicly no absolutely but Maria I've seen this exact same play happen in Del Rio the exact same play happened in Eagle Pass and now it's happening in El Paso it's only getting worse unbelievable Tiana jump in okay Congressman you mentioned Guatemala earlier now we're seeing these the share of migrants who are coming in for the first time in you know since since the northern triangle took over Mexico for being the majority Hub of where these migrants are coming from um now it's coming from Beyond the northern triangle so if Republicans do take control again and if there is some power if there is some ability to restore some of those do you think that these Northern triangle countries would be in favor of restoring the same safe Third Country agreements that was able to staunch that bleeding at the latter half of the Trump Administration are they upset enough about this migrant flow to want that consensus brought back I I do and you know uh Guatemala in particular is jumping up and down begging to be a partner they're going you know what has happened in our country it directly impacts you he goes you know this week we found eight afghanis within this this group of migrants so it's not just people from Venezuela it's from all over the world yeah so it's it's dangerous to everyone involved so yes these these countries are begging for partnership he's asking me hey can you lean on the administration to have them give up give us a call we're looking for the United States for leadership to bring Panama and others to the table so what's the point there's the point here to just get more people to vote Democrat because in Washington DC right now there's an effort to get non-citizens to vote so I mean connect the dots is that what this is about because no one in their right mind would have an immigration policy to have a wide open border where 80 people were already apprehended from the terrorist watch list where you know drug cartels were taking home 300 million dollars a week 13 billion dollars made just last year from the dangerous cartels just on human smuggling are dropping fentanyl through drones in the country I mean nobody in their right mind would have an open border policy this way is it all so that they could get more voters and hope that they vote Democrat you know it could be but you know I'm a Mexican-American descent I'm a Hispanic descent you're seeing in South Texas you know uh several candidates like uh Monica De La Cruz and Myra Flores yeah so so it's not necessarily given that the Hispanics are going to vote Democrat what I will think what I do think is happening is the Democratic party had this romance with what an open border looked like and they're getting the realities of what an open border looks like wow and they don't know what to do and they're completely overwhelmed what in aptitude it's incredible Congressman thanks very much for all of you're doing and your leadership Tony Gonzalez joining us this morning in Texas thank you sir

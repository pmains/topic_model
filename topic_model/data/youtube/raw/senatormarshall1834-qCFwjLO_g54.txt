well Congressman Richard Hudson thanks for coming down to my office and talk a little NCAA basketball Kansas North Carolina I think you know the first question I got for you how many North Carolina teams are in the tournament this year what's it look like for you guys it's got a great year you know my alma mater UNC Charlotte's not in the tournament this year but you know we're in a rebuilding phase but you've got you know North Carolina Central you see Greensboro Duke Carolina State number teams from North Carolina we're really excited to get this good this kickoff started soon we want to start up an epee here in Virginia and you in BC who do you got win in that game Craven K State I get to go with this one okay you know case takes I big man's hurt this year he's the from Saint John Kansas just down the road from my home we're gonna really miss him Clayton another well coached team but I'm gonna have to go with my alma mater Kansas State Wildcats here if you don't mind do you what are you thinking well I always like to favor the 9 seed over the 8 seed but cratons pretty hot right now so this may be for bone of contention here I'd hate to stand sit here in a Kansas office and do this but I think I'm gonna go with crate all right we got the Wildcats and Davidson is we're where's Davidson and well Davidson is a dangerous team you know they they're well coached they're veteran team that's a big wins issue Kentucky's a powerhouse safety belt Kentucky but I think I'm gonna go for the upset here and go with our North Carolina team and I'm gonna put Davidson I think Kentucky is is playing about as horrible as they could possibly play but they're so talented I'm gonna have to stay with Kentucky here with this one got Arizona and Buffalo Arizona of course has a pretty good big man is he a top five pick most likely they're better both go to Arizona Miami Leola I don't got a dog in that fight well we won obsess you team play pretty strong they had a big win this year when they upset dukes I'll probably go to Miami I'm going Miami as well Tennessee and Wright State I know Tennessee's had a good basketball tradition they're the three seed about to go with the three seed okay we're both going Tennessee we got Nevada and Texas I'm gonna go with the Longhorns from Texas you know I think I'm gonna agree the only upset just because I always try to find a few upsets so I'll agree with you on Texas since daddy is tough those guys fight hard they're gonna go deep in the tournament I imagine as well so I'm gonna say I'll go with Cincinnati there yeah you know Georgia State's actually really playing good ball but since that is such a John or not I think Xavier and Texas Southern gotta go with Xavier they're hot yeah we're in Florida State at eight and a nine seed you know Missouri's probably one of those that could really have some upsets in the tournament you know our ACC loyalties with Florida State yeah it's tough eight nines are always tough calls I'm probably gonna do I'm gonna go Missouri as well bio state and South Dakota State Ohio State yep let's say next is Gonzaga and you in CG you don't see Greensboro Greensboro what do you think well you know my heart would be with Greensboro but I think my head's gonna go Gonzaga yeah Cheers the ball well you had pretty good combination outside inside better go with Gonzaga on that Houston and San Diego State yeah I think I'm gonna go with Houston on that you know Houston's playing pretty good ball right now Houston Calvin Sampson's down there they don't play much basketball but they're the best wrestlers and rebounders I've seen so I'll go with Houston as well a lot of agreement here at this bracket so far Michigan and Montana I didn't know Montana made it it's been in the hospice of Montana team's been in here I'm sure Michigan's got it surely has a talent team ya think Michigan's Michigan is really hot right now okay and the next we got am and Providence am and other SEC team Providence I've not seen play this year I'll go with am we finally got a disagreement I'm gonna go with you upset for Providence okay Providence there here we go North Carolina who what Patsy do they got Lipscomb North Carolina and Lipscomb doesn't matter cuz North Carolina's going all the way stick was going over there vah Tech and Bama that's actually if you be a really tight game okay I'm gonna go with you on it as well we'll both go with Alabama West Virginia Murray State a West Virginia's got this game I'm actually gonna pick Murray stays an upset and it's probably because Huggins coached at Cincinnati all those years a big archrival of UNC Charlotte so maybe I'm biased but fair next Maya week shockers and Marshall Richard I'm telling you Wichita State is built for this tournament they got great outside shooting they got three big men when the outside shots not working I'm expecting Wichita State to go really really far again a well coached team by my namesake over there as well so I'm going WSU here WSU the wheat shockers okay next is a Florida and st. Bonaventure Florida six seed Bonaventure at 11 no they they had to play him to get here I think Florida is one of teams I'm watching so I'm going Florida Florida's always scary since those back-to-back championships a few years ago as well next I'm gonna go with Texas Tech here yeah so we'll go text Tech and what they do they hold their pistols up like this get your guns up all right Arkansas and Butler Arkansas the 7 seed Butler the 10 seed other was a good basketball tradition as well again I'm always looking for upsets I'm doing the same set here Purdue and see it Cal State for Allstate for 10 as well I Do's the 2014 yeah when's the last time the two seed got upset it's been a while yeah okay now now to one my favorite brackets we over here we have Kansas and pin let me just talk about Kansas just for a second 14 big 12 championships in a row I mean since John wood no one's done this now I think a Devonte Graham is butta he's that he's absolutely butter smooth as silk this is a young man that's that's going to get hopefully a little rest he's played most every minute of every game Rob Watson Devante grand play I've seen his leadership just grow and go this team is gonna be good okay so we go Kay you hear Seton Hall North Carolina State my head says Seton Hall's playing pretty good ball but I think I'll stick with the home team and NC State on this one close the New Mexico State Clemson actually looks pretty good to me yeah I'll go with Clemson so Clemson and then we have a burn in Charleston I got to go all Brennan own TCU Texas Christian University and Syracuse TCU the the the foghorn foghorn frogs where they play a really good football team Syracuse made it in the tournament 11 seed riched basketball tradition in another bracket so I'm gonna I'm gonna pick an upset it's probably not a smart upset I'm gonna go sir you know that 3-2 zone just kills me Michigan State back now yeah we gotta go Michigan State here Oklahoma Oklahoma was just red-hot back in December their point guard was playing better than any freshman point guard I've ever seen they kind of fell flat on his face but this kid can play they're there the 10 seed here versus Rhode Island I'm gonna go Oklahoma no Hugh you've got I'm going upset here I think I'll go okay all right and then finally the the bluedevils Duke Blue Devils and Iona gotta go Duke all right let's do Villanova in Alabama Villanova the 1c I'm gonna go with you there and then we have this is we have a disagreement I got West Virginia and WSU and you got Murray Murray State yeah so I think I agree I got Wichita State here and then next it looks like we've got Florida and Texas Tech I'm going Florida in the upset I think Florida's gonna surprise people in this tournament okay I gotta go Texas Tech so you want to write your blue there with Butler and Purdue it's hard to it's hard to pull against Purdue right now they're they're pretty solid agreed so Purdue let's do your bracket over here in this side we have Xavier and Missouri I think you got to stick with the ones either yep so Xavier and then Ohio State and the Zags Gonzaga I'm probably stickin was Gonzaga I do two sagas made for a tournament Houston versus Michigan yeah I think so too I think by the second game of that tournament that weekend Houston will be a little tired they depend so much on their physicality that I expect Michigan's finesse to kind of run through there here we got either way like you said like we got North Carolina go for it going forward there Virginia k-state oh this is gonna be so hard do I go with my heart on my mind here what are you thinking I think that defense of Virginia is just gonna be too much and they're gonna control the pace you know ginge is gonna roll over k-state or crate and I'm afraid yeah I think we'll have to grits it really breaks my heart to have to give up on my Wildcats but we'll be there fighting fighting for okay and then this one we got I've got Kentucky versus Arizona so I'm gonna take that's a tough one and you got Davidson versus Arizona so I got Kentucky going poor no I think Arizona's going for I'm gonna take your aluminum alright well both of Arizona that yeah we're both going to Arizona all right Miami and Tennessee yeah I think Tennessee is gonna surprise some people this tournament too they're they're playing really good ball yeah I think they're on the way their stocks going up too so I'll go with Tennessee and then we both have Texas and Cincinnati going going here you got to go with the Bearcats again there they're gonna be tough and fighting hard yeah so we got Kansas and North Carolina state now I'm gonna stick with my buddy yeah so we'll both go kay you here and then Clemson and Auburn two teams I'm not real familiar with yeah this is uh it's a tough call I think approach to come ACC here we've got Syracuse and that darn three-two zone and Michigan State one of the top tournament coaches of all times and of course Syracuse has a great coach as well I think Michigan State though has the talent this year and then lastly we have Oklahoma and do again a great tournament coach great experience Oakland OVA and Wichita State Bill Nova okay let me think about this I'm gonna call the upset here and go with the shocker so where does we got a difference here I'll put my WSU up and you put your Villanova going forward and then in this game we have Purdue versus either one of ours and I think produced though I'm gonna stick with my upset Florida I think Florida is gonna be the our sweet 16 yeah let's go where would be what we ready for the Elite Eight it looks like yeah to figure out who's going good well you know I think I'm going UVA over Arizona I think you know just to jump out a little NBA to me as a Final Four team so where you are here but I'm going UVA yeah we better stick with UVA together there on that one Cincinnati Tennessee I'm gonna stick to tipsy I don't know why but okay we have to disagree on that one I got Cincinnati and you've got Tennessee going through em all right and down here Xavier ins and ziege things acres gonna end good sagas Cinderella runners yeah we'll stick with the number one seed I hate to do fundamentally but it's hard to argue how well they're playing okay and then I've got to stick with Carolina here along with your thing absolutely and down here we have Duke and Michigan State yeah that's gonna be a heck of a game Duke Michigan State what do you think I gotta stick with my home state Blue Devils who I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with Duke as well anyone that was point guard for Bobby Knight at West Point you had a root for right that's right and then and then the guy Kate you and Clemson I'm going K you I'm staying on the bandwagon with it alright we're getting now we're ready for the Final Four in the Northeast so I would be the Northwest looks like we have Virginia and you got Virginia and Tennessee I'm sticking with UVA and I think I agreed I think be a universal Virginia walks gets into that Final Four again great defense defense wins basketball games defense and rebounding okay now at this out of the Southwest we have Xavier and Carolina I think we're both thinking those Tar Heels are going to be argued up ready to go now come in this direction I'm going to stick with Wichita State here so we probably have a little difference on this one yeah I'm gonna go Florida okay so I got Wichita State you've got Florida and I'm sticking here with this will be another just a great day can you miss imagine that going this game okay you Duke game they should do that once a year such a good game I'm going to stick with ke this will be a tough one I think I'm sticking with K use well okay so we have a East Coast mid and Kansas Final Four and so Virginia plays North Carolina so this is tough because Virginia handled North Carolina twice this year beat Carolina and the ACC championship tournament final game they controlled the pace and in each of those games but I just think Carolina is gonna you're not gonna give us one more time so I'm gonna I'm gonna go with Carolina you know I am too I think it's really hard to beat a team four times in a row right yeah so let's both go with North Carolina this Wichita State K you gain Wichita State will be so fired up for this game but I'm telling you why this this young man Devonte Graham is going to just have the tournament of light of his lifetime America is gonna Rob this young man the way he plays with with his heart just sticking 3-point daggers in then at the right moment controlling the pace of the game he's not going to come out of the entire game and I'm gonna go with KK you hear all right okay you Carolina fine I'm obviously gonna pick the Tar Heels imagine I am I'm gonna get you son okay you lose this we're gonna get you some sunflower seeds and maybe some good Kansas beep sounds good well I'll throw in some Bojangles fried chicken Charlotte and some cheer one that's our home state assault drink wish you wish you luck you bet thank you Richard Hudson North Carolina

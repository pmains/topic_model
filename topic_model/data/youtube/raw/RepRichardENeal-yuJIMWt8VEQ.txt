Thank You mr. chairman I rise in support of HR 6 it has become all too clear that the ongoing opioid epidemic has gripped our nation's families and communities it crosses social spectrums and as a public health safety and economic crisis as well in Massachusetts in 2016 there were two thousand eighty three confirmed cases of opioid related overdose deaths this is a 26 percent increase from 2015 and a 54 percent increase from 2014 in 2017 there was a small decrease but clearly there was still a strong need to address this devastating trend this week the house is considered opiate bills in committee and on the floor and some of these in fact will expand treatment options for the care that is necessary however a number of the Democratic priorities in ER I think really provide real investment and opportunity for example it incorporates a bill that I introduced that would expand Medicare coverage for opiate treatment programs currently Medicare does not cover this sort of treatment this would give Medicare beneficiaries access to a broad range of treatment options leading to opportunities for lasting recovery although many think of opioid use disorders is a problem faced by young people many may be surprised to learn that it is rapidly growing amongst our Medicare beneficiaries Medicare Part D spending and opiates for this treatment outpaces enrollment growing from 165 percent from 2006 to 2015 in 13 states the over 65 population has the highest rate of opiate related inpatient stays a chart also expands coverage of medication assisted treatment and allows nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribed or dispensed treatment opiate drugs the measure also provides consistent Medicaid coverage for at-risk youth that expands Medicaid coverage for foster youth until the age of 26 these bills are pieces of a large complex puzzle we need to find realistic solutions with long term outcomes the part of this approach is to protect and strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act the ACA guarantees parity and non-discrimination for people who need substance use disorder and mental health treatment thanks to the ACA millions of previously uninsured outs adults now have access to health insurance and I might add the expansion of Medicaid there are many efforts here I think time and again to dismantle the Medicare proposal as well as cutting back on many of the initiatives that we have proposed in the past instead of strengthening and ensuring sustainable future for the ACA and for Medicaid some of our colleagues want to cut to pay for a two point three trillion dollar tax plan efforts to sabotage the ACA coupled with premium hikes slashing pre-existing condition protections and increasing drug prices it will lead to more uncertainty dismantling current health benefits would damage any progress that we're making today with the opioid crisis it would also increase health care costs and lower coverage and quality of life for Americans and their families so I urge our colleagues to recognize that many families who are devastated by addiction are going to need the opportunities that we are embracing today the impact of the opioid crisis on labor participation rates in America should concern all of us and according to a recent report the economic burden from opiates was estimated at 95 billion dollars the American people are facing two pronged obstacle health challenges uncertainty remains one of them we want to make sure that we don't Sabbath as the ACA and part of the path forward today is highlighted by the achievement we're all about to recognize

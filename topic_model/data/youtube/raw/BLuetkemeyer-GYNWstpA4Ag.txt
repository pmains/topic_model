hi this is Congress Luke tomorrow thanks for joining us this week for no additional blame buzz want to just comment briefly on Memorial Day coming up next week obvious it's an important day in our country's history in that we honor those men and women who have fought and died in the service of our country I think we need to remember those sacrifices because at this time we're a very divided country and sometimes we lose sight of what we have because of how we're going back and forth and I think it's very important that we understand the greatness of our country is the fact that we have the ability to have this dialogue to be able to go back and forth and have these different and divergent views of opinions to be able to be voiced we've had a situation over the last several months here where there's been some questions about the the First Amendment with regards to free speech with regards to freedom of religion freedom of expression of religion and as a result I think we see every day that the greatness of our country is the freedom that we have and those freedoms were protected by the men and women who have served this country and faced the enemy face to face literally and have been victorious and i think it's a it's time that we have taken its well spent to take a moment to honor those brave men women who have given their lives and remember all those who died and give support to and thanks to those veterans as well or with us yet today so with that hope you take a few moments out of your day on monday to be able to attend a service or just to think about those men are sacrificed so that you have the ability to do and be whoever you want to be in this great country thank you can look for seeing you next week take care

our budget which replaces sequester with half revenues and half more targeted spending cuts i believe moves us in that right direction we in virginia in many ways are ground zero of of of the effects of sequestration this senate budget is a compromise like all are and there will be more compromise that should take place in any normal process but the budget does a very good job in a number of ways it it tackles the task the challenging task of deficit reduction to get us to figures that would be very much the equivalent of what had been recommended in the simpson-bowles reports as senator warner indicated it focuses upon economic growth a growth agenda which is the most important thing we need to be focused on in this body and it does it in a balanced way that incorporates real savings and also appropriate reform of revenues it is impossible to fix a balance sheet by just focusing on one side of the balance sheet business leaders know this governors know this every day americans know this will the senator yield i will i will yield senator um i'd like to just ask the senator and as i know he he has seen and he's he's very familiar with these with these installations and and families because of his his tenure as governor but i guess you might want to also make the point senator is it not true that in an area like hampton roads where you not put these folks on furlough and the literally 88 000 98 000 um immediately affected uh can you also talk to the point of the ripple effect this has for the literally thousands of others who provide the support services restaurants gas stations auto repair you name it that rely upon those folks having jobs as well absolutely senator i'm i'm glad you brought that up when when folks are furloughed and they see their pay reduced and they're going to spend less at the dry cleaner they're going to spend less at the restaurant they're going to delay the purchase of the automobile that they had planned for this year they're going to be doing all kinds of things to tighten their spending that's going to affect shopkeepers and merchants in their area when i was governor early in my term ford decided to close a plant with a couple of thousand workers in norfolk and the ripple of that throughout the economy a couple of thousand workers was very significant to take ninety thousand uh civilian dod employees in a state like virginia heavily concentrated in northern virginia and hampton roads and to furlough them and to reduce their salaries this is going to be felt throughout this economy and this is just one of the many effects of furlough the many effects of sequester these civilian furloughs you can't cut and tax your way out of this problem you've got to have a growth agenda and any good company in any good country has a business plan and any business plan in any country or company that's going to compete in the 21st century has to do at least three things they've got to invest in their workforce they've got to invest in their infrastructure they've got to stay ahead of their competition and that's in research and development an all cuts approach is like looking in a mirror and wishing you were weaker because an all cuts approach makes you weaker it makes you weaker in defense it makes you weaker in education it makes you weaker in infrastructure it by laying people off in jobs makes you weaker because your unemployment rate is higher an all cuts approach is like looking in the mirror and wishing you were weaker i don't want to be weaker i don't want this nation to be weak or we have to be stronger can we make cuts sure we can and we have and we'll make more but we ought to be focused on being stronger about growing the economy and growing jobs and that's why the approach that the senate takes is the right approach

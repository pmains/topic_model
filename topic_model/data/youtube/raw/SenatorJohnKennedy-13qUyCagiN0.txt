senator kennedy senator kennedy is recognized um i'm going to follow up mr director on a point made by senator leahy he talked about the massive voter suppression that he's expecting in 2022. do your intelligence reports show they're going to be there's going to be massive voter suppression in too 2022 i i don't believe i uh characterized um the voter suppression threat as massive and i'm not aware of any intelligence assessment we've done that that quantifies it certainly voter suppression is a concern it's something we investigate something we pursue okay on the next database where do you get where do you get the information for for the nix database so uh a lot of sources but um most of the information is coming from say local law enforcement well they all sending in all the information they're supposed to uh we are continuing to improve that uh the fixed nics act that that congress put in place has been a big help in that regard and every year we're increasing the the completeness of the next database but there's still room for improvement yeah there's still a lot of holes in it aren't there there are yes yeah and the truth is i mean for some i don't want to paint with too broad of brush but my understanding is that for some um at the state and local level it's just not a priority it's not that they're sitting around watching netflix they they've just got they're busy doing other stuff would that be a fair statement well i uh i understand why you would describe it that way i've got to be a little bit careful to characterize um our partners uh as i'm distracted but i i will say that um you know i've gone out to nixon put on the headset and sat there with the operator listen to the calls and see how it works and um you know some of these things especially start getting into you know misdemeanor domestic violence offenses and things like that it can get kind of complicated and if the records out in whatever jurisdiction it is aren't ready at hand or clear it can become a real challenge and that was magnified during the pandemic you know because a lot of departments local departments you know were not at work uh and so that ad well i i just i he i read about the president and others saying well the problem is we need to expand background checks and it just seems to me that a big part of our problem nothing's perfect of course but a big part of our problem is that um the the the the current system we has have is only as good as the information inputted and all the information isn't being inputted it's just not um and i think fix next did help and i think it's better but i don't think it's well and it would seem to me that that would be a logical place to start is my is my thinking faulty i don't think your thinking is faulty i think we all share the goal of keeping guns out of the hands of those legally prohibited from having them which should be the the table stakes in this uh endeavor and that's what the knicks system is designed to do uh to the extent that the holes that you identified are holes in different agencies and departments you know patchwork around the country uh you know i would be remiss if i didn't uh point out that some of them may need you know grant funding or research to help them because it may be a resource issue for them say i'm not suggesting they're just sitting around watching netflix they're working they've they've they've been uh cussed and disgusted and uh accused of everything in the world and their budget's been cut and then we wonder why crime goes up but uh so i'm not criticizing them i'm just pointing out that it seems to me that the the system is only good as the data that's in uh put into it uh let me ask you a final question i just want your opinion on this why do you think chicago has become the largest outdoor shooting range in the world well i mean i think i've referenced a lot of the factors from a national perspective i don't know that i can sitting here right now give you a chicago specific explanation but uh certainly some of the same trends that i described nationally would undoubtedly be at play in chicago um i know that uh you know over the past year we've had you know 200 this is just the fbi now you know 270 gang arrests in chicago 150 maybe violent crime arrests uh that's just in the past year or so and i know that our partners there we have some great partners in chicago you know police department among other agencies and they're all stretched pretty thin thank you mr director

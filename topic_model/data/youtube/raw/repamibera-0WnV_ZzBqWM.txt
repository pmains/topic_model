I now recognize the gentleman from California mr. Barrow for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman thank you to the ranking member thank you dr. Sullivan for for your service to our country in your service at NOAA I often hear my colleagues say well you know they can't determine whether the climate changing or not because they're not scientists now I'm a physician by training I am a scientist not a climate scientist but certainly trained in the scientific method and how you collect data and at the surface if we just think about it 2015 was the hottest year on record by quite a bit that's just objective data and folks may say well that's not a trend but 2014 was the second most hottest you're on date again objective data 2010 was a third hottest year on record in recent memory 2013 2013 was the fourth so you know as a trend it doesn't take a scientist to realize that the climate is changing and we are experiencing a new record heat wave after record heat wave let's drill that down to what it means to the the people you know in my own district in California and to our state we're going through severe drought like conditions that are impacting everyone you know from our farmers to our consumers everyone's chipping in in my own district Folsom Lake which serves a close to half a million people in my community rely on folsom lake for drinking water for surface drinking water it's been at record lows and yes we are having a wetter winter we are having some snow but what we realize you know over the last four or five years is when we look up at the Sierra Nevadas our snowpack has been disappearing and much of that precipitation when we get it is coming down as rain not as snow this is a crisis situation in my district we rely on folsom lake and Folsom dam to help manage both flood risk as well as drought risk and as we go through a joint federal project that will give us much more flexibility to manage both these conditions weather forecasting becomes increasingly important and the investments Noah is making in better forecasting so we can better manage our water in the lake knowing when we need to increase flows to create more capacity as also when we should hold back on water knowing that you know those storms aren't coming so I appreciate the work you're doing I was reading about the Cray supercomputer and just managing the big data and all the points of data and I'd be curious about the Cray supercomputer as well as other resources that Noah could has to help us better predict and forecast weather thank you very much for that questions throughout the the supercomputing is indispensable to this work as you can imagine you have to measure the entire globe and ingest the data and then run the calculations that let us have the kind of foresight that you're speaking about one of the exciting projects to me very specific to your interests is something called forecast informed reservoir operations which our weather service with our research teams and our fisheries teams actually are pioneering out in the Russian River basis for just the reason you said if we can tell a damn manager with the Corps of Engineers it's not some more rain coming for at least X amount of time then they could hold the water that comes in a wave an atmospheric River instead of letting water go downstream to make room in the reservoir that has great potential to help add some precision and some greater margin to the water management of your state thank you and anything we can do to help better manage that provide the funding make sure when we're writing the manuals that help us manage these reservoirs we're not relying on data from 30 years ago or 40 years ago we're relying on the instruments that we have today the tools that we have today and again in a state like mine in a region like mine where we have the dual risk of both fled and droughts we have to have those tools so we very much appreciate the the work that Noah's doing we want to make sure as we update the manual for Folsom lake and the management in Folsom dam we incorporate all that data and the forecasting data and you know again from my perspective this is a reality that we'll have to deal with the climate is changing managing these resources has incredible impact on individual lives on our economy and the more we can recognize that the quicker we can recognize that the climate is changing and we've got to manage this life-saving asset and water this sooner we do that the better off we'll be so thank you for your work thank you I'll yield back

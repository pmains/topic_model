crenshaw we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw okay so as we record this right now kabul has just fallen uh today and um the rest of afghanistan has been falling really for months as the taliban have moved through province after province and taking capital after capital uh kandahar was just a couple days ago and and now kabul uh the afghan national army afghan security forces don't appear to even be putting up a fight and um a lot of us predicted this a lot of us said this was exactly what would happen if we did something like this something like this being a very rapid withdrawal and um and i have to say this look this is what happens when simplistic slogans drive complex foreign policy and if you're part of the no more endless wars crowd that makes it feel good to yell that yell that slogan well um you should just be cheering now i mean you should just be thanking biden for doing exactly what you wanted uh because this is exactly what the no more endless wars crowd wanted bring the troops home no more endless wars now that that seems to be about the extent of the foreign policy analysis is just those slogans and this is what happens when that's what we rely on that's what happens when we let a motion take over foreign policy and um we should have learned this lesson this exact same thing happened in 2011 when barack obama also wanted to listen to the emotional cries of being the boy's home and um then had to go right back because isis emerged soon after that and now we find ourselves in a situation which is actually probably worse than than pre-911 it's actually probably worse um we're going to get into that and assess what we're dealing with right now and maybe what we should do about it i got my friend congressman mike waltz here with me uh congressman from florida mike always great to be with you um special forces uh also a previous um policy advisor in the white house under under uh president uh obama and bush or just obama uh president bush president bush president bush um it's a lot of great experience that you've had even wrote a book about it uh you know serving on the front lines and then coming right back doing your kind of day job in the white house um pretty pretty impressive background obviously you've been on before so i mean what do you think react to what i just said i mean it's kind of for guys like us it's kind of at a loss for words here even though i always expected this to an extent because i knew both political parties were driving towards this it's still it still sucks yeah i'm i'm vacillating honestly between uh between rage and grief uh wanting to go get my kid on and and grab my rifle and go get on a plane and uh and and head over and or crawl under the bed with a bottle of bourbon um but at the end of the day you're absolutely right uh you me a number of others uh told the last administration uh and this administration that this is what would happen uh if we just yanked everyone out uh uh like this and you're absolutely right it is easy to put a bumper on bring the boys home and bring the troops home um that's like saying i want to end world poverty right yeah easy bumpers i'm against poverty and hunger yes right and i'm against war too like uh like those of us that uh like you that have literally left body parts on the battlefield uh and those of us who've left so much blood sweat and tears and treasure there didn't want it to end either and uh we are now going to see al qaeda 3.0 uh that biden's own intelligence community has repeatedly briefed us that they fully intend to reconstitute and attack uh the united states again uh and um uh it's just beyond frustrating because then you and i know in the future uh we're gonna have to deal with it uh the question is how long the biden administration lets it fester uh and uh once they hit us back here again special operators are gonna have to go back but this time they're gonna have no bases our local allies will have been hunted down no host government to even work with uh and we are in a worse place than pre-911 because we don't even have any allies in the north anymore uh from the northern alliance which is who uh the horseback soldiers the green berets that went in the very beginning dealt with they're gone too so um we've actually gone to a worse place uh than 9 11. let's let's go through some of the arguments we hear and i really just i i am focused on the normal swords crowd i i just can't and i just i'm just so done with that crowd that we're going to address everything they have to say um because it's because it's been interesting for me to watch them sort of uh squint and do some mental gymnastics to try and come up with who do we blame because it can't possibly be us right because this isn't our fault we didn't we we didn't say gained it over the taliban we just said bring the troops home and like well they're one and the same guys that's what we've been trying to tell you if you actually sought to understand the situation on the ground and what though there's been a few interesting op-eds recent written recently about blaming the generals holding the generals accountable some of this isn't a terrible argument i think the generals misled politicians and the public to an extent but in the end i think um i i would i would sooner blame the the well i don't know there's a lot of factors for blame there but it's an interesting take on it um we can discuss that the other thing that the this crowd kind of points out sort of aimlessly is well there was just no strategy there was there was you know it would this was always going to happen so we might as well rip the band-aid off and get it done with and what i continue to point out is that what these people have they have a complete inability to distinguish between nation building which which i do tend to agree with them on you know nation especially in afghanistan especially in afghanistan nation building seems like a waste to a lot of people i'm very sympathetic to that but they can't seem to distinguish between that and a fairly small security contingent let's say 10 000 troops you know which is by the way a fraction of what we have in korea japan germany a fraction of that and a small contingent that can conduct security operations and keep pressure on an enemy that does want to go to war with us even just because we decide there's no more war doesn't mean they do right that's how 9 11 happened and what did we get for the last 20 years well we got no more 911s so i'd actually i don't feel like my friends died in vain i don't feel like i lost my eye in vain i and i don't know how you feel about that but but those what other arguments do they say i mean or respond to some of those well yeah that right i mean you you you pointed out that we shouldn't be doing uh nation building uh you know we're not the world's police force um um uh we i i want to build roads in uh in in florida or texas not overseas and they give the impression that we had hundreds of thousands of boots on the ground kind of world war ii style uh uh over there with you know at the end of the trump administration we had 2500 excuse me uh troops they were doing they had two missions one counter terrorism keep going after the leadership and put pressure on al qaeda and isis and taliban senior leaders and the reason we haven't had another 911 is because they've been running scared when they're worried about where they're going to sleep at night they can't plot and plan to attack the united states it's about being on offense not defense and the other one importantly was providing that support to the afghan army the afghan army is out doing the fighting and dying what people need to understand is is that but what that small contingent of american troops were doing was providing the command and control the logistics for the arms and equipment that we're providing and importantly critically uh coordinating american air support when when needed uh and and this full withdrawal not only yanked that out it yanked out any intelligence that we had on the ground the cia uh nsa and others and uh it yanked out the american contractors that were helping maintain the afghan air force so yanking all of that out at once uh was was devastating but i think the other piece stand that people need to understand there's a lot of people asking how did the afghan army fail so fast and so quickly you've had biden anthony blinken austin pointing the finger at them and there's some blame there absolutely but they have to understand and people need to understand the battlefield psychology when when america announces the president united states announces that america is abandoning you and the taliban are saying we're going to win eventually one way or another afghan army commander you have a choice of either being beheaded or will let you go home to your family you know which do you think they're going to choose uh and if they even if they choose to fight the taliban go after their family uh and start uh attacking their children and you know attack and attacking uh their village in their homes so it's a much different dynamic so for somebody like secretary of state lincoln to sit in his air-conditioned office and say they should have fought harder uh under those kind of conditions uh really to me just shows they're either clueless or heartless or both probably a little bit of both um especially clueless i mean this is resignation worthy from the secretary of defense and the secretary of state especially the way as you pointed out especially the way they laid they they're trying to blame everybody but themselves right it's the trump administration's fault it's the uh it's the it's the afghan national army's fault they just gave up well it's like like you said i mean you're you're taking away their their life raft as they're drowning you know because they were just clinging to that and look this gets to a broader point of what we were doing there we were there as an insurance policy hey very quickly though i want to take on that you know we inherited this uh plan uh myth that you know an excuse that they're throwing around um i i had a real problem with that deal and i said so publicly yeah we both we both signed up for the trump administration you did as well and so like let's look at the plans that uh the biden administration from trump is torn up in the first six months iran israel aid to palestine keystone pipeline nordstrom 2 i mean they've shown no problem with reversing course from the trump administration but yet we're expected to believe on this one suddenly their hands were tied they had no choices it's yeah it's just yet another excuse on the face of it and it's ridiculous it's pretty ridiculous i mean they already they i think the trump deadline for troops out was in may you know the bite administration already changed it to september and foolishly chose september 11th by the way which was just the deepest propaganda win for the enemy that you could imagine i i have like who the hell thought of that probably the same people that thought it was a good idea to have that weird tick tock star do that flamboyant supposedly funny video in the white house the other day probably this is probably the same my theory actually dan is it's uh it was it was susan rice who thought it would be great to make a trade for bergdahl and then celebrate him as a hero uh in in the in the rose garden i think she's still lurking around the white house making terrible decisions it's such a such a twisted view and and look it's it's guys like biden and it's guys like everybody in the bite administration has been in sort of the foreign policy blob for a long time and and the reason that americans are so misinformed about what's going on in afghanistan is because their leaders misinformed them and you were never supposed to present this as a war in a traditional sense this was always a security presence that prevents another safe haven that causes 9 11. and i'm sorry that that people get impatient with that presence but deal with it because the alternative is a terrorist safe haven and 9 11. that is the alternative that's right it's more 911. it's it's it's it's unbelievable i don't get that yeah i know i put a little first of all there's no timeline on protecting the united states right secondly uh we're fighting an ideology an idea and it took decades to defeat the idea of communism it took decades to defeat fascism it's going to take that long to defeat uh islamic extremism but i want to fight it forward we need to be fighting it in places like kandahar not kansas city when it follows his home right so yeah you're absolutely right but that's you know the endless war crowd can never articulate a counter-terrorism strategy beyond bring the troops home too hard too long too expensive they they they run right past that point of of american security they run right past it like they did they just talk past you on that point because because their position is just emotional it's completely filled with emotion it's also worth noting over the last few years i think we did come to a good balance you know like i think i think trump's end goal was pull the troops out the exact same way biden's doing it now but to his credit he never actually did it okay so so i don't want to hear everybody blaming him for this because he ain't president but but that what happened over the last few years was a was a small contingency of about you know ranging between 3 000 and 10 000 troops um with a pretty limited mission set we haven't had a combat casualty in afghanistan for 18 months like let that sink in does that sound like an endless war like a an active duty service member is at much more risk from from dying on base uh right now in the united states than than uh than getting killed in afghanistan that's just a fact um so it's not exactly like we were just fighting this endless war we have a security presence the way that we have in hundreds of countries i mean special operations are in well over 100 countries and what are we doing we're creating a security network where we build alliances we conduct training with them and we have eyes and ears on the ground right right it would be insane to think that the the department of defense is supposed to just like man the beaches on the atlantic and the pacific right like you know we got the seals in san diego and virginia we're just sitting there on the beach just defending america no you have to we're globalized society whether you're like this is about you have to be leadership that's absolutely right man and you also have to be forward deployed that's right uh fight forward i want to be on offense not defense we've had uh special uh special forces in colombia for 40 years uh and you know in the 80s a narco state with airliners being blown up that was threatened you know with with narco groups and uh and an insurgency threatening to take over the government uh and and look at where we are now but it was training logistics uh at times limited air support we have done this before and we're to your point we're doing it all over the world so why this obsession when we have half the world's terrorist organizations that our intel community says today still want to hit the west and you would have thought i want to make this point too that the crowd making this decision would have learned from the pull out of iraq that led to al qaeda 2.0 which evolved into isis the size of indiana a caliphate that was launching attacks all over the world the same people are in charge dan secretary austin was in charge of central command in charge of the middle east blanken was the deputy national security adviser the current head of uh dni the director of national intelligence was the deputy of cia it's the all the same folks making the exact same mistakes and we're going to lead to exact same disastrous results except this time we don't have any bases in the region like we did around iraq uh we don't have the kurds uh because everybody who worked with us in afghanistan would have been uh been hunted down and uh and assassinated uh and by the way the taliban now have a whole army's worth huge caches worth of armor artillery heavy weapons ammunition uh and and on down the list that future american soldiers are going to have to deal with in order to get through them to al-qaeda once they start plotting and planning to attack america again and that blood is going to be on all of their hands and we're going to hold them accountable i think we should like i said i think they should just resign at this point it's worth noting too this was so preventable look uh i've got a timeline here which is kind of interesting because this started a few months ago on april 14th when biden announced the the troop withdrawal from afghanistan starting on may 1st and to end on september 11th again huge propaganda win to the enemy but you got these kind of people making decisions very quickly after that major offenses offensives uh began throughout afghanistan from the taliban another reason it was so completely insane to announce withdrawal on this timeline is because it's right at the start of fighting season you know the the fighting season afghanistan as as the snow melts and everything it starts in the spring it goes it gets really hot and heavy during the summer and then it dies down again for the winter that's how it is every single year and to to announce withdrawals in this fashion with a weak afghan government in place and it could be weak for a very long time was so was so disappointing and irresponsible um and it gets so avoidable um you know you look at this timeline and they just these provinces are just following one by one and yet we're pretending like nothing's going on i mean they just had no plan you know they had no plan to to get ourselves out they certainly didn't have a plan for the interpreters you know that's right that's something me and you were were pretty adamant about getting our interpreters out and our contractors out but little did we realize they had no plan to get ourselves out i mean bagram fell a while ago to to taliban insurgents they didn't even hand it over to the afghan army it's just it's just so disgraceful and it just i can't i'm at a loss for words because i'm just trying to think like what on earth were these people thinking what on earth were they thinking and and by the way like again it's they can try to blame trump's negotiation all day long but the trump administration had not really adhere to that negotiation because the taliban broke it right away you know again i don't think trump had the right ideas on this however at least he respected red lines when the taliban broke those lines the administration pushed back yeah no you're absolutely right and i know because i talked to president trump directly about my concerns that uh you know ambassador khalilzad who was kind of the point man for all of these negotiations had convinced uh everyone that the taliban had changed they were interested in peace they really wanted to govern they would do power sharing uh and that you know i expressed my concern that this was a bad deal that these guys were using it to get us out to buy time to build up their forces to launch the offensive uh the the very offensive that we saw but i also promise you that president trump listened uh and yeah he he did want to get folks out he was frustrated with you know hard long and expensive but when they came to him as they did right before the end of the administration and said you know we can't go to completely to zero he listened and we had 2500 at the end along with the cia and along with our contractors providing critical support to the to the afghan air force i also promise you that he would have had a plan for our interpreters would have had a plan for ongoing intelligence would have had a plan uh to protect those who had you know fought and stood with us journalists female politicians uh uh even even you know folks in civil society uh anybody who had taken a stand against extremism and finally he would have had a plan uh which we don't still to this day to have bases somewhere in the region if we have to go back in and i think when people look on the map and see that afghanistan's surrounded by you know by places that aren't going to let us uh have a base and the fact that we gave up you know part of biden's big reasoning for doing this was that we got a shift to china you and i both agree with that but we also had a base in afghanistan that was sandwiched between china russia and iran uh and we just gave it up for nothing we got nothing in response you know and again the arguments for this stuff are so interesting like like yeah we need to shift to china but they're not mutually exclusive again we had such a fault small footprint a small counter-terror footprint in afghanistan as we do in many places around the world they're just not on the news a lot so so americans don't get all emotional about it yeah but but it's a necessary part of your foreign policy and i'm sorry i'm sorry that it is right like it confront that can frustrate people that it is but look we don't live in the world that you wish we lived in we live in the real one and in the real one there's a lot of people out there that want to kill us and you know at maximum they're at a 12-hour flight from the united states so so you get used to this problem uh my god and we like we can't make keep making these mistakes over and over again what do you think about some of the op-eds i've seen recently that are that are really taking swipes at the american generals the american military specifically for their handling of it and i think some of that stems from and rightfully so from a lot of the whitewashing that occurred um you know giving this rosy picture of the situation afghanistan year after year uh without being a little bit more honest and maybe taking a step back and saying you know let's have a totally different strategy here um and how about we communicate it to people so that the no more endless war crowd doesn't get as strong as it did yeah well i mean i that's a lot of what i wrote uh my book about it you know it was it was a you know an exercise in frustration because i was in the white house uh hearing what the president intended us to do i was in the pentagon but then i was out on the ground seeing us do the exact opposite so where does that disconnect between you know president united states saying we're going in this direction and then the general is taking us in a different one um man that's a long conversation i think part of it has been risk aversion uh over the years uh you know with the draft army we were you know you were pulled out of your life and given every incentive to do everything necessary take every risk you needed to to win uh and then so that you could come back home now a tour over in somewhere like afghanistan or iraq is a one-year blip on an otherwise very promising career so the incentive becomes don't screw it up don't have uh don't lose a sensitive item don't have a base overrun um but you know the other piece uh is that we didn't deal with some of the basic fundamentals like the sanctuary the taliban have enjoyed in pakistan uh no uh insurgency that i know of in in history has ever been defeated when it enjoys a sanctuary next door state support to help it rest refit rearm uh and keep going we never dealt uh with that piece and then finally i think in many ways we tried to create a government in a military that looked exactly like ours rather than working with some of these local groups that that do have the fight in them and still they're reaching out to me to this day i just spoke to the son of ahmed shah massoud the famous resistance uh fighter that the taliban was never able to conquer but al qaeda killed right on the eve of of 9 11. that he's going to continue the fight uh but we have to support him so there's a lot of reasons i think for the for you know why we are where we are we've made a lot of mistakes but back to our original point just because it's been hard or just because we made mistakes it doesn't mean we just surrender and throw our hands up and let more 911s you know let it fester in the cancer spread and let more 911s happen again we adjust uh and and we move forward well it's like in economics the sunk cost fallacy you know where you know you put a hundred thousand dollars into your house and you thought it'd be done but you know you still need another ten thousand what you don't do is just walk away from your house because they're like oh god that hundred thousand dollars has really eaten me up but i'm so mad i wasted it but if you just but you know what you don't do is just it was just walk away right it did you know a rational irrational decision is made upon current the current event and what might become later and so like what you hear from the critics is this hand-wringing this constant handwringing about about what we've spent and the mistakes we've made and and and using that as a justification to just throw it all away it's just it's just so mind-blowing to me and i don't know how to explain it except that it's it's based on pure emotion pure emotion and you know from our side i really don't get it because you you would think that we wanted them to like that we're drafting people and forcing these guys to go to war you would think that based on the emotional reaction to the endless wars right like that's it's something i've never understood and what really irks me is when they start to to justify their position uh by invoking veteran sacrifices like mine and like my my dead friends like that that really pisses me off and it just like we're not you're not your victims we don't need your saviorship all we want is to protect this country and we want you to stop using silly slogans to drive our foreign policy that you want to know what veterans want that's what we want and uh yeah you're absolutely right and and i do want to i think it's worth stating again you mentioned it that uh that their sacrifice yours uh mine you know my green berets i didn't bring home uh to our gold star families that are out there that are so upset right now uh to to the victims of 911 the sacrifices were not in vain uh the we volunteered to go fight this forward so that you know we don't have suicide bombers in our schools or more planes flying into uh more towers uh that the al qaeda was not going to stop with 911 they fully intended to continue to hit us again so we we knew exactly what we were doing i'm proud of that service and i'm proud that we've gone 20 years without another 911. we had some inspired attacks because of the mistake of pulling out of iraq too soon that led to isis but uh but i just want to be loud and clear to everyone you should hold your heads high uh it was not in vain and what has me so mad now though is that we're we are going to have to start over all over again and there is going to be far more blood and treasure spent than those that were hand-wringing about what we had what we've spent so far i mean dan imagine if we had said you know what 20 years was it in korea you know so so we pulled out in 1975 and anybody who's worked with the south korean army knows that we are still doing a lot of support even to this day with the world's 12th largest economy but back then they had a higher illiteracy rate than the afghan army does today that country was devastated by japanese occupation it took years of working with them uh so for biden in his most recent statement to say we don't get involved in civil strife well how about north and south korea how about colombia and the farc how about the philippines and their islamic insurgency and we can you know i guess he wouldn't uh have agreed with getting in between east and west germany either um it's just an asinine foreign policy and approach and now they're trying to justify this this failure that i think is going to turn out to be one of the worst foreign policy disasters in modern american history now the people yeah i mean again the bidens of the world this this administration and you know the bipartisan effort to or the bipartisan and the rand paul's you know the rand paul's of the world too dan i mean this is what i mean why aren't you calling out republicans it's it's it's isolationism based in ignorance uh and and and frankly if you look at you know biden has been a you know a politician his entire life he's never really dealt with the mentality that you find over there tony blinken has been a staffer for biden his entire uh life so you have a lot of people that i don't think understand that the taliban could care less if you isolate them from european international cocktail parties right they understand strength and leverage uh and and when it comes to it bombs on foreheads uh and that's when you negotiate with them when you're in a position of strength you're absolutely right look i mean i'm hardest on those on the right right because i i think they should know better um and i don't understand our side on this i mean like i said they've gotten very emotional about it over the years it like they act as if i'm i want to make them go and fight a war they don't want to fight and um and they deliberately talk past the the basic points of like well do you disagree with us going in there at all you know like answer that question and once we're in there because everybody was for that at the time everybody right good reason right for very good reason it was not it was not an irrational decision you can quibble about iraq i can totally get that one but afghanistan it was it was a highly rational foreign policy decision to go in there and and prevent that safe haven and once you're there okay you can't just take that back and and these guys who make these arguments like you say rand paul plenty on our side it's a hell of a lot more than him um like they act as if they act as if you can just wave a magic wand in some utopianistic fashion and change the past um in order to inform your future that's just not true it's they're living in a reality that does not exist and i'm so damn sick of it and this is what you get i mean you and i we've we've been we've been banging our heads against the wall on this particular point for a long time written about it a lot and um you know a part of me always knew that it would end up like this because of this bipartisan desire for it to end up like this now of course they deny that now they're like well not like this well hey those of us who know what we're talking about told you it would end up like this and you should have listened and don't try to blame somebody else right now i mean that's ridiculous but again like the things i see tweeted um are just so utterly ridiculous no you a lot a lot of people on our side wanted biden to do this and uh and so you better be defending him that's all i got to say about that so and i think you know that so here we are uh the the flag is is down over our embassy this is a saigon uh moment even though uh blinken wants to deny it and biden is you know back in his basement and we haven't heard anything from him personally but here we are with the flag is down the afghan flag is down and replacing that is the flag of the taliban and soon to be al-qaeda 3.0 so where do we go from here and the administration needs to decide are they just going to shrug their shoulders and let this thing continue to fester uh or are they gonna support a continued resistance through unconventional warfare through local militias uh and due to the taliban what they did to us uh and not let uh al-qaeda uh become completely resurgent and dominant like isis did uh in iraq and that's you know that's the next decision uh before us i think part of it too is we have to deal with pakistan and i think we have to deal with them much more harshly because at best they turned a blind eye at worse they they've actively edited it aided and embedded in this yeah i know a lot of people in our business think they they certainly did actively aid in a bet much of it um you know the isi the uh that's that's what they're called right their intelligence service um yeah that's right is i can't remember what it stands for but in any case it's um it's it's often complicit i mean it's it's a strange relationship yeah with them you don't want to completely isolate them and then just let china fill the vacuum and and what's frustrating about this entire thing too is china will clearly fill the vacuum in afghanistan they don't have these moral qualms with just being an ally of the taliban and they will be happy to expropriate those resources this afghanistan is extremely rich in mineral resources so yeah it's it it's just it's hard to see any silver lining here except it made some people feel good because they had bumper stickers that said we should bring the troops home like that that's literally it there's there's no other benefits here and all policy decisions have to be viewed through a lens of what the costs and benefits are and um god this administration has just screwed up in in so many ways that it's um it's unbelievable i mean they listen they listen they listen to the the bumper sticker slogan slogan years on on foreign policy they listen to radical radical immigration activists on the southern border they listen to socialists on the economy i mean i just it's what that is you know the thing that's so fresh the thing that's so frustrating to me is biden portrays himself as you know the consular in chief and this kind of kind you know grandpa but if you look at the actions it's heartless uh if you look at them as you mentioned the migrants on the southern border 30 to 40 percent according to doctors without borders of the young girls and women are being sold into sex slavery if you look at the you know did nothing uh for the people of cuba as they took their life you know their lives in their in their hands to to stand for freedom is doing nothing for afghan women nothing for our interpreters that stood with us nothing for the millions of uyghurs uh that are in in modern day slavery uh and and forced labor and we can keep going around the world so his uh his inaction again heartless clueless or both i yeah i just i don't know it's it's unbelievable and of course they're sending back in about three thousand troops i mean so we're like immediately five thousand five thousand so so how they get back in and exactly where they stay i don't know i'm curious to see how this how this ground truth actually plays out um and you know are they going to leave soon are we going to have this same dumb discussion over and over and over again it's a different situation on the ground now i mean the government has completely fallen the president is out of the country uh it's so i mean and you have a mala that is likely to become moab as his name that's likely to become the next ruler so basically we're going to have uh you know in iran they call him ayatollahs in in as you know in sunni islam but another uh islamic emirate we're going to have a bastion of terrorism china gets a trillion dollars of critical minerals and by the way you know the country most upset the world's largest democracy in a critical ally india is becoming surrounded on all sides so yeah and you know if you could talk about if you care about china because no more endless wars crowd seems to only care about china fine i think that's i think that should be our priority to be fair i agree but then maybe you might want an air base that's only a few hundred miles from the chinese border you know maybe maybe that would be a good thing to hold on to um you care about it wrong i'm assuming so maybe maybe you want um maybe you want strongholds in places right next to iran and and you can squeeze them from both sides if necessary so like there's you know there's just a complete lack of of strategic thinking here and and again if you know because if i'm going to blame you know republican politicians now labeled the neocons i'm pretty sure i'm labeled in neocon i'm pretty sure you're labeled to do con because you know because because we have nuance i think that's just code for having we believe in american leadership forward you know outside our borders and having having a nuanced discussion about american foreign policy that isn't that isn't reduced bumper sticker slogans but fine if that's what makes you neocon um now but but i do agree with that crowd i'm like look you can't make the map democracy happen everywhere uh and and you know we agree on that point but there's there's a lot of middle ground um but again just real quick on that i mean south korea was a dictatorship until the 80s right um so yeah this isn't about creating switzerlands all over the world this is about engaging uh where we have a national interest and i don't know if you look at afghanistan like you said you're on top of half the world's terrorist organizations and uh with bases that border china southern flank of russia east eastern flank of iran so four out of the five major threats in our national security strategy are touched by afghanistan and yet we just walked away i mean just gave it away for nothing it's um it's a sad day for guys like us um 20 years of uh 20 years of hitting it hard and then and then to end it like this is it completely inevitable or completely avoidable a completely avoidable mistake um i think we've ranted on log enough about it what do you think anything else to add yeah no i think that is i think it's important though um i probably sounded like we were ranting i know we're both frustrated as hell but it's important to shoot down some of these myths you know some of these ex these bumper stickers as you said from the you know the isolationist these excuses that the biden administration's throwing out they had no choice so suddenly they're totally beholden to what trump wanted to do that's a news flash uh you know that it was all the afghans fault well you know they were given you know beheading or go home because america's abandoned you um and in the in the you know great power competition uh argument as well i think it's important that we continue to talk about these things because as you said our generals uh and and a lot of our elected leaders are not talking about it and not talking about why it matters to the everyday american who's trying to you know get their kids to school uh deal with mass mandates and you know get to get their next paycheck but uh this will follow us home and the next pulse nightclub the next 9 11 you know we can go down the list of attacks um is is going to have real consequences and that was the point 20th anniversary now 20th anniversary of 911 with uh you know with this kind of with with flags flying uh uh over over kabul representing al qaeda and the taliban yeah and that was the point i was thinking about the you know again the so-called neocons like if there's there's one thing to truly blame them for yeah maybe a little bit too idealistic about what kind of democracies can be created abroad but also just just a complete lack of communication with the american people i mean we kind of rat like and that lack of communication radicalized a lot of people it made them extremely emotional about these about these foreign policy decisions or these this this presence that we have in places like iraq and afghanistan and you try to explain you know everything we've been explaining over the last hour on this podcast you try to explain that to them and all they hear is you you just want a nation bill you just want to spend a trillion dollars on on them and creating a demand you know and it's like no that's actually not it we're trying to explain to you the security reasons and the national security interests that we have here and they just can't hear it like i i notice it over and over again people just can't hear that and um and it's it's gotten us into this situation and i just hope we learn those lessons and that's why with you and i keep talking about this you know because we can't change it at this point but i hope that maybe maybe this time america will finally learn it's less it didn't happen after vietnam uh it didn't happen after after isis uh the fight right the resurgence of isis and it um maybe it'll happen after this one um it's like an insurance policy you know you invest a little bit it prevents the catastrophic uh you know uh blow up an accident down the line so i'm with you brother thanks for coming on mike always good to have you okay talk soon dan go army yeah yeah okay i'll give you that one since you're a guest all right michael it's everybody appreciate it bye

I want to address the biggest problem in Kansas and I say not agriculture but the biggest problem in Kansas because Kansas is agriculture and agriculture is Kansas the biggest problem in Kansas is the price of wheat the price of sorghum the price of corn the price of milk the price of beef and the the price of pork and if you you've addressed NAFTA already please take the rest of my time and address what you're seeing the future looks like in Japan it's a huge market for our wheat and our beef it's a two hundred million dollar problem going forward with our competitors when it comes to the wheat issues as these tariffs come in place and I want you to be reassured I interviewed ten people from Japan and they all preferred Kansas beef / Australian beef so it's 10 out of 10 people so we'd like to get that Kansas beef over there I understand I think again you may have heard and I was very encouraged here the our president Davos talked about a potential interest in in rejoining TPP as we know that TPP 11 have moved forward but when we look talked to Japan when we look to the other countries involved in TPP I think they were very regretful that the United States was not part of that and I'm gonna take the president his word again he's a tough negotiator he's American and he believes in America but I think again we understand how vital trade is try AG economy not just in Kansas but virtually everywhere else but the wheat has not fared that well we were on a good roll with sorghum I never thought I'd see sorghum at a premium to corn and that's one of the the hit took a place with the China even announcement there was disheartening in that regard NAFTA I'm as I indicated earlier I'm hopeful that we can really close that out and have an improved NAFTA a modernizing after that's better for the American producers as well as we go forward but our farmers need certainty they are optimistic they're resilient they're courageous but they need like any business they they they really deal in certainty and there's a lot of trade anxiety out there so I wish there were some way the secretary of the US Department of Agriculture could just wave a magic wand and fix prices you and I both know that's not possible but you're absolutely right the farmer is great for the AG economy it's great for the economy in general because if farmers make money they're gonna spend money and they rotate it through the economy and in a mighty way you see that green paint riding everywhere as well as other things but that it's good for Main Street the AG economy and those rural Kansas communities is good for Main Street as well thank you for the hope and I yield back

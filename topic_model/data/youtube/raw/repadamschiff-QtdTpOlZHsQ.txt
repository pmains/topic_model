some reaction now from democratic congressman Adam Schiff of California Congressman thanks so much for joining us as the lies mount it certainly looks like top House Republicans still aren't budging on Congressman Santos do you see any way to get him out of Congress well you know they're not going to be shamed into doing it because of course this is a party under the leadership still of Donald Trump who spread you know thousands and thousands of Lies as president so Santos is very emblematic of that anti-truth uh Trend within the GOP but because McCarthy is so dependent on every vote including Santos uh they're going to treat him like any other member and to a sad degree he is like so many of their members just more extreme uh well if I do want to just uh you showed some images of the president in California I want to thank the president for being in California surveying the damage we suffer from these storms and for the Emergency declarations that are going to help so many residents and business owners get through this natural disaster we're greatly appreciative that he is here today yeah he wants to reassure the people in California the federal government will help I want to turn to the looming crisis over the debt ceiling Congressman as you know Republican Congress whether Nancy mace says insisting on more debt without budget reform isn't serious can Democrats sustain the position of refusing to negotiate well you know what I think is not serious is a party saying they're going to take us over the fiscal cliff to try to attack the deficit when their First Act Right their first act in the majority was to defund part of the IRS uh so that more people could uh more wealthy people could cheat on their taxes something that's estimated to increase the deficit by a hundred billion dollars or more so they're not serious about the deficit they are serious about basically uh creating this fiscal crisis in order to exact cuts to Social Security and Medicare that's their goal and I think the by Administration is exactly right to say you're not going to take the country's fiscal Health hostage here we're not going to negotiate over this this is something that is the debt ceiling applies to debts that are already incurred and we pay our bills and I think that's exactly the position they should take let me also get your thoughts on a different issue while I have your Congressman President Biden I don't know if you heard it he just spoke while out California on the classified documents found in his home and his office saying there's no there there and he has no regrets he's been following his lawyers advice he's saying that as well is that the right tone when this relates to highly sensitive top secret SCI documents I ask you the question you're the former chairman of the house intelligence committee well first of all I think whenever classified documents are found somewhere they shouldn't be it's an issue and we need to find out how the documents ended up there and is there any risk that they were exposed to people that didn't or shouldn't have had access the intelligence Community does those kind of damage assessments mitigation assessments they should do so here I think what the president is alluding to is you know he's very confident that in his case this was completely unintentional and I believe that's exactly right and I think that when they do the investigation they'll find that there was no intention to hold on to these documents and indeed when they were discovered they were immediately turned over that is of course a sharp distinction from what Donald Trump did with a far greater number of classified documents there there's every evidence that Donald Trump tried to obstruct the investigation and his lawyers may have lied to the FBI about the continued possession of those documents so I understand the president uh President Biden feeling I've got nothing to hide here this is completely inadvertent I think he's right at the same time we need to assess just in case uh any any uh by the IC and take any potential mitigation that might be necessary I see the intelligence Community congressman Adam Schiff thanks so much for joining us thanks Wolf coming up

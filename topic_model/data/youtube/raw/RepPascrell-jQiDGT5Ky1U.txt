to mr. Pascrell the gentleman from New Jersey you know I've heard better stories mr. chairman in the bada bing club in New Jersey I'm listening to the accounts of all of these poor people let me tell you what we're talking about here you see this big chart that's ninety nine point eight five percent that get nothing out of this legislation in the United States of America and here's zero point one five percent yet 270 billion dollars of a tax Scott yeah let me use the magnifying glass I get a better picture of how much we're talking about but you can all see that orange / right there you're telling me that this helps the common good my friends on the other side of the aisle and when I use the word friends I mean it having recently taken to talking about the lack of wage growth in this country yet here we are today considering legislation that will add mr. speaker 294 point eight billion dollars to the deficit for people who don't work at all this whole idea that the estate tax hurts middle-class Americans in income that has already been taxed is simply not true much of this income has never been taxed repealing the estate tax in full would result in a massive tax cut for the wealthiest of the wealthy it hits 5,500 households in this whole country now in mind Texas the whole country with the state's worth more in five million dollars I mean that's the law I'm not making this stuff up as I go along this bill only further exacerbates already upside down tax code our tax code is already stacked against hard work labor income and this bill would make it even worse I sit on the House Budget Committee as well as ways and means and after sitting okay at least Speaker I yield an additional minute to the gentleman from New Jersey thank you after sitting through 13 hours of our budget markup I could tell you that this 294 point eight billion dollars go a long way making up for the devastating cuts that the other side of the aisle is inflicted on the middle class it's also important to note that the budget the budget does not assume mr. ranking member the repeal of the estate tax where the heck they're going to get the 294 point eight billion dollars it assumes a revenue-neutral I'll occur when they say a revenue-neutral reform it assumes that revenues will be exactly what CBO projects on their current law for the next ten years we really have only two conclusions either this bill is directly contrary to the budget or it's not paid for today Congress will at some point have to sit down the go down the road passed a pass a tax hike to pay for this massive deficit finance doctor you have no choice you can't have it both ways I'd like to hear from my good friend the chairman what his path will be to make up for this 298 point five billion dollars that's a lot of money mr. speaker weird that only time isn't it from the gentleman's time are the jump from Texas is recognized

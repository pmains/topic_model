uh senator carper uh you are recognized for your questions yeah thanks mr chairman i wear a couple of hats uh today one of them uh is that of a naval flight officer on active duty in vietnam were stationed in moffitt field california where we had because we shared a base at uh just near mountain view california shared it with nasa and we had a one day i was driving into to work this was like 40 30 37 years ago and they had the two runways dual runways alongside of each other at moffett field and early in the morning uh navy p3 coming into lands 13-man aircraft and a big nasal plane and the flight controller put both airplanes on the same runway to land and the nasa aircraft landed right on top of the navy p3 aircraft killed everybody on board and uh i arrived at the base like 10-15 minutes after that the fire fire departments came rushing out to put out the fire to try to save as many lives as he could some success but i think only one one member of the crew survived fast forward about 30 years i'm driving down uh south in uh through the dover through dover delaware uh on the state route one going right alongside of dover air force base we have big airplanes there c5 c17 and the c7 c5 had just taken off a few minutes before i got there and they had taken off with uh had engine problems they tried to get back and land on the uh on the uh on the base at the dover air force base landed about a mile short of the base the fire department was rushed out boom from the the airplanes trying to save as many lives as he could and we had no no fatalities no fatalities uh that's the good news uh the the bad news uh at dover is there like four communities around dover air force base that now have contamination from pfas and and before uh from yeah so you got a substance that actually generated developed to try to save lives uh as a firefighting firm and it ends up taking a lot of less and putting people at risk but with pfas contamination confirmed i think about 400 military bases around the country there's a lot of impact a lot of concern to go around including my own state while the dod's activities will be a clear focus of the first panel i know contamination associated with military installations will be a major focus for our second county as well as the chairman of the senate environmental public works committee fairly realized the critical importance of pfas contamination and i'm all too aware of the ongoing impact that these toxic forever chemicals have on countless communities across the country including my own i also want to note the complete absence of federal limits on these toxic substances that sent many states family to protect their communities and resources many states have had choose limited resources to set states with specific standards a move which could end up creating a patchwork of regulatory requirements that could hamper an effective national effort to manage a nationwide public health in response to the serious lack of federal protection i'm working with my uh colleagues on the environment public works committee to address uh and a bunch of other senate colleagues on senate legislative package to address pfas contamination building up the epa's recent pvas strategic roadmap and a thoughtful p-5 pack package passed by the house they called the pfast action act i personally feel a great sense of urgency to take steps that will hopefully provide relief to affecting communities families and particularly our most vulnerable infants and children who's so desperately in need again i want to express our thanks to the committee this committee for holding this hearing today without his a preface well we have some idea of how many installations are affected by pfas contamination i don't see any evidence from the the ig report the dod has estimated the number of service members exposed to pfas we made any effort to contact them my question mr o'donnell is this thank you very much for being with us and for wearing a couple of different hats yourself but is that a fair read of your report and mr kid is that an accurate assessment of dod's level of knowledge go to mr kidd and mr o'donnell please i'll defer to mr who was the project lead for this can you speak louder yes sir this is the inspector general i'm going to pass to the deputy inspector general on the specifics of the report all right so the 2019 ndaa required that the secretary of defense assess the implications of uh human health exposure to pfas our defense health agency in the department of defense took several steps to carry out that requirement that was in the law specifically they estimated the number of service members including veterans and that was made up of national guard active duty and dod firefighters who may have been exposed to pfas so our defense health agency within the dod would have the uh statistics in response to that 2019 ndaa requirement so so i'd like to thank senator carper for reminding us a little bit about why we use a triple f or used a triple f for the department of defense it saves material and it saves lives it was brought into the department after a major loss of life on a navy aircraft carrier and we have used it subsequently to address a number of fires and incidents i went down to florida to air force tyndale air base where they train and i met with the firefighters and it's amazing when they they have the a triple f foam trucks they plan to attack the fire they train as if there's an aircraft that's on fire with people in it and they attack the fire and that's you know frankly heroic i i see all the uh incidents of pfas use release intentional or otherwise that have occurred uh uh in the in the last uh 10 months since i've been there and one of the stories was a bradley fighting vehicle loaded with ammunition was on fire and the firemen drove right up to the vehicle and used a triple foam risking their lives in that instance that said i've also seen reports or we have accidentally released a triple f and caused some you know caused the need for for cleanup in regards to cleanup right now we are tracking 699 sites where there's been potential pfas use or exposure those all 699 are in the circle of process so that's uh reviewing them we've completed the initial phase of that process on 190 installations of those 190 installations 75 were found to have no evidence of pfas use so they have been put to a side and the others are moving into the next step of the the circular process which will allow better definition of the problem and also allow for some of those interim response activities that we talked about earlier we will complete the first phase of the circle process barring anything you know unforeseen uh on all the uh department of defense installations by the end of 23 and then we will continue to move those through as we complete that first phase that will inform our budget requests that we will take to our authorizers and appropriators all right thanks for that response mr chairman uh my time has expired i'd like to have if i could 20 seconds to just ask a question for the record and that question would be uh to ask a secretary kidd please share with us the immediate challenges that the department faces in establishing an enterprise wide risk management strategy for addressing pfas contamination and additionally are there actions that congress could take that would assist dod with establishing such an approach thank you thank you all for being with us thank you for your work on this mr chairman our committee of pw committee looks forward to working with you and in glove and with uh with hs guy thank you thank you

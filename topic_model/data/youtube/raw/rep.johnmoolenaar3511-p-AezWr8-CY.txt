Thank You mr. chairman for recognizing me mr. speaker the American competes act is good legislation that will help build a better future for our country the competes act expands the definition of STEM education to include computer science according to the bureau of labor statistics every computer science graduate between 2013 and 2023 there will be two jobs available that's why programs in my district like go IT offered free of charge to middle and high school students are so important to creating career awareness in computer science and other STEM fields this legislation increases government accountability it requires the National Science Foundation grants to meet a national interest standard and to publicly justify why they should receive taxpayer dollars requiring government agencies to prior prioritize the national interest is common sense and enhances accountability to the American people I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of the America COMPETES Act and I urge my colleagues to vote YES I yield that gentleman yields back

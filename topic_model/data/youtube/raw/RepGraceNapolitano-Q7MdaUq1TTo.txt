I'm not recognize my femur napolitano for a statement thank you so very much mr. Schuester mr. chairman that's bringing up this very important piece of legislation the benefits are veterans mr. Davis and I've introduces legislation to authorize funding for the US Army Corps of Engineers to hire and train to carry out the course curation preservation responsibilities under the veterans curation program and mr. chairman at your request I will be offering our bipartisan amendment as mr. Gibbs pointed out that strikes the authorized funding level amounts and replaces them with the funding quote using available funds unquote that appropriated by Appropriations Committee the veterans curation program laboratories carry out the course curation responsibilities including cataloging scanning photographing records and artifacts while utilizing and training a workforce of disabled or wounded veterans or veterans who have recently returned from overseas including Iraq and Afghanistan the vcp program seeks to impart skills in computer database management digital scanning digital image capture and writing skills to the veterans while improving the course management of its heritage assets the technical skills learn by our veterans at these laboratories will be transferable to jobs outside the government the veterans curation program not only educates and trains and employs veterans it also allows them to heal by providing an opportunity to carry out meaningful work that is beneficial to our nation the club began these activities in 2009 using temporary funds from the Recovery Act to Train veterans in archaeological processing since then the Corps has successfully carried out this program using existing appropriations the bill allows the core to continue the program provided providing them with long-term authorization for the program that will preserve it and allow it to grow the core undertakes these activities in three facilities across our country located in Augusta Georgia Alexander Virginia and st. Louis Missouri according to the core 241 veterans who have participated in the program including the current class of thirty eight of those who have already completed the probe eighty-seven percent have gone on to either permanent employment in the field or continue their education in some other fashion this program is a win-win for our veterans the win-win for our nation it needs our support and I urge my colleagues to support it and help our veterans gain job skills heal their wounds at the same time and I certainly want to thank my colleague mr. Davis for leading this effort with him and request as mr. Gibson said your support for this bill I yield back the balance of my time

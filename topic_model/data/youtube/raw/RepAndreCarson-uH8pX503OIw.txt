kind of Congressman Andre Carson serves on the House Intelligence Committee and is a Muslim American it joins me now congressman thank you very much your reaction well thank you for being with that I don't even know where to start but your reaction to Donald Trump well I think damn it look mr. Trump is is a smart man I've met mr. Trump before I can tell you this he is he is he's a ringmaster of sorts and he knows what kinds of things to say that will hit the right buttons with his constituency I think we're living in a time quite frankly where politicians or those seeking office are rewarded for making provocative statements he is up in the polls and the more provocative he becomes the more of a gadfly he appears to be the more reinforcement he gets from his focus group numbers his poll numbers and cross tabs but next year I think you'll see his popularity waned because the American people are looking for something more it is true that mr. Trump presents himself to be a bold and very decisive leader he doesn't deal with the ambiguity or the nuances to your earlier point but the facts are clear people are anxious there's a great deal of disillusionment and anxiety as it relates to the global terror threat so to have someone who speaks boldly though he erroneously but speaks boldly is quite attractive to many voters how are people who you know in your community at home how are they reacting to this to being painted with this you know terror brushin and being demonized this way and what is the effect on children I just had a meeting with some folks on Saturday they were a Pakistani descent Syrian descent Americans white black who happen to be Muslim and you know they're deeply concerned these folks were engineers physicians lawyers and police officers just wanting to make positive contributions of the society as they've done for decades as their families have done for decades so naturally there's a deep sense of despair because they too are concerned about the global terror threat were facing and they were asking that the a pertinent question what can we do to help what can we do to help and so I along with congressman keith Ellison we've been calling on some of our congressional colleagues to reach out to local mosque and I had a meeting recently with the FBI and we talked about ways in which the CVE strategy the countering violent extremism strategy could be improved and tweaked and making sure that the relationship with the Muslim community isn't transactional that its ongoing that it's honest and upfront what do you say to your own governor mike pence on the subject of Syrian refugees well Mike Pence and I served in Congress he and I used to go to lunch together I think that Governor pence a while he is the chief executive of the state of Indiana he has a duty to protect Hoosiers however governor Pence must understand because he is a descendant of immigrants that our nation is built on the backs of immigrants and the very fact that our previous governor governor mitch Daniels is of Syrian descent and so when you think about that governor Pence has to know that there are scores of Muslims who are in our intelligence services even our law enforcement communities we're helping to keep our country safe I come from Indiana's Department of Homeland Security Intelligence fusion center I think I'm the only member of Congress who has worked in a fusion center as a Muslim I can tell you that Muslims are on the front line in helping a push back a threat that day to see is detrimental to our society congressman Andre Carson thank you very much for joining

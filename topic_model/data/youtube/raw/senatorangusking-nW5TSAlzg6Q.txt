well i think there are series of steps and and uh one that hasn't really been mentioned very strongly so far is uh the international community uh we're in the infancy of the law of cyber war if you will and we need to be more active participants in setting the standards and the guard rails and the norms for activity in cybersplit in cyberspace so that when we do act whether it's the imposition of sanctions or other responses we're not acting alone or unilaterally winston churchill said the only thing worse than fighting with your allies is fighting without allies and that's one of our major advantages on the world stage with regard to our uh uh our principal near pier adversaries of russia and china i was in asia about a year ago and the the someone said america has allies china has clients and i think that's so that's that's step one is to develop an international set of norms that will themselves be at least some level of deterrent secondly we have to have a clear declaratory policy i emphasize the word declaratory because if if you don't tell your adversary that you'll respond then it's not a deterrent and so i think we need to have a much clearer statement of our doctrine of our strategy so that adversaries know that they will in fact pay a price the problem has been you can argue that we have done a good job of deterring catastrophic cyber attacks of course you there's no way to measure something that doesn't happen but we haven't deterred lower below the threshold of the use of forced cyber attacks whether it's the opm breach that you mentioned or the attacks on our election or election infrastructure or uh the kind of intellectual property theft we haven't done a very good job of deterring that so i think the important thing is to establish a the the means the credibility the credible response and secondly to declare it to make it clear that you will not attack the united states and not have a a significant cost imposed upon you so i think international norms and a clear declaratory strategy it's not exactly as you know i think as you understand it's not exactly analogous to the to the nuclear deterrent it's it's a it's a different and more subtle uh kind of issue but i do believe that unless we make it clear to our adversaries that that they have they have to calculate that there will be costs imposed and it may we it doesn't have to be cyber for cyber it may be sanctions or other other kinds of responses until they make that calculation they're going to keep coming after us so that would be my response to that very

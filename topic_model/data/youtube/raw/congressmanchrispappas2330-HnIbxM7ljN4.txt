i rise to pay tribute to david leblanc of nottingham new hampshire who passed away on this day six years ago a lifelong new hampshire resident david was born and raised in manchester and worked in the line department at public service of new hampshire for over 30 years he was an avid runner whose legacy lives on through the greater manchester running club which he founded with his wife cheryl in 1980. in addition david honorably served the state and his country as a member of the new hampshire army national guard today he will be reinterred at the new hampshire state veterans cemetery something that is only possible because we changed the law this year i was proud to sponsor this legislation that ensures all of our veterans including members of the national guard and reserves can be laid to rest in state veterans cemeteries the national guard and reserves are a critical component of our military and sacrifice so much to keep us safe so as we honor the memory of david leblanc let us honor the service of all of our veterans and ensure that they're never forgotten thank you and i yield back

back here in Washington we are learning new information about that phone call from inside the White House to a rioter on January 6th which was first revealed on 60 Minutes here's cbs's Scott McFarland tonight we're learning new details about this man 26 year old Anton lunick of Brooklyn seen here on January 6th turns out he was the man who allegedly received a call via the White House switchboard on the day of the attack the news of such a call was revealed Sunday night on 60 Minutes by former January 6 committee investigator Denver riggleman that's a big pretty big aha moment you get aha wait a minute someone in the White House was calling one of the rioters while the riot was going on on January 6th absolutely and you know who both ends of that call I only know one end of that call I don't know the White House end which I believe is more important CBS News has learned that lunac traveled to DC the night before the capital attack with two friends the call allegedly lasted just nine seconds and was made to lunick's phone at about 4 30 PM it's not known whether there was an exchange or if the call was sent straight to voicemail a CBS News Review of lunick's case finds he left the capital more than an hour earlier at 3 18 PM after about 10 minutes inside Illinois Democrat Raja krishnamurthy is one of riggleman's former U.S House colleagues I think that it's fair to say we all knew that the White House was somehow involved with January 6 on the very day that the Insurrection was happening any information about this particular phone call would help to develop that narrative further we reached out to Anton lunick through his attorney to get more details about that call but didn't get a response a spokesman for the January 6 select committee didn't directly address riggleman's claims about the call but said riggleman left the panel in April and has limited knowledge of the committee's work Nora

they're also those who claim that our reform efforts would ensure illegal immigrants this too is false the reforms the reforms I'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally and one more misunderstanding I want to clear up under our plan no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions and federal conscience laws will remain in place that was one of the ugliest moments I think we've seen in politics in a long long time if ever Republican Joe Wilson of South Carolina calling the president a liar on national television he did put out a statement tonight saying he apologized he also called chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and apologized but I have to think that that's in his heart it was an honest reaction all of these congressional members had a copy of this President's speech tonight they were ready for that Maxine Waters joins us tonight congresswoman thanks for your time delighted to be here are you satisfied did the president do what you wanted him to do did he go far enough president hit home run he was forceful he was Barack Obama the educator he laid out the facts he talked directly to the senior citizens and to try and help allay their fears about the lies that had been told to them about death panels he confronted it head on and he laid out what it was what the bill is and what it is not he did a great job and he talked about this this business of a government takeover he dealt with that and he dealt with the cost and that people know that it would not be deficit spending he did a complete and thorough and forceful job he covered all bases covered all bases it seemed to me congresswoman waters that he set the table for a public option to be passed in the house I think so I mean what do you think the Blue Dog response to this is going to be you know I don't know but he made a special appeal to them as he talked to the progressives also and I think they're going to have a hard time just ignoring the president they don't have a good reason for not wanting competition why would they not want competition what is wrong with competition special interest they got a wake-up call tonight yes I'm special and I mean that now it's really it's either gonna go one way or the other it's not going to say the same it's either going to get nastier and a lot tougher or the president's going to get some things that he wants and he's going to get some people working with him which way do you think it's going to go I don't know but the fact that he showed that he's willing to get tough yeah I think Maybach some people down I think some people were taking you for granted might motivate some folks till I think so so I think we're going to get it okay where do you think the progressive movement is going to be I mean you're you know our progressive caucus yes would you go back to your constituents and say we're not going to get everything but we're going to get a lot and he went far enough tonight would that be your message but I'm going to go back and say is the president made a commitment to public option he said I'm going to stand up for public option he said I'm also going to leave the door open I will entertain others who want to come talk to me who may have good ideas and so what he did was he said my preference is this is what i'd like to do but he also said I'm not closing off any ideas I want to hear them I don't think there's anything better than public option when you talk about trigger that's just about played itself out when you talk about coops that's nobody can tell you what a co-op is they can't adequately describe what it would do you can have to go public ops yeah because if you're going to force have a bill that says pre-existing conditions right there's not an insurance company on the face of the earth that's going to go along with that that's right I'm by overplaying that I mean what I'm waiting for the press release from the insurance companies to say hey we love this bit about pre-existing conditions being gone we can't wait to get into that market it didn't going to happen it's not going to happen and if we don't have cost containment they're going to charge the premiums are going to go up there going to say oh these pre-existing conditions we have to pay a lot more money to cover all those sick people with cancer and all of these diseases so I mean if we don't have public option to keep the cost down people can forget it they won't be able to afford it well let's see what's just a reminder now the Republicans were against the stimulus package they didn't want to help the bailout they fought the wall street thing they've been against everything this president's wanted to do they're not going to support health care reform either yeah even when the market went to 10,000 that wasn't good enough for him oh there there obstructionists yes you expect them to be that way through absolutely I don't expect them to come around at all it okay so tonight we're solidifying the base and forward that's right congresswoman thanks your time so welcome Thank You Maxine Waters with us here on a special issue the edge show tonight

game by those rules we got to the 290 and so now we should have had a boat three weeks ago on a Thursday on a Tuesday it was set for a hearing by the committee and Essence took it off of the calendar brought it to the committee and if you listen to if you listen to the you know the the testimony that was given there was a lot of self-serving comments that were made on the record to make it sound like everybody was in support of fixing this but in in reality they weren't bashful and identifying that what they did is they took this vote in order to take it off the calendar so that it would not be voted very frustrating and very frustrating in the fact that in 20 years we've been having been able to get a hearing uh and so this this hearing could have happened two years ago it could have happened two months ago uh instead it happened uh three weeks ago or so in order to kill this bill from moving forward uh talk a little bit about what that legislative process is and the frustrations of trying to to move a piece of legislation that clearly has the recognition that something's wrong with the 305 co-sponsors on it tell you in bipartisan show you that there's a serious problem here but in reality we're not we're not getting it done because of because of what so Pat you're you're exactly right that this has sort of been a cat and mouse game we get the 290 co-sponsors they come in and try and stop the clock on as we get to within days of this bill being called for a vote on the house floor they then circumvent the process and go bring it up in a committee where they killed the bill the the I want to I want to stop there for just a minute because during the committee discussion on the bill as they're sitting there saying oh we you know we can't do this um what they were saying is that it was going to cause because bankruptcy of the social security system and that it was going to take revenues from people effectively that didn't deserve it and and give funds you know back to the to the people who've been victimized by windfall elimination government pension offset what they failed to mention was that this is your money you have paid into the system and you just explained how this disadvantages or adversely affects people but look I'll give you another example of that Pat let's say that you and I both decided that we were going to be security guards we were going to be private security guards in 20 years of our life you and I work side by side we made the exact same amount of money we paid the exact same into Social Security and then I decided at that point you know what I'm gonna stop working um I'm gonna stop working you went on to be 10 years as a sheriff's deputy 10 more years as a sheriff's deputy so so keep in mind you and I paid exact same amount of money in the social security for the exact same time exact same salary whenever we go to retire I'm going to make up numbers here just for for a Give an example let's say that my social security benefits are 1200 a month yours may be 800 maybe 700. even though we work the same period of time we paid the same amount of money that is defunding police that is that is discriminating against law enforcement and teachers and firefighters and other people that are underpaid that are overworked and sacrificed much and so it's wrong so where we are now as we continue to play this cat and mouse game he said okay you're going to do that we're going to file a discharge petition we're going to use another provision in the rules that forces this bill for a vote under a discharge petition if you get 218 people to sign the discharge petition I'll Pete for the third time we have 305 co-sponsors if we get 218 people to sign our discharge petition this bill is forced for a vote before the House of Representatives so that's one path we're doing and we're not going to stop we're not going to back down we're going to keep trying to run up those signatures but there is a parallel path that's going on after the committee voted the bill down Congressman Rodney Davis congresswoman Julia ledlow myself and others we got together at a press conference we called out the people who killed that bill in committee and we reminded him it is your money it is not their money it is your money and as a result they came out in the press and said both the chair and the ranking member of the tax writing committee came out and said that they are committed to coming up with a solution by the end of the year so we are while we're working that discharge petition process and trying to force this to a vote we're also trying to hold them accountable to their own commitment to get something done by the end of the year and of course we have a few must past bills that this fix could be attached to and ultimately give you and so many others the relief that they deserve

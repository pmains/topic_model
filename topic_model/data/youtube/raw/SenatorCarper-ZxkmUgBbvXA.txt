mr. Harper some of us wanted to hear those other questions but I'll go away Thanks our thanks to all of you for joining us today my thanks to our chair and that's why ranking member for pulling this together it wasn't how many years ago I think was 2016 that the Chairman and I worked with Department of Homeland Security and and stakeholders on a bill to address violent extremism and our legislation we're doing a number of things that were created in office for partnerships against violent extremism as mr. Salim will recall within the Department of Homeland Security and building on mr. Slim's work in the Obama administration our bill would have established an office reporting directly to the secretary to lead the government's efforts to counter violent extremism and further I bill would have put in place important accountability measures to protect civil rights and civil liberties and ensure congressional oversight of administration efforts to counter violent domestic terrorism that bill passed out of this committee I think was on a voice vote but with it would pass without opposition as I recall over two years ago there's not taken up by the full Senate since then the current administration has rescinded grants administered by that office cut its budget renamed it not once but twice and created additional reports between the director and the secretary I would just ask mr. slim could could you just share with us today some of your thoughts please on the need for congressional oversight of administration and efforts to counter domestic terror and violent extremism and the second half of my question would be do you think that statutory authorization including strong reporting requirements such as were required in our bill are a good first step Senator Carper thank you for your question and and I'm grateful for the opportunity to having appeared before both both you and chairman Johnson before on this specific issue and I appreciate the diligence and the sincerity to which you and other members of this committee have given this over the years so thank you for your question I think it reflects some of the history that you and this committee have brought to the issue specifically to initial points to start to answer your question it's important to point out as a number of members of this committee have noted already data drives policy and it's so important when we're making policy and the homeland security in the national security space to have the data that drives and and depicts the accurate threat or risk that we as a country face one of the pieces of legislation that's pending right now that would support achieving a clearer picture is the data act that I think is pending before both the house and soon to be the Senate this is a key piece of legislation that I think can fill some of the critical gaps and I would urge this committee to help there several data acts over even in recent years you recall it the prime sponsors in the Senate I put that in my write in response if that's true I have it here in my notes but I don't want to waste too much of your time the the second thing to address your question specifically is a pending piece of legislation currently titled the domestic terrorism Prevention Act this does again what what a number of members of this committee have noted in terms of codifying into law the resources tailored to the threat picture today as this committee attempted to do several years ago and is it is interested in engaging on again today having an accurate picture to make data-driven policy and programmatic decisions coupled with statutory appropriations and authorizations of offices that have required reporting on an annualized basis can help give this committee in this Congress a better sense of where these trends are going year in and year out and where where resources can be more accurately applied I think so thanks very much I miss ran up a question for you if I could tragically in in recent years we've seen increases in targeted violence especially gun violence perpetrated in in our country in horrific instances we've seen domestic terrorist attacks against minorities they've occurred against people of color in Charleston South Carolina against immigrants in El Paso Texas last month and against their religious groups in places of worship such as mosques all around our country and in synagogues and any number of places from Poway California to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania I would ask mister but you you lay out your extensive data graphs in your testimony highlighting the rise of domestic terrorism in the United States looking back I think as far as the 1970s and we've seen these attacks surge in just the last couple of years could you just highlight for us where you believe to be the main reasons for the most recent spike in domestic terrorism in this country main reasons for the most recent spike in domestic terrorism in this country thank you senator carper we should note that domestic terrorism is a persistent threat in the United States so it is there's been an uptick in recent years but it is not like it came out of nowhere there's a very large population of individuals who have espoused violence to advance a political agenda in the United States and that is more of an enduring fact than it than a recent trend in recent years we have seen an uptick in violence emerging from those extremist movements and I think there are probably a host of reasons we're talking about political violence and political violence and politics are interrelated that's uncomfortable and true there have been so there appears to be an emboldened movement in the United States over the last several years and we see things like targeting preferences shift according to political rhetoric so the anti-immigrant verbage or political rhetoric has is reflected in anti-immigrant targeting we also see social media or online platforms that enable the most virulent of these individuals to find each other online and to exacerbate one another's tendencies researchers might call this the gamification of violence where one individual seeks to one-up another that he or she has never met but tries to get a higher body-count in their next violent attack this kind of deviant behavior facilitated online and you know allows individuals to groupthink themselves into greater and greater levels of violence the you are correct in your in your question when you referenced firearms the availability of firearms although that's not new is interrelated with the the level of violence and we see in the United States by far firearms are involved in the most lethal terrorist attacks or are the most lethal terrorist attacks involve firearms thank you for I got an excellent answer to a pretty good question thank you

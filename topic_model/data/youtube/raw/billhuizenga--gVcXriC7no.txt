i would just like a general sense because given the contentious atmosphere in congress right now i voted republican voter view but i'm not proud of republicans i'm not part of democrats the nation is burning yeah they're digging around and people are getting very upset with us can you give us any hope this afternoon that we can move forward and actually solve some problems in congress yeah and we'll talk yes is there hope um and i'll read that i'll read the email email i got from eric cantor literally half an hour ago um where he was talking about biden group conversations and um and i want to touch you again on sort of four divides that i see so i want to say i want to set the table because i think this is a very important this is a very important issue and we've got some frustrated people down here just think it's going to be you know rhetoric or whatever and i am definitely trying to move beyond uh just that so yes ma'am i know i'm pat meyer and i've been working with john and we voted for you um and thank you for coming i was going to your office to propose how to help social security i worked with thousands of people and there's a lot of people that worked on it and they have the real accurate thing there's so many people about social security are told many things if it was rated if it wasn't when medicare stopped so i'm waiting on you to look at that bill because i'd be proud of the camera or colin michigan so it is here and many people want some information and it's real good all right thank you very much thank you appreciate it and we have a question back there sorry i'm making the house no that's all right thank you for sharing easter from holland and one comment one question my comment is that many of us don't feel any confidence in washington and i would just like to see a one-year moratorium on spending i don't care how you get the rest of the money for doing anything but spending should be stopped for you just to prove that you could do something otherwise it just keeps keeps keeps going the question i have is what is our business in libya what is the strategic importance of the country why don't we pay attention to where our friends are in the middle east and promote you know not brotherhood but some real democratic movements all right okay thank you and we'll get to digging here for a second because i've got i've got the kucinich resolution here that uh that i want to read it's very short so we can we can we can tackle that a second as well john uh our president has 32 stars and with an average uh about average pay of about 151 000 um are they having any influence on what legislation is passed the short answer to that is yes they do i mean they're driving a lot of uh whether it's consumer financial protection bureau or others right they're in the deck hello i have a question about the teachers um my granddaughter said just the other day mom my two very best teachers were paint slipped and i was a teacher all my life but i couldn't go back to teaching not the kind of paperwork that my daughter has to do on every student a couple years ago she had 13 special needs students in her class besides the others and its reports reports reports you said wouldn't i give you a time to teach and um i just feel we have a bad feeling about teachers because of the unions but there are so many of them who are just working their heads off trying to do the best for the students and love them nearly all of them but i just think we have to take a new look at the teachers and the new teachers as well yes ma'am i am very concerned about the proposed cuts to safety net and poverty focus these cuts are foreign and i think they will backfire that's my comment now i have a question i think there's an area where maybe we can work together the area of tax expenditures most tax expenditures go to the middle class in the upper class they are in this in essence kind of hidden spending and i think we really need to look at those get them out of the tax code make them more exclusive so that they get the scrutiny that they deserve thank you all right appreciate that okay i hear hear a lot of concern for various aspects in our federal government i heard something really regret directly anyway the country's on fire and i think economically and many other ways spiritually and so on we are our house is burning and i also hear a lot of concern about what you talk about gas prices uh health care prices and so on and all these things are very valid and a very real concern but i think they are they are symptoms of underlying problems and that's that's like our country and many other civilizations for a long time and that is whenever you got a uh a banking system that will be boxed the currency and put it up on thin air then an unscrupulous government of issues like that very much because that gives them money to go out to their constituencies so they can get re-elected and that's their some of them as a primary concern because my question is what is your what is your position on on doing something about this uh the federal reserve for instance or some are saying that that is the curse on our country and i would agree with that and also then the national debt are we going to do something about this we're going to just talk about it are we going to are we taking the position that we're going to put we're not going to vote for that increase i would support that very much because nothing else is going to get their attention there's going to be a lot of talk and nothing else it will just be extended one more time i believe it's been extended what 50 60 times in the last 60 years it just keeps on going yeah all right well we've got yeah last kind of live lesson let's hit this last one and then uh because i uh and i understand uh last time we had a little show up we were supposed to be 45 minutes we ended up going an hour and 15 minutes i was a little late for my uh uh for my luncheon that i spoke at uh up in the scheme so we've got about an hour today as well and i hope you'll understand i'm gone a fair amount so i'm trying to get back home to make sure that my daughter gets to ballet and we've got some family things that are happening and so hopefully we'll make sure we'll keep doing this we'll keep we'll keep coming back go ahead right okay if assuming you work your way

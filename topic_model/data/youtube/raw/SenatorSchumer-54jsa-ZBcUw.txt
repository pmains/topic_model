As soon as Donald Trump took office,
he set about sabotaging Gateway by halting all administrative approvals on completely bogus grounds. He said he wouldn't
even negotiate on Gateway until there was money to build his wall. He shut down the government for weeks when he invited me into the Oval Office
to try and force an agreement to build the wall
and then maybe Gateway. I had a few choice Brooklyn words for him. No ing way, Mr. President. What I couldn't have anticipated then
is that the person who would replace Trump would happen to be the best pastor
of all person anywhere. To move Gateway forward. Mr. Amtrak himself, Joe Biden, who was able to transform the cruel
illusion of Trump's so-called infrastructure week after week after week into an infrastructure decade
that will be funded by the amazing $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure investment and Jobs
Act that we passed into law. And we're going to build
this infrastructure decade where our union folks
with tens of thousands of new good paying union jobs, all millions all paid. We love you. As majority leader,
I made sure that the bipartisan infrastructure law included
formulas and allocations that will provide ample
funding for Gateway. Thanks to this historic 292
million investment led by the President,
passed by my Senate and House colleagues. Gateway is finally leaving the station.

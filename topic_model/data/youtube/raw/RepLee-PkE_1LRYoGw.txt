rly of California thank you for being with us congresswoman good morning Ravenel glad to be with you but now when the president says this first of all a personal attack on a federal judge this so-called judge how do you respond to that out mean this seems to be a little over the line who you know a sitting president attacking of federal judge as a so-called judge let's start there it's outrageous first of all another bit of evidence that this president does not either understand or respect the three branches of government in this democracy and when you denigrate and dismiss the judiciary a judge and a judge that President George Bush nominated for the best come on this is another clear indication that something is very very wrong with this administration terms of how they are attempting to undermine our democracy here in our form of government it's dangerous it's serious and people need to continue to protest and raise their voices and put that Street on this administration because we're at a very dud I think a defining moment in our country now when we see the street heat and the continued demonstrations from various constituencies on various issues but really coming together questioning this one of the things that has become a serious concern is now his nomination for the Supreme Court and in light of the fact that this nomination is to really supersede denomination that President Barack Obama had given a year ago this month when Justice Scalia passed now many including me have said we can't just walk past the fact that they in many ways have all went around what is procedure normal traditional whatever term you want to use and denied even a hearing to judge garland who was the nominee of President Obama and are we going to proceed here and really establish now his star pattern congresswoman where parties are allowed to just ignore the side by side step a nomination of a sitting president if it's if it's a president that they don't like going to agree with or not of their party what is the historic precedent here and in light of that how do you and other members of Congress go forward on dealing with the nomination of Donald Trump without dealing with that there's there's no president forever now first of all senator Mitch McConnell and and the Republicans in the Senate they really does still be seated it's a stolen seat and so we have to remember that as we move forward secondly when you look at that this nominees record you know and Donald Trump's criteria there it's very dangerous when you look at some of his decisions especially as it relates to Roe versus Wade the litmus test I in terms of women's active healthcare and so as the Senate moves forward you know we're going to be raising our voices especially from the Congressional Black Caucus in terms of how this nominee would you know at least judge in terms of the criteria as it relates to fairness and justice but also remembering that you know we have to play by the same rules and they're not playing by the same rules and it was really outrageous it was ridiculous it was unfair that at least judge garland did not get a hearing it was disgusting really when you look at how the Republicans treated judge Garland and the Obama administration and i would say that we need to really look at the rules and how they change the rules and understand what we have to do to okay what you're carrying to do when you say look at the rules what can you do can there be a showdown by the Democrats in the Senate and the Congress saying wait a minute you change the rules the block garland now what are going to be the rules here we're going to play by the same rules here the block Gossage all we're going to all agree that you robbed it last time you were wrong and this is going to be the president I mean can we call for this could be a showdown and define what is going to be the procedure from now on absolutely i think members of the Senate can do that they can also filibuster I mean there and they have to gain this out how they want to do it but as a member of the house I would suggest that first you know we have to just say we've got to play by the same rules if those were your rules why aren't they are rules and really move forward on that basis river now man picked up on one appointment of the administration of Steve fan and I just want to say how dangerous it is to have as Nancy Pelosi described him as a white supremacist in on the National Security Council Prince of Congress of the Progressive Caucus black Hispanic and Asian Pacific caucus we sent a letter to president Trump and said that he should be removed from the National Security Council but also he should be removed from the White House his fingerprints are all over foreign policy issues now and especially as it relates to the the Muslim ban that has been thank goodness you know suspended and so I think we need to look at the dangerous nominees that he's placing forward in terms of what it means to our country also here we are now looking at a possible confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions next week during Lackey this is Black History Month someone who has sit on the wrong side of civil and human rights and so I hope that the public boolean wrote as the nature and voting right no not a word voting rights human rights I'm ready to haul that also about Steve benen because twice in Nancy Pelosi the minority leader of the house twice in her statement she referred to Bannon as a white supremist twice and and I thought that that was very very very telling of the attitude of many of his record and to have them on the NCS is national security at NSC Oh correcting myself is something that is alarming at bet so I'm glad you went there what can be done in the Congress to really try and force the President to at least remove them from there if you can't be removed from the White House other than a bully pulpit right now we are actually looking at legal ways to approach this in terms of the research we're doing to see if we can find a mechanism to remove him if President Trump not remove him right now at the public pressure and the street eat the marches and the protests will help and the more we expose this man and who he is as a white supremacist his background Breitbart news and you know many of the terrible dangerous statements that he's made and to see those statements now and his views reflected in our foreign policy dangerous it's wrong as serious and we have to fight every way we can to make sure that he is removed from the NSC and also from from the White House so we're in the process now trying to determine if we have some legal mechanisms to really remove him if the president won't what is the danger if I'm sitting at home this morning sipping my coffee before doing whatever I do on Sunday explain to me congresswoman the danger of having someone with the radical thoughts and radical expressions of Steve banning on the NSC look at the chaos for example that the Muslim ban has created two people who should be able to enter into our country to refugees people who've been vetted look at the this but it really Krypton shows as relates to our international standing in the world when you have someone there who has made statements that is at time Willem for example then these views are reflected in an executive order come on this is dangerous this is serious and he's made statements and has believes other you know think about other people and it's a very serious moment when you have a white supremacist of white nationalist making influence in the direction of our foreign policy the immediate situation as it relates to the ban is a clear example of the confusion and the disregard for the Constitution and for the humanitarian concerns are my concerns of the country where country built on immigrants and he just has no clue in terms of executing or putting forth his views you know on this religious band which is what it is well thank you for joining us this one and congresswoman barbara Lee

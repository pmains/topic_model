this and other amendments challenging metal in the fossil fuel research I would oppose I would oppose because not always providing us that the doorway the pathway for energy independence in the past it's been funded by over seven hundred million dollars in this administration in the last four or five years has seen that rogue down and thanks to the appropriators they've been putting that number back up again to what's more appropriate but it's a big difference so we've already made a cut from seven hundred million dollars down to five hundred and ninety some billion dollars we're talking about a huge cut that's already occurred well we have to understand mr. chairman is at this this facility that all across it just in the sponsor of this amendment in Tennessee there are 24 projects there 27 million dollars being spent in his state to be able to take care of 300 jobs you're at risk on this but more importantly is that what they're doing in this facility at all these across the country in these research laboratories we're trying to find ways for us to have for example carbon capture if we truly want to reach us reducing this carbon footprint we need to spend it through the Department of Energy in their laboratories and they're they're doing a chemical looping one of the largest projects in this country has been done it with metal they're trying to develop ways of reducing our carbon footprint by energy efficient hi turbines for boilers to make coal energy from our coal natural gas and steam trying to find ways to improve it these are things that their metal is is working with they're trying to find ways of fracking the gas so that we get more gas out of the ground that we're getting right now instead of fifteen or twenty percent to get twenty-five or thirty percent so it's nettle has a terrific track record we have some the best scientists and physicists in the country working to try to make energy efficient and we've already cut their budget by over a hundred million dollars in the last few years this is not a time mr. mr. chairman to be cutting their budget and channel even further if we're going to reach us I want them to be able to reach internally to do the things that will give us energy independence so it's not a time to poke an eye at these hard-working people and what they've done this is a time to continue the funding continue this if we're going to get energy independence this is a way to do it so again I would ask that the group reject this amendment and any other that further erodes the power of Dettol to do with job thank you are gentlemen Tennessee has 30 seconds well 30 seconds i was going to yield but i'm not i'm just

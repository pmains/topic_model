everyone and thank you for tuning in i'm congresswoman lori trahan and i'm so grateful to be joined today by an incredible panel for a discussion that is so critically important for us to have in our communities and it's about domestic violence you know as you know or as you may know uh october is domestic violence awareness month which provides us with an unbelievable opportunity to elevate this issue unfortunately too many may not realize just how prevalent a problem this is in almost every community both here in massachusetts and across our country you know more than 10 million women and men are physically abused by a spouse or an intimate partner in our country each year that equates to an average of almost 20 people per minute that who are victimized by domestic violence one in four women and one in nine men experience a form of domestic violence including severe intimate partner physical violence sexual violence or stalking that can cause physical injury post-traumatic stress disorder use of victim services and so much more also domestic violence can be fatal in fact nearly one in every five cases of domestic violence includes a weapon of some sort and when a gun is present the risk of homicide increases by 500 percent i want to be clear on this domestic violence has been an epidemic in our country for a very long time and with necessary restrictions to slow the spread of covid19 uh over the past seven months it's only getting worse the national domestic violence hotline has seen nearly a ten percent increase in calls and many contexts have reported that covid19 has impacted their situation preventing domestic violence and providing resources and relief to victims of dv requires strong partnerships and a unified commitment across all levels of government and private organizations including the ones we have represented here today the center for hope and healing alternative house and the live for live foundation it's no secret right now the federal government is failing to do its part in this partnership the violence against women act of 1994 also known as vawa ushered in transformative progress by calling for the protection of all americans from violence and abuse while also working to ensure that survivors had access to life-saving services and of course justice for the crimes committed against them congress has updated and reauthorized vawa four times since its passage more than 25 years ago but it expired early last year despite our best efforts in the house to extend the vital protections in this legislation last april i voted to pass an updated version of vawa that authorized a billion dollars in federal funding over the next five years for services for victims and programs and also contained long overdue updates to this legislation including better services for victims of domestic violence dating violence sexual assault and stalking and for the first time we included language in the le in the legislation that's specifically designed to help young and lgbtq victims of violence we expanded housing protections for survivors who are doing everything that they can to escape an abusive household but who may have nowhere else to turn and we also included provisions to close the boyfriend loophole this long overdue provision prevents those convicted of abuse or stalking from buying firearms make no mistakes this provision will save lives the legislation passed the house with strong bipartisan support but the senate has refused to take it up at least in part because the gun lobby opposes closing the boyfriend loophole as frustrating as this is we've managed to continue funding vawa programs through the budget process that way we can at least continue providing these critical services under the now expired version of the legislation but this is just a band-aid approach to a very serious problem and getting an updated version of vawa signed into law remains a top priority in the meantime i wanted to hold this facebook live conversation because it's so important that viewers tuning in especially those who know someone who is a victim of tv or is perhaps a victim him or herself are aware of the resources that are available in our community it's why i'm so glad to be joined by three truly outstanding guests who have committed themselves to providing these critical services to victims and potential victims of domestic violence so if you tuned in to some of our facebook live discussions before you may recognize our first guest the great issa waldo georges isa has been the

guests uh erin casey who currently serves as the coordinator of community engagement and survivor services for alternative house which is a lowell-based non-profit seeking to put an end to domestic violence by offering domestic violence victims and their children access to shelter support children's programming legal housing and community advocacy she's a graduate of framingham state university erin conducts research to the excuse me outreach to the community and coordinates staff training and provides direct support to our dv survivors welcome erin thank you for having me and i just quickly want to express admiration for all of you in this position in the last year i've really been able to bear witness to how you all show up for your community and specifically for survivors and i've learned so much so thank you for having me you bet you bet we're we're so grateful for all you and everyone at alternative house does for our for our community uh and last but certainly not least our final guest is jody marchand uh a survivor of domestic and gun violence jody has spent the last decade uh raising awareness and speaking out against all forms of domestic violence she co-founded the live for live foundation after her own daughter olivia's life was tragically taken at the hands of her own father jody's mission and the mission of her foundation is to educate raise awareness and offer help and support to victims of domestic abuse and violence you know my family has run in her annual run to help build awareness but i think most importantly jody has shown enormous courage an unending dedication to the fight against domestic and gun violence as exhibited through her foundation her fundraising and her willingness to speak publicly about her own experience so i'm so grateful that you could be part of this afternoon's discussion it's great to see you again jody oh thank you i i'm so grateful to be part of it it's just so important to you know talk about what goes on in our society each and every day so i thought maybe before we kick it off uh you know i um i remember the first time jody i heard uh your story um and you know for those of our viewers who might not know um i'm uh you know it's it's it provides so much um you know information on what folks can do um so if you wouldn't mind just starting with uh your story how it's impacted you and what live for live uh is all about um well if can cut me off when i when you're ready because i that story could be on forever but basically um i met someone i was 19 years old um he was 28 he swept me off my feet because you know all of a sudden at 19 i'm going out to dinner to those fancy places and um you know meeting all those fun friends and um and and but you next thing you know it just it started with emotional abuse uh control power that's what we say there's so many signs so i you know when i speak to i speak to some kids at the western academy talk about you know being uh when your boyfriend or girlfriend is texting you you know 20 times in 20 minutes uh where are you where are you going what are you doing are you with you know it's control and so for years that's what i put up without i you know you're only allowed to do so much uh shopping meant you know buying something and putting it hiding it and taking the tag off and so what it boiled down to is he knew he was losing control after you know 30 years and um and i got home one night and he started yelling at me and choking me which is one of the you know final steps and the next thing you know my daughter walked in and i said we gotta get out of here uh and we went upstairs and i was changing on my pajamas biggest regret ever came up with a gun a glock and uh shot my daughter and killed her and i turned to go towards her and i was shot in the head and the bullet entered my left temple shattering my jaw and now sits in my right shoulder so i say he got the last he got the last bit of control i i forever live with the loss of my child um and pain in my jaw that's unbearable but you know so after it happened little by little i've been out there because i think i try so hard to get into schools i was 19. um but i feel it's important to talk about it and live for live is currently raising money so that we can someday help you know women number one by helping them with maybe first last one security deposit so they can get out of a bad situation because that's kind of where i was afraid and and also hopefully soon have some sort of transitional housing so that we may be able to train them for a job or very often they have a job and they need that money to get into a place and that's what our role is yeah oh thank you and thank you for for sharing uh your story you know as a mom it's heartbreaking to hear it um but it is so important because when you talk about the control preceding uh you know the the the violence i think it's really important that like young people understand those those signs uh even when they're in just a what might seem like a casual relationship and i i know that hearing you know your story it's it's just all too familiar to those who have you know lost a loved one to domestic violence so one i i know i speak for for so many when i say how grateful we are um that you share your story but i also think it's incredibly important that we give folks who are tuning in the opportunity to hear about the different forms of domestic violence and abuse and how they can spot those signs so i am going to just turn it over to each of you since you're the experts uh and just talk a little bit about that and maybe what sort services your organizations um offer to assist uh victims and their loved ones and so isa maybe uh you go first in this uh thank you congresswoman this is an important such an important discussion um and jody as always thank you again uh for your gift uh of your daughter and sharing your personal story inspiring and motivating thank you um the center for hope and healing has been added in lowell for over 40 years right trying to eradicate sexual violence um and support our community you know i do want to say in terms of power and control that is one thing that sexual assault and domestic violence share in common sometimes when people think about sexual assault they think about sex um when the reality is it has very little of nothing to do with sex it really is about dehumanization power and control it happens more often than not unfortunately in relationships where people are known to one another where the perpetrator is known so it's an intimate relationship a dating relationship a partner a spouse um so that's important to know and the other thing to know about chh is that oh before i even go there congresswoman thank you keep at it we need vawa we need all the protections that you're wanting to include in the next uh bill it is so so important yeah that's very much because what we're finding right now and how folks are describing our challenges are that they're describing it as a pandemic within a pandemic absolutely i've heard that right but describe to our viewers what that means you know i think that means that existing challenges existing inequities existing you know things that social determinants of health tell us the challenges poverty homelessness joblessness are double down for survivors right now and they find themselves in a situ in a catch 22. i can't leave i don't have a job and i'm maybe forced to stay with someone who was abusive or be homeless and that is even not safe right now given cobit 19 so we're getting calls on a daily basis for housing for food for shelter it's really really challenging in a community like lowell specifically that really is struggling with the impact of coronavirus and so i don't know aaron if that's what you all are seeing as well i want to make some space for you and i'm i'm over here just nodding away because everything you're saying is just so exactly what we're experiencing here with working with survivors and as jody was talking about um the hopes for live for live and offering those uh security deposits we see that it on average seven attempts for someone to successfully leave an abusive relationship and so much of that is tied into financial abuse and not necessarily having control over your own money and assets and in this time of uncertainty and with fear of covet as well that's another factor that can deter someone from seeking shelter that fear of um contracting the virus and potentially putting your children at risk um so yeah and also with the way that we are adjusting and um daily life and um how a lot of court processes are being um done remotely it also leaves a lot of questions when it comes to emergency restraining orders there are survivors that call us and just don't know what move to take and so that's a service we provide to work 24 7 crisis hotline legal advocacy i'm just walking you through the steps and um just letting you know that there's options for you and that's definitely part of our work is if we're not able to provide that housing or food assistance we are going to refer you to some place that can this work is so collaborative yeah yeah and so um ac you were going to uh tell us a little bit about um center for hope and healing and you know sort of how you uh um maybe get uh referrals how you sort of intervene what kind of services those are i think there are probably so many folks who don't know where to go like you said uh you know right now there is a pandemic within a pandemic and so you can just imagine how overwhelmed uh you know victims of domestic violence are feeling uh right now just like that they they can't even get out from underneath and they're putting their own uh problems you know you know second to maybe protecting their children or uh you know staying in a in a in a home and so um i guess my question is two part one i want to come back to issa so that you can kind of tell us about center for hope and healing or tell our viewers about center for hope and healing and then also give some uh guidance uh to folks on you know what they can do what what's that first next step uh that they can do that will help put them on a path to you know a healthy um uh you know a healthy path sure um thank you so the center for hope and healing you know really is a comprehensive organization that's grounded in social justice that is a multicultural organization our staff speak multiple languages represent the various communities that exist in lowell which is so important because many of the folks who come to us right their first language is in english their first culture is not this culture their birthplace is they were you know it's not here so in terms of understanding and navigating systems so much of what we do is advocacy we do one-on-one counseling we do support groups um we do web-based services we have a web-based chat right now we do 24 7 hotline so all of those are core components folks can reach us anytime and soon we're so excited to be launching a new out mobile outreach program we'll be doing a van that actually is going out into it's going to be going out into communities reaching people where they are because isolation is such a real and dangerous thing um so that's a piece of what we do we also do lgb q and t youth work and support and we have a men and boys engaging men in boys program because we know not all men are abusers but men are an important part of the solution to be role models and to be leaders right in healthy masculinity so that's a piece of what we do in terms of prevention and intervention and where to start the first thing i want to say to anyone struggling with violence or a loved one is to really start with breaking the isolation and experience of violence is the most isolating thing you can experience if you think well this is me i'm crazy i'm bad i've done something wrong this is only happening to me so you can imagine pandemic within a pandemic right so now i'm thinking that and i can't go out and tell anyone i can't go up and really even get help so there's so many things you could do for friends and family and loved ones drive by drop off some food you cooked call someone on the phone and check in have a zoom chat is a time for all of us as community members providers loved ones to send a strong message to survivors we see you and we're still here for you we haven't forgotten you such important reminders uh jody i saw your head nodding uh that that entire time aziza was talking uh what do you want to share on that well um i mean everything she's stating it's just it's so mind-blowing to me that it goes on the number of people it goes with um i will say i i was just with someone uh recently going through who had went through a bad situation she got out and she's with her parents and um she wanted help because she had a restraining order or she had to extend it i believe so i talked to someone at alternative house because yes i can help someone that's in a current situation but my husband killed himself so i didn't have to go through a restraining order and and and all the um all the steps that need to be taken so fortunately there are resources out there um and and thank goodness for that yeah because you know think how part of the fear is trying to get to court and um and how do you do it when someone's home with coronavirus and also um you know i think very often someone doesn't believe if they're in it they don't see it as issa said you know you think you're crazy they make you feel like that and that's why uh talking about it is so important and when i speak i always say it could be it's you or your family member or your best friend and these are the signs it's not just hitting and but look what happens when the person knows that they are losing control they they're not going to have it yeah yeah and so um you know one of the things aaron though i think the i've known alternative house for a long long time in fact uh when i was a staffer for the congressional office before i became the representative uh we we shared space uh we'll share the floor uh with alternative house and uh and then you know i was just uh meeting uh with kathy kelly and the chief of police and so you know it's clear that um there is a tight relationship uh when you know there are uh 9-1-1 calls and you know there's a um you know an episode of domestic violence that alternative house has long worked with the police department to get the support uh and the services that you know victims need uh because i think as we're all in our homes right as we're all sort of retreating into those walls whether it's remote learning or there's a lot that happens in those walls that aren't healthy for you know families and they relied on school and work to kind of get out um and so i guess one of the things that i want um you know issa gave some great examples of like what can you do to sort of penetrate those walls you can drop by uh if you you know you can drop by your neighbors you can do a zoom call you can check in and uh especially if you're worried about a friend or neighbor maybe speak to some of the ways you've been able to intervene i know sometimes it's reactive but i'm sure it's proactive in other in other ways as well yeah and also circling back to guidance on where to even start at alternative alternative house as advocates we recognize that when someone calls our hotline it may be the first time they ever are sharing their story and experience and considering the stigma of domestic violence we understand the power of just empathically listening and validating someone's experience and from there another service we provide through our hotline is safety planning and this is something we can also do with concerned family and friends it's a way to work with that person and understand what's working for them in harm reduction what's working with them to keep them safe and really empowering them that they have the tools and that we are here to support them from behind and offer guidance and referrals um and just understanding um you know the just the power and the strength it takes to ask for help and to be vulnerable about your situation um so also with our hotline um we're also here to listen for emotional support you don't have to call with the intention of um needing to take legal action or a step sometimes you just need someone to hear you out and we're here to just be someone to listen to oh that's that's great and you know i do see so much much collaboration between organizations you know uh when i um i guess the last time jody i saw you you were with uh mom's demand action and uh and you know you were talking about the importance of ending gun violence and you were telling your your story there um uh and then there's obviously covid19 has like just changed i'm sure you've had to change your methods of outreach uh to reach all those co you know community by community culture by culture you know get uh make sure folks know that help is help is there i wonder if you could just speak a little bit to uh what folks can do i mean this is what kind of is going through my mind we're in election season people are off the sidelines in droves it is such a great thing for all of us uh to see i think women are are in part you know leading that charge it started you know a few years ago and it's and it's continuing um but there are so many other ways that we can be helpful on a community level uh once the election is all over uh and you know people really just want um to use their activism and their energy in a place that's uh and so what do you say to folks who are you know maybe watching this uh who don't necessarily maybe necessarily aren't um a victim but they want to help uh they want to help in their community they want to help organizations like yours uh who is that is that directed to me all of you all of you i'm really bad i'm not great at the moderating part so i just will i'll just toss in a few things and actually during this time it has been an incredibly moving thing to watch the mutual aid happening in lowell to watch organizations coming together schools boys and girls club youth serving organizations all giving out food being their resources for communities jody said it earlier economic independence right is the primary factor to move folks towards safety and well-being if you don't have the resources it's going to be really nearly impossible to get out of a dangerous situation so there's plenty of organizations especially in lowell that are collaborating to needed resources to children and families you can't think about safety from violence if you're hungry or if your children are hungry or if you're going to be evicted tomorrow so those basic needs join any mutual aid group in lowell that's giving out food that is supporting children and families right now that's why i would say it's a place to start of course after voting and nationally that's that's exactly right that's exactly right what else aaron and i jody erin first definitely finding ways that you can get involved and support the work of the people that you know are on the front line in doing this work and even in a way that's even simpler than that within yourself is you being an advocate in your own life and you know speaking up against domestic violence when you witness it or even the way you contribute to rape culture or how you talk about these things how you work to end the stigma within yourself and within your circle and although it's so important to you know get involved and donate your time and resource but it's also important to within yourself there's a lot you can do um even if it feels like it's not on a large scale it's it's important um jody i'm sorry i am part of mom's demand action and um because for me um my husband was a hunter so there were guns in the house so it was not unusual and when what the gun he used though was not a hunting rifle it was a glock he had asked for it for christmas and because he hunted i didn't really think that much about it so i actually bought the gun he asked for that murdered my child so i'm telling you awareness is everything awareness of the signs of abuse um you know awareness about about gun safety you know it's it's got to get out there more and more and you know um and and can i say this when there were times i went to leave and economic was was it i would look at places that you know you know i have a child and what i needed first last month you know whatever the security deposit i didn't and then but i think if someone said here's here's this money yeah here you go if i had woken up in the next day with the relief i would have felt i would have worked three jobs and so this is one part that we can help with and and every bit helps and i they said the resources are out there thank goodness for for issa and and for alternative house you know it's what we it's got to be talked about well and and to you jody right i know i've seen you in so many uh places uh sharing your story and spreading awareness and making sure that uh people understand the signs uh and that they don't fall into um you know the traps of ever believing that it's okay that this control is actually going to lead to something good uh so you know you all deserve un i'm just unbelievable credit i don't think people realize uh you choose you all choose to commit your lives uh to helping victims um and it is just the nobility in that is uh is tremendous and so i not only want to thank you for uh spending time with me today but also you know how you spend your time is just it's it's quite admirable so thank you for doing that and um you know i want to thank everyone uh for tuning in you know i think it goes without saying that if you or someone you know is a is a victim of domestic violence or abuse uh and you think one of these incredible organizations can be of assistance you know please don't hesitate to reach out and contact them we've included links to their uh websites in the comments section so all you have to do is is click for more information um so uh finally if you've tuned into any of our conversations on facebook lately uh you've had you've heard me with my mom moment at the end of the call where you know we just impress upon you the importance of uh not thinking we've turned a corner on covet 19. now we're about to have that same small talk again right now we are seeing spikes in covet cases in communities across massachusetts uh nearly 80 cities and towns are currently characterized as red because of the high level of transmission going on and we did such a great job getting this virus under uh control earlier this year and that was due in large part uh to all of you um helping out our essential workers our courageous frontliners by doing your part and so we have to do that again we have to re-energize that effort so please continue following the guidance from our public health experts keep washing your hands frequently maintaining a safe social distance and wearing that mask we know that those simple acts work uh experts predict that flu season is going to be tough so get a flu shot all of these steps will go to ensure that our front line and our essential workers are able to do their jobs as safely as possible um and i just once again thank you for taking the time take some of the advice that we learned today uh and you know enact it in your own daily lives check in on folks check in on your neighbors and your community make sure you stay safe stay healthy and if you haven't already make sure you go out and vote thank you so much thank you thank you

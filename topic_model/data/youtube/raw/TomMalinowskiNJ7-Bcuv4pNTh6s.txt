congressman you know let's first start off with the stimulus uh do you look at it as progress or almost a waste of time um given the gap in the yawning gap between what these 10 republican senators are proposing versus what uh joe biden is asking for it's roughly about a third of the asking price with no state aid how does this at the end of the day get done we all agree it needs to get done sure so it has to get done we need to go big we need to go quickly and sure i would much prefer to do it with some republican support to do it in a bipartisan way because the american people are crying out for us in washington dc to be working together so we can move along two tracks i'm i'm glad that republicans at least some of them put forward an alternative even though it's inadequate i'm really glad that joe biden is doing the decent thing and welcoming them to the white house to talk things over to see if we can find common ground that's what he ran on that's what he ran to do but at the same time we are moving this week in the house with the legislative steps that would be required to pass joe biden's proposal in the house and in the senate um with a majority vote in both houses so we'll be ready to go either way a couple follow-up questions quickly on stimulus congressman one is republicans have been saying like mitt romney hey somebody a household making 300 grand a year shouldn't be getting a stimulus check makes sense to me i'm curious how much we're really talking about of the 1.9 trillion that that would represent and secondly i don't know of any governor including conservative governors from the register red states that don't think their states need federal aid otherwise they have to raise taxes or cut costs in a terrible way in an affordable way right now so what is the pushback from republicans on capitol hill to help out states uh so yeah they're saying that that the the two thousand dollar checks should be more targeted and i i think that's a conversation that we can absolutely have and we may be able to save a bit of money there but they also eliminate all the state and local direct aid as you said and and yeah that's totally bipartisan in the states and in in the municipalities my municipalities in in my in the seventh district in new jersey i got more republican mayors than democratic mayors they're all concerned about being able to balance their budgets without raising taxes so this is this is just an ideological uh fight that republicans in washington have picked um they uh they cut out a really excellent proposal that biden made to provide uh tax credits uh for for children uh refundable tax credits for kids which would eliminate half of child poverty in america even as it stimulates the economy so uh that's that's how they save the money they also take some of the school money away which i don't quite understand since we all want to get our kids back to school all right i want to pivot um to the bizarro world that you have to inhabit where marjory taylor green is across the aisle from me now i should mention that your old colleague denver rigelman um who was on the other side of the aisle but like you talked at length before january 6 about the real threat of q anon and some of these extremist groups he says we minimize these at our apparel january 6 was not a one-off what are republicans going to do about her i mean she has a committee ship for crying out loud with education and labor at the least will she be stripped of that what's going to happen to her and and tell people what it's like at home here to have to go to work with somebody who talks about assassinating the speaker of the house yeah uh it's it's uh not what you expect in the house of representatives of the greatest democracy in the world so you're asking me what a republican's going to do i'm not sure if i'm the best person to ask that question but it is the right question because it's up to them they get to decide who they appoint on their side to committees that they they would have to agree with us if we were for example to vote to expel her you can't do that with a partisan vote you shouldn't do that with a partisan vote it would have to be both sides so um look all i will say is we've learned in the last month what i and others were saying a long time ago that what happens online eventually happens in the real world if there is violence online if there is hate speech if there are conspiracy theories that are being spread and promoted wildly among the american people eventually people are going to act on that crazy stuff and we saw them thousands of ordinary americans laying siege to the capital of the united states wanting to hang mike pence and kill nancy pelosi that is the product of allowing this kind of craziness and hate and and lies to spread uh all of these months and unfortunately republican leadership looking the other way the other way best as as these people came to prominence in their party so they're gonna have to show us who they are uh we are going to move to get her off of that committee so that's a vote that i think they're going to have to take in relatively short order hopefully they will avoid the trouble of having to take that vote by just deciding to get her off that committee and any committee themselves adam kinzerger uh your colleague a republican seems to be about the only voice yes there were nine others who voted for impeachment along with him but who's calling out saying i don't recognize my party anymore privately do many others feel the same way but don't have the courage for fear of a primary or a trump tweet or is he really an island out there well adam is a is is a friend and he has tremendous courage and integrity and he's a republican which means like he and i like we could debate issues we wouldn't agree on them but but we respect each other for having that integrity i wish there were more than 10 who were willing to speak out uh as those 10 did on the impeachment vote i know there are certainly way more than 10 who felt the same way who agreed but they were afraid to say what was in their hearts and they they're afraid yeah they're afraid of getting challenged from the right in a primary election some of them and this is the really sad part some of them are also afraid for the safety of their families if the president of the united states or in this case a former president has started a movement in this country that makes you afraid for your safety and your life if you vote to impeach that president well that's a pretty strong argument for impeaching that president in and of itself you know what that is the best way uh put for why at this moment in history it shouldn't be as hard of choices for somebody is but anyway congressman i appreciate the time thank you same so much and don't get buried in today okay thank you stay safe

[Music] I'm Virginia Allen and this is the daily signal podcast for Friday September 23rd what kind of threat does China really pose to America and is America ready to face that threat today I am sitting down with Mississippi representative Trent Kelly to ask those very questions Congressman Kelly serves on the house armed services committee and has served our nation in the military for over three decades and so he's joining me today to talk about the relationship between America and China stay tuned for our conversation after this [Music] boating is one of our most important Civic duties because its impact reaches far and wide it is important to have trust in our electoral system that's why the Heritage Foundation created the election Integrity scorecard the scorecard Compares each State's voting rules and regulations and gives each state a ranking on their transparency and overall potential for interference and Corruption if you want to understand the nature of the election system in your state make sure you check out the election Integrity scorecard at heritage.org elections scorecard it is my pleasure today to welcome to the show Mississippi Congressman Trent Kelly Congressman thank you so much for being here well it's an honor to be here and thank you for having me it is a pleasure to have you well Congressman I I want to begin by really thanking you for your dedication to this country and specifically for your military service for 36 years you have served as the Mississippi Army National Guard as a combat engineer would you just share a little bit um about your experiences I I know that you are mobilized for Desert Storm you deployed to Iraq twice correct uh that's correct you know I think that's just important it kind of goes to the core values of most of the men and women who serve this country we don't do it for pay and for all those things we love this nation and so it's just been an opportunity for me to give back to this nation that has given so much to me so 36 years is a long time I had a full head of hair when I started this thing uh and I don't know if Soldiers made me pull it down or if some of them hard missions but it is so important and now I'm getting to the level I'm on the Strategic level as a major general where uh the policies and things that we do impact soldiers lives and so I think that's so important that we to give back not just to America as a whole but to those service members who choose to serve this great nation and currently on the house armed services committee as ranking member on subcommittee you are constantly looking at what are those threats to our nation so in your assessment what are the greatest threats to our country right now I think we have to keep our own China and both economically and agriculturally and militarily and all those things China Russia are the biggest threats there are pacing threats right now but you know I'm also on the AG committee as well as the internal Norm services and I see food security I think we really have to make sure our supply lines and we have to be a nation as a whole in government be prepared to be self-sustaining should the need require I mean our energy policy we went from an energy producer uh to now uh we're relying on others and taking down our strategic reserves is so important that we see National Security as a whole of government and all those functions uh in the military we use dime diplomacy information military and uh and economy but I think it's so important we see the national security threat as a whole yeah well and specifically in the area periods of agriculture and natural security those are are crossing paths a little bit right now in regards to China because we're seeing that China is coming to America and buying U.S Farmland what do we know about that and what's happening there yeah I mean that's a difficult because I don't think we know how much they're buying and I think we have to make sure that uh that we shouldn't allow foreign countries to buy Farmland here and so we need to put stipulations and you know when I tell our business owners right now China they're not buying it as China when they buy it they're using Straw Men and so you need to be really you need to when you're selling large things you need to make sure that you're investigating who exactly are we selling those to because we have to be self-sustaining and we have to not allow other countries to take advantage we need some reciprocity of how we deal with foreign Nations too you know we allow China to operate so freely over here but you go over there and I assure you don't have the same freedoms there so I think there needs to to be some reciprocity with these nations if they're allowed to purchase here we should be allowed to purchase there and that's not always the case in there and especially the president's comments over the weekend an interview came out that he did with 60 Minutes in which he was really pressed on the fact of if China invades Taiwan would America actually come to taiwan's defense with troops and the president said yes what was your reaction to the president's comments and then also to the White House what are starting to walk that comment back yeah well that's not the first time they've done this so he had experience and he did this prior a couple of years ago but I think we've always had political ambiguity in our response to China invading Taiwan that being said I think China needs to look at the tea leaves and most of the American politicians and most of the American people do not support Chinese using Force to take Taiwan but as the President of the United States uh you have to know your own policy and you have to be able to answer your own policy so I think it's horrible that he's not doing that but I also think um we have to be very careful about not rattling Sabers for war but we are always prepared to war and I think one thing China understands uh seeing how Russia when they invaded Ukraine and how the world came to our Aid or to Ukraine's Aid I think it will be even more so if China chooses to invade Taiwan there's such great partners of ours in that region Japan South Korea and all those so I think China needs to heed his words but uh I think he should stick to the political ambiguity if you were to describe America's relationship with China right now at this present moment how would you summarize it and then if we were to fast forward five years what do you predict about that relationship changing or morphing you know we encouraged all our businesses many years ago to uh to buy Chinese and to sell to China and so now we're asking them to back off and I think that's important but I think we have to educate them I think they have to understand the threat and the malign influence that China has used I think they need to understand that they've infiltrated our universities uh they're buying our Farmland they're stealing technology uh they're they are not a human rights friendly country and I think we need to hold China accountable and so we just have to educate the Americans not only that we need to do that but we need to tell them why Americans demand not only that you ask them to do something but that you tell them why you're doing that and I think they will rise up and help us to start combating some of of this because China's all over the world and they are stripping resources from everywhere in the world and so we've got to start investing not just here but in other parts of the world to combat uh Chinese influence and about the area of cyber security because we hear about Chinese technology we hear about technology from the Russians from the perspective of As Americans are we prepared enough to combat any sort of cyber security threats whether it be from from China Russia or any other Bad actors yeah I think we have to really re-look what the threshold of a uh not necessarily War but but where do we cross the line where's a country using cyber to attack where does that cross the line into something that requires uh sanctions or even more than sanctions and so I don't think we're prepared because I don't think that we understand the problem set enough to to uh to address it so we really have to work on that we work hard but when they're continuously attacking and then we don't have any offensive capabilities when they do something we need the ability to do something back to them on the same scale and right now I'm not convinced that we're prepared to do that who who are the other um Nations that we really need to be aware of and talking a lot about apart from China and and Russia right now that we need to be very focused on as a nation and prepared to face on all fronts whether that's cyber security militarily what not well I mean Iran is always going to be and they're trying to become a nuclear they're more Regional in nature though they don't expand and they don't have the partners and allies and then North Korea is the same way North Korea and Iran uh they they have the bad will towards us to do those things they just don't necessarily have the capabilities that China does and Russia and China are the key threats that we need to focus on because and especially China because China can bring the whole of government the economy and all those things that Russia just can't bring right now yeah as far as our military are we prepared you know should there with any of these countries be a time when you know we need to be we need to be ready um to really face them yeah you know having served 36 years I will tell you we have the greatest military not just in the world but in the history of the world and uh as we saw uh we overestimated how strong Russia was uh they they did not perform as well in Ukraine but I think we can't sit on our Laurels they're catching us both in technology gaps and weapon systems and size of the army but we know how to employ those forces we know how to jointly do those but I think we can't sit on our Laurels we have to continue to strive to get better and then we have to relook Warfare and those are a lot of the conversations we have uh how does tomorrow's army look and I always use World War II an example the Japanese did us a favor uh by sinking all of our battleships in World War II because battleships were not the future of that war uh aircraft carriers were and so we transitioned from battleships to aircraft carriers so what is the next aircraft carrier for this how do we fight we don't fight the 1980s war that I joined in the way that we may have to be more mobile we have to be able to consolidate Firepower so we have to really look at how we fight and what assets do we really need to bring to bear to have the strongest military in the world where's policy Solutions what are the pieces of whether it be legislation that that you and your colleagues are talking about that okay these are the Strategic steps that that Congress is going to take in order to make sure that America is as strong as it as it possibly can be and and is ready for any and all threats I think we have to be on that strategic level all too often in Congress we ask the Army the Navy the Air Force we ask them to be the experts and they do know the weapon systems and all those things but uh again had we relied on just battleships and relied on the Navy we would have built more battleships instead of aircraft carriers and so I think we should be uh sometimes the Strategic thinkers in the room and we need to hold them accountable for what they're doing and so I think we have to shape where we want to send them we need to give them the goals we want them to achieve and then they can figure out how to achieve them but we can't just do business as usual we have to be the Strategic thinkers here in Congress Congressman before we let you go I want to ask you election in less than two months now Republicans do retake the house what will be your top priorities and what do you think your those top prairies of your colleagues will be wow there's so many top priorities uh number one is uh we have to have some oversight on some of the things that have happened whether it's the intelligence Community or DOD so there has to be some oversight the Department of Justice those things are important to get to the bottom of uh we got to build back America's trust and our FBI and our department of justice that's one of the things the other things is is uh it's the I I don't know if Reagan said it exactly this way but it's the economy stupid you know I mean we have got to do the things that make us a strong a strong economy without a strong economy we can't be a great nation and if you look back we had GDP growth that was beyond what they ever said was possible under Trump and now we've got a inflation hitting us at all areas we continue to spend money so we've just got to make sure we put a curb on their appetite to spend money on things that don't matter well Congressman Kelly we thank you so much for your time today it's been a pleasure thank you

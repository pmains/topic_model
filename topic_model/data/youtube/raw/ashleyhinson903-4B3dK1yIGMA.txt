well good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for another episode of hot seat with hinson i'm congresswoman ashley henson back in iowa always great to be back home so thanks for spending a little bit of your time with us on this friday morning we have a very special guest for today's edition of hot seat and i'd like to introduce everyone today to juan ciscomani he is a fabulous candidate in arizona running to flip arizona six from blue to red and it is my pleasure to be supporting juan in his race we're behind you a hundred percent um and you have such um a great story to tell so um for everybody who's watching today just tell everybody a little bit more about yourself and your family and why you're running for congress i thank you well congresswoman thank you so much for having me on it's a pleasure i've enjoyed getting to know you and following your race uh your your tenure as well as congresswoman and i think we're all fighting the same fight here to take our country back and that's that's the main reason that i jumped in i'm a as as you know i'm a dad of six i have a 13 year old all the way down to a three year old three boys and three girls and when you look at a large family you may think gosh they could be the reason to not run but they're actually the reason to run because i wanted to have a shot at the american dream the same way that i've had a shot at the american dream and you have as well my family came from mexico so i i've gone through this process with my parents of uh immigrating uh to the country becoming a citizen they i lived all that with them and i know exactly what it takes and my parents get dressed up like this actually better than i am dressed today to go vote because they value it they they had to fight for it they had to earn it and uh so they they love america in a very unique way and that's how i was raised i was raised here in tucson which is the the main town in the district and my dad today still he's uh drives a bus for the city that's what he's done his whole career and uh it's just great to be here before i launched the campaign he asked me he said where else could we have our story juan he said we come to this country we immerse ourselves in the culture learn english become citizens he said i drive a bus my entire life and my son has a shot at becoming a member of the united states congress where else in the world can this be and the answer is nowhere else this is this is the the land of opportunity and this is the american dream and he's living his as you know in his job and i'm living mine you're living yours and i want everybody to have a shot at that and that's why i jumped in this race yeah absolutely critical and your why is i think what is resonating with so many americans right now and um you have not only that that great background but also um unique perspective with especially a lot of the issues that are affecting our country right now and you are in a border district and um you've had a lot of experience in working with local law enforcement and folks there at the southern border can you tell me a little bit and tell everyone watching a little bit more about um the situation there we're certainly hearing about it with the failures of this administration most recently this week the news broke about them eliminating title 42 which allows them to more quickly process people coming over the border the wrong way not like your family did but the wrong way where they come over illegally um and and they're taking away every tool that works to keep our country safe and really protect our freedom um in that instance but can you share a little bit about your experience in that district well growing up growing up on the border like i have and and so many of us here have uh gives you a very unique perspective of what it's like on the border life life is like here at the border because we have kind of like three aspects of it one is border security which is the main one and the one we're going to talk about here today then you have trade and commerce which flows uh legally through our ports of entry that we all enjoy we all like uh over 228 000 jobs in arizona are produced by this trade with mexico and canada as our number one and two trading partners all that we want to promote fast and speedy trade while we have a secure border though and then you have the immigration process which i explained uh my family went through so i have a personal journey with that so all three aspects of it when you live in the border you kind of understand that you can separate the the good ones from the bad ones and the trade conversation and tourism versus the border security part of it so it's for me it's always very important to distinguish that living on the border is not a it's not a war zone but we are in the worst situation that we've been in a long time right now when it comes to securing our family and uh in our border because of the of the failure of the bidet administration they've created this border crisis that wasn't here i can tell you i lived here and not only does data prove it but anecdotal data also proves it that it wasn't like this uh just a couple of years ago when we were under the right policies like remaining mexico policy and obviously title 42 helped with that as well and and it's also sending the right message to latin america that that this the border is not uh open to cross illegally the way they are doing it now so the messaging has been wrong the policies have been wrong and the uh the resources have been uh failing uh everything about the bible administration and the pelosi team of how to how to approach the border has been a failure and we're seeing the evidence of that yes absolutely and you are truly seeing the evidence of that in your communities just as we are here in iowa i did a ride along with cedar rapids police um in 2020 and got a chance to see firsthand um how an illegal immigrant in our community who had been arrested before right he had been undocumented in this country he got aggressive and fought and had to be tased by police in cedar rapids so i've seen that firsthand in cedar rapids and um you're seeing that play out in a much more uh demonstrative way in your communities um a way that's actually putting the safety and security of your communities at risk can you tell us a little bit about what you saw because you just wrote along with one of your local law enforcements as well that's right that's right this is so much uh more complicated and deep than what i think even the media can show on this because it's going beyond just these uh migrants crossing and even in arizona you have the uh of two different sections one section of the state where the migrant families are turning themselves in and you're seeing the masses of them just crossing over where the holes in the wall are and they just go and turn themselves into uh to border patrol then in my district you're seeing actually the ones that are running from law enforcement because they're the ones carrying the the drugs and they're the ones carrying the dangerous and the criminal uh uh element of of a a deeper criminal element of their actions so they're there are endangering um our communities just yesterday like you mentioned i was in i was in sierra vista and i was in cochise county which is where sierra vista is it's the border county and part of my district and uh hours before i showed up um an incident happened where a 29 year old u.s citizen from tucson arizona which is about an hour away from sierra vista was driving at a high speed chase carrying migrants the car stopped the migrants jumped out because they know that if they can't catch the migrants with the driver the driver can not be prosecuted so they have this whole system down the driver continue to try to flee from police and and at that point police was keeping back because they know that that these people have no regard for life as they're fleeing because of what they think they know about the law and and how little regard they have for the safety of others so police are very careful at uh pursuing these individuals especially in residential areas long story short the driver ends up uh crashing the side of a building and then and on the on the bounce from that crash uh ran over a 59 year old lady that was riding her bike just casually going from point a to point b uh thankfully i think by the time we left she was in stable condition but but it was life-threatening for for a while there these are the things that we're facing uh on on daily basis because i of course i'm i'm getting briefed on this and and uh the the sheriff told me this happens two ten times a day this is a daily incident that we see and one thing that many people may not know the way that they're finding out about this is through social media using social media platforms they're recruiting uh vulnerable uh young individuals that are being promised fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars ahead to transport him from the border up to the metro phoenix area which is about three hours away and for some people it's a six hour round trip or a three hour one one way may uh to make you know ten fifteen 000 sometimes seems like a good business deal without without uh really putting in perspective the danger that they're putting themselves in and others as well so this is uh infiltrating into younger uh citizens that are participating in in the in the trafficking of these people right and and continuing to put our safety at risk here in the united states as well and all this does is continue to enable the cartels as you mentioned the migrants get out with the drugs and run in the communities we know this is how they are funneling these these uh things like dangerous fentanyl and meth and um you talk about who this is really benefiting i mean the pay that they're able to shell out these cartels are making hundreds of millions of dollars um and all that does is uh enable them to grow stronger in mexico and continue to overrun um legitimate mexican authority as well so um this is a huge safety and security issue for us it's a huge safety and security issue not along the border but um for for mexican communities as well as american communities so i'm sure you're hearing a lot about that from people who have immigrated the right way that we need to follow that process and i clearly understand that many people want to come to the united states to seek a better life here and we want that to happen we want to make sure people feel that they can come here and pursue freedom but we want them to do it in the right way and speaking of freedom our freedom every day is threatened by rampant inflation rampant gas prices and that's something that i believe i'm hearing more about this issue than probably any other issue from my constituents here in iowa i'm sure that's resonating back home for you as well um tell us a little bit about what you're hearing and what the key driving issues are in your campaign that's absolutely right and we started with the main one which is border security and the second one is inflation this is hitting everyone um as you know we know how much gas is up 50 percent uh here in arizona for sure we i always quote that bacon is up about 19 and another thing that i'm tracking is a kid's shoes you know with six kids you gotta buy kid's shoes almost all the time and they're up twelve percent in case of any of your listeners are following are wondering these are all the things that i'm tracking even as a family man today but i know that the community is as well i grew up in a two-bedroom apartment with sharing a room with my with my siblings uh and my parents in the other room trust me if if we would have seen these numbers then i don't know how we would have been able to afford um just daily needs and so i know that today families are suffering because of that i'm hearing it from my constituents here in this district that it is difficult and they they don't understand why we can't get something like this under control and how could it have turned so so bad so quickly and uh and as i'm talking to people we just had to train our signatures here in arizona and and i did so and in the process of that i talked to many many people many many independents my district actually has about a third just roughly a third republican or third democrat and the third independence and everyone is being hit with this the same way so this is not a party issue this is not a a what side of the owl are you on everyone's paying the same price for this and everybody's feeling it and it's not good and i and clearly comes from the top and this is again another failure of the biden and pelosi team of failing our country yeah well as you can imagine i've only got two boys uh but mine are nine and 11 and eating meat and so we go through a fair amount of gallons of milk every weekend and so i can tell you we've been monitoring those price increases and and we feel them smooth right here in america's heartland um and and i know that inflation is going to be a key issue and we continue to offer solutions in washington dc but they continue to fall on deaf ears with speaker pelosi and president biden's driven agenda their agenda is about spending money and creating an expansion of government um you know this this bill that they keep rebranding it was built back better and now it's build a better america all it does is expand the role of government expand spending and continue to to force dependence and reliance upon government which is the wrong direction for our country you talk about what's fueling inflation it's this excessive spending we've been sounding the alarm on this for more than a year now it's clear it's resonating with americans and we will continue to do everything we can to not only take back the house and fire speaker pelosi in november but reverse some of these disastrous policies that clearly are taking our country in the wrong direction and that's why i'm so excited to have you as a candidate juan because you're out there working you're on the campaign trail you're talking with voters um and you and i had talked about this and i know you have probably a lot of favorite moments from the campaign trail so far but um you're a spanish speaker and so you're able to really connect in a way that many others can't can you talk a little bit about the impact of that on on your campaign and what it's like to be bilingual out there talking with voters and connecting with people in that unique way sure it just makes her campaign um an opportunity to have a broader reach my i grew up speaking spanish at home as you can imagine and this is a great opportunity uh right now the hispanic community uh they're they're being hit with these issues if you ask my parents or really most people that came here why they came here is for a better job and a better education and both of those things are in danger right now by the by the left the far left policies that are just hurting our communities on the education front as well so the hispanic community and the spanish-speaking community specifically really waking up to this reality that listen these policies haven't worked for for me at all and and now i'm listening here and i have a better opportunity it's not always about uh converting them and and uh having them register change their party registration but as i tell them let's start by voting for a republican let's start by by voting and supporting for these policies and and that's uh that's resonating well because we're focusing on the issues we're not focusing on party we're not you know we're not uh into the into that kind of approach and game uh all i'm focusing on is saying these are the issues and this is where we are and i'm telling you families come here and not only the ones that are coming here but everyone is pursuing the american dream we all want that a piece of that in whatever way maybe you've been here for you know 10 generations or you just got here either way the the the point is that we're pursuing the american dream and nothing stifles that more than a big aggressive overreaching government that just infringes upon our personal liberties to pursue that american dream and that resonates very well with the hispanic community and and we're being able to reach them and i'm telling you i can reach them like this or we can reach them in spanish as well my wife is also bilingual our entire family is so we enjoy going out in the community and showing people that the republican party is a broad tent up with a place for everyone that wants personal freedom absolutely well i can tell what's fueling your fight uh to take on this important work in congress and i can't wait to have you as a colleague juan and

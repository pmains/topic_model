  COMMITTEE. JOINING US NOW, THE ONLY OTHER  REPUBLICAN SERVING ON THE  JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE,  CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US. I WANT TO ASK YOU, THOSE TEXT  MESSAGES WERE REALLY  UNBELIEVABLY DAMNING, AND THEY  WERE ALL TURNED OVER VOLUNTARILY BY MARK MEADOWS BEFORE HE  DECIDED TO STOP HIS COOPERATION  WITH THE COMMITTEE. FIRST OF ALL, WHY DO YOU THINK  HE TURNED THEM OVER, AND DO YOU  THINK HE HAD ANY IDEA HOW  DAMAGING ALL OF THAT STUFF WAS? DID HE KNOW WHAT HE WAS GIVING  YOU? >> WELL, FIRST OFF, I THINK HE  TURNED THEM OVER BECAUSE HE KNEW HE HAD TO. IT IS THE LEGAL PURVIEW OF THE  COMMITTEE TO REQUEST THIS, WHICH IS WHY WE HELD HIM IN CONTEMPT  WHEN HE DECIDED HALFWAY INTO HIS COOPERATING HE WASN'T GOING TO  COOPERATE. NOT EVEN ON THE NON-PRIVILEGE  STUFF. NOW HE CAN GO OUT AND TRY TO BE  A HERO OR WHATEVER, AND I'M NOT  SURE IF HE KNEW HOW DAMAGING  THEY WERE GOING TO BE, BUT IT  DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE. WE HAVE THAT LEGAL AUTHORITY TO  GET THAT, AND I THINK THE  INTERESTING THING, JONATHAN,  ABOUT ALL OF THOSE TEXTS AND,  YOU KNOW, EACH ONE OF THEM HAS  THEIR OWN KIND OF FLAVOR OF  IMPORTANCE, BUT A LOT OF THESE  TEXTS WERE ABOUT A YEAR AGO. SOME EVEN, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE  LONGER THAN A YEAR AGO. WHAT HAS CHANGED? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S CHANGED  SINCE THOSE TEXTS WERE SENT ONE  YEAR AGO. PROBABLY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MORE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT ANTIFA  OR THE FBI HAD SOMETHING TO DO  WITH JANUARY 6th. IT'S BEEN A YEAR AND WE HAVEN'T  HAD ANY REAL, IN ESSENCE,  DETAILED ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHAT LED TO THAT, AND THAT'S WHAT THE COMMITTEE IS FOCUSED ON. OTHERWISE THE HISTORY BOOKS, WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY  BECAUSE WHO WILL CONTROL THE  NARRATIVE? WE JUST WANT THE TRUTH. >> ALSO TEXT MESSAGES, AND I  ASSUME YOU HAVE MORE, BUT THE  TEXT MESSAGES THAT YOU RELEASED  FROM YOUR COLLEAGUES, FROM YOUR  REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ON JANUARY 6th AND AS YOU SAID, BEFORE  JANUARY 6th, THAT LOOK PRETTY  DAMNING. DO YOU THINK THAT SOME OF YOUR  REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES BEAR  DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT  RIOT? >> IT'S POSSIBLE. I'M NOT READY TO KIND OF GO TO  THAT POINT YET BECAUSE I WANT TO LET THE FACTS DICTATE IT, BUT I  WILL TELL YOU, YES. THERE ARE MORE TEXTS OUT THERE  THAT WE HAVEN'T RELEASED, WHERE  IT'S, YOU KNOW, FOLKS NOT SAYING THINGS LIKE, HEY, MARK MEADOWS. WHY DON'T YOU MAKE SURE ALL THE  VOTES ARE COUNTED AND THEN  WHOEVER HAS THE MOST WINS. IT'S GOING AROUND THE NUANCES OF THE LAW, OR IT'S SAYING, HERE'S  HOW WE CAN USE THIS TECHNICALITY TO WIN, AND I THINK THAT'S WHY I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE  ELECTORAL COUNT ACT AND SAY, IF  THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE  TECHNICALITY OF THIS, AND HOW TO WIN AGAINST THE WILL OF THE  PEOPLE, SOMETHING IS WRONG AND  WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT. WE'RE GOING TO PURSUE DOGGEDLY,  EVERYTHING TO THE ENDS OF THE  EARTH, AND THAT INCLUDES MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT. >> I KNOW NO DECISION ON THIS  HAS BEEN MADE, SO I'M ASKING  YOUR OPINION TO BE CLEAR. DO YOU THINK YOUR COLLEAGUES,  SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES SHOULD  BE SUBPOENAED IF THEY WON'T DO  IT VOLUNTARILY, SHOULD BE  SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE? >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, AND I  DON'T -- THE QUESTION IS HOUSE  RULES AND SPEECH AND DEBATE AND  ALL THOSE NUANCES, BUT YES. I THINK IF YOU HAD ANYTHING TO  DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6th AND I THINK MORE  IMPORTANTLY, EVEN ON JANUARY  6th, IS THE EVENTS AND THE  NUANCES THAT LED TO JANUARY 6th. >> RIGHT. >> BECAUSE JANUARY 6th WAS A  REALLY BAD DAY. EVERYTHING PRIOR TO THAT IS THE  ROT IN THE DEMOCRACY OR THE ROT  IN SELF-GOVERNANCE THAT WE HAVE  TO CORRECT SO WE DON'T GET  ANOTHER JANUARY 6th. SO ABSOLUTELY ANYBODY -- NOBODY, MEMBER OF CONGRESS, FORMER  PRESIDENT, NOBODY IN AMERICA IS  ABOVE THE LAW. >> SO A SUBPOENA FOR FORMER  PRESIDENT TRUMP? I KNOW THE COMMITTEE HASN'T MADE A DECISION, BUT YOU THINK THAT  SHOULD HAPPEN? >> HERE'S HOW I'LL SAY IT. IF WE NEED IT, YES. NOBODY SHOULD BE ABOVE THE LAW,  BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE WE CAN GET THE INFORMATION WITHOUT HIM AT  THIS POINT, AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN  YOU SUBPOENA THE FORMER  PRESIDENT, THAT COMES WITH A  WHOLE KIND OF, YOU KNOW, CIRCUS  ENVIRONMENT, BUT IF WE HAVE TO,  WE'LL DO IT. >> RIGHT, RIGHT. THAT GIVES HIM A BIG PLATFORM. LET ME SHOWCASE SOMETHING ELSE  THAT LIZ CHENEY SAID ABOUT THE  IMPORTANCE OF MEADOWS  TESTIFYING. TAKE A LISTEN. >> MR. MEADOWS' TESTIMONY WILL  BEAR ON ANOTHER KEY QUESTION  BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. DID DONALD TRUMP THROUGH ACTION  OR INACTION CORRUPTLY SEEK TO  OBSTRUCT OR IMPEDE CONGRESS'  OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS TO COUNT  ELECTORAL VOTES? >> OKAY. SO I KNOW CONGRESS DOESN'T HAVE  THE POWER TO PROSECUTE. THAT'S THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,  BUT WHAT CONGRESSWOMAN CHENEY  JUST DESCRIBED THERE IS A CRIME  UNDER THE U.S. CRIMINAL CODE. IT IS A CRIME TO OBSTRUCT THE  OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF  CONGRESS. IS SHE THERE SENDING A MESSAGE,  AND ARE YOU SENDING A MESSAGE  THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  SHOULD BE PROSECUTING NOT JUST  CAN THOSE THAT BROKE INTO THE  BUILDING ON JANUARY 6th, BUT  SHOULD BE PROSECUTING DONALD  TRUMP HIMSELF OR AT LEAST  INVESTIGATING THAT POSSIBILITY? >> I THINK INVESTIGATING THAT  POSSIBILITY FOR SURE, YOU KNOW,  CONGRESS HAS I THINK IN THIS  CASE OUR COMMITTEE IS GETTING  MORE INFORMATION THAN LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND DOJ,  BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THE POWER  AND THE ABILITY TO GET THAT  DONE, AND SO WHATEVER  INFORMATION WE GET WILL BE  PUBLIC RECORD AND THE DOJ SHOULD TAKE A LOOK. PARTICULARLY IF THERE'S CRIMINAL CHARGES TO BE FILED, BECAUSE  AGAIN, THE BIG THING IS, AS BAD  AS IT WAS ON JANUARY 6th,  THERE'S REALLY NOTHING IN PLACE  TO STOP ANOTHER ONE FROM  HAPPENING AGAIN, AND IF SOMEBODY BROKE THE LAW, IT IS SO  ESSENTIAL THAT WE SEND THE  MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE NOT  UNTOUCHABLE AS PRESIDENT. YOU'RE NOT UNTOUCHABLE AS A  FORMER PRESIDENT, SO JUST GO AND DO YOUR JOB HONORABLY, AND I  THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY  THAT SELF-GOVERNANCE SURVIVES IN THE FUTURE. >> IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR  SENATOR McCONNELL THIS WEEK. HE OBVIOUSLY OPPOSED AN  INDEPENDENT COMMISSION TO  INVESTIGATE ALL OF THIS, BUT HE  SEEMS TO BE -- I MEAN, ALMOST  CHEERING ON THE COMMITTEE, AT  LEAST BY THE WAY McCONNELL  SPEAKS. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO  SAY ABOUT THE COMMITTEE'S WORK. >> WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE  WATCHING IT. IT WAS A HORRENDOUS EVENT, AND I THINK THAT WHAT THEY'RE SEEKING  TO FIND OUT IS SOMETHING THE  PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW. >> THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT KEVIN McCARTHY, THE LEADER OVER THERE  IN THE HOUSE IS SAYING. >> RIGHT. LOOK. I MEAN, I GOT TO TELL YOU, SO,  YOU KNOW, SAY WHAT YOU WANT  ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL. HE OBVIOUSLY HOLDS HIS CARDS  VERY CLOSE. I THINK THAT WAS A VERY POWERFUL STATEMENT AND I APPRECIATE IT. KEVIN McCARTHY, ON THE OTHER  HAND, HAS NOT SAID A WORD ABOUT  ANYTHING, EXCEPT FOR THAT DONALD TRUMP IS PROBABLY THE GREATEST  PRESIDENT TO EVER EXIST, AND  KEVIN McCARTHY HIMSELF I THINK  MADE DONALD TRUMP RELEVANT AGAIN WHEN TWO WEEKS AFTER JANUARY 6th OR SO, HE WENT BACK DOWN TO  MAR-A-LAGO AND BROUGHT HIM BACK  TO POLITICAL LIFE BY PUTTING HIS ARM AROUND HIM, TAKING THAT  PICTURE, AND BASICALLY SENDING  THE SIGNAL TO THE REST OF THE  REPUBLICANS THAT WERE PRETTY  QUIET AT THIS MOMENT, THAT WE  GOT TO GET BACK ON THE TRUMP  TRAIN, AND HE BEARS  RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT. I DON'T THINK HISTORY BOOKS ARE  GOING TO BE KIND TO HIM. >> OKAY, WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF  TIME, BUT ONE MORE QUESTION. YOU WON A BIG DECISION, THE  COMMITTEE DID, THE APPEALS  COURT, D.C. CIRCUIT ON THAT  EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE CASE TO GET  ALL THOSE WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS  THAT ARE HOUSED IN THE NATIONAL  ARCHIVES. THE COMMITTEE GAVE TRUMP 14 DAYS -- THE COURT GAVE TRUMP 14 DAYS  TO APPEAL. THAT 14th DAY I THINK IS  CHRISTMAS EVE. DO YOU EXPECT THE SUPREME COURT  IS GOING TO TAKE THAT UP, AND DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET  THOSE DOCUMENTS? >> I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THE  SUPREME COURT COULD PICK IT UP  BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT, BUT I HOPE FOR AN EXPEDITED RULING,  AND I DO BELIEVE WE'LL SEE THAT  DOCUMENTATION. IT'S THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S  DOCUMENTS. IT'S NOT DONALD TRUMP'S, AND THE COURTS MADE THAT VERY CLEAR. >> HOW IMPORTANT ARE THEY, THOSE DOCUMENTS? >> THEY'RE -- I THINK THEY'RE  GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. I THINK WE'RE GETTING  INFORMATION REGARDLESS IF WE  DON'T GET THEM, BUT OBVIOUSLY  THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. THERE'S A LOT OF VISITORS LOGS,  ET CETERA, THAT WE NEED TO SEE. >> OKAY, CONGRESSMAN ADAM  KINZINGER OF ILLINOIS, MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR JO

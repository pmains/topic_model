I used to examine the ethical policies conduct and alleged criminal activities within the Department of Homeland Security I now recognize myself for an opening statement May sixth through twelfth was public recognition week we set aside time each year to honor our public servants who keep us safe care for our veterans patrol our borders and find cures for rare diseases they make our country stronger and make a difference in the world most of our employees understand that public service is a public trust each one has a responsibility to the United States government and the citizens they all serve to place loyalty to the Constitution laws and ethical principles above private gain and most public servants adhere to this trust however the Pew Research Center interviewed more than 3,000 adults about their views of our government fifty-four percent said the federal government is mostly corrupt well thirty-one percent said mostly honest and eleven percent said they don't know either the survey also showed just a third of Americans has a favorable opinion of the federal government the lowest positive rating in its fifteen years a measure of dissatisfaction these days is to be expected the country is in economic trouble and our leaders promise things they cannot deliver what compounds this dissatisfaction our government scandals there have been many reports of federal employees wasting taxpayer dollars and in some cases committing crimes which erodes the trust American people put in our government the General Services Administration Employees spent over eight hundred thousand dollars on a conference in Las Vegas the Department of Homeland Security spent nearly 1 billion dollars on the secure border initiative network with little return on this investment we've also found criminal activity within our bureaucracies custom and Border Protection personnel collaborating with drug smugglers cartels immigration and customs enforcement personnel filing fraudulent travel claims and TSA personnel stealing personal belonging of passengers since 2004 over 130 agents of the United States Customs and Border Protection have been arrested charged or otherwise prosecuted on corruption charges allegations and convictions include alien and drug smuggling money laundering and conspiracy the DHS acting inspector general mr. Charles Edwards States at mexican drug cartels attempt to corrupt DHS employees and this impacts our national security the inspector general also reports that since 2004 there's been a thirty-eight percent increase in the number of complaints against CVP employees as recently as February 2012 and ice agent pled guilty to 21 counts of obstruction and corruption violations these charges include illegally obtaining and disseminating government documents to individuals with ties to drug trafficking organizations there have also been allegations of convictions of ice agents accepting thousands of dollars in bribes from immigrants seeking us documentation a former intelligence chief for us immigrations and Customs Enforcement is accused of embezzling more than 180 thousand dollars stemming from a travel voucher fraud and kickback scheme that defrauded the government of more than five hundred thousand dollars for other ice employees pled guilty to involvement in a scheme to defraud the government in the past year alone there have been numerous incidents of alleged misconduct on the part of TSA officers and employees thousands of dollars in cash and items have been reported stolen dozens of TSA officers were fired over improper luggage screening because they had allowed thousands of pieces of luggage on two flights without proper screening TSA officers have allegedly taken bribes allowing passengers expedited security checks a number of additional allegations range from racially charged statements and actions to inappropriate sexual harassment a recent 22 count indictment alleges TSA employees took payments to provide drug couriers unfettered access through los angeles international airport so that drugs should be smuggled into the united states executive branch employees are subject to executive orders issued by the president and ethics regulations issued by the US office of government ethics some agencies also have issued supplemental ethics regulations that apply to their employees and even though there are stacks of government manuals training materials and nearly briefings about ethics these lapses continue and they not only waste taxpayer dollars they are a threat to the security of our nation without the majority of bureaucratic personnel or law abiding this hearing will examine the ethical policies and procedures of selected components of the Department of Homeland Security and attempt to understand why these ethical lapses continue and what is to be done to prevent prevent them from happening in the future one final note it is unfortunate the Department of Homeland Security and the face of such serious ethical mishaps refuses to provide witnesses from leadership to discuss these matters and open before the American people we request the leadership from CVP ice and TSA however only CBP recognize the importance of these issues

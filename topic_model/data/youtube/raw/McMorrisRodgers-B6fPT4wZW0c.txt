earlier this month we heard from five states who made clear supply limitations are the number one barrier to getting more shots in people's arms hopefully our projections for increased supply and new vaccines will resolve this to crush the virus states also need to resolve self-inflicted problems my home state is no exception the seattle times revealed that the washington department of health ignored basic logistics in their rollout plan it was called a quote bureaucratic nightmare had washington plan better the most vulnerable could have been vaccinated much faster i also recently learned of governor inslee's unacceptable unfair and irresponsible intervention in whitman county after vaccinating all phase 1b tier 1 eligible people who wanted the vaccine whitman county was ready to vaccinate the next group teachers but governor inslee interfered he threatened to withhold vaccines if they proceeded one school superintendent called the governor's decision demoralizing i agree we should be doing everything we can to get our kids back to school that means supporting counties that are delivering the vaccine with efficiency and speed i know that this has been a very long year full of fear of the unknown the uncertainty and more isolation this week marks 500 000 lives lost social distancing school closures long hours and nights for people on the front lines the rise of suicides and overdoses it all adds up and is taking a toll people are tired many are in despair i'm especially worried about the mental health of our children so my message today is this there is hope our vaccine supply is expected to increase distribution is becoming more efficient we will get through this pandemic it's american innovation and ingenuity that's going to end this crisis and give people hope the ability to heal and the courage to dream again we will emerge stronger than ever before that's our mission today thank you madam chair i yield back

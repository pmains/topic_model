say to go from talking but actual deal we're joining me now to congressman from opposite sides of the aisle maybe they can find some points of agreement that democrat jim Himes of the Financial Services Committee and Republicans on coal than 70 Majority Whip walk gives you both you'll you're smiling has has a good way brunel see all y'all feeling happy is there gonna be a deal let's start with you Jim is what do you what are you sensing well I'm encouraged it'sit's unconsciously encouraged on the one hand one thing that encouraged me it could encourages me is it after the meeting today nobody ran for the microphones neither the president nor the Republican leadership ran for the microphones and that's always a good sign that people are getting serious and really working towards a solution and then I'm also gratified to see that the people are really focused on making sure we don't default default on the Full Faith and Credit that the government shutdown is uncomfortable it's hurting a lot of people but the fire we were playing with on default was really a horrifying thing some coal I mean it seems that everyone's agreed is gonna be like a six-week extension on the debt ceiling ever since that's the most sensible course of action everyone agrees that government should be reopened the only question I guess now for the Republicans given the pretty awful polls that have come out tonight with more and more Americans blaming Republicans is what kind of concessions if any they get as part of this process how do you see the deal which is probably pretty close to being done now actually being completed well I agree very much actually with what Jim had to say I think we've made some real progress both sides clearly recognize you don't jeopardize the Good Faith and Credit of the United States both sides are talking both sides have agreed to continue the discussion how much you worried about the particulars of what they'll decide on it does seem to me that opening the government sooner rather than later is a good thing to do look we're going to pay these folks anyway which was the right thing to do over half the government is up and operational with the Defense Department and essential workers you know why would you keep paying people and not giving the opportunity to work so we ought to do that but I think probably the key thing from Republican standpoint is that there is a negotiation and honestly there's a time limit not that it couldn't be renewed or standard I think there's a serious negotiation there would be but each side's given a little bit here now that sets the framework up for productive mataas gmoms I've got a great interview with Donald Trump coming up late in which he really lays into Washington generally for the lack of ability as he sees it to negotiate and to get business done but you guys accept that this doesn't look very good the way this is all played out well first of all I never sort of looked at Donald Trump for what is true and good in this world but also look Donald Trump in his business when he doesn't like how something is going he can just do as he does and say you're fired none of us can say that to each other we are all elected by very different people in different parts of this country and you know Donald Trump doesn't necessarily have to work with people we have to find ways to work with each other we can't fire each other and that creates a very different dynamic here and again today it looks like maybe uh we're looking up on that count well you can't be fired by the American public cool so every two years they get their chance son cold do you think that Donald Trump is a force for evil of his worlders look I never having married my dad about to make a judgment about him but look I suggest what we're about here as part of a larger pattern of events we had a lot of trouble we came to a budget deal in April of 2011 had a lot of fights and came to a budget deal in August actually a destiny on august of that same year had the fiscal cliff earlier in january of this year at a continuing resolution a deal in march all four of those together have narrowed the deficit that's why it's about half of what it was three years ago all four of them were bipartisan it looks to me like we're on the edge doing the same thing again but perhaps in a bigger way and more productively I want to play a quick clip from as interview would take crews they came out of tonight's crossfire let's watch what he had to say they followed you into a ditch and now there's obviously no chance that Obamacare is going to be defunded and we're on the brink of a horrific default do you think that in the reflection of your own heart you might say you know what I'm a new kid here I think how you guys an apology you know van I know you desperately want to change the topic from Obamacare and it is striking that all told him let me ask you from the default name in the world that condom actor dancer the van let me answer you let me answer your question listen Democrats in this town do not want to discuss Obamacare why because it isn't working I mean what is interesting it isn't it Jim Heintz it is that as she Obamacare has suddenly disappeared off the talking points here because everyone recognized it was becoming the great obstruction to getting any deal done suddenly got Paul Ryan writing you're not fair piece we doesn't even mention it yeah look I you know Democrats do want to talk about the Affordable Care Act because the CNN wall street journal poll that was released today showed that in the last week the Affordable Care Act has actually risen seven points in popularity over this last week now by the way we should all be willing to look at Obamacare and say what's good and what's bad let's have those negotiations absolutely let's have those negotiations let's make a law that some people disapprove of better let's do that it's hard though to look at the strategy that was led by Ted Cruz in the Senate and say that that ended up well from the standpoint of public perception for for the opponents of Obamacare what Donald Trump I know you like very much he gives a rousing defense of the tea party later that comes later in the show for now jim Himes and Tom Cole thank you both very much indeed

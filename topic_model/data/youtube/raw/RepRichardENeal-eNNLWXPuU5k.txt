the gentleman is recognized thank you the previous speaker said we really shouldn't have to do this and the answer is we don't have to do this Bill Clinton proved on four occasions that you can balance the budget it's only been done five times since the end of World War two so what we really should be calling this legislation that's in front of us today is the Jesse James Sikhs clemency Act we are here because of their tax cut invade Iraq let's have a tax cut invade Afghanistan let's have a tax cut the tax cuts the answer to everything the last round let's borrow 2.3 trillion dollars over ten years before the Federal Reserve Board by the way has a chance to raise interest rates three times this year as they predicted for the purposes of providing a tax cut ago by the way how about that old song don't worry because tax cuts pay for themselves this is what we've heard here and this is what has put us in this predicament that we're in 20 trillion dollars worth of debt now here's the caveat that they always attach to these arguments by the way if there's a Democratic president you need to balance the budget if there's a Republican president you don't need to balance the budget they're spending priorities are keen it's borrowed money to provide tax cuts for people at the very top further concentrating wealth now let me give you some numbers here then I paid a lot of attention to over the years I'm Jan uary 19 2001 when Bill Clinton said goodbye we were staring at a five point six trillion dollar surplus and for balanced budgets and record economic growth the greatest economic growth spurt in the history of America surplus again five point six trillion dollars so what happened well we cut taxes over the objections of many of us in 2001 by 1.3 trillion dollars then we had a recession where we were losing 800,000 jobs a month oh by the way in 2003 we came back in cut taxes again here by one trillion dollars plus the bonus then they decided to do a reprint tax holiday and now they're here like this my father used to have a great line he used to say at least Jesse James had enough respect to wear a mask I mean this is unbelievable that they would commit with a balanced budget after what they have done repeatedly all of these years to wreck the budgets all under the guise of if we simply cut taxes everything will get better the reason that this deficit is ballooning is not because of an increase in spending revenue as a percent of gross domestic product remains roughly in that 17% to 18% that's the post-war norm except for the end of the Bush years Bush w-when revenue as a percentage product with the 15 cents on the dollar because of the tax cuts and by the way increased spending for Iraq and Afghanistan so let me remind our Republican friends of this the priorities have been wrong we could have reached an accord on these issues but today to do this to bring forth a balanced budget amendment we're going to disturb the Constitution of the United States to maybe get them through the next round of congressional elections because that's all this is about so the tax cuts are going to reduce revenue and here's the footnote that you might want to pay some attention to 83% of this tax cut that they voted for without one Democrat incidentally in the house supporting it 83% of the benefit is going to the top 1% of the wage earners in America and then they found time by the way to double the exemption on the estate tax so we're taking the estate tax from 11 2 million dollars to 22 million dollars and remember this about the estate tax the estate tax is not a tax on Conrad Hilton the estate tax is a tax on Paris Hilton and my God who can be against that when you think of how this has been pursued it's all about concentrating more wealth at the very top for people who have said we don't need it there wasn't anybody beating down our doors in the top percentile of wage earners in America saying cut my taxes we could have reached an accord on the corporate rate we could have done some things too in a bipartisan manner to address some of these issues and making American competitive internationally but instead they chose to do what they always do let's starve the federal budget and then say after we starve the federal budget oh by the way we've got to cut Social Security let's starve the federal budget of revenue and say oh by the way we've got to cut Medicare and oh by the way let's starve the federal budget and say we've got to get rid of Medicaid for people who need it this is why we find ourselves when the 20 trillion dollar debt and you know what I'll take the Clinton years in the Obama years compared to what they gave us in terms of federal revenue forecasts CBO accounts the other day they came back and said what these are the numbers in one minute gentlemen let us tell you right now what's wrong they gave us hard core numbers about economic growth and they gave us hard core number about debt and deficits and you know what the answer was well let's not believe what they have to say let's not pay any attention to what they have to say because it doesn't square with the philosophy of tax cuts paying for themselves so the last point is if you voted for the tax cuts and you voted for the Omnibus spending bill on the Republican side because I know no Democrat voted for the tax cut today when you come in you ought to wear a mask when you cast your vote because Jesse James would be honored and I yield back the balance of my time

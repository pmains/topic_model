Mr Speaker I rise today to speak about the administration's approach to trade and the pain that we are already feeling due to the short-sighted and poorly considered decisions that have been made since the administration announced its plans in March to use wide-ranging tariffs to address trade imbalances I have been warning the president and the nation that this is a wrongheaded approach so many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle I believe agree and we all want to see American jobs secured and increased opportunities for our economy that is without doubt but raising broadly defined tariffs will do I believe just the opposite we all know or at least most of us know that the most likely effect of raising tariffs will be other countries adjusting their trade measures to protect their economies and their industries and their workers let's realize that in a global economy that we live in today most countries have leverage I hope the president realizes this and what happens as a result we have a trade war that's where we're going and I've been saying since March no one mr. speaker no one wins in a trade war which is why both Republicans and Democrats have publicly expressed grave concerns with the administration's tariff based approach to trade but beyond the warnings and concerns mr. speaker we're now feeling the negative impacts the administration's approach without a doubt our country is beginning to engage in these stages of a trade war tariffs for example in California agriculture products are already in place forty-four percent of California's agriculture economy which is the number one agricultural state in the nation 44 percent of it is based upon international trade almonds wines pistachio citrus all faced increased tariffs on exports to China and that's just the start it's also taking place in Mexico and Canada I met with California almond Purdue process yesterday who told me that as a result of these tariffs that Chinese buyers are staying away from the table he told me that this time of the year he usually a sold a significant portion of his harvest to Chinese buyers but because of the uncertainty of these tariffs he hasn't sold a single pound mr. speaker the retaliatory tariffs imposed in a reaction to this administration's still and aluminum tariffs are already impacting the California agriculture economy which again forty-four percent of it is based upon international trade and it's hurting our relationships with many of our allies in Europe as well as our neighbors to the north and to the south yes there are trade imbalances in the global market we live in and we should address them there is my partisan agreement we should address them but the way to address these trade imbalances is through successful renegotiation of NAFTA negotiating trade agreements with our European and Pacific Rim allies that's the way to deal with the trade imbalances we cannot address trade imbalances or arrive at mutually beneficial agreements through trade wars plain and simple what's more the president the Congress must work together on trade agreements based upon where we are today it looks like we will require us in Congress to reassert our constitutional authority and responsibility to regulate international trade agreements that's part of our job this will take hard work bipartisan negotiations and serious policy deliberations which in turn requires that we overcome our partisan division and come together as America's Congress I call on my colleagues today to join me in real negotiations in real bipartisan work and the type of policy deliberations that our nation needs and that America deserves we can do this and we must do this our country currently is being led by this administration into a very real trade war but it's not too late to stop it and it's Congress's responsibility frankly to say timeout let's sit down and work together with our allies in Europe our neighbors to the north and to the south of us and in the Pacific Rim to do what's right and that is to ensure that we protect American workers American industries American agriculture and yes that we don't engage in a trade war that will lead to no good in we can fix this trade imbalance and we should and we must assert ourselves I yield back the balance of my time

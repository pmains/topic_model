we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks we are trying to get back to normal here i would pumping out more podcasts for you as long as you give me five stars and um today i want to talk about the uh colonial pipeline issue and unpack that a little bit you've seen a lot of news stories on it i'm going to use the next 30 minutes to really try and dive down into it and talk about the implications of it uh i've also got a distinguished uh staffer from my dc office um on this podcast he shall not be named but i assure you he's a lovely gentleman and um uh he's gonna help us through this problem so look let's um let's lay out the basics real quick on friday may 7th colonial pipeline was the victim of a ransomware attack shut down the pipeline connecting the gulf coast refineries in much of the south and eastern portion of the u.s so i see all these gas lines because people couldn't get gas gas couldn't go to the gas stations it's not just cars that are affected of course it's um you know this has an effect on our military this has effect on our national security uh turns out our airplanes also use uh gasoline this is this is this is an important issue across the board uh the attack targeted their i.t system and uh they shut down the uh pipeline so that the ostensibly is what i believe to be true that so that the uh ransomware attack wouldn't wouldn't proliferate to the operating uh technology side of things okay there's just minor detail there i'm not sure you need to know it but there you go as a result over 5000 miles of pipeline stopped and stopped transportation of two and a half million barrels a day so uh it's a pretty big deal when it comes to u.s infrastructure and of course the bite administration uh showed out of an abundance of compassion that i thought they had showed no compassion whatsoever to this vital piece of infrastructure have not offered any help whatsoever but the secretary of energy yesterday did say that you know if you only had an electric car this wouldn't affect you well thanks that that's that's the bite administration's message to you americans if you were just better people if you would just spend all that money on electric car on that tesla then this wouldn't affect you um so much compassion so much realism anyway but let's let's get down to nitty gritty of what happened um as of last night by the way the the looks like the uh pipeline is back online so that's great news for a lot of our friends um on the east coast who have been unable to get gas for their cars so what we want to talk about is um why this happened why it's important and um what the implications are fundamentally this is an attack on american energy dominance we're going to talk about where this attack came from and and some of the thoughts behind that and how our geopolitical adversaries such as russia are certainly beneficiaries of an attack like this and um offshore how offshoring energy could lead to more vulnerable vulnerabilities like this as well um kevin mccarthy our distinguished leader in the republican house of the colonial pipeline crisis shows that we need more american energy to fuel our economy not less but the bind administration has already canceled the keystone pipeline and paused oil and gas drilling leaving our energy supply more vulnerable to attacks this is exactly right i would also add to this comment that you know this is the bind administration itself is attacking pipelines um via excessive regulations via via drawing out permitting deadlines forever and ever and ever i often point out on this podcast that look one of the best ways to reduce global emissions would be to make sure that we build pipelines from our west texas drilling operations that are flaring natural gas right now instead of flaring that natural gas which just means burning it put it into a pipeline and export it to places like china and india and replace their coal burning power plants with our cleaner natural gas this would have a massive effect on global emissions but the democrats they simply do not believe in this type of infrastructure they're almost gleeful when it goes down they they believe it makes their point for them of course it doesn't when in reality what you're seeing here is a bit of a glimpse of the green new deal this is what happens when all of a sudden you have a shortage in fossil fuels and i assure you that every single policy measure by the democrats is intended to destroy the fossil fuel industry abruptly mind you not not in a not in any well-reasoned gradual way but very abruptly and so yes this is an attack um from an outside source but it's important to note that this kind of attack in a different way is coming from within as well so let's talk about what a ransomware attack is real quick and um these attacks they seize data they encrypt it and the demand to ransom from the victim to unencrypted data usually under the threat of pay or we're going to release the data or increase the fee so 2018 or some data on this in 2018 ransomware had an estimated global damage cost of 8 billion last year an estimated 300 million ransomware attacks cost an estimated uh 20 billion and affected government corporations medium and small businesses and individuals the the primary responsibility for this is a group called the dark side they operate on the dark web and they they basically sell the ransomware software and they also take a cut of the ransoms now they have not claimed responsibility for this they claim that they're ethical hackers and that they often uh they often give their ransoms to charity so that's fascinating um as a result of the cyber attack gasoline prices surpassed three dollars per gallon wednesday for the first time since 2014 in large part due to spiking demand as people race to fill up at the pumps so the colonial pipeline is huge runs over 5 000 miles from texas to new jersey so it's uh not surprising that it would have such a large impact um people ask about the the keystone pipeline i think it wouldn't have affected this particular issue remember the colonial pipeline is responsible for that east coast supply um the the excel pipeline is is something different it transports it back to texas um to be refined that's that's what that pipeline would do i think the the main point here is that look it's not just outlaw hackers that are against our energy infrastructure it's also the bind administration going back to the point i made earlier what do we know about this dark side group we believe they're eastern european that belief stems from the fact that they only seem to attack english-speaking western countries and never eastern bloc countries so you know when you're dealing with the russians and russian intelligence very similar to iran they like to use surrogates uh they're very good at using surrogates and they give these surrogates a wide operational capacity and leeway um they're not as concerned with risk-taking uh as as we would be in our in our own american intelligence community and um and they again they claim to be apolitical they operate on the dark web if you don't know what the dark web is uh i'll try to explain that real quick basically it's a it's a uh you have to download um maybe i'll let what do i call you because you know you don't want to be named uh kevin kevin what do we call maybe you can help explain the dark web if you know much money more about it but you have to let download a separate tour browser i believe and therefore it enables anonymous browsing and then you can access this entire other side of the internet it's it's very spooky stuff yeah it's essentially the dark corner it's the the the the black market of the internet where um you don't go there unless you're looking for trouble or ways to get in trouble or cause trouble um i i think that would be kind of a yeah a lamest way to put it without getting into the technicalities of it it's not something you're gonna you're gonna access access what you're with your new macbook that you just popped open from the apple store um it takes some work to get into you don't just fall into it yeah it's not it's not hard though i mean it yeah you got to know what you're doing but um it's a weird place a lot of illegal activity happens there that's where that's where people like this live um and you know it maybe people remember um what was the uh what was the main site on the dark web uh call that got shut down by the fbi i can't remember off the top of my head um i was in the news a bunch but it's not important anyway don't go on the dark web all right the fbi might be watching you if you do um that's maybe that's maybe the uh the moral of the story here so you know it's difficult in these situations right to figure out who done it and um and who to blame and and how we even find that as of right now i don't believe that the fbi uh has come to any conclusions on whether it was somebody associated with darkseid whether it was um somebody associated with russia or russian intelligence or whether it's just some kid in his basement you know i mean i think that's accurate right so the f there there's now confidence that it was dark side darkseid was suspected um but we're reporting over over the past day or two has pointed directly to um darkseid but the the interesting thing though to understand about dark side is that dark side it's dark side ransomware that was used um okay we know that for sure yeah sure but but how they operate is they operate as a ransomware as a service so what they do is they create this software and then they let clients um or let's say contractors use it so then a client or a contractor of darkside will use that darkside software to hack into colonial pipeline let's say and if they extract a ransom darkside collects a fee for getting to use for that client using their malware um so it's they're really taking it into a business model um as opposed to just um hackers creating a code and creating uh malware and then them being the one who hacks in and inserts it and you know this is a it's an ideal situation for again like i mentioned before a country like russia that is is often willing to take a good degree of risk you know they're troublemakers fundamentally and um in a way that we in the united states are just not willing to do and it's hard to attribute because they they they effectively use these surrogates and then these and they give them such broad leeway that it's hard to make the connection right there's there's there's not necessarily that smoking gun that says hey hacker we told you we tell you to do this right now go right because because they operate and then sort of this freewheeling relationship yeah absolutely so it's a complete 180 from from how the soviet system worked right so a lot of people who um study military history they learn about the one-way radios in russian tanks during world war ii because commands came from the top and if you were below it there's no need for you to question no need to seek clarification you do what you're told um but now under the new russian model um the people are allowed much more autonomy a lot more operational freedom and it's pretty much go try stuff out and make the motherland proud um so you have uh in that so you have a lot of these um intelligence operations um that includes cyber warfare who you have small autonomous groups who have a lot of freedom of action and you go and you make the you try to make those motherland proud sometimes you do um but when you don't you'll pay a price um so it's kind of a competition for glory and um validation in the eyes of the russian leadership because if you do well you'll get elevated you'll get promoted um but if you bring uh if you bring shame or dishonor a failure um then you'll get punished so that's what's really interesting about now is um you have these small actors with a lot of freedom um that make decisions on their own um and that that creates that firewall between russia the russian government the russian intelligence services and then these actors so if we're trying to trace back attribution um you know it it bears the hallmarks and you look at who benefits most from a huge american energy shutdown on the east coast um that's our biggest competitor absolutely because if we look in recent years the um the shale revolution america went from a energy importer to an ex uh to a net exporter um so we cut into someone's market share well whose market share did we cut it to right we cut into russia's market share and not just does it affect us here in the united states but now as there's competition of whose energy are we going to use you know russians can kind of tell western europeans look can you really count on american energy they can't even take care of their own pipelines how are they going to supply you yeah that's exactly right it's exactly where this becomes a geopolitical conversation and geopolitical problem and it's even more of a problem because we have an administration that kind of agrees with the russians you know for being honest about this they don't like i've never heard a democrat uh exclaim excitement about being energy independent or showing any amount of pride over that um it is uh it's it's a real problem and you know we're particularly vulnerable in the united states to cyber attacks because we we do have such an integrated system and um you know advanced technology which differs from from other countries where you know maybe more standalone maybe just less advanced systems whatever it is so it might make our our systems more efficient more cost effective it might make them better in every single way um but there is a vulnerability there and the investment in cyber infrastructure cyber security infrastructure has has not kept pace under the trump administration we did increase funding quite a bit um really got cisa working on overdrive that's within the department of homeland security that's the uh um critical infrastructure what's the what's the s stand for yeah so the trump administration actually created cyber security and infrastructure security uh administration or agency um i always get my a's mixed up um but yeah and that's their primary responsibility at cyber security um and infrastructure security and the fact that we only created that recently is insane like it's insane um but there we are um it needs a lot more work right i cut you off what else were you saying about it oh no no that was good that was good yeah um so we need more of it um look i mean just recently we had solar winds uh everybody remembers that story compromised us government facilities dhs department of commerce treasury a number of other public private clients um in 2013 in new york damn 25 miles north of new york city was hacked 2018 north carolina water utility company was targeted earlier this year a florida water treatment facility was hacked so they're probing our infrastructure very meticulously and um you know maybe they make some money off of this through some kind of ransomware maybe get paid off but but fundamentally we should be more concerned that this is another this is a a peer competitor a geopolitical competitor because it's hard to imagine why a bunch of rogue hackers would bother with this stuff i mean look sometimes they just like to do it just to see if they can do it there is that culture within the hacking community um everybody remembers the cool movie hackers from the 90s right uh but you know we should be we should be uh we should be a little bit more suspicious than that i think and and it probably it's it's fair to attribute some of this to china and russia and iran that both have these capabilities and the desire to do so to probe our infrastructure because they're not going to beat us in a fair fight they're going to use asymmetric warfare and cyber attacks along our infrastructure would be certainly be considered asymmetric warfare and um it's difficult to respond to as well the first thing we need to do is to defend against it now it's worth pointing out that one this this instance has shown how much we need pipelines because people have to live their lives and you need to gas up your car to live your life it's not just your car either it's it's the trucking industry that brings food to your grocery store um everything goes up in price when something like this happens and it's not just your got your gas prices that go up it's everything you buy goes up this is the again i don't overly politicize this but this is what this is the promise of the green new deal people it really truly is because the green new deal fundamentally says destroy the fossil fuel industry completely and electrify everything okay basically invest in unreliable energy that is dependent on uh weather and by the way they also claim that weather is going to get so much worse under climate change so it'd be weird to invest in an energy source uh that uh it fundamentally depends on weather anyway it's just a side note but here's the point in the 2.65 trillion dollar american jobs plan which is uh the democrats trademark infrastructure bill uh there's a lot of things that couldn't be considered infrastructure such as civilian climate corps whatever that is uh racial equity and environmental justice provisions but there's nothing in there on cyber security they're not even taking it seriously um when this is probably the greatest need in our country right now so you have anything to add to that no so uh with the with the american jobs plan it's interesting because they point back to the american highway system and and some other things um you know great achievements in american history sure um but they also talk about how the the modern need for it well the modern need of so many things of the actual the actual pieces of this infrastructure that they're talking about funding need to be secure um they're talking about water treatment facilities they're talking about electrical grids yeah well these are things that are very vulnerable um and it's not just ransomware but far more nefarious actions like the water treatment facility in florida from early this year that wasn't a ransomware attack where they were requesting money that wasn't they were just going to stop the flow of water what that hack did is it was going to change the measurements of chemicals that were put into the water and possibly poison people geez yeah so this is pretty malicious stuff yeah exactly so it's not just criminal but there are there are far more nefarious ways to go about doing it uh or to to to harm um the people downstream of this infrastructure um and it gets back to this asymmetric warfare idea because look if you can't afford to build 12 new aircraft carriers to compete with the united states what are you going to do hire some 18 year old hackers you know and just tell them to go let hey go go get wild that's what you tell them and um and it allows you to level the playing field and um go ahead sorry and not just that but the the the genius of using these proxies um that that make it hard to attribute the attack is if if we got word if the fbi said this was a this was a russian intelligence operation run in-house to shut down colonial all right we've got an easy we've got an easy way to respond we do the same thing to them and we shut down one of their pipes but one of their pipelines but if they're doing it through a proxy we cannot for sure determine who it was dark side may have a lot of things but they don't have a pipeline that we can go and shut down and then so how do we respond proportionally yeah and that's what i want to end with really is this sort of um philosophical discussion on on how we how what escalation dominance looks like in a cyber war and it's difficult um and we need to figure it out uh as as this administration certainly needs to lay something out and it we need to have a set of i think ground rules um that indicate look this is how we respond based on attribution if we can attribute it um is it in kind what what what if what if it's like what you said where you they their cyber attack actually poisons people and kills people well does that now deserve a kinetic response kinetic meaning you're dropping a bomb somewhere you know we need to we need to we need to have answers to this as americans and it needs to be some kind of structure that we agree upon now of course every instance is different there's always a lot of grayer in these things and it requires decision making ultimately up to the president and um you know we're all in a bit of a surreal state right now where it doesn't feel like we have a president it just doesn't um just it's just based on how he performs on a daily basis uh but this is really important stuff and it's getting worse um and and i and i think there is this feeling abroad from our enemies that that america is in a weaker position america is back to the era of of apologizing for everything and empowering our enemies um i think there's there's you know maybe changing topics a little bit but there's there's a good argument to be made that that hamas is emboldened that iran is emboldened because because biden has long talked about removing those sanctions long talks about getting back into that deal that was very very beneficial for the iranians and their proxies there's nobody better maybe the russians are a little better but there's russians in iran are very very good at surrogate warfare they're very good at it i have a direct experience with this on deployments to the middle east they're very very good at it and they they don't take any prisoners and um you know hamas is is obviously receives aid from the iranian uh from from the iranian revolutionary guard the kudz force they're very good at this stuff and they're emboldened in a way that they were not emboldened under trump and um this is something we just need to recognize as fact i think well and if i may mentioning the the hamas and iran pieces um so a lot of people were were clutching their pearls and ringing their hands after the suleimani strike um but what they didn't understand which you made clear is that we were re-establishing deterrence because there had been an uptick in attacks what's going on right now in the gaza strip um the israeli strikes on hamas leadership israel's goal is one to protect its civilians of course but then also to re-establish the currents so that's also related to not the question not just of how do we respond to cyber attacks but how do we create a deterrence yeah escalation dominance exactly so that state and non-state actors know all right if i mess around with critical us infrastructure there will be a price to pay that it is not worth it yeah and if i do this i'm going to suffer and what strikes what infuriates me about this situation is what we've heard from the administration is well this wouldn't affect you if you just buy an electric car i mean it just it's such an unbelievably uncompassionate response to to people's hardships right now um the response needs to be we're going to find who did this and they're going to pay and we're going to make sure it doesn't happen again because we're going to finally invest in our critical infrastructure and the cyber security needed to defend it you know no ifs ands or buts there that should be a very clear message and it shouldn't be that hard and it's kind of it's um it's frustrating that we don't have that right now anything left to add no just hopefully this serves as a wake-up call um because um we we've seen what a small ransomware attack can do um and the the effects it can have on so many people so um as we're debating this infrastructure package it might be very worthwhile to discuss how do we make how do we go about securing um our our cyber vulnerabilities yeah you would think so you would think so but uh vague statements about environmental justice and uh and praying to the goddess gaia are really what's in that uh in these infrastructure packages i'm not making that up by the way that really isn't the clean futures act all right hey this is why i'm good at what i do because i have great staff hey uh thanks for being on really appreciate it thank you

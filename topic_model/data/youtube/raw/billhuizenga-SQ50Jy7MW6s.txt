mr. Anderson you recognized for five minutes Thank You congressman huizinga for that kind introduction and thank you chairman Chabot ranking member of Alaska's and members of this committee I appreciate the opportunity to testify today on behalf of structural concepts corporation and a HR I structural concepts was founded in nineteen seventy two and is located in Muskegon Michigan we manufacture commercial refrigeration equipment basically we make the refrigerated merchandiser or display that you would find at your local grocery store or restaurant our products ensure that food is stored safely and is accessible in all corners of our country from mom and pop shops to largest supermarket chains like so many small businesses across the country structural concepts is deeply rooted in our community our friends our neighbors and our town depend on jobs we provide unfortunately small businesses like ours are facing significant new regulatory burdens from federal agencies and that is why I'm here today first it's important for me to tell you that my company is not anti-regulation like many of our fellow ehri members we consider ourselves to be concerned citizens responsible neighbors and leading innovators we have complied fully with previous regulations and even exceeded our obligations what I am here to talk about however is the burden of conflicting regulations on businesses like mine and the need for regulatory certainty President Obama talked about this burden an executive order 13 563 when he required federal agencies to tailor regulations to impose the least burden on society taking into account among other things the cost of cumulative reticle regulations my hope is that this hearing can help illuminate the need for federal agencies to live up to this obligation in 2009 deal we finalized energy efficiency standards for commercial refrigeration equipment our industry was required to come into compliance in 2012 over those three years we developed energy efficient solutions engineered them into 400 plus refrigerated display cases and tested them for energy consumption while still upholding our most important regulations pertaining to food and product safety to accomplish all this we had to dedicate thousands of engineering and testing hours that would otherwise be used for customization or developing products to increase sales and grow company we had to increase our capacity accuracy and throughput of our test labs we had to develop new manufacturing processes and supply chains to produce our own condensing units in the end we reduce the carbon footprint of our entire self-contained product offering by approximately fifty percent we felt proud of the fact that we comply with the new deal we energy levels and in most cases went above and beyond unfortunately we soon found out that wasn't enough last year only two years after the compliance deadline for the old rules d we again updated it standard with more stringent energy efficiency criteria the new standards which have to be met by 2017 a v8 many of the investments that were made to comply with the 2012 rule quite simply after making huge best since made based on regulatory reality d we moved the goalposts to make matters worse EPA proposed rule last year that will take away the current refrigerate used in all of our self-contained refrigerated systems on january first 2016 that's only nine months away the alternate turn ative refrigerants EPA proposal either to flammable and limited the amount of refrigerant we could use in each system or they increase the energy consumption in our application if finalized EPA's proposal would have significantly raised energy consumption of all of our products and violated the New Deal we energy regulations after we submitted comments to the EPA the agencies offered up alternative refrigerant we could use our 450 a although this is much better than the previous alternatives it still has its challenges production of the new refrigerant and regulatory approval of compressors can take years to implement all of our systems will again need to be redesigned and tested to see how the new refrigerant impacts energy efficiency here is our primary problem d we is requiring us to collide with new energy standards on january first 2017 epa is proposing compliance with their new rule in january first 2016 while it's possible the EPA's compliance they will slip do e is mandated to review energy levels every five years this means that in 2022 we may have to review our product yet again my point is this if do e and EPA do not coordinate their efforts we could potentially be redesigning our product every two to three years for 12 or more years in a row at great expense combined the compliance burns burden associated with these two rules could devastate our industry my purpose today is to draw the community's attention to the regulatory burdens faced by small businesses everywhere the regulations I just described both specifically designed to address the commercial refrigeration and industry will not only increase our costs but for structural concepts to reduce the number of products manufactured throw uncertainty into the current and future products offered and overall result and reduced unemployment or in employment we are not a large corporation with a plethora of resources to redirect towards the review testing and compliance of new rules we are a small innovative manufacturer that makes refrigerate display cases hardly the nexus point of the nation's energy and environmental policy battles our company and thousands of companies like ours across the nation make a big difference in the stability of the economic recovery which has only just begun to take hold again we are not anti-regulation we are simply asking federal agencies to consider the impacts of cumulative regulations on businesses like ours and live up to the guidelines articulated in President Obama's of executive order thank you very much for the opportunity to be here today and I look forward to answering questions thank you very much

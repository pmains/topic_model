and gamestop joining us this morning two members of the committee a massachusetts congressman stephen lynch and kentucky congressman andy barr gentlemen it's great to have you thanks for the time ahead of the hearing appreciate it thank you great to be with you congressman lynch we've got we've got three big silos of interests here being represented they're the short sellers there's social media and then there's retail is there one do you think that's truly going to be at the center of this hearing i actually think that uh we should focus on the integrity of the markets themselves and not not so much on uh winners and losers in the gamestop trade uh there is a target rich environment i think my colleague would agree uh there are a lot of moving parts here uh but what i'm what i'm centrally concerned about is the fact that you know during the run-up of of gamestop's uh you know price dislocation uh you had uh robin hood uh you know in a position where there seemed to be a liquidity problem they actually had to stop uh they suspended trading and and put their retail customers at enormous risk and i'm just wondering what would have happened if there were wider uh volatility in the market and there wasn't someone like citadel to come in and rescue them uh what if we had uh liquidity problems wider in the market and you had a a major major uh brokerage firm suffer a catastrophic collapse uh could that reverberate through the through the system itself so i'm worried about that and i'm also worried about look our our adversaries learned a lot about our the vulnerabilities of our our our markets uh back there on on uh you know during the gamestop uh debacle so is there a way that these trolls in russia could do the same thing they're doing with misinformation on the political side but but use that to disrupt and undermine the integrity of our financial markets that's a real possibility but uh we'll learn more about that today yeah there's certainly a lot of the issues you're raising were big questions in the early days of that squeeze a congressman barr in an era in which there seems to be no issue that is even remotely bipartisan does this one at least get in the ballpark well i hope so and i hope that this uh hearing is more about an impartial fact-finding exercise as opposed to political grandstanding or an effort to justify excessive government interventions in ways that would actually harm investors you know i think there is going to be undue scrutiny of payment for order flow in this hearing i think there's going to be undue scrutiny of short selling when of course we know short selling is an important part of hedging it's an important part of the capital markets the proper and efficient functioning of the markets in terms of price discovery and the provision of liquidity i hope that the scrutiny of payment for order flow doesn't end up leading to an overreaction by regulators to undermine the democratization of access to the capital markets we've seen great innovation with robin hood and other online trading platforms to give retail investors access to the capital markets to expand participation in saving and investing that is a good thing we should celebrate that and volatility in a handful of stocks that didn't have any systemic impact in terms of the broader market should not be a justification or a predicate for an overreaction by regulators congressman lynch do you agree with that do you think that there is a risk of going too far in terms of you know regulating more transparency especially around that payment for order flow i would say i i need to know more uh to to judge that i am concerned about the pay for auto flow uh model and in the aspect of are our retail customers getting the best price uh because there there does seems to be a lack of transparency there i know that uh the broker's firms have to file 60460 604 605 forms but those are those are you know once a year or when you open your account so there's no way that a retail or there's there's very little way that a retail investor can find out if they got the best price and and what the what the margin was is this you know are we getting the national best offer or or is is the margin significant that that the real retail customers is uh is losing out here so uh is this the best execution under this model and and how much how much uh advantage is being taken of the retail investor under these circumstances i do agree that you know we want to encourage people into the market i you know we we all love the idea of the democratization of the markets and and zero commissions but but it's not it's not you know it's not free there's a cost here and and we're trying to figure out what that cost really is congressman barr good morning it's john ford i want to press on that democratization idea because it seems to me there's a difference between investing and day trading and when it comes to access to capital markets are uh apps like robinhood really encouraging saving and investing or are they encouraging the gamification of trading do you see a difference and do there need to be perhaps different incentives given for for the way this gets rolled out to to new investors john that's a good question and what i would say is that you can't legislate valuation and investors should be free to take risks that's what the market is all about investors should be free to trade as they see fit and they have the freedom to be wrong and i think you're seeing market discipline set in here no there shouldn't be gamification of the markets but i think market discipline is setting in when you see retail investors who get in late in this rally and where game stock pricing is so gets so far away from fundamentals and valuation that retail investors learn a very painful lesson that market discipline will set in i think at the same time these professional hedge fund investors are learning what uh uh democratization actually means in terms of the risk of of short squeezes and and so i think that this episode is actually teach as a teaching moment for many market participants and so i see the market working very very well that's not a bad point congressman uh certainly uh the street is is well aware of uh of the institutions having to rewrite their algorithms and their strategies because of the retail uh presence and then you you're right uh look at that chart of gamestop will tell you people who bought it 400 uh have learned a painful lesson we can't wait for the hearing this afternoon gentlemen i really appreciate your guidance on the issue of gamification though uh last year we saw the the volume of of options double i'm sorry up 50 percent and and i'm i'm concerned that uh retail investors are being led into the options trade uh and that's a much higher risk so so you know and it adds to the gamification aspect of this as well so very concerned about that all right uh we look forward to the line of questioning uh congressman thanks so much thank you thanks for having us good to be with you

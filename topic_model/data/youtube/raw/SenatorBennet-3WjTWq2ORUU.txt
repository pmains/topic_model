let's bring it right now uh democratic senator michael bennett of colorado he wrote and helped pass the expanded child tax credit a program that starts delivering payments directly to families this week we're going to get to that in a moment lisa murkowski uh senator may be a little more difficult for republicans to beat than that than uh than they think they they tried this before in 2010 with a tea party candidate and she beat him as an independent write-in candidate she's tough isn't she she's incredibly tough she's incredibly honest i'm not sure there's anybody in this building with more integrity than lisa murkowski and i think the people of alaska know that which is why the last time as you said the tea party tried to take her out she was able to overcome that election even though she wasn't even on the ballot she did it as a write-in candidate so i think she's got a real shot here so hey can you can you uh sort of take us behind the scenes and let our viewers know what the state of of bipartisan negotiations are across a a wide array of bills we of course we hear about the fights we see some crazy clips from from conferences we hear ideologically uh driven charges from both sides but what is what is happening with you with people like yourself and senator murkowski uh uh romney talk about some of the bills that are getting passed or at least some of the negotiations that are moving forward yeah i mean i there there there is good bipartisan work going on right now with the infrastructure bill that that i think we're going to have the chance to vote on in the next couple of weeks it's not in my view you know a perfect bill but it is the product of of a bipartisan negotiation that i think is constructive and helpful i've spent the last two months in a room with republicans and democrats trying to figure out whether there's a path forward on immigration including the dream act we meet once or twice a week with a group of senators lisa murkowski has actually been part of that conversation so there there are there are conversations going on i would say that i think that the big dividing line right now here is that the republicans in washington are are unwilling to vote to repeal a single cent of the trump tax cuts for the wealthiest americans and they'll do they'll stretch to every degree to avoid to avoid doing that and that's going to make it very hard for them i think in the end to pass a large bipartisan infrastructure bill all right senator i want to ask you about this new child tax credit how long will it last and how does it work so i ran as mirka as you may remember an almost completely unnoticed campaign for president on the idea that we could cut childhood poverty almost in half in this country and joe biden has taken my american family act which is a reform of the child tax credit in the american rescue plan and passed it and it will cut childhood poverty in this country almost in half the way it works is it goes from two thousand dollars a kid to three thousand dollars thirty six hundred for kids under the age of six uh it's it's fully refundable which means for the first time in the country's history the the millions of children who are our poorest children will receive it and it will be paid out starting on july 15th on a monthly basis for the next six months so parents will get and by the way it's 65 million children that are going to benefit from this almost 90 percent of america's kids will will have this benefit until the end of the year right now our fight is to make it permanent and that's what we're trying to do i mean we have one of the highest childhood poverty rates in the industrialized world the the gen the population in our country that is poorest uh are our children which is a disgrace and childhood poverty costs our country uh almost a trillion dollars a year so here is an opportunity finally for the federal government to intercede on the behalf of working families on poor families and make a difference in their lives it certainly you know had has made me more optimistic than i have been in the last 11 years that i've been in the senate and i give the biden administration huge credit uh for leading on this hey senator it's uh jonathan lamere good morning great to see you uh two questions for you two questions a few very different topics first it just quickly if there's any update you have on the disturbing arrests of four people in denver your home obviously in your home state uh with a huge amount of weapons and if there's any sense as to what the motive might be in any connection to the all-star game which of course is being played there this week and then secondly we're gonna hear from president biden tomorrow on voting rights we deliver a much anticipated speech uh in philadelphia kind of want to get your sense as to what you think should happen in terms of potential filibuster reform and the scheduling of these two big voting rights bills that are in congress being considered in congress at the moment yes so jonathan i i don't want on the on the arrests in denver i don't want to front run the investigation that's going on there i will say that it was apparently the result of a maid who who is who saw these weapons in a hotel room and reported them and that's incredible i mean you know the idea that a citizen came forward like that and did her duty i think is really really uh amazing on the voting rights stuff i i what i think should happen is we need to show up in favor of democracy you see people in cuba that are protesting uh oppression there democracy is being tested all over the world the chinese government is uh is competing with us in a relentless way and we need to get our act together and mitch mcconnell's obstruction in the senate uh which is not a traditional use of the filibuster it's not a traditional republican approach it's a it's a bastardization of the senate process is bringing this democracy to our knees as is the voter suppression that's going on all over the country my state has the second highest voter participation rate in the country and the reason we have that is that we have mail-in ballots we've got uh we've got opportunities for people to drop off their ballots early there is no fraud if you try to take it away tomorrow republicans would fight as hard as democrats to keep it the way it is and i think the rest of the country ought to look like that you know if we believe in democracy we ought to support the right of people to vote just as we have in my purple state of colorado a third republican a third democratic and a third independent and i i do not for one do not believe that mitch mcconnell's as i said bastardization of the filibuster and the senate rules should stand in the way of our ability to make sure that we protect the american people's right to show up participate in this democracy and to make sure that we can actually compete with totalitarian societies around the world that is what's at stake and uh and i think that's why it's so important all right democratic senator michael bennett of colorado thank you and just for the record i noticed your presidential campaign i noticed i wrote a column about your presidency you did it i predicted i predicted you were going to do very well nostradamus i am not but still thank you so much for being with us thanks joe

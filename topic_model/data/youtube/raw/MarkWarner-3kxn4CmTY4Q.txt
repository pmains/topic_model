excited about Warner on Virginia to talk about the startup act a job creation initiative really quickly though gentlemen before we get to that Senator Warner what do you think he means we're not giving up on this is this a fight for Cordray in particular or a nomination of their choosing depending if it's somebody else well I think mr. Cordray should have been confirmed I know Jerry may have different views on this I think at the end of the day that we've got to make sure that the unregulated part of the financial industry gets the same kind of rules particularly in consumer protection that the banks and credit unions and even the larger banks already played by so a level playing field makes sense and this Bureau ought to go ahead and be able to move forward if he were mean I guess senator Moran is there a suitable nominee given the broader concerns about the infrastructure of the bureau the budget of the bureau the accountability of the bureau will anyone do I think that when the president says that he's going to move forward and continue this fight I hope what he means is he's going to work with all members of Congress to address those issues you just said about the accountability a board not a not a single director the financing of the Consumer Protection financial Bureau I don't think it matters who the nominee is I don't think that's the issue here there's not discussion about mr. Cordray's qualifications the discussion is we need to get this right from the very beginning and therefore we need to have a different structure in place so that mr. Cordray or another nominee of the president can be confirmed I want to talk to you about this bipartisan jobs planned you're calling it the startup act five prong initiative that Senator Warner really looks like it's trying to turn the United States into an enterprise zone right a zone that does attract business something you know something about well I spent 20 years as an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist and the data is in I mean the vast majority of new jobs being created over the last 20 years haven't come from big established firms having custom all businesses they've come from startup firms that grow very rapidly and we've got to remove some of the regulatory burden we've got to make it easier for patient capital to invest in these firms we've gotta try to keep the world's best talent that we oftentimes educate and you know we might not have the kind of discussions we just recently had about the Consumer Protection Bureau if you actually start with a bill that's bipartisan and jerry has been working on this for a long time we're going to be great partners on this and I think this could be a jobs bill that actually could get bipartisan support is it does it mean a moratorium senator Moran condragulations it requires a cost-benefit analysis for new regulations and it also brings in the independent agencies that are not currently covered in that process so we're going to at least slow down get a better analysis of the regulatory environment we recognize in this bill that you cannot address all the regulatory issues that a entrepreneur a small businessman or woman face in trying to start or grow a business that's a major issue for our Congress to address and it's an important one we need a different regulatory environment and need a certain regulatory environment lots of bills to do that we recognize in this one bill we're not going to address all those but we also know that that's a significant component in in changing the environment in which an entrepreneur can better succeed you know that the number one issue I think in the country is job creation this bill addresses that and the number one complaint about Congress and Washington DC is we can't get along mark and I are proving that we can come up with good ideas in a bipartisan way that grows the economy creates jobs and does it in a way that we think has success we're not looking for this moment on on your network to talk about it we're not looking for a headline that says we've introduced a bill we're looking for success not for ourselves but for folks who want to go out and start a business and in the process of pursuing their American dream their success they put people to work how broad is a support for this so far senator Warner well I think we're going to see broad-based support I mean there's not anybody in the business community that hasn't said over the last 10 years you know at least on integration we ought to find a way to staple a green card to those folks who are educated graduate degrees in science and engineering and math skills that we need to keep in this country this bill does that we are lots of folks have said how do we make sure that immigrant entrepreneurs get a chance to start a business hire Americans here this bill does this how do we get to make sure that research that goes on in universities actually gets out of the lab and into commercialization this bill takes a step forward so there's an awful lot to like on this bill I don't care which part isn't label you put to it it's about creating jobs as Jarius said and I think you're going to see some action on this and does it mean necessarily that you two gentlemen agree on things like a payroll tax which the president just finished talking about Senator Warren wit well it means let me assure you I think we need some stimulus I have some concerns about the payroll tax holiday over the longer term that we don't create another embedded way of driving our deficit bigger you know we're going to have to sort through this but at least you know what we're starting with here is we got to get we got to get stimulus in effect we've got to get our deficit under control but we've got to create jobs and what we're Jerry and I are working on here is it is a real true job creator well the clock is ticking on that that's for sure gentlemen appreciate your time we'll watch closely during rant mark warner joining us from the hill before the

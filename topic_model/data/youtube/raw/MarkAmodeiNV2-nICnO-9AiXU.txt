up and running in Washington some members of Congress are celebrating this tax day colloid news now is Peter Zampa spoke with congressman mark and the day who says he's thrilled with what's to come after passing a massive tax overhaul since we passed that massive overhaul late last year what effects have you been seeing in your state in Nevada well it's good news for workers in Nevada in terms of their withholdings already less for next year there's multiple employers nationwide who have large footprints in Nevada Southwest Airlines Walmart among others that are quite frankly doing larger bonuses increasing benefits when you talk about maternity leave or other types of benefits health insurance stuff like that to where they've got more resources to work with to increase those benefits for those folks and this is the last year hopefully we'll see that you have to do all that paperwork maybe we'll all be on talking about postcards next year you're worried about what we're hearing out of the Congressional Budget Office about adding significant amounts of the deficit and growth slowing over the next few years well you know what when you look at the history no disrespect to the to the CBO folks but quite frankly when you see what we've done with tax cuts in the past over the years like the last few decades history doesn't bear out that conclusion the other thing I'll tell you is is is the art the most honest that you can say this as time will tell quite frankly in the past when people have had more take-home pay and companies have had more money that they kept they did things like hire more employees you know it's interesting the CBO didn't mentioned that unemployment claims we're at a forty four year low right now so guess what you want to talk about the middle class they're not filing for unemployment because they have jobs so time will tell direct answer your question not worried yet I think we need some time but so far the initial indications are good congressman thank you Carol Capitol Hill

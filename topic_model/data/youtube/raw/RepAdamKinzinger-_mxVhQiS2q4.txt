is republican congressman adam kinzinger of illinois he's a veteran of combat operations in iraq and afghanistan and a member of the house foreign affairs committee uh congressman thank you so much for joining us so members of congress have been getting briefings from the biden administration obviously without divulging any classified information what is your assessment of the situation in ukraine now more than a week into the war well i i think it's going you know better for the ukrainians than uh initially expect and i think president zielinski with his uh decision to stay and fight has made a lot it has made a lot to to basically give the morale for the ukrainians to fight the russian troops don't have morale right now um but this is going to be a long slog this is going to be really intense obviously against civilians as we've seen i think the administration has done a lot frankly to make sure we're supplying to make sure that we're uniting europe but this is just the beginning i fear of a really bad of a really bad war as far as we know you're the only member of the house and one of only two in the entire congress along with senator i think wicker advocating for nato and the u.s to enforce a no-fly zone over the skies of ukraine you're a former air force pilot you know better than i do how much that could bring the united states into direct conflict with russia given how focused putin has been on this mission and how brazen he's been why wouldn't a no-fly zone cause world war three well look i i think it's a good question i think we have to first off recognize that you know we've been used to as americans we've been blessed to not you know to always have a risk-free choice we don't have risk-free choices right now in this i mean even with what we saw with the scare with the nuclear plant we came frankly close to a huge tragedy so that said i see as this develops as this gets worse as the situation continues to decline i fear that then we will have to take broader military action particularly if there's some massive tragedy and and after we see more and more pictures come out look i know that it's frightening the idea of a no-fly zone and i do recognize there is risk with it and i think short of it we need to continue to send stinger missiles and everything else uh but that said if vladimir putin really is going to use nuclear weapons against the west in nato keep in mind this was the old soviet union playbook to always threaten it and it also shows you that if vladimir putin's willing to threaten it it's the one thing he fears but if he's really going to do that he would use him against ukraine i mean the reality is i think we're going to be forced to intervene sooner or later i hope not i think this is the cleanest and easiest thing to save ukrainian lives and send a message to push russia back further and deny that airspace to them why do you think other staunch advocates for ukraine such as congresswoman liz chaney or senator marco rubio aren't with you on this call for a no-fly zone don't look it's it's a tough decision it's a tough call i mean and again there always is a risk of escalation the difference is i fear that that risk of escalation is happening regardless it's going to continue to get bigger and bigger and uh so look i you know i was also the first member of congress to call for bombing isis and i was told that that was certainly going to start another large iraqi war six months later we're bombing isis so i hope i'm wrong especially if we don't end up doing the no-fly zone uh but i do fear that i'm not and so we in in the short of that i think whether sending drones giving ukraine drones to use as the turkish drones have been used so effectively more stinger missiles that should be done in the near term for sure nato says that russian forces are using cluster bombs uh the russians attacked with military force a nuclear power plant overnight russia continues to target civilian apartments there have been too many civilians who have died for this to be an errant missile there are global calls for the international criminal court to pursue vladimir putin for war crimes do you think that should happen and would that make a difference yeah absolutely it has to happen i mean we have to have these standards and uh and it's there's no doubt that putin is a war criminal i'm not sure he necessarily feel fears that threat i think uh he's you know content right now being isolated in the middle of russia obviously he has you know not traveled in a while we we don't understand his mental state but i think for the sake of humanity and for the sake of standards we have to pursue this there's no doubt and again i fear jake that as time goes on as every day that goes on we're going to see more and more war crimes occur uh ordered by vladimir putin and i certainly hope that doesn't include thermobaric bombs uh et cetera you're also on the january 6 select house committee um so i want to ask you about that court filing this week from the committee indicating that former president trump uh in your committee's view may have been part of a criminal conspiracy obviously you don't have the powers to charge the president um is the committee going to make a criminal referral to the justice department well i i can't answer that but what i can say is we were asked if there is a fraud and crime exemption to the attorney-client privilege between first we lost uh congressman kinzinger there in the in the uh era of zoom um congressman kinzinger thank you so much we'll have you back soon

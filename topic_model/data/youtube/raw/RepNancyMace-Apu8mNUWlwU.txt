more on this let's bring in south carolina congresswoman nancy may she serves on the transportation and infrastructure committee the question about police reform and now it's back front and center senator tim scott making another run for that of course he's your fellow south carolinian but i want to play for you some sound from corey bush she's a congresswoman who says they don't want to compromise watch we compromise on so much you know we compromise we die we compromise we die we compromise we die you know i'm i didn't come to congress to compromise on what keeps us what could keep us alive nancy means your thoughts this morning on that well it's very sad to see the violence across the country whether it's the devastating murder of george floyd or walter scott or dante wright i mean there are countless others and we do need reforms in this country we need to acknowledge that but the radical left the quarry bushes of the world the radical left not only do they want to defund the police but they want to abolish the police and i can't think of a worse idea as we're seeing spikes in violence and violent acts and attacks against citizens and also law enforcement officers right now i think it's a terrible idea we know it's a terrible idea and it's not good for our country we should be investing more in our law enforcement so we have more qualified candidates better recruits and uh we get them better training we we're seeing that training or lack of training be a real issue in some of these cases and get them the mental health counseling that they need because they're putting their lives on their line every single day that they put on their back seems like something might be moving in congress karen bass with chris wallace on fox news sunday we're going to have to negotiate that but the intent of this is we have to find a way to hold officers accountable are you willing to blow up this deal over that issue i don't know if i'm willing to blow up the deal i don't consider that blowing it up but we do have to look at ways now if lindsey graham and tim scott can show us some other way to hold officers accountable because this has been going on for just decades i mean the good news there is that she did not say no do you see some possibility here absolutely i mean there are many republicans we care about this issue we've seen the crisis across our country even in some of us in my district in charleston we've seen the devastating impact of some of these violent events i mean these are these are issues that i know as a republican as a state lawmaker before i came to congress i worked on criminal justice reform and prison reform and issues that are very very important senator tim scott has been a leader on these issues but right now in congress everything is divided everything is partisan the left doesn't want to work with republicans and that's the issue that we have today we're here we want to listen we want to be helpful we want to work together we're willing to do it but it's it's it's their it's their way or no way at all right now um we are coming up on the 100 days for president biden he will give a big speech on wednesday night um to a joint session of congress although a smaller group than usual congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez might have surprised some people by her assessment of president biden so far take a look at this i mean i one thing that i will say is that i do think that um by demonstration and president biden has definitely exceeded expectations that progressives had uh you know i'll be fraying i think a lot of us expected a much more conservative administration that's her take what about your expectations so far this hundred days well her endorsement of the biden administration you don't have to say anything else i mean there's been more damage done in the first hundred days of the biden administration than i thought possible in four years and i have a front row ticket to seeing the dismantling the taking away of our freedom and the dismantling of our constitution and you see it in hr one you're seeing it with dc statehood you're seeing it with uh with the green new deal the trillions of dollars in new spending and they're about to put on the hard-working american people the largest tax hike in american history in the middle of a pandemic so she's spot on this administration has been uh been more far left than i ever thought possible and they're doing more damage um and it's going to hurt us coming out of the pandemic not just in the short term but in the long term for years to come all right congresswoman nancy mays thank you for joining us

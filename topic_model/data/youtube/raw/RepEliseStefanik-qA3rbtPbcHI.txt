chair now recognizes for question for five minutes the gentlewoman from New York mr. phonic Thank You mr. chairman mr. fast Minh in the amicus brief submitted by Microsoft in the browning-ferris case Microsoft argued that the NLRB x' new standard will discourage companies from implementing policies and initiatives that go above and beyond their legal requirements for example market leaders with complex supply chains would be penalized simply for implementing policies on responsible product sourcing or human rights as well as labor and environmental standards in this Congress I've worked on the Millennial task force which I chair with my colleague mr. Messer who also sits on this committee and we have explored how today's companies are changing business models to attract and retain the largest segment of our workforce millenials what companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers uber and Google are telling us is that Millennials are looking for companies that have a purpose larger than the business corporate citizenship is now more than ever a key factor in Millennials interest in a job so how does this new joint employer standard actually chill positive corporate policies by American companies specifically large companies with complex supply chains I think that that's a very very good point and the answer is that large companies with supply chains and with innovative programs under this standard that the labor board has created you have to be extremely careful about the control that they exercise that is implementing policies from the top down that seems to me to be very a very doubtful enterprise if in fact this is the standard because the more control you retain the more you say you should do this this is how we want to do this the more likely it is that you're going to be considered a joint employer is there any more specific example you can provide I can't think of any sitting here right now okay thank you very much I yield back

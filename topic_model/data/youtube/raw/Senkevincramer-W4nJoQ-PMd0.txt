joining me now senator kevin kramer of north dakota senator kramer welcome back sir can you weigh in on i mean i'm reading this look i i might add the um senator manson's people were very uh hospitable and cooperative to hashing through what's actually in this bill regarding what's called generation shifting which means epa does not have the authority to end fossil fuels uh for power generation whether it's whether it's coal or natural gas but but but um although they are trying to tell me otherwise it just sounds like congress well at least in this bill provides epa with a lot more authority than they used to have uh to regulate greenhouse gases which i think is kind of a foot in the door but you're an expert on this what you think well you just had the real expert on and andrew wheeler and i think the way he differentiated between authorities and appropriations is important larry but it is nonetheless an incremental step in establishing some sort of an argument perhaps an argument that could be used in a court in the future that is congress's intent to allow this shifting even though there's no clear authority in it there's an appropriation now for it i i intend to go after that 45 million for sure that that you all were talking about that relates to to the epa or the west virginia versus epa case specific to section 111 and other sections but there's a whole host of other appropriations that give the epa weird authorities quite honestly i want to read one to you that's really important there's a section on electric generation or an electric electricity generation that has 17 million for a whole bunch of different things in other words several times it's 17 million but here's an 18 million dollar expenditure that i'm going to read it word for word and i'll emphasize a few key words page 670 of the bill for those of you that want to read along 18 million dollars to carry out this section to ensure that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from domestic electricity generation and use that's you larry use are achieved through the use of authorities of this act including through the establishment of requirements under this act incorporating the assessment larry in other words they want to give somebody 18 million dollars against the epa to regulate the generation of electricity and the use of it what does use mean they want to re and use requirements in the authorities does that mean they want to require you to cut your showers shorter at least the warm water do they want to require you to use a certain light bulb to buy a new expensive appliance to regulate the thermostat in your house what are these requirements and we ought to be very concerned about this power grab as well as obviously the spending well i mean what do you think i mean look it let's step back for a minute all this sure legislative minutiae yeah there's nothing changing here this bill is completely part of the war on fossil fuels only this time it's worse because they want to jack up seven or 800 billion worth of taxes along with it which boggles the money i mean you know that's to me that what you got here is the two 250 300 billion dollars of social spending for obamacare by the way for families that don't need it got a gigantic tax hike which will make the recession worse there is no inflation reduction but you have a war against fossil fuels which along with the federal spending might well make inflation worse in the future i mean to me that's what's the essence of this uh of this bill other than that it's a great bill yeah right i know besides that what did you like about the play yeah i know i get that exactly it's just off but you're exactly right and and they may very well succeed at this you know it's as you know it comes down to kirsten cinema at this point so they may well very well succeed except for this you and others are sounding the alarm guys like me and my 49 closest friends in the united states senate are sounding the alarm and we're preparing with a whole host of amendments that will bring to the floor and we'll force people like joe manchin to correct course if they're willing to do that and and i'm telling you larry my goal is to make it darn uncomfortable for democrats to either vote for this package or to not vote for some of the amendments that help clean some of this stuff up well look at you know not to put too fine a partisan point on it but since i want to kill the bill it's a partisan bill that's all it is right it's a partisan bill that's exactly right it was sprung on the gop at the last minute after the chips plus vote but the thing is every race every senate race every house race i don't care governors whatever newt gingrich has made this point in his newsletter republicans should confront democrats about where they stood on this bill and on the provisions of the tax provisions the social spending provisions the anti-fossil fuel provisions because senator kramer and polls i've seen folks do not want this they don't want it well even if they think they want it larry when they see their inflation go higher when they see the price at the pump go higher the price of food go higher when they see that they're gonna have to start rationing their food when they're gonna have to you know start rationing their travels which is already happening when you see personal credit personal debt going up to 16 17 trillion dollars as people max out their credit cards just to pay the bills that's going to have a negative effect on on election day for democrats the problem is between now and election day we have to hold these people to account and that's the point you're making that's very important that's what we're going to do when we have the voterama when we offer up our amendments when we force the debate when we require democrats to explain themselves on the stuff but it's also why chuck schumer did this so quickly it's why they they did it right after to your point right after the chip's vote and why they want to get this done before the weekend's over because they don't want democrats to go home before they vote on this because they're going to get an earful when they do you know he wants to get right yes to that he doesn't even want to let the cbo score it over 10 year periods because he knows that's going to look like a horror show and it is i mean some of this stuff is just crazy anyway senator kevin kramer thank you sir as always illuminating the issue we appreciate it

South Dakota Republican senator Mike rounds joins me he's a member of the Senate intelligence Committee in the Senate armed services committee good evening sir and um are we in trouble and I say that because we've got a spy balloon from China sweeping the United States we hear these reports from the military that this seems that we're almost in an arms race with China we know that Iran wants nuclear weapons they're moving in that direction we know that the Russia violated the new start treaty by not allowing inspections by U.S we've got North Korea I don't see anything moving in sort of a peaceful direction do you have some thought on this probably the one thing that's moving us in a peaceful direction is the creation and the deployment of the B-21 stealth bomber and the creation and the deployment of the Sentinel missiles we've also got our our deep sea uh submarines that we are upgrading and so it is that deterrence which will provide for peace if we don't stay on that course it can be very very expensive but right now China is challenging us on the air Land and Sea furthermore in cyber in artificial intelligence and in space in all areas they are trying to take the upper hand they're doing it on an offensive capability approach we've been doing this for years in terms of providing deterrence we have to continue on that line we've got to upgrade we've got to continue to upgrade our nuclear command and control if we do if we stay on time and on target then we will have peace if we don't stay on time on target then they will look at us and they'll wonder whether or not maybe they might be able to take the upper hand and they will start making dictations to us about the way that they want the world to uh to exist in the future I turned out of the Spy balloon China says is a weather balloon we allotted to sweep across the United States it's now been several days around the Senate Intel committee have you gotten all your questions answered about I realize some of your National Security but are you satisfied do you have all your questions answered about that no and in fact the one major question that I think we have to have and it's a policy question is who made the decision that we should allow this this uh this information gathering system to enter our airspace and then to proceed across the entire continent the right decision was made to shoot it down it was just one continent too late and so what we've got to do is to work our way back through find out whether or not there was a lack of communication if it was a matter of a policy determination who made that policy uh and and where the decision was actually made those are questions that we have to answer yet and we've got to be able to make sure that we fix it so that it doesn't happen again you know if a house burns down the fireman gets to the house pretty fast and puts out the fire it seems like getting those answers I mean I would have expected I mean something so important as a spy balloon from China and if that the Senate Intel committee would get the answers right away and you know I don't understand you know I realize it's only been a few days but that's just a few days too much for me we agree so um what are you going to do about it I mean how are you going to get those answers and when are you going to get them look look this I I'm new on the committee uh I've been to basically three of their meetings so far but I have been on the armed services committee for the entire time that I've been in the United States Senate I I can tell you that there is real consternation on the part of members of the house and the Senate Republican and Democrat alike that the information has not been forthcoming and that we are very frustrated by it and we're going to do everything we can to correct it it turned out to tonight what uh what does he want to hear the president talk about tonight well it would be nice if you talk about why our prices are up 13 and a half percent since he came into office it'd be nice to find out why it is that we are now more dependent on our adversaries for oil and energy than we've ever been in the last I don't know dozen years or so it'd be really nice if we could find out whether or not he is really sincere and continuing to build our military resources up but I suspect that we'll probably hear more of a political speech we'll hear him talk about items in terms of uh the people that he's brought in as guests some of whom we should absolutely respond to accordingly and and respect them and the deeds and the Deeds that they've done but I suspect we'll all also hear a lot of propaganda about the great things that his administration has done I'm not so sure I buy it and I don't think the American people will buy it do you expect a big Showdown coming up on this debt ceiling or will it be worked out good question I look I I think we'll work out the issues around the debt ceiling uh we're not going to let the full faith and credit of the United States government go by the wayside but this is an excellent opportunity for us to talk about deficit spending and part of the reason that you have to have that discussion is because there is no other place to do it when we talk about our Appropriations process all 12 appropriation bills when you put them all together they call it an Omnibus that even when you talk about all separate 12 appropriation bills you're only talking about 30 percent about what we actually spend the other 70 percent are on autopilot they're the items that nobody ever talks about because we don't vote on them they're on autopilot and if you're not voting on it you're not managing them and you don't make them more efficient and then you don't get the big picture about where the deficit spending is actually at and so if the only focus that we have is on whether or not we should spend money on defense or a non-defense discretionary we're not talking about the other 70 percent of what we spend every single year that goes right on through and it has since 1970 before without having the Congress of the United States responsible for taking a vote on it we've talked about it for years we need to start voting on the entire amount that we're spending not just the defense and non-defense discretionary Senator Mike rounds thank you sir hope you come back thanks sir

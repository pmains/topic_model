Governor Inslee welcome back to the House Energy and Commerce Committee out of curiosity I just wanted to start out by asking you how you traveled here and what the carbon footprint was associated with that travel and if you had laid out specific steps to offset that that impact yes I intend to develop a clean energy system for the United States and the state of Washington and that will be the most tremendous offset of anything I've ever done in my entire life because we will give my grandchildren an opportunity to have a life that's not severely degraded and I travel here the same way that everybody on this committee travel here which is on a jet airplane and we are now developing biofuels and we have developed biofuels in my state something we should be proud of at Washington State University and Alaska Airlines that have developed a biofuel that we can fly we've flown a Boeing airplane across the Atlantic Ocean yes thank you and I'm excited about the biofuels too because it helps us address what's going on on our forests governor Inslee as you know in Washington State our largest source of clean renewable reliable affordable energy is hydropower seventy percent the Colombian Snake River system provide important energy for us they also provide irrigation to water our crops making agriculture our number one industry flood control preventing catastrophic floods that we had in years past barging a product up and down the river it's really a superhighway with significantly less carbon impact than trucks or trains so I just had some yes-or-no questions I wanted to ask you do you support removal of the dams I support what we're doing in our state which we have a task force to help respond to the federal court order to evaluate the potential of that both from the positive and negative consequences and there are both positive and negative consequences and I support a way for Washington citizens to have their voices heard so that they can look at the cost to agriculture of difficulty moving wheat for instance they can look for the costs of transportation but they can also look at the potential positives from the salmon recovery standpoint and as you know we're in a federal court or to determine all of these things so I support Washington State citizens being able to have a system which we've developed as you know on our task force to be able to address that issue and I'll be working with citizens to evaluate all of those things okay I have some other questions do you acknowledge that fish rates are maintaining even levels or even increasing as was outlined in your own state of the salmon report I'm sorry you say fish rates yes fish return rates up and down the river no I am NOT confident that over a long term that we we have stability on the Columbia system and the reason I say that is that the system is dependent on things in the salmon life cycle that are not on the system itself they depend for instance on food change out in the Pacific Ocean and unfortunately we are seeing some degradation of those food change because of climate change because of increasing temperatures both in the mainstream and in the ocean and indifferent and acidification of the ocean yes so the answer is no do you agree if the dams are removed Washington's agriculture industry will be negatively impacted it would be if we did not find some other alternative for transportation and that's one of the things that this group is going to be evaluating is to determine whether there are feasible alternatives for transportation and that's something that I think that deserves a great scrutiny where everyone's voice is heard to look at those potential alternatives and there may be potential alternatives in in rail and trucking and the like and I think that that is appropriately investigated in a real sense where we can really get down to it here's the reason I say that I think it's important for people to have a forum to look at this on a scientifically credible way rather than just press releases or bumper stickers we need people listening to one another and I hope that that'll happen okay I think I'll just go to my last question which is about your recent travel expenses and increased security detail expenses to run for president do you plan to reimburse the taxpayers of Washington State for these expenses you're incurring on non official business and do you plan to offset the carbon emissions associated with that non official travel so we plan to fold the law and and plan to follow the current law and that's what we'll be doing thank you I yield back

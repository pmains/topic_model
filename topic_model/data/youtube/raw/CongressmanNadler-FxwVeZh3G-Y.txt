joining me now Democratic Representative Mike Honda of California who was sent to an internment camp but he was nine months old and lived there from 1942 to 1945 representative Jerry Nadler a Democrat of New York congressman Honda leaned again with you what was your response when you saw this statement that was put out by the mayor of Roanoke well I was very very saddened by what he had said and the things that he said was very inaccurate first of all he called the japanese-americans Japanese foreign nationals and we were actually US born citizens 120,000 of us two-thirds of us were natural-born citizens and the rest of us could not become naturalized citizens because there were fair laws that prohibited that and so you know it was either a comment that was out of ignorance and just needed more information or he's just not well-informed congressman Nadler that there's been a lot of discussion about the how the u.s. reacted to the possibility of accepting Jewish refugees and particularly around 38 and 39 you know there's generally this rule of thumb it's called Godwin's law right that you shouldn't be invoking the Nazis to make arguments in present day is this a fair parallel to draw at this point in time I think it is a fair parallel to draw it has nothing to do with the Nazis it has to do with the reaction of Americans to refugees in that case from the Nazis in this case from Isis and the the the hysteria was similar these were people in desperate desperate need and and people wanted to reject them on the grounds that maybe they were in this case terrorists in that case communists or or whatever in 1940 President Roosevelt proposed a bill to admit 20,000 Jewish children who might otherwise perish in the heart in Europe over quota it was rejected by the Congress after a congressman from Mississippi got up on the on the floor of the house and said that 20 that they may be 20,000 cute kids now but in 15 years they'll be 20,000 damn tykes and his direct quote and it defeated the bill and so this is the exact same Asteria congressman Honda you know it just it seems like the rhetoric in the house and on the campaign trail has gotten really really ugly if I can say that sure are you having conversations with your colleagues over there about are you sure you want to say what you're saying do you recognize how that how history might judge some of the things that are being said and in the people's house right now no I haven't had a lot of conversations so if those who have been saying that but have been a lot of talk among our own colleagues who have the same mind you know today we have about fourteen Asian Americans in Congress we're in 1942 there was zero and so we're talking among ourselves about how we're going to approach this our situation and I think that we have colleagues like Jerry Nadler who understands the situation and you know jared is very very correct that in 1939 this country rejected 900 Jews who were coming here as refugees and we turned them away that's just as you know today would try and turn away Syrian refugees from this country this is not what America's about this is not what our character is about and also our Constitution is also one that we really have to be cognizant of the fact that 120,000 Japanese were put into camp was a breach of the constitutional protection and that created a lot of out of just discord in the japanese-american community just within ourselves because there were some of us who wanted to prove that we're 100 percent Americans by responding to the draft and there was those who said I will respond to a draft if you released my parents from an unconstitutional car serration and then if you do that and I will respond to the draft and so even to this day we have discussions among our own communities about what happened to us apply the government in 1942 so we really have to be vigilant about what it is that we're all about and the Constitution's are based Anker we have a history in the traveler we have a history in this country in times of war and in times of crisis of reacting of reacting in panic the Japanese incarceration was one panic we usually end up apologizing about thirty years later Congress formally passed an apology and compensation in 1988 for the Japanese internment of 40 years later we had the Alien and Sedition actually rejected refugees we passed the the racist Immigration Act of 1924 designed to cut off Jewish and Greek and Italian in Eastern European immigration the Almanac of American politics wrote that if a racist xenophobic Congress had not passed that act in 1924 maybe 2 million of the 6 million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis would have been in the United States instead so we have a history and we should learn from that history right now we should look where the threat is you know 7 of the 8 culprits in Paris were French and Belgian nationals who can come to this country without even a visa that the danger is from people like that or from people here who are radicalized not wealth netted refugees refugees are fleeing the people that were that we're against they're fleeing the tyrants and the murderers then we should help we vet them we make sure nobody is dangerous among them the danger that is people who are here Odin come here without anybody yeah I think Jerry's right in pointing out that acts of terrorism precipitates this fear against the people that were not familiar with Pearl Harbor precipitated the incarceration japanese-americans just as the bombing in Paris had is precipitating in this country a response a negative response against Syrian refugees in this country and I think that that that's gotta stop in our systems working in terms of Vettii the the series that were here they've been here since we've since 2011 we've been receiving the Syrian refugees and not one has performed any acts of terrorism all right Representative Mike Condon representative Jerry Nadler thanks to both

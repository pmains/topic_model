thank you madam chairwoman we are here today because of Democrats desire to continue a sham investigation which has been ongoing now for over a year last year Democrats threatened the oil and gas industry with subpoena's months before even inviting them to a hearing despite the appearance of oil and gas CEOs at a six-hour Committee hearing on October the 28th last year chairwoman Maloney still subpoenaed all the hearing Witnesses for documents right now we should be talking about skyrocketing gas and oil prices and what can be done to help Americans however that is not the purpose of this hearing today because Democrats are out of touch with the reality that millions of Americans are experiencing inflation but this is not surprising because during a hearing last October Democrats asked Mike worth are you embarrassed as an American company that your production is going up really why would he be embarrassed that production is increasing fossil fuel is an imperative for our country to properly function and it is stunning that people in this hearing room actually think that we can eliminate fossil fuel do you know that everything made from Plastics comes from fossil fuels in the Petro chemical industry um do you drink water from a plastic bottle do you get hand sanitizer from a plastic bottle do you have a laptop computer a television how about the glasses that you wear or even the easel back there that's holding that sign has plastic on it how about the insulation on electrical wire electrical wire of which you could not build an electric vehicle without insulation on electric wire and that comes from hydrocarbons all of it comes from hydrocarbons so moving away from Plastics made from hydrocarbons is clearly clearly a recipe for disaster but if we're going to move away from it what are we moving toward what is the substitute there is not one not only are Democrats out of touch but they are clearly deflecting our attention from the fact that neither the Democrats in Congress or the bite Administration have a plan to address the energy crisis one day President Biden commits to cut to cutting gas pollution in half by 2030 and the next President Biden attacks the domestic companies for not producing enough energy over the Fourth of July weekend this past summer President Biden Stoops solo is to demand that gas stations abide by his will asking small businesses to cut prices across the country as the solution to his failed anti-oiling gas policies I would like to ask unanimous consent to submit for the record this article that was published by the National Review on July 6 2022. without objection so ordered thank you Biden's shameful gas station attack Mr schellenberger as you know plant Vogel reactors three and four in Georgia are the only two nuclear power reactors to be built in decades in America in my Georgia constituents will benefit from it every day with inexpensive and clean energy and by the way thank you for your testimony concerning energy density as it was very enlightening to see where actually the energy you know of each particular product rests on the ladder of energy density that was uh that was I hope every person in this hearing room really takes that to heart so what role do you think nuclear energy should play in meeting America's current and more importantly future enemy our energy needs thank you for the question sir I mean nuclear is the queen of power of all sources of electricity it's the most environmentally sound it's the most secure and of course it's always been a huge priority for every presidential Administration the United States because it is a dual use technology it always has been it's a serious issue we need to significantly expand we need a green nuclear deal not a Renewables expansion that would increase our dependence on China we need to reduce our dependence nuclear is the key to that my concern sir is that we've we're losing the valuable intellectual property and skills that were developed among welders and pipe fitters and other workers to build the vocal plants we need we need industrial Security in the United States that's what Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows and that means that we need a plan to build out nuclear take it from its today 19 to 50 percent of electricity between now and 2050 we've always had a national champions model the right model is two major nuclear plant building firms we might have one partnership with the Japanese French or Koreans but we need to expand nuclear power it's a national security imperative at this point sir well thank you I certainly agree with you in that and um it's uh it's a shame that we have only seen two nuclear plants in the last 40 to 50 years come online I think we need more too thank you for that and with that I yield back

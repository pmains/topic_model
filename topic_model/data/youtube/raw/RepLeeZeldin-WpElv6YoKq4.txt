Mr Speaker I rise today to bring awareness to the campaign for decency which was launched by Lisa H enoki a part-time resident of my district who is with us here today in the gallery operating out of the 1st congressional district of New York and Shelter Island the campaign for decency is a nonpartisan organization that seeks to bring civility back to our nation miss Joan okie was inspired to launch this campaign after witnessing much of the bitter division in our country and the inability of many Americans to engage in civil productive discussion as Americans we cherish our freedom to dissent but must always bear in mind that these debates must be productive and substantive in July miss Janaki mailed out 535 decency buttons to every single representative and senator she describes the campaign as quote a simple reminder of the basic standards of decency that every American deserves regardless of their political views I'm proudly wearing this button here today to join in miss Joan Okies call for you and Lee both here in Congress and together as citizens of the greatest country on Earth his campaign sets an example for us all to abide by as we strive to reach across the aisle in a bipartisan fashion Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back

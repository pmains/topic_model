about what these policies actually mean for too long people focus on arbitrary issues like deadlines and top lines and personalities between factions and they don't actually talk about the substance of the bills and that's what i really care about because it's about the policy that's going to affect people not personalities or arbitrary deadlines and that's why i appreciate having literally one of my dear friends and mentors and someone who has given me a lot of support over the years and as a champion not only for economic justice health care equality and affordability but also making sure that we're actually meeting the needs of people where they are and that is congressman gregory meeks from the fifth congressional district out of new york and we wanted to really have this conversation with all of you i'm so glad to be joined by another dear colleague and community warrior senator dean neal represents the fourth district in the state senate and she is carrying on a legacy that was set by her father senator joe neal who was the first african-american to serve in the state senate um for 32 years and i followed him in that seat and now senator dina neal is carrying it to a whole nother level and what i love about my senator is she is also very focused on policy like you know a lot of people talk about again the politics of issues and this is a a non-official event we're doing so we're going to talk about the politics of how we get this done yeah but the policy of who these bills actually benefit at every level and my senator calls me texts me emails me about what they're doing in the legislature what we're doing on the federal level she wants to know how these bills are going to get implemented and what they can do on the state level to make it all work because that's the other thing we can pass bills on the federal level but they have to be able to work on the state and local level so i want to thank you as well for all of the you do but i call congressman meek sees chairman he's chairman of the congressional black caucus pact but he's also chairman of the foreign affairs committee okay and he's chairman of uh and one of the senior members i should say on the uh house financial services committee which oversees a number of important areas including housing which i know we're going to touch on today uh but but we're going to talk about the buildback better agenda and what it means for families specifically um black families because it's important for us to really uh break down these policies and understand that we're trying to address systemic issues as well right i'm currently leading uh the racial equity initiative for the ways and means committee along with jimmy gomez and terry sewell and included in the buildback better agenda are a number of key provisions that we identified as part of our racial equity work and their priority to the white house the president specifically and the vice president their priority for the house democrats and the senate democrats uh and their priority for the american people and the folks we represent and all of you so we're going to talk about that a little bit more but let me begin by just saying that you know i'm proud to have already voted for the key provisions in the buildback agenda not once in ways and means but twice as a member of the budget committee as well and i'm ready to get this bill passed out of the house and through the senate and to the president's desk uh by the end of this year because along with the bipartisan infrastructure bill that i support it is going to transform lives and it is a once in a generation investment in people and it's about not leaving anybody behind any community behind and making sure that we actually address some of these issues it it was clear and you all know this even before the crisis that we needed to invest in and expand key sectors like health and home care which we'll get into and that workers and families need to be able to keep more of their hard-earned money which this bill includes a tax cut for middle-class families 97 percent of the families in my district are already benefiting from the child tax cut the biden tax cut the child tax credit um and today is actually the fourth installment of those advanced payments that people are already getting in their paychecks so i'm really proud of that and in nevada it's already pumped 179.1 million dollars into nevada's economy each month each month the child tax credit and the housing choice voucher programs helping some of the most vulnerable communities get ahead by reducing child poverty addressing food insecurity and homelessness which is a major problem and concern so our attendees here today will share some of your own personal stories and the work that you've been doing on how the legislation impacts you and your families and and friends and the work that you do and your testimonials are incredibly important to our efforts to pass this bill because we have to keep this focused on you i get stopped constantly in the halls of congress by press and they ask me well you know are you going to do this by this date are you going to agree by this time i said talk to me about a substance of the bill and i'll answer your question because that's what my constituents want to want to know is what is this bill going to do for for them absolutely yeah so i'd like to start on the subject of housing and addressing the homelessness crisis so i'm going to hand it over to congressman meeks to talk about some of those key provisions based on his leadership on the house financial services committee so take it over first let me thank congressman nevada's lucky to have him he is tireless he is determined and focused he is an individual that not only represents the people of las vegas and nevada what he does is he fills them he feels their needs and concerns so you can tell it's more than just a legislative job for him it's a mission to deliver and to help people have a better life and that's the kind of representative that you want and that's why he's fought and that's why it's extremely important that he sits on such an influential committee as the ways it means which is the only committee that is included in the united states constitution which is um the committee that makes and sets the rules of the road really uh especially when they deal with taxation and other things so that we can have a better america and that's the agenda that he came into washington d.c with and so i want to thank him for all of his work in that regards you know i was sad to lose him he was i had him on financial services for a little while but we needed him uh and the congressional caucus needed him in that slot at ways and means it's not an easy slot to get to so let me just say this first you know just listening to him summarize i almost feel like as opposed to speaking as a member of congress to speak as an african-american in america because it is my life i grew up in public housing my parents before the access to public housing was living in poor housing conditions which would have dwarfed my opportunities not only as far as economics is concerned but pride but the ability to move forward you know as far as food is concerned on the table mental health is important education is important but if you don't have good housing it hurts all of those things and um when you think about what we're doing and build it back better um if my prayers didn't have public housing now we've gone back 60 years ago wouldn't be here and we have not done anything meaningful in public housing since 1974. so it's time that we do something to make sure that we build more affordable housing and or repair some of the affordable housing that continue to exist because it has now been overdue for repayment so we put money in the buildback better bill so that approximately 80 billion goes towards public housing to ensure that individuals despite their level of will and wealth have access to safe and affordable rental housing also all across america we see other folks need section 8 housing and so we put approximately another 90 billion dollars towards section 8 housing uh dealing with choice vouchers and project-based rental assistance which will significantly reduce here in las vegas and all over the country homelessness and housing instability there's another approximately 10 billion dollars to fund a new hud program for first generation down payment assistance and housing counseling so you see my parents lived them first in dilapidated housing that was barely a place where you could live fortunately the government stood up and had public housing and then from there my parents was able to get into a program so they could buy their house so there was a gradual move up and then when you buy your house you also help them create wealth and move forward and helps help others and so there is another uh as i said 10 billion dollars to fund a new program for first generation down payment and assistance housing and counseling and build it back substance what he said does the plus talk about the policy let's talk about the suffix let's talk about what it helps there um and then of course we know that lead paint is all over in place so there's approximately another 10 billion dollars to address the lead hazards that ensure that we have healthy homes so i mean so these are major significant policy decisions that we have made that we can build that america better especially coming out of this pandemic and we knew that we had problems even before the pandemic congressman horsford you know we talked about ways and means they also included that he was the leader in the neighborhood homes investment act uh of which i followed him you know he talked to me about it and so i jumped onto them he said mix you better get on this bill and so i jumped on the bill and became a coast guard but it gives credits would be used to cover the gap between development costs and sale prices up to 35 percent of eligible development costs so that we can rebuild our communities yeah this is something that this man is doing and moving to to make to make to make happen to make happen so i'm delighted to be here with him because of his leadership you know um the way it works in washington our clothes on this is that when you are on a certain committee you get to develop expertise stephen hospit initially came in he was on financial services so he knows this stuff that i'm talking about he's got that expertise and then he's taking it to another level and all of us then go to him to say stephen what should we do when we start talking about tax credits you talk about the child tax credit for each day early et cetera how can we follow you he gives the ideas to us so that we can follow so we thank you steve thank you for your leadership in washington dc uh not only for the congressional caucus but for all americans uh what you do we really appreciate your day [Applause] thank you chairman and you don't have to thank me i'm doing what all of you elected me to do uh i'm proud and honored to be able to do but we've got a lot of work to make sure people understand what these what these bills do what the provisions are and how they help people and and the chairman just articulated a number of key elements just in the housing area and we were in an event with chairwoman maxine waters who's over financial services and she is working hard to make sure you know as we compromise on this buildback better and the number that these priorities that help people are maintained we can't do everything but we've got to do the things that people need most and i know here in my district and throughout southern nevada housing obviously is a big part of what we have to do and and the chairman articulated not only for public housing and affordable housing and how housing for the unhoused the homeless particularly our veterans but also helping first-time first generation home buyers this bill also includes 10 billion dollars to help first-time first-generation homeowners get down payment assistance that neighborhood tax credit program west las vegas and other communities like it that we've been talking about these these older homes that are well established you know this is the segregated part of las vegas from the history right the history of las vegas this is the only place black people could live is over in historic west side well now the very homes are being devalued because of a lack of investment because of a lack of access to funding to help maintain the home this would actually help those homeowners one keep their home two not deal with gentrification and three get the investments to do things like improve the roof do weatherization plumbing and at the same time put people to work in our community to do it so it's a win-win and we're taking the federal tax code and using it now this bill does a lot of things but this is the substance of what it actually does so it creates jobs like i just talked about it cuts taxes for middle class families and it's going to help lower over overall costs for working families across a number of areas health care housing climate change and other issues but i want to turn this over now to senator deana neil because that emphasis that i was just talking about around community development she's been working on this for a very long time first in the assembly now in the state senate the new market tax credit we're reauthorizing that at the federal level she's making sure the state's putting more money into that uh the the investment around low affordable tax credits for low-income housing development and we keep saying where's the affordable housing we have tax credits they have to be administered at the state level once we pass the federal law for the tax credit benefit then it has to get implemented at the state level she's the policy maker who's making sure that that's happening that's why we talk all the time so that she knows what we're doing i know what she's doing and how we can help so i'm going to turn it over to you senator dean and neal thank you [Applause] you know new markets we in the state legislature have managed to get it's been 400 million dollars come through the state from 2013 to 2019 it was reauthorized in 2019 and it's consistently been my legislation but the focus has been how to leverage it within north las vegas and west las vegas in order to be the gap right fill the gap around development and figure out when we when we talk about how to advance the bilo center over there that's where new markets comes into play new markets comes into play for mixed housing right development so when career wants to talk about um developing c street and jackson and revitalizing when he wants to do the business at the bottom and the housing at the top new markets is one of the tools that can come in and leverage that development and actually make that help manifest right because it fills in the gap right so you can take the redevelopment money you can take new markets and then you can establish exactly what you want and so it's a significant tool and i'm super grateful because when when they were reauthorizing it uh i was literally like uh right yeah trying to figure out how to take the new markets and leverage into the hundred plan so that it can move faster and we had a whole meeting with the cdes which are the the folks who have the tax credits and come in and pick projects that they want to do and so when they sat with careers team they were like we want to do pretty much all of it like we just need the federal allocation to take what we have at the state and figure out how we can leverage that and so that's the real life like how what does that mean and you see like new marcus tax credit you're like ah what tax credit is okay nobody cares but it really does impact what we do at the local level because i've tried to make sure that it had a real life impact that's the only reason why it's advanced in the way that it has um in terms of like the housing tax credit like we're literally at the ground level trying to figure out how to revitalize older neighborhoods how do we how do we move in and leverage and kind of build like a seven layer cake right where he was talking about weatherization where you take what's in the i think it's in the funding dollars where you can go in and do lead remediation right you can go in and mediate the lead make sure there's no blood poisoning which gives you the entryway right into a 1965 home a 1970 home a 1980 home and then figure out how to take the left the weatherization build from there the energy tax credits the light tech and then change that house right and at the end of the day what's good about going in and being able to revitalize you get a little bump right in in your taxes and and we get a bump as a city in in that small incremental tax growth but it's not to the point where it puts you in the base but it doesn't raise your tax every year but it puts you back in the base where you've aged out right so in nevada i don't know and i'm gonna stop being wonky but in nevada at 50 years you age out of the base right so your house is no longer in the bank so whatever your that last amount was whether now you pay 5 000 a year that is now it we don't accumulate anything else but we do it funding for our schools it affects funding for other areas of the community needs especially our schools right so there's a cumulative effect to keep those properties working and improvements is a small way to do that which helps you right helps the homeowner but then it helps to leverage the economic investment because everything is aesthetic right and at the point where you can build it up and then you start talking to commercial developers saying invest here invest here you can think about the rooftops right because the rooftops now look aesthetically pleasing you have a little bit of bump in that tax base and then you can talk about what are the benefits that are going to come to that developer to help lift up the rest of that space and so that you have to think about those things in those terms because i always do how what's the ecosystem how to develop and how to maintain it right yeah that's great and that was not wonky because when i walk my district yeah and i talk to constituents throughout my district and yeah i represent you know all of north las vegas historic west las vegas the northwest part of las vegas including my rural areas i was just in tonopah and i was out in hawthorne and up in shers yesterday they benefit from this too so this is not just some quote-unquote entitlement program for certain communities this is how you put the tax code to work for working people so when the republicans were in charge of the white house of the senate and of the house what did they do they gave the biggest tax cut to the biggest corporations and to billionaires the ultra-rich 83 of the benefit of that tax cut went to the top 1 with very little going to those of us in middle middle class in our communities so now democrats are in charge of the white house of the house we have 50 50 in the senate so thank god for vice president harris who breaks that tie when we're in the majority we're talking about giving tax cuts to middle-class families we're about using the tax code to help homeowners in communities like mine and yours we're about prioritizing the needs of people not of the very wealthy and that's why this substance matters and why we will get this bill done and i'll just say and then i'm going to turn it over to michelle is to this point of the community and the development in the community and you know we hear from our seniors especially and and those um families who made and have taken over that property so i grew up right here on d and leonard on the corner it was a yellow house now it's great but you know that's that's where i grew up and my father was shot and killed just down the street at lake mead at ingelstad when i was 19. but when i walk my community my district and i see the homes that are in disrepair the roofs that are falling in the weatherization that is not provided for which hurts the efficiency of that home and the cost of their power in the summer months when we have had the hottest temperatures on record in las vegas that's why this matters so this is not wonky because this is about helping people in the policy that matters and helping real people not big corporations who claim that they're people so michelle who is the secretary treasurer of sciu 1107 and has literally been a champion on these issues she went up to carson city to advocate for health and home care workers and i want to commend you and all of seiu and your members including rosetta who's here today for bringing the voice of care workers to this discussion so we we're we're talking about buildback better because there's been so much emphasis about the infrastructure bill well the bipartisan infrastructure bill i'm for it i'm a sponsor i'm a member of the problem solvers which is half republican half democrats i meet every week with republicans to talk about issues of common ground that we can work on and the bipartisan infrastructure bill is that bill and i'm for that but guess what ninety percent of the benefit of that bill goes to populations that aren't women wow so how are you going to pass the infrastructure bill when the people who were disproportionately affected during the pandemic yes and the recession are women and specifically women of color so i believe it's a false choice to do one and not the other the choice is we do both and i am fighting for the provisions of the care economy for home health care for the health sector because you all were on the front lines of this and still are and we're not going to leave you behind we're not going to leave you out and i want to turn it over to you to talk about the substance of what this bill does for you and your members thank you so much we appreciate the time and space thank you for having us it was nice to meet you and i heard that you've gotten safely and i will just tell you when we have our wonderful home care workers and we thank senator neal for championing our bill critically i mean it was just an honor and in 2018 uh we had approximately 13 000 personal care workers in nevada providing home care services to you know our senior population our most vulnerable population um giving them resources such as bathing toileting eating going in their homes every day and 84 were women that were providing this service and our workforce is already disproportionately made up of women of color we make up 17 and that is total 35 population for the home care workforce and congressman horsford and senator neil and seiu1107 have been championing to fight for home care workers to have a voice and a seat at the table for a long time and the voice at the table the growth of home care started because the baby boomers moving out of las vegas and wanting that dignity respect and to retire in their own home and a lot of our home care workers started off making 11 and 7 cents per hour i'm gonna stay with you seven cents per hour about fifteen thousand dollars per year exactly i heard it you feel that you felt that right fifteen thousand dollars per year um they struggled with inconsistent hours not being able to put enough food on their table and 17 are still relying on medicaid and other government assistance just to get by while they're providing a health care service to other people they couldn't even afford to provide health care for themselves or their families you heard that like i felt that again they couldn't even provide healthcare services to themselves or their families but yet they're continuing to work every day during this pandemic and they chose to and they wanted to they had to struggle with getting ppe from their employer they had to struggle with paying for their own certifications you'll hear the stories their truths women of color paying for their own certifications just to go to work making sure they have car insurance making sure they had gas you know they're not reimbursed for these things eleven dollars and seven cents per hour and making sure they have to do all of that still so we are very excited about the build that better plan we absolutely are um you know just citing low wages one out of two workers left before their first year because they couldn't afford it you can't afford to be continuing to be poor workings and so you know prior to covert um 19 uh we knew that we needed to fill 87 more home care jobs and again it's because people are moving here we have a rapid expansion of senior living in nevada and we want people to come we want people nevada is beautiful like we enjoy nevada we want people to come but we also want our home care workers to be taken care of because they want to take care of other people as well and so we are excited um that congresswoman hartsford has brought us to the table to talk about you know issues especially the women of color like i think sometimes we're forgotten and we know that because of you and leaders like you we will not be forgotten so we really truly appreciate that because we're here and we're not going anywhere and so you know we just want to thank you and we are hoping that the hb cs investments in the building better plan will help our home care workers get better wages and better living conditions for themselves so that they can continue to take care of our most senior population and i think you too i love you both i do i mean i appreciate you you have no idea like i i go to sleep knowing that i hope that i have someone like you to take care of me when i when i become hello and thank you for your time and coming out um just like michelle said she said eleven dollars i started off at 9.50 wow and that was 12 years ago today i'm making 10 and 25 cents um through the pandemic i lost people that i loved that i shared time with i mean three and four five years and they just was popping boom boom i'm like they're damn and no one told me no one asked and said rosita are you all right is there something that we can do no no one asks but they did ask me to take on another client come on rosita i'm like well this is kobe but i love what i do i love what i do i even service the oldest woman in las vegas audrey james she lives right down here on reveal i had to you know my water bill went up my power building up i every day because my husband has a underlying issue he has diabetes and he was laid off there was no money coming in and with one client i was bringing in 167 every two weeks but i'm a child of god and i know that he took care of me and i just push on because like i've told michelle like i told my friend it's not about us it's about the next generation of hometown workers being able to be educated they sent us in with no ppe no no no real training and they were saying well don't get too close why would you not get too close when we gotta put a person in the shower bathe them touch them how was it so but no one said we're gonna give you some hats and payrolls either because you're out there doing it i just was told last night don't go to work because your client has not been certified and i'm going to what and this is the only fire i got and i'm going lord what is going to happen to him i had already made it by my mind i was going to go anyway i told him i said look here i'm going down there to talk to dana neal and mr horospur no what has happened to you before i got here they call me my company now call me go ahead and go just we just gotta wait for the lady to get certified but you go ahead and go i'm like okay is i'm gonna get in trouble for this no you know what i'm saying and and and he was so this man was so upset he could have had a heart attack he can't walk he's in a chair he was so upset with the va yep this story go on and on and on and i'm just so grateful to be able to tell you that the mental state of honking workers i mean it's no it's some of us are crazy well no not someone was all over the place because we've been work we're overworked we're underpaid no one cares it seems like no one cares but i know you guys do and it's going to take time it's going to take us as healthcare workers to stand up for each other you know and ask for what we want and what we need and we have a place at the table now that we have we went up to the capitol you know it's just great and i'm glad i'm just glad that i could tell you my story because as soon as i leave here i'm going to go service thank you for doing that yeah and you are essential not only to show up but you're essential enough to be paid not just a good wage but a family sustaining range and i know that's what you all fought for with sb 340 and the leadership already but that has been leading the way we need a federal policy to help support this you know in some cases not every state is doing it the way we are because again democrats are in charge here with a governor and a legislature who puts people first that's not happening everywhere and we need a federal bill so that it's codified so we don't have to worry yeah next time around that they don't prioritize home care and it's the people you care for but it's also you i mean you you to to to be working as long as you've been working and and making what you're making and then they they want to say the wealthy shouldn't pay their share so that we can give your profession yeah yes what you need as essential that's the choice they're telling us you why why are you why do you want to have the wealthy pay their fair share to pay for this bill this is a paid for bill this is not a a bill the buildback better act is not something that's going to add to the deficit we have we have a deficit we need to manage that this bill is paid for how by making the very wealthy and big corporations pay just a little bit more so that you can just get a little bit more exactly it's a lot it is a lot for them to say i mean and they have the money to take care of their their people it seems like that the clients that we do get they don't have nothing they don't they don't have nothing they're medicaid not a was even b.a they don't have you know if they did i'm pretty sure that they would pay for it like like you know when you told us about your mother you know you went doing high you was like yeah i got to pay down but some they don't see it like that because they're poor people or they they're misunderstood people or they want this or they want that you know it takes me an hour and a half to take my client of that he has two hours a day i do three because i just how can i just take him a bath and say well i gotta go he hasn't eaten you know i you know he hasn't talked to anyone let me talk to him you know bring it you know your day going yeah we are plumbers uh just people that listen we we um we care we talk to them they call us on the phone my husband's like who is that quiet they want to talk they want to tell us what's going on with them and can we help them you know it's like okay thank you should we quit hello i'm sunika cooper i'm also a home co-worker here in nevada i came here about four years ago from los angeles which um a single mother for i couldn't afford it um i was making twenty dollars an hour there but even at twenty dollars an hour it wasn't enough so i came here to the great state of nevada um i'm happy to be here um but when i came here um i learned very quickly that uh the living wages and what we do as home care workers is definitely um doesn't cut um they offered me nine dollars an hour and me doing this over ten years and i was like i never made nine dollars an hour my first job um so i would never um i i negotiated um to 10.50 and even that as i said was low but here [Music] i was surprised that you have to pay for um i didn't have a job i had to pay for all my fingerprints i had to pay for my basic training my cpr first aid um if you don't have a job that is almost 300 um just to sum up the amount of money and so that was a shocker to me i scraped up the money ball the money got it then to realize that um these clients asked my sister rosita said um an hour here a hour there 45 minutes here um we are essentially their family a lot of these clients don't have them um in my situation um i had three clients um and in 2020 um my son three years three months before his 18th birthday was shot and so i had a dilemma of do i take care of my son who was in icu fighting for his life or do i go to work i was no people i paid time off no sick time i wasn't eligible for unemployment i wasn't eligible for to take a medical leave it was either work and if we don't work guess what we don't get paid and so i of course took the time off to take care of my child who is now paralyzed and even i have to struggle now because we don't have health care um i couldn't afford just basic health care for my family um it's really hard and it was heartbreaking because while my son was fighting for his life i had this agency call me hey when you come back to work um did i not tell you my son is in icu i don't know if he's gonna live do you think they cared about that two weeks in a month later they're still calling me all along i had my clients call me ashley said they call us because we're their family and um i didn't go to work of course because i was caring for my son who was in icu and i found out that three of my clients passed why because they didn't send somebody to care for them they didn't call the check on them and it hurt me i i stopped called to let them know that two of my clients passed away they didn't even know but they got the money they made sure they got paid for those clients because their money was coming automatically to them and that you know that that's hurtful things but those are some of the things that we have to you know deal with you know not being able to care for our families or like we all do spend more time with our clients there's no way you can do anything in two hours you know there's no way that you can make sure that they have the things that they need and they always tell you hey no overtime well guess what a lot of these people like i said they don't have family so i'm gonna stay that extra time to give them what they need if they need these things a lot of times i'll see something out hey i know miss peggy needs this or mr smith needs this i'm going to pick it up because guess what they're my family too because i know they need it but this build back better plan um it'll help us because we we can't afford to take care of our own families it'll give us definitely the the support that we need as far as you know um not not just making better wages for us but also giving our clients the adequate care that we need because when we're when we're not stressed out it can give us more resources to give to them as far as things that they need and as much times as i i can tell senator neil thank you this is something that has been needed for so long because there's so many people out there that that that like myself i felt like you know there's i love what i do i love what i do you know if i can do this forever i would you know and i know eventually i'll need someone to care for me and that is why i do it because if it was me or if it was one of my parents um i i actually was the person who had to care for my child i never thought that i would be in that situation but then also it's it's what you can't you can't you can't escape it you know we're all aging we're all gonna get older we're all going to need someone to care for us so in that in that place um for me it's it's just something that needs to be done and then it's time it is time you know and so i just thank you guys for giving us this opportunity um yes thank you i just want to say um thank you for your strength in your heart um i listening to you guys talk i know we what we what we passed was a heavy lift but i feel like there needs to be a part two in terms of what is that basic support that needs to be there in this environment because even right now i'm thinking about how do we corral within this zip code and the other zip code and figure out how we make sure there's basic support for those families because i walked it right and so hearing that it it breaks my heart to know that someone is is not going cannot go to the restroom and has no capacity to have help to go to the restroom and has to stay soiled because they have no one there to help them and even on top of that we knew at the time when we moved that bill they can't even go get their medication so the simple task of going to go get the pills that will help remedy the issue is not there and they have no way to get there without paying somebody to take them there and they can't move and so thank you um and we gotta figure this out and um i'd love to meet your son one day and thank you for sharing your story and for bringing again two parts right we we're talking about the workforce of home care but we're also talking about what happens to those who are in care about the home right and so that's those are the provisions that are in built back better because we're it's about helping you the professionals get better pay better conditions better benefits training training helping the people that are coming in behind you get trained having this proper support that's all the workforce pieces and this profession is i believe if i'm correct it's over 80 women yeah 84 and and most of them are women of color yes yes so this is why when people ask me well why can't you just vote on the infrastructure bill what what you're going to do for all the home care workers right why is this a choice between one or the other let's do both because otherwise we would be leaving you out after you've been caring for the very people who've been most affected during coven yeah we need roads and bridges and highways and water systems and broadband and and and those professions get paid well they're not making 9.50 an hour for 10 an hour right right home care workers are making 950 10 12 if they're lucky and then on top of that you're caring for our loved ones veterans those on social security and medicare medicaid yeah and so you know your passion and your heart does come through and the senator expressed it and you know i i feel it and it's why there's there's a burden for us to get this done right because we know people are counted on us this is a once in a generation opportunity and this is what democrats do when we're in charge we deliver for people there's other things that other people will do when they're in charge and that's why there are choices for voters to make but this is what people told me to do when i went to and that's why i'm trying to do it and then i will keep trying to do it so i really appreciate i want to bring in javon johnson who's executive board member with the carpenters southwest carpenters local 1977 and antonio bowen who's a youth pastor to be part of this and then we can open up for further discussion because again you know um we have to put those at the center of the policy who are most impacted right and for a lot of times women especially have been left out of the workforce whether it's been traditional sectors like trades or um you know certain areas that we put a lot of attention on but we don't in other areas well i want us to do this equitably across the board right i don't want to forget about the trades the trades are important and we need more women and women of color we need people of color period represented in the trades and i want to recognize assemblywoman danielle monroe marino who's here has been working with senator neil on all these issues at the state level you all know my passion around workforce development from my days writing about partners in the culinary academy but but jovan has been really instrumental in helping me see how we promote women and women of color in these jobs and i really appreciate you participating today we've done some great things here in vegas we've built the stadium y'all y'all built the raider stadium now the allegiance stadium we built the convention center i know you're working on the sphere and those have been billions of dollars worth of projects well now they're they're done they're complete so we need other we need other projects to keep you and other members uh on the job so that our economy can continue to rebound right and so for me my priorities have always been about crushing the buyers creating jobs and helping to restore public competence in our government and creating jobs is a big part of what we need to do for folks particularly with our unemployment so i want to turn it over to you and antonio and let's continue the conversation absolutely thank you thank you thank you all for your story you know it's it's inspiring your perseverance is inspiring and our and our political leaders as well for everything that you guys are striving to do and continuing to do it you know i've been department for almost 20 years 19 years right i came in as a single mother right so one of my first challenges was child care you know i didn't have reliable transportation and i didn't have i had support but you know in our community especially in communities of color your parents are working and very often your grandparents are working yeah so you have to go to child care facilities which are expensive you know so just starting out i couldn't afford child care so how do you go to work if you can't afford to send your kids somewhere you know and in construction you're starting at five in the morning yeah so where are you taking your kid at five in the morning you know so when we talk about you know when you think about the infrastructure build and build back better you would think that the carpenters are all about the build part and we are you know we are about to build part we do care a lot about that because it does create jobs we feel like we build jobs we build buildings where people go to work in so we're we're very passionate about that part of it but it's the better part too that we care about it's the people that we care about because if we're not building communities it's how we look at it we're building communities where people live and work because we're all mothers were fathers you know and as parker said there are there's a lack of people of color and especially women of color in traits and the southwest carpenters we've been pushing for that for a while and now we have a reinvigorated focus on bringing women into the trade the women of color into the trades we need the infrastructure bill to have the jobs there for them because we provide the training you know so the wages and benefits will be there when they get there we just need them to come into the fold you know and we can we consider it a community wealth so to speak because when you are struggling right when you're working and you're struggling you're barely making ends meet then where do you especially if you have two jobs you have to work two jobs where do you have time to invest reinvest your money into the community you don't have time for movies shows various games you don't have time for any of those things not only do you not have time but you can't afford it well you know you can't afford to do that so when we talk about community wealth that's where we're going that's what we're talking about we're talking about people that have well-paying jobs and the support from legislation to increase the pay of the jobs that they already have and the support from the community so that they work the one job and they go home and they have time to spend with their families time to take care of their families time to improve their quality of life so that's what we focus on and having the buildback better plan that's how we see it you know and and going back to the childhood issue it's it's a big deal because when you bring women especially black women because we were impacted i i feel mostly by dependent you know because we're in service industries so when things get shut down we get cheaper you know and that impacts our income our livelihood our mental health all of those things and that factors into our family lives and to our children you know all of the impact is so great and we carry such a heavy burden of child care because even if you have a two parent income right to two income family and something goes on with your kid at school the mom's going to be the one to leave her job to go handle that the dad typically doesn't yeah so imagine the impact on on their financial situation but imagine it more if there's just one income in that household she's missing a day of work how is that going if you're getting paycheck to paycheck missing a day at work is a big deal and don't let your kid actually be sick you know because then what are you doing there's then there's the child care and everything else that goes wrong with that so this build that better program is we see it way past the building part of it into how it's going to help you know just in this area you're looking at 70 percent 76 percent i think is the actual number but families that will be able to afford child care going into that i mean that's a big deal when you look at it because even the sisters we have a we have a committee of female carpenters here in las vegas called the sin city sisters right so we're part of that name but um we do a lot in the community but when you have a search and i and i i don't share that committee but i oversee it and when you have a sister that's looking for work and she or she needs to come to a meeting or something and i get a text that says can my kids come yes it's not because she wants her kids to come it's because she doesn't have anyone to watch them and if she hasn't been working for a week or a month or two months she can't afford the child care to just come to that meeting and we we tell our members hey come to the meetings so that you can network and meet people that might be able to help you get a job but if you can't come to that meeting then you're stuck you know and when you have those families that are are in that you know i don't think that trickles down is poverty okay so if if you're in a financial situation your kids grow up in a financial situation and your grandkids are going to go financial situation so what this build that better program the way we see it this bill is like breaking that yeah this bill is is that is crea is actually able to create generational wealth yes wow how many when was the last time i mean i'm not going to tell you my age but i'll tell you one thing when was the last time you thought about breaking that cycle yeah it's this is what's so important about this and it it's the people part of it that's the most important part because if you can build all the buildings in the world but you have to have people to work there those are the jobs it's not just a number of jobs if you create 10 000 jobs but they're low-paying jobs where people have to work two of them and you're only helping 5 000 people right you know so we have to get to that point to where we're seeing the people part of it and it goes beyond numbers but there are numbers and you're talking about three quarters of a community that will be helped by the billboard metaphor you know three quarters of community that will be helped with child care resources medical care leave of work things that really matter and especially in the back communities with black women when we're out there trying to take care of our families that is key critical to what we do for everything else you know you're not enduring what you're enduring at your job because you love it so much you know you have bills to pay yeah and that goes for all of us yeah so we have to refocus and that's what i appreciate so much about what our legislative leaders are doing yeah they're refocusing on the people part of it we appreciate the support on the infrastructure you know we appreciate it because we don't get it done but the helping of the people part and that's something that makes me really proud to be part of the southwest conference because we we focus on the people part two we try to do everything we can to help our members and whatever and because we know that that trickles out into the economy and that's what we call the community wealth portion of it because when i go and i spend my check somewhere i'm helping that person that works at that place you know especially during these times when people are struggling to be able to go places those service industry employees are hurting so we we have to do everything that we can and you know the emphasis on mental health service industry child care you know all of the the people helping part of it is so important and i really really appreciate all of you guys being here and the focus that you guys have on trying to get this done because it's going to change lives it's going to save lives it's going to create generational wealth community wealth and that's really what it's all about so thank you [Applause] again the focus as you said is on on workers and and and but what do workers need i when we were in the committee hearing marking up this bill in ways and means you know my republican colleagues kept saying why are you guys beating up on business and i'm like i'm not beating up on business i just want them to do their fair share yeah i want businesses to be successful because they help create jobs but guess who helps build the jobs the people it's the people it's the workers and so let's put some emphasis on workers and people who make america great yeah family right yeah we talk about america being great who made it great exactly and and what people need are child care and you really hit that in nevada and in my district specifically we have a child care desert the senator and i have been working on this not only are we trying to lower the cost of child care which on average is like seven hundred dollars a month for one child per child per child but maybe we also have to create more child care facilities we have to train the child care workforce and they also need to be paid why should a home care worker or child care worker not be paid enough to actually afford child care for themselves they're caring for your child and they can't even afford to have child care for them for their for their child that's that's that's the part of our history that we're supposed to have moved away from and that goes to this equity issue yeah people are like why are you bringing up equity because we have some systemic problems that we can't keep uh enforcing in our policy break and it does need to be transformative yes so through the work we're doing on racial equity literally i've had to add you know i've had to reinforce with my own members this is why we're doing this lean into it the voters who put you here expect for you to deliver on these provisions that help them not keep the inequities from the past you want black voters and hispanic voters and young voters and women to show up for you on election day right then show up for them yeah on the policy that's right paid leave you had to choose between caring for your child who was sick and hurt or going to work at a 10 an hour job and of course you chose your child but you should have been able to care for your child and be able to have paid leave so that you're now not going further in debt further behind further in the hole which is that generational poverty that we want to break yes so that's why these policies matter and that's why the substance matters so you know i wish we could take this listening session on the road and get some more people to listen because this is um this is what we're fighting for this is why this bill matters and this is why we will get it done it's it you know yeah we got work to do yeah yeah but we're gonna do it so i'm gonna turn it over now to antonio bowen he's gonna bring us home pastor here in our community thank you i feel like we've already had service [Applause] well well besides being a youth pastor for the last three years my goal has been putting young people in college and this act right here this build that better will allow i work with a lot of aau basketball teams and a lot of those sports players don't get the gpa to go to the bigger colleges so i travel and go visit colleges and and seeing what teams and what coaches will allow our players with lower gpa come play on their basketball team so with this build back better act it gives the kids two years free of community college that will allow them to work on their gpa so they can go to a bigger and better university so that would give them an opportunity to go to stay home and go to csf for two years and and do something bigger and better then go to byu then go to a college that they actually want to go to so i am super [Music] super excited about this because every day my phone blow up from a basketball coaches high school coaches saying can you help this kid go to college and i'm like yeah i can but what's the gpa you know uh then when you find out what the gpa is then you have to figure out how can we get these kids scholarships uh how can we get them grants but a lot of these scholarship programs you gotta have a certain gpa to even receive that scholarship so with this act right here that congressman horsford is is fighting for and got passed and then it it's gonna change the whole uh dynamic yeah it's gonna change our whole it's gonna be a whole different movement because now we're able to put our kids through school up for free for two years man two years [Music] [Music] that is not just a blessing but that's a miracle because a lot of our kids have been fighting you know them kids want to go do better yeah and be better but if we don't give them an opportunity to go be better or give them my outlook man things are going to stay the way it is because they can't afford it and their parents their parents don't didn't even go to college so we helped them uh my nonprofit helped them fill out their uh financial aid they fast for information different things like that and we helped them go search for scholarships and and now the search won't be that hard no more you know because now we know that you can go to community college work on your gpa and let's put you in a place where you really want to be so thank you sir thank you thank you it's also about yeah making it about the future and the next generation and focusing on what they want which is their hopes and their dreams yeah i'm a first generation college graduate and you know the first in my family to attend college and the year that i started college was when my father was shot and killed and so i had to make a decision am i going to stay on this path or i'm going to move in another path and i had to work all through college and so it took me a long time to finish my degree but like you said there are a lot of kids who want that opportunity who can't afford it who are still trying to figure out what they want to do quite honestly because we haven't done enough in k-12 to help them figure out that path which we're working on but also it's the the the example that i've learned is a lot of people want to invest in themselves and and will do the hard work if we give them a shot give them the opportunity give them an opportunity so that's what this provision of the bill does and it does it in key sectors that we need people to be trained in yes right i i work with dr zaragoza college of southern nevada we're talking about establishing a new um health occupations it's called hpa health professions occupations grant nevada doesn't have one we have these all over the country but we don't have one here where he came from before he was the president at csn they had one so now he's like we need to get one for nevada so i brought the legislation and it's it's now we increase the funding for hpov's health professional occupational grants that's one of the programs that young people will be able to enroll in with that two-year degree wow now we have a health care professional shortage right yes every level including nursing including doctors including specialists this actually trains you though to get into those entry-level jobs in healthcare which are in high demand and then you can keep going to school right to earn your nursing degree or your medical degree but now you have a foundation to work for yeah so we're we we are pushing hard for this provision again my senator and i have been working on this from a workforce the future of work perspective the state's been putting a lot more emphasis on this with the governor and and our legislature but we need federal investment into these strategies because this is not something we can do alone so this is another key provision so we've covered child care community college

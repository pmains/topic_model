NSA leaker Edward Snowden on Friday making his first public appearance after three weeks in a Moscow Airport Snowden now says he wants asylum in Russia while he tries to arrange travel to Latin America here to discuss the Snowden case and more congressman Michael McCaul chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee who joins us from Austin Texas congressman what do you make of Snowden's decision now to seek at least temporary asylum in Moscow and and what about the Russian government providing him with what the White House is calling a propaganda platform to make his announcement well every day this man's a fugitive on the run he puts the United States national security more risk he's a traitor to this country he took an oath of loyalty to the United States and now he's running for cover with our enemies the idea that he's in Russia i'm sure the Russians love this they're making a mockery of the United States foreign policy and I'm sure every day they're extracting more and more information from this man and at the same time it's a test of our of foreign policy our diplomacy and I would give the administration low marks for what they've done so far I think the irony here is this is a man who's a defender of freedom supposedly and yet he's running for cover in countries in the world that a press freedom where there's China Russia and now he's talking about going to Venezuela so I think this is a you know I think the administration could be doing a lot more well let me ask you directly what should the president do to make it clear to the Russians that we don't want them to give him the safe haven and it look this was an important relationship it's a complicated relationship between the US and Russia how far should we be willing to go in putting overall relations on the line over the Snowden case well I think we should be putting any and all pressure we have economic trade I think the the restart button with Putin was a mistake clearly it's not working in this case because we have no diplomacy leverage of Russia they're thumbing their was at the United States and that's not that's not diplomacy through strength it's been the pattern of this administration to try to negotiate without strength and I think now we're seeing the repercussions of that strategy let me turn to another sucker Janet Napolitano surprised Washington on Friday when she announced that she is stepping down as the Secretary of Homeland Security I think it's fair to say she was generally seen as being effective in imposing order over a very unwieldy Department 240,000 employees spread over 22 agencies on the other hand she was criticized for her comments about how secure the border is and also for her reluctance right from the start to even use the word terror take a look at this do you think about both from the man caused and non man cause incidents but particularly on the man cause the weapon of mass destruction involving a hazardous chemical or biological weapon is very high up on the scenarios that we are seeing I love that man caused incidents uh congressman how do you think that Napolitano did generally over four and a half years is Secretary of Homeland Security and and what impact you see her resignation having at at a moment when immigration reform and border enforcement or at the height of the national agenda we got respect for that position and we disagreed on many issues particularly when it came to the border she would go around saying it's never been more secure I took just the opposite position that it is not secure and that's why we passed the border security results act out of my committee to achieve that and to get that done so I think and also with respect to morale I think morale has been very low in the department so I think there's a real opportunity here to get a real leader in who can work with House Republicans on security issues on enforcement that issues and so on you will garner the respect you know of the Congress which I think right now that you know there's a real problem with that and lastly to talk to your point about taking a war on terror out of the vernacular taking out Radek Islam if we can't define the enemy we can't defeat it Giuliani testified for my committee on Boston talking about that very issue the narrative of this administration that al-qaeda is on the run bin Laden's killed war on terror is over let's downgrade the military let's pull out in the pre 911 threat narrative that's being thrown out there I believe is a very dangerous narrative because it does not reflect reality we're gonna get to specific names in a moment but are you suggesting that if the president were to name a man a woman who's seen as tough a law-and-order tough on enforcement that that might reassure Republicans on the question of border security in this immigration debate absolutely I think again I think there's an opportunity for this administration and I would be much very well to talk to them about this I mean their names thrown out there like that Alan the Admiral the Coast Guard there let me put may be put on the guest room because we spent a lot look we put a lot of money into creating this this graphic so let's put up some of the names that are being mentioned as possible replacements for Napolitano Craig Fugate is the current head of FEMA John Pistole is the head of the Transportation Security Administration New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly former Commissioner Bill Bratton is you've mentioned that Allen former head of the Coast Guard do you like any of those names is there anybody else at favorite candidate who you think would reassure Republicans on both the war on terror and on border enforcement immigration yeah I mean it's ultimately president's choice Bell tell you that Alan's testified for my committee multiple occasions Admiral Coast Guard very well respected Ray Kelly in terms of counterterrorism point one of most respected guys out there and a lot of people were pushing for him and and braxton as well but I think yeah I think I any three of those coming in we gained a lot of respect from the House Republicans and could help us at a time we're really trying to push this border security measure out of the house of representatives let me switch subjects on it there were reports this week that the president is growing increasingly frustrated with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and is now seriously considering speeding up the the pull out the withdrawal of US troops not to the end of 2014 but perhaps to the summer of 2014 in that instead of having a residual for us after 2014 somewhere between five and twenty thousand troops that in fact we would go to the zero option here was the White House spokesman Jay Carney on that subject this week one option is no troops I'm not saying that's a preferred option I'm just saying to suggest otherwise would be to make assumptions about negotiations that have not reached a conclusion congressman will call how do you feel about getting out of Afghanistan faster and getting out after 2014 4 good place another failure of diplomacy with the Karzai administration there are policies to negotiate with the Taliban to resolve Afghanistan I think that's a very you know troublesome strategy if you will the zero option and my judgment is no option because the zero option takes us out completely out of Afghanistan and I understand we're all wore fatigues we're ready to wind down the forces but the problem with that is it leaves no counterterrorism footprint behind so we have no ability to deal with future bin Laden's that may pop up in a safe haven of Afghanistan that we saw when we pulled out of Afghanistan the last time defeating the Soviets so I don't want to go back to that strategy you know we did the same thing in Iraq with the status of forces agreement and now rack is becoming a huge problem if we if we read a ganar commitment to the Afghan people and the Afghan military and pull the rug out from under them and allow the Taliban to come in and seek retribution and kill them and put Afghanistan and chaos as a safe haven all over again that does a great disservice a great disservice to what our troops have tried to do the last 10 years and all the great gains that they have made in Afghanistan one last subject on this very busy Sunday congressman McCaul what do you make of the developments in Egypt over the last week we saw the mass shooting of Islamic protesters in the streets we also saw the creation of a new trend government with some establishment figures who were somewhat respected generally speaking are youing encouraged or discouraged by what you've seen the last week or two in Egypt I've actually been encouraged and i'll tell you why when the Arab Spring occurred in Egypt and Libya in across northern africa and now we're dealing with this in Syria to see the Muslim Brotherhood come to the heights of power suspending all other authorities in the government and then opposing Sharia law on their people I've been greatly troubled by this Arab Spring really becoming an Arab winter I think the military in Egypt is most stabilizing factor in Egypt and I think we should support the military in their efforts in ousting the Muslim Brotherhood and in arresting the Muslim Brotherhood and bring a more secular moderate form of government to Egypt and we have a lot of strategic interest over there remember the relationship with Israel with the the Peace Accords that were struck that's very important let me do it really does we have we have 10 seconds loud as well let me just ask you in 10 seconds left so you would very much opposed cutting off US military aid to Egypt I think the administration needs made the case is why we shouldn't suspend the aid but I I personally in an agreement with supporting the military which is most stabilizing factor in Egypt to go against the Muslim Brotherhood and against Sharia law congressman McCaul we want to thank you so much for sharing part of your Sunday with us it's always good to talk with you sir thanks Chris up

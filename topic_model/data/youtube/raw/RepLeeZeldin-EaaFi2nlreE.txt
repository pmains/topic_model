mr speaker i yield three minutes to the gentleman from new york mr zeldin a member of the committee on foreign from new york's recognized three minutes thank you mr speaker and thank you to chairman royce for bringing this important legislation the american public stands with you chairman and there are multiple reasons why the american public will stand with all of this congress that will vote for this bill for one the american public has an issue with financing iranian terror through u.s financial infrastructure the american public has had an enormous issue with a lot of specifics related to the iran nuclear agreement for one it's not really much of an agreement it is an unsigned political commitment there are material differences with regards to the agreement the u.s says we're going to be able to access military sites the iranians said before during and after the negotiation you'll never be able to access our military sites we said sanctions relief will be phased in based uh in over the course of time based on compliance the iranians say no sanctions relief will be immediate no suspension these are pretty important parts of the agreement well let's talk about some other parts that weren't part of the agreement they weren't able to agree to so they put into a secretive deal between the iranians and an entity that we have no ability to actually be on an inspections team because as ap reports put out the iaea's agreement with the u.s these so-called deals where the verification is outlined the iranians in some cases are inspecting their own nuclear sites in other cases they are responsible for collecting some of their own soil samples that is why the american public stands with everyone who votes for this legislation because of all the unilateral concessions that have been made since this agreement has been made this isn't the only one buying heavy water for no reason while this president is holding the heavy water of the iranians those who vote for this bill who have opposed iran nuclear agreement they are holding the heavy water of american security for the 1.7 billion dollar payment that was made after this deal was reached 400 million dollar debt plus 1.3 billion dollars of interest or our detained soldiers who are embarrassed through photography and videography and we're saying thank you for releasing our sailors the american public was outraged using our sailors as propaganda to make yourself look strong and the rest of us look weak or maybe it's giving the iranians access to u.n u.s financial institutions we're being laughed at the iranians will take to the street they'll chant death to america they will continue their illegal test firing of intercontinental ballistic missiles they'll detain americans unjustly they know that we didn't even ask for a signature think about it of all the agreements we enter into a life buying a car buying a home we couldn't even ask for a signature the american public's upset and that's why they stand with you chairman

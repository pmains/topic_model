in in my website uh i wish this is the fourth congress we're introducing it we now have two republican members that are smart enough and brave enough uh gibson and uh catcall that are joining us in and get trying to get some funding for this bill it's a bipartisan now we have uh 26 schools in my district that we started the program that was this bill was patterned after it's successful so far no attempt at suicides which was suicide prevention aimed at the children in schools on site clinicians we must start them at an early age so that as they grow into productive adults we don't have as many problems we need to communicate your involvement we need to network so please network with the people around you learn the warning signs the extreme changes in behavior the verbal clues etc we must continue to educate our general public especially parents to be able to seek help the national crisis hotline is 1-800-273-talk or 8255. it's a 24-hour confidential hotline and assists veterans too now you have packets that you have any questions please don't hesitate to make this short because you need to hear from the folks up here so thank you very much god bless you for attending and without any further ado um we'll move on to our speakers because they're sharing our their expertise with us and we'd really like to hear from them our first speaker will be kana anamoto who was appointed in august 2011 as the principal deputy administrator for samsa in this capacity miss anamoto serves as a print the principal advisor to the administrator on policies and programmatic activities with more than 600 employees and a fiscal year budget of approximately 3.5 billion miss animoto brings 23 years of experience in the behavioral health field 15 of which have been in federal service at samhsa and i'll just turn it over to you right now i don't like bios either but i don't quite have the gravitas of congresswoman napolitano to pull it off that's right thank you so much congresswoman napolitano you are a beacon of hope for those of us who are champions for mental health particularly the mental health of children uh you've been such a great spokesperson for us and a leader in congress and this is a time when we need it the most so we at samhsa the administration administrator hyde and i really owe you a debt of gratitude i'm not here to lobby but if anyone would like to educate their members about the importance of these programs and the costs yes and by paying attention to children's mental health we will save money i think that is the bottom line um message as well also save lives but and also the organizers and the sponsors of this event have been stalwart friends of samhsa we support your mission and we know that you support ours thank you so much for this convening it's exciting we all believe in the prevention of mental illness the promotion of mental health of resiliency early access to treatment and fostering recovery for young people and today thinking about what the important role is of schools in that space we've been at this event before sampson we're very happy to be here again particularly as national children's mental health awareness week is next week um when i'm going to be wearing my green i only have one dress so i have to parse it out um but no and we hope that everyone joins us on may 7th and there's a flyer i think out in the front maybe most of you know but many people really don't know the prevalence of mental illnesses serious emotional disturbances and substance use disorders in our nation and data are telling us that one in four americans at any given time is experiencing one of these conditions and so when we hear that 68 of people wouldn't want to live next door to a person with a mental illness or have a person with a mental illness in their families all they need to do is look around right because two-thirds of americans will be sorely surprised to find that they may be married to a person with a mental illness they have a family member with a mental illness or they have a neighbor or a co-worker with a mental illness or a substance use disorder and they don't even know it and we have to make the change we have to change direction we have to talk about it and we have to raise awareness so people don't treat these as special or different or that we're they're special in that you know they're very fundamental to our success in life and they're not something to put away we don't we don't shy away from people with diabetes we don't shy away from people with cancer we don't shy away from someone with a broken leg and so we shouldn't shy away from a child or an adult with a mental illness um and yet we know that one out of ten our nist our national survey on drug use and health found that one in ten adolescents suffered from a major depressive episode last year one in ten and how many do you think got treatment some of you know how many who knows less than half 38 percent only 38 percent of kids got treatment and depression is a life-threatening condition we know that and with any other life-threatening condition we find it acceptable that only 38 percent of children got treatment absolutely not and so we need to get this message loud and clear to everyone and anyone who can help us with it the human costs are incredible over a quarter trillion dollars a year for untreated mental illness for mental emotional behavioral disorders among youth and we need to create healthy environments in schools and we need to prepare the teachers the administrators the family members the parents everyone in schools to surround our youth with the environments they need to thrive both academically and in life so we at samhsa are very grateful for the incredible research that's out there that tells us that early intervention that prevention that promoting mental health at in schools in colleges and in universities it works it works and we can do this for many years for over a dozen years with the support of congress samsa has funded the safe schools healthy students program where we have put over two billion dollars into local educational agencies as well as in most recently and state educational agencies to foster five major components of a program which have been documented by the institute of medicine safe school environments and violence prevention activities alcohol and other drug prevention activities student behavioral social and emotional supports mental health services and early childhood social and emotional learning programs and these programs are showing great outcomes with this investment the president has decided to try to take this program to scale through his nation his now is the time initiative and project aware because what we saw in our safe schools healthy students grant was that the number of students receiving school-based mental health services doubled the number of students receiving community-based mental health service went up by one and a half one and a half times 143 percent and nearly 90 percent of staff in schools said they were better able to detect mental health problems among their students after their school district had implemented the safe schools healthy students program we also found that the number of kids who've said that they had been in a physical fight at school went down it went from 19 percent down to 13 and we know that actually the experience the experiences of violence by our young children are startlingly high um substance abuse similarly was reduced from 24 to 18 percent so by creating these healthy school climates by doing these positive emotional supports in schools by giving access to supportive services partnering between schools criminal justice juvenile justice community organizations and community mental health we have and and family members and youth themselves we have created healthier communities with now is the time which was born after the sandy hook elementary school tragedy the president proposed funding for programs to protect our children and our communities by increasing access to mental health services with the project aware that i mentioned we've funded 20 state educational authorities at about two million dollars per year for five years to develop the necessary systems in their state school districts again using three pilot school districts or lease because we have this model that worked with 12 2 billion dollars and 12 years no state was doing safe schools healthy students statewide even though we had the results even though we had the data and so that's why the president has put his support behind project aware we also have a hundred project aware local educational agency grants which is for schools to in school districts to work with their communities with parents with youth to promote mental health first aid and youth mental health for state to increase behavioral health literacy so people know the signs people can detect these things early and we know that early intervention is very important we're of course working hand in glove with the department of education and the department of justice with their now as the time programs because we know that all of these systems have to work together because kids don't live in a vacuum they don't just live in our families they live in ecologies and we have to partner at the federal level with all of those agencies that have a role in fostering a positive ecology for every child another place where now as the time is emphasized and where stamps is really proud of our work is in healthy transitions that's a new program that we got in 2014 and that is fostering connections for those kids that are 18 to 25 or 16 to 25 as they're at that very precarious stage of life not only do we know that half of all mental disorders show up by the age of 14 and three quarters by the age of 24 so there are some kids that are first experiencing the signs of illness at this very delicate time we also know that kids who are in youth serving systems and are already being served have challenges as they make that transition to the adult serving systems and the danger is that they can fall through the cracks if they don't get the services and the supports that they need that their parents don't get the peer supports that they need to successfully navigate that transition and so we're really pleased with the 20 million dollars that we have for our healthy transitions program another effort that most of you probably already know about is our very successful and long-standing systems of care program or our children's mental health initiative which has served kids up to the age of 21 and their families with serious emotional disturbances this program has had an impact on millions of america's children by funding state and local agencies tribes and territories to develop implement and sustain services wrap around services for children and their families that bring together schools and parents and churches and synagogues and other and youth groups and others who everyone who is touching those kids child welfare everyone who's touching the kids and can be supportive and make sure that those children are getting all the things that they need around for their communities it's a very holistic approach which we also wanted to take to the tribes and so we've had our circles of care program which builds off the systems of care program but allows tribes to define their own uh system of care for wrapping around their youth because we know that tribes have our sovereign governments and they have their own traditions their own languages and they need to be able to form a service system that works for their youth over the past 17 years we've seen incredible tribal communities mobilizing and developing tools necessary to plan for the particular needs of their young people as we move early on the trajectory sampson is really proud to have supported the good behavior game this is a program often done in first and second grades where we do it's a universal evidence-based preventive practice where we've seen um great progress we've done some grants to some schools that had at least 50 free and reduced lunches and these programs address early aggressive and disruptive behavior which is a powerful risk factor for later emotional distress and we've seen reductions in the aggressive and disruptive behavior in the young kids but then following them over time children who participate in the good behavior game in first and second grade have less juvenile justice involvement they have better school completion rates they have less substance abuse rates and less abuse of alcohol and tobacco as well as fewer personality disorder and other mental illnesses developing later in life so that early period the early developmental period is so important we also know that later years are important so the adolescent years campus going to college those young people who don't go to college that's when we know that a lot of young people are at high risk for suicide and samhsa has been co-facilitating the national strategy for suicide prevention with our colleagues across federal government and i'm sorry to say that we have now reached over 40 000 suicide deaths in 2013 2013 right the number is still growing and despite our efforts we we know that we can do things with young people to intervene to follow up to do prevention work to create networks so that they can talk to people and get supports but we don't have enough resources to do it everywhere that we need to we also know from other countries that there are incredible models where you have primary care follow-ups where you do really aggressive screening and intervention for some of the really high risk factors in middle age populations who are actually the highest numbers of suicides and we don't have the resources to do that either and that affects families as well so we know that we need to do more with our campus suicide we need to do more on suicide prevention in general something that we're really looking forward to is another tribal initiative a tribal behavioral health grant where we're doing suicide prevention as well as substance use prevention and allowing this is a 2016 proposal where tribes would be encouraged to partner with their bie schools and to address the mental health problems the substance abuse problems that are showing up in the schools that are getting in the way of tribal youth's academic success because it's very hard to concentrate in school for anyone if you've got so many mental health problems or if you've got trauma in your family or in yourself that is very hard to get past and to achieve academic success and you know that's really important for all of our youth but for tribal youth in particular there are such significant struggles in those communities so samhsa is partnering again with bie with ihs and our other colleagues across the department to do this important work and finally as i mentioned i'm happy to say that this is the 10th anniversary of children's mental health awareness day and so we do hope that you all will join us on may 7th we're excited we have mary lambert joining us as a special guest and it's going to be a great great day we thank you for helping to bring mental health and substance abuse issues out of the shadows i think this is a great event and i appreciate all of your efforts so please let us know if samsung can be helpful in the future thanks and so our next speaker will be jill diamond um jill diamond is the chair of world blockchain cares a program that reaches out to impoverished children in 164 countries her journey send her across the globe as an official and supervisor of the championship bouts and as an ambassador to ver for various charitable programs miss diamond's commitment was recognized with the boxing humanitarian ward wbc's women of the year new york city's pal 911 award and was acknowledged by the california legislature for her work with women athletes in addition jill writes for several media outlets and i will stop the biography now hello everyone i'm probably the least qualified person here to talk about this but my quali my qualification comes from life experience i would say i grew up in a home where my much older brother was quite ill he was handsome he was smart he was funny and then he went off to college and a month later he came back and that was the beginning of the journey for us the lucky part was that he never heard anyone outside of the home and today many many years later he is taken care of in a very wonderful facility where he's safe and that's considered a success story i don't consider that a success story this is 40 years later and still many children would rather kill themselves than come forward and risk the shame of rejection and stigmatization because they won't ask for help this has to stop we can cure everyone but we can change our perspective about this illness so at the world boxing council which seems like an unlikely organization to get involved in mental health awareness it completely isn't many of our boxers many of our athletes come from very disadvantaged backgrounds they've dealt with poverty they've they're very damaged people some of them and they see boxing as a way to elevate their lives to become normal whatever normal means to get you know reward from their sport and so what we do in addition to boxing is we travel through countries youth centers hospitals our boxers go in and they tell their stories and the children really respond to them particularly boxers that come from their area they tell them if i can make it you can make it when i get hit and i fall down i get up you can get up they are very fragile people outside of the ring and they are very open and willing to share their experiences and i think that it's very inspirational to the people that we come and visit so out of respect and support to grace we are honoring the month of may this year also we will be wearing the green ribbons at every fight including the fight that's happening this saturday um mayweather and pacquiao we dedicate our month to mental health awareness in hopes of knocking out the stigma thank you and our next speaker will be dr dana cunningham dana graduated from southern illinois university at carbondale with a doctoral degree in clinical psychology in 2004 following the completion of her internship at the university of maryland medical system maryland veterans administration consortium she completed a postdoc at the center for school mental health currently dr cunningham is the coordinator for the prince george's met school mental health initiative and i'm not even going to attempt that acronym thank you good afternoon and thank you for inviting me here today it's a pleasure to be here uh and i think you have a copy of my powerpoint slides in your green folders so i'm here today to talk just briefly about school mental health and the value and importance of school mental health services the title of my presentation is about increasing access and improving outcomes and i believe that by providing school mental health services that we can improve access for mental health for youth to receive those services and also to improve outcomes for them just to give everybody a clear definition about what school mental health is or what it looks like there's some key components to mental health that's when it's implemented well we usually see a partnership between the schools and the communities that is undergirded by families and youth and making sure that their voices are a part of the work that we're doing we see that school mental health programs really build on existing partnerships that are already taking place in the school so it's not our intention to come in and take over the role of a school psychologist or school social worker but to really help support what's already taking place in the school environment the goal is to really focus on all students not just a subset of students so all students can benefit from mental health services that are based in the school so there's really a full array of services that can be provided in a school setting from school mental health promotion for for instance you might have a broad school-based bullying prevention program that all students all staff members would participate in there might be a subset of students who might need more specialized attention or treatment so perhaps maybe a group of students who may be at risk for substance abuse disorder a group of students who maybe have been exposed to trauma can receive more of what we call secondary level of prevention and then there might be a smaller subset of students who might need more individualized treatment because they are at risk for significant challenges so why are schools an optimal place to provide these services one of the things i think kind of kind of probably provided a very good overview about the importance of school and health services is because we know that the onset of mental illness many mental illnesses begin in childhood many of them before the age of 18. so if those illnesses go on untreated there's a significant cost to that and so as we know there's you know as was mentioned earlier there's about one in every five students have some sort of mental health illness and about one in five i'm sorry one in ten are really impacted by a significant impairment but the reality is that many of those youth are not receiving services the good news is that we know that youth that do receive services overwhelming majority of them are able to receive those services in the school environment so there's research that shows over 75 percent of students are actually receiving mental health services in the school setting we know that there are some barriers to receiving mental health care in a traditional outpatient setting i certainly don't have to go over all those with you but you know certainly things like stigma or or insurance are barriers transportation past experiences with with mental health agencies that have not been positive sometimes steer people away from seeking those services in a community setting we know that traditionally in many outpatient settings it's on for in some instances people after they make their first appointment don't even show up to that first appointment and beyond that the most frequent number of times that people actually go to an outpatient mental health center for services is one so they may go to that first appointment but don't frequently return and so we see over time that many many people discontinue treatment or don't continue with treatment and so that is why schools provide i believe a really optimal place providing those services for one yes students are certainly there and it's easy to access them but addition in addition to that there's also the ability to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health services because the counselors are based there in the school students can see their friends going to see a counselor and it's not i've had students bring students in to come see me and talk to me because they feel that it's a safe place to be as a good place to receive services so it's definitely less threatening we heard earlier about some of the statistics with depression and suicide i think being present in a school environment allows you that opportunity to see those students who might be isolated to see that student who sits in the back of the the classroom with their head on their desk and is not really engaged oftentimes in schools the students that we typically get our attention are those that are making a lot of noise but when we're based in the school setting it's definitely much easier to also reach out to those students who might be suffering some of those internalizing disorders such as depression or anxiety so if i had to sum all of that up in terms of the advantages i would say that when students have their social emotional behavioral needs addressed through wellness prevention and intervention there are fewer barriers to learning and more time for productive classroom instruction and we see that there's really you know some people have concerns about the impact of school on academics and say well maybe that will take time away from a student's learning time but we know that if students mental health needs aren't addressed they're going to have difficulty learning and difficulty performing well in school and we do also know through lots of research that's been done about the positive impacts of providing mental health services and some of those the ability of school and health services to reduce some of those non-academic barriers to learning so we see that students are more engaged in school that they can perform better academically that we see less fewer students going out to participate in more restrictive school placements so in overall improving academic outcomes decreased dropout rates so there are lots of positive advantages of receiving school and health services and actually the center for school mental health where i work is dedicated to improving the advancement of school mental health practice and policy and on their home page that's listed there if you can see it on your handouts but it's csmh.umaryland.edu but on their home page there is a link to a whole list of academic outcomes and an impact of school and health services on other positive outcomes if you want to look at that we know as well that school mental health certainly reduces long-term costs if we think about you know the cost of you know i've said earlier we talked earlier about the the number of students who exhibit mental health illnesses in adolescence and prior to the age of 18. so if those students go on and become adults and have mental health problems that are not treated what is the impact of that going to be on our workforce on the justice system on the health care system so if we don't treat those problems early long term that certainly is going to be quite costly in terms of dealing with those issues in the future within our program we have had an opportunity i've kind of told you what the research has said about the benefits of school mental health but we've also have simply asked the families and students you know what do you think how have these services benefited you and some of the things we hear family members have said or that no therapists are always available a grandparent said that her daughter was less angry a case manager helped her get back on her feet so so families are able to certainly see the benefit and similarly when we ask youth they report positive experiences as well you know that they appreciate having somebody right there they can get their feelings off their chest one person noted that it's free and that was from a young student who actually had experienced the challenges he saw his mother having difficulty paying for the insurance co-pay so he was very happy to see that you know there was a service that was available there in the school that didn't require a cost so just to tell you very briefly about our program again it's the prince georgia school mental health initiative we're based right across the way we have a few of our staff members here thank you for being here and we're bates in prince george's county maryland and we really have a great collaboration between the prince george's county department of special education the maryland state department of education and the university of maryland baltimore and the purpose of our program is to really provide more intensive services and supports to students who are at risk of being removed from their home school placement so really focus on that population of students but we also do a lot to really help enhance staff training and self-competency provide some training and family outreach as well we provide individual therapy group therapy prevention activities really the whole range of mental health services that you could receive in the community we provide them there in the school we also actually have a psychiatrist who provides consultation services as well so it's a very comprehensive program in terms of the students that we see as i mentioned we really focus on students with disabilities but we also have had a wonderful partnership over the last couple years with some of the local graduate school programs and so they also provide services to students who are in general education as well so we really are able to serve a broad range of students and you also i'm not sure how well you can see this in your handouts but we've also done some research over the last couple years with our our students who've been involved in our program and one of the things that we do is is observations of students behavior at the beginning of the school year and at the end of the school year um and and try to look for areas of change

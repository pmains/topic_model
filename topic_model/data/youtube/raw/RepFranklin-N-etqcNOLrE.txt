thank you madam chairwoman mr vordren um what is your estimate of the percentage of cyber attacks that are criminally motivated versus foreign intelligence cyber operations well sir i i don't have a good answer to that question today i would be happy to take that back and get you a more refined answer all i can say is that between nation state actors and criminal attacks on u.s infrastructure both are extremely prolific do you ever see or do you believe in your opinion do you think there are nation state actors that are posing as criminals uh at times to probe our networks under the guise of just seeking ransomware but actually have a more nefarious intent sir we can uh it's more of a classified discussion but what i can say here is we would refer to that as a blended thread and so there are some intelligence gaps about whether intel service individuals are moonlighting as criminals or state actors or hiring criminals to conduct certain activities so those are some gaps certainly happy to have a more classified discussion with you that if that's of interest to you okay thank you um do you think with the spike that we're seeing in ransomware is it more that people are more willing to report it or are there more attacks because crooks are seeing that it's more profitable it's more lucrative why the the recent spike do you think so our data and again i think it's important to highlight that we only see our estimates are about 20 to 25 percent of the total intrusions and i'm quite sure brandon would share approximately the same figure with you so it's very hard to say increase decrease what we can say though is that in the last six months we have not seen a decrease in the amount or frequency of reporting on ransomware attacks we attribute it to the simple fact that it's incredibly lucrative for the criminals that's partially due to the valuation of virtual currency but it's partially due to the vulnerability of our systems and our infrastructure here that makes it profitable in both ways thank you director english the colonial pipeline attack caused major disruption at the gas pumps you know there's talk about concern of it uh shutting down the energy grid if something like that were to happen obviously there'd be mass chaos it's not hard to think of other examples of attacking health care systems where we could see a significant loss of life i know this isn't that's completely within your purview but you also have with a military background as well in your view when would such an attack rise to an act of war typically classically the attack rises to an act of war when it um achieves the same degree of damage that a kinetic weapon would achieve you know the loss of health safety kind of national security of a significant nature um that that being said these are serious at any level and therefore requires that we respond fully with the remedies that are proportionate to that need we need to double down on resilience and robustness we need to proactively defend these spaces and we need to find and bring to justice the miss greens the transgressors who conduct these actions okay we talked earlier about the 16 critical infrastructure areas and it's one thing to to reach out to a you know a foreign country like russia and tell them pretty please you know please don't do these things but should we be engaging in treaties or some sort of formal documents with other nations to establish those tripwires and you know like a geneva conventions or something of that nature there was a global group of experts kind of sponsored by the united nations in the 2015 time frame that described norms that constitute reasonable expected behavior in this space the united states signed on to those just a week and a half ago the vice president in paris announced that they we would support the paris accords which are a similar articulation of what is reasonable and responsible behavior in this space they do not have the force the effect of treaties but they clearly are recognized by like-minded nations as the way one should behave in this space and what the responsibilities of nations are in this space so something like that would provide us then cover and justification if violated than when we responded in kind then we would have kind of the international it has for practical purposes established what we would describe then as reasonable and appropriate behavior and therefore we're able to describe what what is not uh mr wales spoke earlier in his testimony of improving our incident reporting system should the definition of major incident change so that congress is better informed when cyber attacks occur against federal agencies i think that we need to have a standard definition of what major incident constitutes such that we can uniformly regardless of where an event might take place um inform the congress of those things that are truly major or in some cases significant to your point um if those decisions are all made locally then there's going to be a certain degree of inherent unevenness if we're going to operate with unity of effort unity of purpose we need to make sure that we have a common standard a common definition and that when and where appropriate and there are various situations where that is entirely appropriate inform the congress thank you now you're back

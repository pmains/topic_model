Zeldin the gentleman from from New York mr. Zeldin is recognized for such time as he may consume Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of my bill HR 2460 which would expand disabled veterans access to Adult Day Health Care a daily program for disabled veterans who need extra assistance and special attention in their day-to-day lives those veterans who are seventy percent are more disabled from a service-connected injury often require significant assistance for others in order to carry out basic everyday tasks despite various care options for veterans their choices are often limited and can come at great expense one such program that is currently available as adult day health care this program provides disabled veterans and their families with a high-quality alternative to nursing home care providing quality outpatient services for those suffering from debilitating illnesses or disabilities these programs provide a range of services from daily activities such as bathing to full medical services like physical therapy the focus of the program is on improving disabled veterans quality of life through an individualized plan specific to their needs while still allowing them to maintain their independence adult a health care programs don't only benefit the veteran they also benefit the family members and caregivers as well this model allows caregivers to tend to their day-to-day activities without worrying about the well-being of their spouse child or friend allowing the veteran to lead a much more fulfilling life while keeping families together and strong adult a health care however is only currently offered at three facilities in the entire country my district is fortunate to have one of these facilities the Long Island State Veterans Home in Stony Brook New York but this program can easily be offered at any of the 153 state veterans homes across the country since the Department of Veterans Affairs does not currently cover the cost of participation this program the expense must be paid at a pocket by the veteran and their family which significantly limits the number of veterans who can enroll my bill HR 2460 would ensure that seventy percent or more service-connected disabled veterans are able to receive a delta health care at no cost to the veteran and their family by defining the program as a reimbursable treatment option through the VA this would expand this great option of care for our veterans currently 52 Republicans and Democrats in this chamber have signed on as co-sponsors of this bill I would like to thank house Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller for all of his leadership as chairman of the committee for recognizing the urgency in passing this bill myself the committee many members of this Congress his constituents and this country will miss him following his service this year I'd also like to thank House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy for having us bill placed on the calendar for today I thank you Mr Speaker I yield back gentleman yields back the gentlewoman from Florida is recognized Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to support HR 2560 and I yield back the balance of my time the gentlewoman from Florida yields back the balance of her time the gentleman from Florida is recognized thank you very much to ask all my colleagues to support this piece of legislation and yield back the balance of my time all time having not expired on this bill the question is will the house suspend the rules and pass the bill HR 2460 those in favor will say aye those opposed no in the opinion of the chair two-thirds being in the affirmative the rules are suspended the bill is passed and without objection the motion to reconsider is laid on the table

I had a herniated disk removed from my back and so I did my homework on the internet which I do a lot I check everything out and there was the best place was in Bedford so I went over to Bedford they contacted Medicare went right straight through I got a little tiny scar on my side and I was and I avoided major massive surgery on my back but that's why I believe in Medicare because the care that I received was excellent and it was better than i would have had received had I stayed in a local HMO one of the things as a legislator that I have learned as you get a lot of facts and figures across your computer screen and one of the things that really stuck in my mind recently was the fact that Medicare's has about a two percent operating expenses and the more expensive insurance companies are talking eighteen percent so who's getting more medical care bang for the buck if you will though the people on Medicare I met Annie when she ran for office two years ago she connected with children she connected with older folks and her message was so people oriented she's not going down there to feather her nest and she's not going down there and make a name for herself to move up into something else she's genuine she's the real thing she's a genuine article I've read a nice position on Medicare and because Annie is Annie because she's as honest and true as the day is long if Annie says she's going to do it she's going to do it you can take that to the bank if Annie custom makes a promise she's going to keep it and she's promised to working to save Medicare and that's good enough for me you

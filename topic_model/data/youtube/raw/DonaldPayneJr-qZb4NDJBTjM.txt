mr speaker i'm glad we're talking about criminals but i want to point out one that potentially has been in the white house he was a general spoke at the national convention of the republican party he said lock her up but when he filled out his disclosure form to work in the white house he conveniently left out that he received money from two foreign governments a former general who defended this nation did not fill out that he received this money sat near set next to vladimir putin for dinner but did not fill this form out properly mr speaker we're very concerned about mike flynn and it is obvious that we here in the house of representatives do something to point out when we see something that is illegal going on what comes around goes around mr speaker and he said lock her up well looks like he might get locked up and that's the way it's going to be

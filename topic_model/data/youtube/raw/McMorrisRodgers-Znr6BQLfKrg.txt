thank you try this again chairman Doggett the ranking member Nunez as well as all the members of the committee thank you for holding this important hearing on protecting patients from surprise medical Billings I'm grateful for your leadership to examine this problem so that Congress can work on a bipartisan solution you know there's so many stories out there I was going to share another story of a lady from Washington State who had a massive heart attack and ended up and it ended up in a surgery place hospital in Oregon which led to all kinds of challenges and to save her life she had bypass surgery a valve replacement and repair she ended up spending a whole month in the hospital recovering from the surgery ranging from an infection and and needing more powerful antibiotics she was discharged and she received her bill she owed nearly two hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars so this one was more than a surprise bill it was massive it was stressful and it was devastating now she eventually was able to get help and relief with a complement a complicated medical charity care waiver but it took six months of uncertainty and countless phone calls from collection agencies it shouldn't have to be this way especially when someone is recovering from a heart attack what makes this story even more painful is that nobody told her that she could have been transferred to an in-network hospital which could have saved tens of thousands of dollars as she said there should be fairness and equality in the system you shouldn't have to file a complaint there should be ingrained into the system so that when you have a problem and you're do relief you get it and she's right so what's the solution there must be more transparency right now it is too difficult to be an informed patient if your care is out of network and you will be charged for it you should know I'm grateful that President Trump is making this a priority to end surprise billing and I agree that this Congress needs to work towards a bipartisan solution germ√°n pallone and ranking Walden on the Energy and Commerce Committee is also working on this issue to protect patients and keep health care costs down we can in surprise billing and give patients a certainty that they need over their health care again there shouldn't be any surprises people should be able to trust that they know how much they're going to be billed especially when they're in some of the most stressful situations of their lives so thank you everyone all the members here today for participating in this hearing I look forward to working with you and the rest of my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee to address this issue and I will yield back thank you both

I wanted of the 800 billion in stimulus funds 240 billion of which was tax cuts not spending by the way isn't it true that Amtrak was allocated 1.1 billion so we talked about 1.1 billion nine eight hundred billion dollars I think it was 1.4 1.3 1.3 billion and the total cost of president and that was basically Congress instructed you to spend that on projects that were ready to go as fast as possible infrastructure projects is that correct that's correct and you spent it on white in broad terms niantic River Bridge and some additional infrastructure infrastructure bridges and so forth which I assume had you not spent it on those that would have been safety problems yes okay so the basic okay thank you now Amtrak has requested 36 point four million dollars implement PTC in fiscal year 2016 now does this go beyond finishing the implementation of of PTC by the end of this calendar year yes what is this off the northeast corner this isn't on the spine of the corner the spine of the court will be done by the end of December but we have other work that we need to get done OK and could Amtrak have implemented PTC sooner if it had more federal funds have a calm a while ago yes but not now no but if Amtrak it has more federal funds a year two three four years ago it could have implemented when we first started if we'd had a dependable amount of money to move forward yes okay now to switch topics for a moment the tunnels into New York have been described as ticking time bombs because of damage from salt water during Hurricane sandy what's the status of those tunnels what would happen if they were to go out of service and how much funding is necessary to prevent that from happening well we found out this winter what would happen if they went on a service because we had so much ice that we had regular ice patrols that had to knock down the ice in one of the tubes or one of the other tubes and when that happened you went from being able to move 24 trains an hour down to six trains an hour so we got a lot of complaints from New Jersey Transit and from Amtrak writers that they had to suede outside one of the tubes in order to get into New York City so that's exactly what you're going from 24 trains an hour to six trains in our as the only rail access into New York City from New Jersey would have a significant effect on the economy absolutely can you quantify that at all I will for you I'll get back to you with that answer please and now I understand the name track is a 21 billion dollar backlog of projects on the Northeast card adjust to achieve a state of good repair is that accurate that's what the commissioned developed and produced yes you have any source of funding for that 21 billion dollars no more so than what we get each year and how much is in the budget that the house just passed 1.39 was what we had last year and I think I know but that's the total that's not just for back projects on the NEC no not for just the projects and so many 1 billion dollars necessary to just to get up to a state of good repair the Northeast character how much was appropriated for that purpose or available for that purpose from the amount of funds voted by the house a couple weeks ago there were some dollars that it were specifically identified for advancing our gateway system but not capital dollars for us to actually build it no capital dollars at all okay so 0 / 21 that's a pretty good ratio now we have heard that ms Feinberg we have heard that Amtrak will have the PTC positive train control in place by the end of the year at least on the main on the spine a little later elsewhere but what's the status of PTC implementation of other passenger airlines like metro north of Long Island Railroad in New York and other commuter rails and what will take for commuter lines such as those in New York area to meet the deadline they're struggling they're very much struggling to meet the deadline we just completed a loan to the MTA for almost a billion dollars to assist with their PTC implementation that is not to breach the deadline that it that will go beyond the deadline but I the estimates to win the commuter rails across the country are likely to be able to to implement PTC it varies dramatically but i would say anywhere from from 16 to 18 to 20 from in other words a year to two to four years after the deadline and we know the possible safety repercussions let me just say that the transportation appropriations bill on the floor this week includes no money for commuter lines such as metro north in the LIRR to install ptc Amtrak funds this out of federal capital grants which are just cut by 290 million dollars despite the fact that there's a 21 billion dollar backlog to achieve a state of good repair in the NEC we spend about 50 billion dollars on highways and about sixteen billion dollars on 17 billion dollars on aviation and 1.2 billion dollars on rail is something very wrong with the appropriations process and for us to sit here and not understand that the fact that that Congress has been starving Amtrak has a large role to play what we're talking about is putting our heads in the sand I yield back mr. Nadler mr. Costello Thank You mr. chairman let me start with miss Feinberg and I want to thank you for

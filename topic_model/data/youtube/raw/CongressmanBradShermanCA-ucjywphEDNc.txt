fair's committee congressman Sherman thank you for being here I know just a short time ago Senate leadership and Foreign Relations Committee staff had requesting an all senators briefing from hospital and Pompeyo on Jamal Khashoggi likely happening next week when Congress is back from Thanksgiving break so more answers to come first though your reaction well it's pretty clear that the CIA report indicates that the crown prince ordered this brutal murder it's also clear that there are many worse things that are happening in the Middle East done by both Saudi Arabia and its friends and the enemies of Saudi Arabia I think Khashoggi is getting a lot of attention in large part because he was part of the foreign policy establishment known as a person by the u.s. foreign policy establishment here in Washington but we need to focus on the use of food deprivation in the war in Yemen by both sides the the idea of trying to starve your enemy is a war crime I know it's gone on for thousands and thousands of years in the Middle East but it's not the way to conduct war yeah it's quickly becoming a historic level of a humanitarian crisis in Yemen so that is a story that we're watching closely I have to say given the run-up with Democrats to this point I interviewed congressman Garamendi of California yesterday and he was commenting that he didn't think that the president believed the CIA report from what John Roberts just reported and I knew you were watching I asked him that question at the end but it was really more about the fact that there was not definitive information one way or the other involving the crown prince look you don't know for sure very many things in this world we're pretty confident that the crown prince ordered this but the key issue here is how do we prevent Saudi Arabia from developing nuclear weapons because whether it's the crown prince that would order this or whether there are rogue elements in Saudi Arabia that can commandeer two planes and a and and carry on an operation like this the government in Riyadh should not have nuclear weapons and the one thing that I think Congress needs to do is make it clear that any nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia must be approved by Congress I think that's the one thing that we're likely to do that would really interfere with MBS or punish him if you would because frankly just sanctioning seventeen thugs by saying they're not going to be allowed to visit Disneyland is insufficient all right congressman Sherman I have to make a pretty hard turn newswise now thank you for your time we see on the left of the screen President Trump and First Lady Melania and they are actually hosting an an upbeat event right now the presidential turkey pardoning ceremony in the White House rose garden so we are going to turn from that serious matter to one that has to do with our holiday this week and there are two turkeys that are up for pardoning let's listen to the president and they're very beautiful families thank

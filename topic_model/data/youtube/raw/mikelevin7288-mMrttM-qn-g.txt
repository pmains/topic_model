i rise today to express deep concern about the japanese government's handling of the case of lieutenant ridge alconis a u.s navy officer stationed at yokosuka naval base in may 2021 lieutenant alconis and his family were on their way home from hiking on mount fuji tragically lieutenant alconis lost control of his vehicle due to a acute mountain sickness causing him to lose consciousness as a result two bystanders tragically lost their lives lieutenant alconis is remorseful for the medical incident that caused the events of that day he has offered 1.65 million dollars in extrajudicial restitution to the victims families a gesture expected in japan but far beyond the family's means ultimately lieutenant alconis was sentenced this month by the japanese high court to three years in prison been extremely upset to learn that the case was not conducted in a way that was fair to lieutenant alconis and that the japanese government violated the status of forces agreement which governs the treatment of our service members there i understand that our embassy in tokyo has been monitoring this case and i strongly urge them to do more to support a service member in need my office has been working with the department of the navy and the office of the secretary of defense to support lieutenant alconas and his parents suzanne and derek throughout this case as i do the navy believes that this is the wrong sentence for lieutenant alconas i won't be giving up on lieutenant alconis and the department of defense must not either

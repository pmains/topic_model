detectives Republican congressman Lance Gooden with us right now congressman it's not your belly we good with the Financial Services Committee but generally in the house when they do have this impeachment vote it seems pretty sure to go along largely party lines and then it goes to the Senate how do you think that's going to go well first off back to the largely upon a largely along party lines comment Nancy Pelosi said this should be bipartisan if we're gonna go forward and she's getting what she wants in the sense that this will be bipartisan against the impeachment resolution we have Democrats they're gonna be peeling off with us next week my guess my guess is 10 give or take a few but the point is is they are not unified on this because they know they don't have a case they know that the facts are very weak and they know that the process has been flawed even if you hate Donald Trump you've got to agree that this process has been flawed Democrats in my district we don't have a lot but they're nice people too they have come up to me and said I don't like the president but I do agree that this process has been flawed and you have to agree that the president deserves a fair shake and he hasn't gotten it so no matter what you think of the president you as an American any American should be disappointed and ashamed of this process I certainly am well you know some of your Democratic colleagues are ashamed of what they're hearing coming at him it's a common in the United States Senate that he is working with the White House Council on the impeachment process that looks like it's sort of an inside friendly you know game here what do you think of that well I think that the the White House should be worked with and cama dated they were not even allowed to be present in many cases for the the proceedings that we had here in the house so I think the president will get a fair shake in the Senate I think that the republican-led Senate will do a fine job but I think we also need to wait and let's see how it shakes out president really are saying I'll do what I want to do and we'll almost seem like he's orchestrating this in the Senate Lisa is that what apparently not because this whole process is a sham so we're now in the Senate concluding a sham process you can't suddenly legitimize this sham process no matter what happens during a sham process with what your critics say will be a sham of your own right I'll tell you when our critics will stop criticizing and that's when Republicans retake the majority because Kevin McCarthy our leader the Minority Leader of the Republicans in the House he has said to me other members that I work with he said when we take back the majority we're not I guess what I'm getting at is and you're quite right and a lot of people agree with you and certainly in your party that there's reason to feel bitter and anger about how the process went in the house but now we have what seems to be at least at the surface a cozy relationship going forward where you're supposed to have a trial in the Senate you don't think there's anything awkward there I don't and in fact we heard Lindsey Graham say I think it was last week he said we're not going to call all these witnesses that are supporters on our base back home want us to call because we don't want to run this thing like the House Democrats did so I think you'll be in a few weeks or months or whenever this goes down you'll be saying wow this was a fair process it's a shame it even came to this point it's a shame understanding we have is there might be few of any witnesses and a vote up or down and done you'd have to ask the Senate I don't know how I don't want to speculate but I suspect it will be fair and I suspect it won't be nearly the joke that you've seen the last few months in the house

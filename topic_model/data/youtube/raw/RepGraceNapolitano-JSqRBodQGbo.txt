the chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from California mrs. Napolitano for five minutes Thank You mr. speaker as the chair of the transportation subcommittee on water and infrastructure I rise to celebrate Clean Water Week I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the importance of water for our communities not only in my home state of California but across the country Americans depend on water clean water for their health the health of their communities and the health of the economy our water resources are precious in every drop matters which is why we need significant federal investment in our nation's infrastructure and strong federal protections for our nation's water resources we need to protect our waterways large and small from pollution and should we conserve our water resources recycle water where we can and protect our groundwater resources for a long-term reliance these are tremendous there are tremendous clean water infrastructure needs facing all our country communities large and small urban and rural and tribal as well and our community American families are facing great challenges in meeting these needs today our nation's network of sewers stormwater conveyances and treatment facilities are aging often very outdated and in many places all over the country not meeting the needs of our communities or what our water quality standards we in Congress need to do more not only to renew the federal financial commitment to repair replace and upgrade a water related infrastructure but also to ensure that this work remains affordable to all of our communities today too many Americans are uncertain whether their drinking water is safe for themselves and for their families now is not the time to cut back on protections of our clean nation's clean water yet this administration is proposing to do just that for more than 45 years 45 years the Clean Water Act has helped to protect our streams our rivers our wetlands and our Lakes and provided our states with tools to keep our waters clean the administration this administration has proposed eliminating long-standing protections for small streams and wetland which play a very important role in feeding our drinking water resources they also help store water during storms and alleviate flooding which in turn protects our communities these small streams and wetlands help recharge our groundwater supplies they also filter pollution and provide habitat for fish and wildlife clean and safe water is the basic very basic human need unfortunately this administration has made it a priority to dismantle the Clean Water Act regardless of what the signs are the law provides the president's dirty water rule puts our water health and health at risk and must be stopped our dress cycle in Southern California continues even though we've had repeated rain in March we must continue to conserve this must be is the new norm for us in the West Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

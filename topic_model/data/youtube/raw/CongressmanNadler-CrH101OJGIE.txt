you mr. chairman we've heard a lot today about saving lives after 23 years in Congress I am still shocked by the hypocrisy we continually here for my friends on the other side of the aisle since 2013 they have been over 900 mass shootings across the country including 300 mass shootings in 2015 an average of more than one mass shooting every day this year 10,000 128 people have been killed this year alone Americans are 20 times more likely to be killed by gun violence and people in any other developed country who are not more or less mentally ill than people in the United States although we have just 30 percent of the world's population the US has ninety percent of the world's firearm homicide and I think that's three percent of the world's population how many hearings of my Republican colleagues held on gun violence since taking over the house in 2011 none since Sandy Hook they've been 142 school shootings the most recent tragedy occurring on a community college in Oregon and since the Oregon shooting 146 people have been killed in 128 shootings in the United States not one hearing not one vote on gun violence for comparison's sake two months ago an extremist liar released a series of heavily edited and probably illegal videos filled with lies about Planned Parenthood an organization that has been providing comprehensive compassion health care to women for a century in the last 30 days the house has opened three official investigations spent countless hours and committee hearings and just yesterday voted to establish a fourth investigation to a special Select Committee we have taken 20 votes this year alone restricting women's access to health care this very hearing is the committee's second in 30 days on Planned Parenthood despite the fact that this entire farce is knowingly based on lies if my colleagues had even one shred of evidence that Planned Parenthood had broken any laws they would have gone to a state or federal prosecutor right away but they didn't and they don't perhaps that's why one of my Republican colleagues mr. shabbos Chaffetz announced on TV just last week that there is no evidence Planned Parenthood has broken any laws imagine how many lives we could save if my colleagues devoted been one half of that attention to stopping the epidemic and it is an epidemic of gun violence in this country my colleagues will claim that we cannot possibly take any action on gun violence because the right to own a gun is protected by the Constitution it's a very funny argument coming from the other side in light of this shameful hearing you know what else is protected by the Constitution a woman's right to access abortion and to make her own choices about her health care and whether to get an abortion get the same colleagues to refuse to take any action on gun violence has no problem have no problem tossing the Constitution out the window to impose their own moral opinions on all american women measures passed at the state and local level put unbelievable restrictions on a woman's right to access and abortion women must endure invasive tests and exams wait 48 hours before they can undergo the procedure take time off from work to visit the one facility in the state where abortion is still available and endure endless badgering and even assault from protesters any time they try to enter a clinic they have a constitutional right to enter they must face regular shaming from the Republicans on this committee almost all men i may add for making the choice to exercise their constitutional rights yet there are no such restrictions for acquiring a gun you can walk into a gun show at noon and walk out 15 minutes later with high-capacity magazine and the semi-automatic rifle in your hands no background check no ID no way of making sure the gun purchase is going to someone with the proper safety training and with no history of domestic violence imagine if we made people jump through the same hoops to buy a firearm as they do for having an abortion imagine the invasive questions about why are you getting the gun and whether or not you've considered all your options imagine the only way to get a gun was to prove to a police report that you've been raped or assaulted in the past or have a lawyer certify that your life is in imminent physical danger unless you get a gun think about being shamed and shadow that and forced to look at graphic images of gun violence as you walk into a gun shop that outraged you feel that nagging feeling that the government is no right to put any restrictions on your constitutional right that is what a woman feels every time she tries to make a decision about her health and about whether or not to under to access her constitutional right to an abortion until this committee is ready to face the real crisis of gun violence our country to take a firm stand that enough is enough and that it is time for real action these proceedings will remain at the critical force this frederiksen are you aware that the Center for medical progress obtained its nonprofit status from the IRS by representing itself as a non-profit based on biomedical research and they did not indicate that political activities in their application and is this a fraud is this illegal to provide false information to the IRS you might they did indeed make that application and I do believe it it's a fraud and illegal thank you my last question is at the moment three House committees and one Senate committee investigating Planned Parenthood the majority's proposed using taxpayer dollars to establish a select panel that would launch its own fifth investigation what do you make of the fact that the majority has committed these were resources to attacking Planned Parenthood and almost none to investigating alleged illegal activity at the Center for medical progress well I think it indicates that the true agenda here is to undermine woman's right to make personal decisions in consultation with her doctor and her family and exercise her constitutional rights to choose her own healthcare as do the testimony of three witnesses have nothing to save that Planned Parenthood but have to say about other that abortion generally thank you very much at your back

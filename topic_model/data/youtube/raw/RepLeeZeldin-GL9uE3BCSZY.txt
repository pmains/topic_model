lee zeldin of New York Thank You mr. chairman ambassador mall you referenced earlier historic verification and monitoring regime have you yet read the verification regime outlined in the side deals between the IAEA and Iran I'm not aware of any side deals between which side deal do you mean I'm referencing the deals between the IAEA and Iran to decide how the jcpoa is going to be implemented what governs the verification of the Iran nuclear deal no Iran and the IAEA have a confidential safeguards agreement that out just like every member of the IAEA your typos or thing have you read that no sir I have not okay I would just offer up for you for secretary Kerry who is here a few months ago it's difficult to vouch for a historic verification and monitoring regime when you don't know what the historic verification and monitoring regime is all you know is what's contained the jcpoa but you don't know what's included in the agreement between the IAEA and Iran especially as we read Associated Press reports about how Iran might be collecting some of their own soil samples it responsible for collecting some of inspecting some of their nuclear sites as we read what the Associated Press reports as far as the verification of the jcpoa if you haven't yet read it it's it's impossible to say that's a historic verification and monitoring regime because you don't know what it is the administration has says this deals not built on trust it's built on verification why hasn't the Obama administration why didn't the Obama administration ask the Iranians to sign the jcpoa why did we ask him to sign it why didn't we ask them to sign it well the the jcpoa is a political agreement and that it emerged it evolved that way in the course of negotiations that in order to preserve our ability to exact the kind of penalties and the kind of nimble ability and agility that we would have to exact penalties if the gree agreement were not implemented correctly we believe it served our interest best to have this as a political agreement i would i would assume that if you have bought and you've bought cars in your lives you bought houses in your life you have signed many agreements you have signed your name on all sorts of things I would imagine if there was an example we need to come up with of something where you should get a signature that the jcpoa is a great example of something where you ask the Iranians would you mind signing it the administration decided not to yeah now what it what is a political commitment can you like the secretary Kerry has referred to the jcpoa not as a treaty and the reason is he said because you would have been able to get it passed that's what he said right here the reason why this isn't the treaty is because he wouldn't been able to get it passed ridiculous answer but moving on he says it's not an executive agreement it's a political commitment what's a political commitment as defined by the Obama administration a political commitment is one that is the official policy of the United States government that we are fully committed as a government to implementing the deal on its terms as a political commitment we or any future government is free to withdraw from that agreement with a minimum of legal difficulty we've decided that i'm sorry you're allowed to withdraw from the from the political commitment without legal difficulty that's right yes okay that's what we're defining the jcpoa as something that you can withdraw from without legal difficulty well if other parties namely Iran decides to withdraw from it they're going to be very serious consequences for that we have preserved by establishing this as a political agreement our freedom of action in ensuring there are dramatic consequences for withdrawal from that agreement okay so should the Iran sanctions act to be extended as is we're I know it's in place until December of this year we're ready to work with the Congress in addressing that question in the road to this what is what is the administration's position on the Iran sanctions Act should it be extended as this our position is is that we're willing to talk with the Congress congressional leadership about that okay when do you plan on coming up with a position on the Iran sanctions act again we are to work with the Congress on on this right your disposal well I have a position the Iran sanctions Act should be extended as is what say you well let's sit down and talk about what that means enduring further does that mean it means Iran sanctions act as is should be extended yes is but in previous efforts to extend the Act there have been efforts suggestions to change the the implementation of its change the author's expending as is but there are there are voices in Congress who would like to amend it so we just we need to have a conversation okay well the the the Obama administration needs to I know that this whole thing about legacy and turning over to the next administration that Iran never acquired a nuclear weapon but many of you all need to pray to God the next administration cleans up your mess I yield back

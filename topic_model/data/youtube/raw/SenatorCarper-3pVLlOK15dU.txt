visit your mystery welcome thank you juice another for joining a sign sorry oh you've got five votes here in the Rose who are sort of in and I apologize for that and I understand you have some family members here maybe do maybe mother yes I am my mother and my uncle are both here was great to see you all thank you and welcome welcome for to our to our hearing your hearing as well I let me just start off by saying mister egg I am I've learned since we we spoke that you may have asserted some type of privilege as part of a refusal to answer Senators questions or deferred to OMB general counsel more frequently than any past oh I olara nominee who has appeared before the committee that pretty stunning and in fact I'm told that you've sorted privilege or counsel deferred to counsel some 19 times in your pre hearing questionnaire and the questionnaire responses and while I'd be the first to acknowledge it may well be appropriate to his whole to redact particular content in some circumstances you apparently have missus has applied may be miss applied overly broad privileged to avoid providing Congress with critical information and documents related to your work ghetto IRA as Associated minister and Acting Administrator ultimately should the full Senate vote to confirm you your general approach of non-responsiveness the committee vetting process we believe sets a bad what you said sets a concerning precedent both for future cut nominees in subsequent oversight efforts to hole the executive branch accountable and this is especially true since you've been you've provided over or I believe presided over been involved in dozens of controversial rules in the past year and a half in which you've worked at olara I have two questions and the I'm a senior Democrat on any environmental Public Works Committee and we focus on service transportation front course a lot of infrastructure issues and we focus a lot on clean clean air clean water and climate issues and so forth the in a EPA's proposal I'm going to talk about the mercury and air toxic rule but NEPA is proposal to remove the legal underpinning of rules to reduce emissions of mercury and other air toxics from power plants Huayra allowed EPA to use the agency's old projected costs of compliance that were three times higher than what the industry actually spent to comply with the rules and ignore the full benefits of the rule I believe I'm told that you declined to provide a specific description of your role in the development of the proposed rule which is opposed by all public health and environmental organizations opposed by the Chamber of Commerce opposed by all electric utilities imposed by the evangelical environmental network and I don't ask a lot of yes or no questions but I I want to get to the the is the straight answer here but yes or no will you provide the committee with the complete description of your involvement in the development of this proposed rule including copies of your calendar and other requested documents senator I can I can tell you now I was not involved in it because I was not acting administrator at the time and a second yes or no question and that would be do you commit to ensure that the final mercury rule uses updated accurate information about the costs and benefits of compliance with the original rules senator I'm not very familiar with that rule because the proposal was reviewed while I was before I was acting administrator I will tell you that you know generally speaking if there is more current data available that is the data that should be used if there is reason to believe it is accurate I do commit to you that I would you know operate under that general principle and you know look very carefully at that at that rule if if it is under review when I am confirmed I just remind remind you and those if you're confirmed you'll be leading this particular role is not not only in doors and your enjoys the support of environmental groups but the utilities the business community a wide range of folks who and their industry is spent money I complied with rule and now they're gonna be asked to walk away from it they don't want to do that and I would just actually keep that in mind obviously like ask your customer will you be up just to listen I would urge you to listen to all of them and you'll use accurate information about the costs and benefits of compliance next question my second and I guess it'll be my last question but this deals with the vehicle fuel standards roll back and Hawara is your largest source of carbon emissions on our planet not coal-fired plants it's not other utilities it's our mobile sources it's the cars trucks and vans that we we drive but a wire is supposed to be an honest broker when resolving interagency disputes and during the interagency review of the joint EPA and Transportation Department proposal to roll back vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards EPA described the Transportation Department's analysis used to justify the rollback as being an Unger to quote quote it reserved their word unusable anyone on to say it had fundamental flaws EPA even asked to have its logo removed from the proposals documentation because it felt the proposal did not include any of its input EPA's input and one last one last question I have as a follow-on to that and again I'm just looking for a yes or no but where you provide the committee with a complete description of your involvement in the development of this proposed rule including copies of your calendar and other documented documents senator for that rule as well that proposal was reviewed before I was acting administrator and I had extremely extremely limited limited involvement and I had no knowledge of the fact that you just said and so until this process then do you commit to ensure that the final car rule uses technical assumptions and cost-benefit analysis that do not include the same problems EPA identified with the proposed rule a similar I absolutely commit to ensuring that rules are based on the best science the best data and the best analysis including including that rule if I'm confirmed thanks very much sender Peters yeah what mr. caucus have I have a couple secretaries that Lake Taylor without mister I just remind us of my colleagues I said this to mr. ray yesterday we're an oversight committee and and we do oversight over the whole federal government that's there was a responsibilities committee and they the only way we can be effective doing our job is to make sure that folks like you if you're confirmed are forthcoming and not asking for privilege and not declining to provide information eventually we're gonna have an election who knows who's gonna win next time who's going to be the majority is gonna be the administration but this this is one that could come back to bite folks on both sides of the oil and I I know mark chairman cares a lot about oversight and let's make sure that we this committee gets the information that they need and I said to mr. a yesterday I said one of my concerns when you have a nominee who's not being especially forthcoming and cites privilege like 19 times which i think is more than anybody ever the idea will that person will that nominees confirmed be any more forthcoming once they are confirmed in that position that's a matter of grave concern for me I think it should be for all of us

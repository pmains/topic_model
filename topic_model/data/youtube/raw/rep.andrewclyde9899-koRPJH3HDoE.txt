what were you hoping to learn from this inquiry and simply asking to be able to to see what's going on what were you hoping to find out well you know this resolution of inquiry was intended to find out from the military the exact origin of their you know the wokeness that's really creeping into our military and has been creeping in for for a number of years it's damaging our Readiness it's damaging our retention um you know our ability our fighting ability has been decreased it's just really been difficult for our military because of the focus on um you know pronouns right they should be focusing on fighting they should be focusing on training they should be focusing on making sure that we are the most lethal fighting force in the world not on uh on what we call each other you know they them him her whatever you know you um you made reference to the recruitment I mean the military all branches having difficulty meeting their recruitment goals we see morale being low of course we're booting out healthy people because they won't get a what we now know ineffective vaccine so what what do you think the motivation is for the Democrats in simply blocking this request to get information is it simply politics to them or is it what we see from this Administration being fixated on this issue of this sexual ideology well I think that that the left really wants to use the military as a way to spread their their uh you know Ultra left-wing ideology and they don't want us to see the origins of it uh you know secretary Austin and President Biden have bowed down in my opinion to the left Progressive agenda and uh it's it's really hurting our military and I want to find out the truth here I want to find out where it came from and I want to find out how we can stop that you know if we can find out where it came from we can defund it and we can pinpoint it and then maybe we can eliminate some of the positions through the Holman Rule and Appropriations uh that that focuses on this gender ideology that focuses on on diversity equity and inclusion that needs to be eliminated from our military you know uh Congressman that's a really good point that people need to understand that with the 100 18th congress with Republicans having a control in the house not the Senate but the house do not have the white house but Congress funds the government and many of the policies are attached to spending and so you have the the power of the purse so you might not be able to pass laws but you certainly can defund those things which run counter to in this case I would argue National Security all right you're absolutely right um it does run counter to National Security and when the military focuses on these sort of things and doesn't focus on Readiness and doesn't focus on as free to core the traditions of our military then our nation suffers from it you know we have a we have issues then with uh the projection of power overseas uh in that as a combat veteran someone who served in the Navy for 28 years and who's got three combat tours overseas in Iraq and Kuwait uh I can tell you that the strong horse is respected uh the weak horse is shamed and the weak horse is attacked and right now President Biden and Lloyd Austin are our defense secretary uh they're not respected overseas if we were teaching military history to those in the military and not pronoun usage they might understand that strength is all is the path to peace and but that's not what we're learning or what our men and women in the military learning today no I think Ronald Reagan said it best you know we will achieve peace through strength and uh that's the that should be our Focus unfortunately it's not our focus and so this uh resolution of inquiry is intent to find its intent is to find the source of this and uh see how infected our military actually is and then that gives us the opportunity to go after it and to eliminate it as I said through Appropriations processes well Congressman Klein I certainly hope that happens in the 118th Congress as the Republicans will have control of those committees

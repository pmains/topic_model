the apa asked bayer the predecessor here in 2019 to help the agency collect data on adverse incidents for cats and dogs using the ceresto caller epa asked bayer to split the registration for cats and dogs so the agency could better understand and evaluate the risks for each type of pet they are refused saying that that change might have quote an adverse impact on sales and they also said quote it would be a substantial increase in work mr simmons are you willing to make that change and split the registration for cats and dogs as the epa requested or do you believe it's too much work i am willing to engage with the epa on anything that the scientific data and the engagement under the regulatory body of the epa merits is the right thing to do we believe the 80 studies and all of the the the pharmacovigilance data that we've submitted to them stands that this is a safe product as well as all the value that it brings to the pets and to the human health with the tick borne illness on over 500 000 people a year that the cdc highlights so the value's significant the risk is reasonable always we're willing to engage with you with all respect mr simmons it's not your job to decide if the risk is reasonable that's the job of the regulatory body my concern here is that soresto is standing in the way of allowing the epa to gather those necessary data and make that decision i encourage alanko to work with the epa to get this data and if they won't then seresto will have to come off the market because too many families have suffered already

this house that does not mean that we are dispensing with all disagreements in this debate our democracy is robust precisely because we have beliefs and we stand proudly even persistently for them and our democracy indoors and prevails because in the end we are humble enough to find a way forward together so my fellow colleagues are the 114th Congress let us uphold our deep and different convictions but let us honor our common obligation to our country in this Congress we will do that do so under the leadership of Speaker John Boehner this house will continue to be led by a proud son

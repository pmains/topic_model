mr. chair I stand here today to offer while I stand here today as I offer my amendment residents across the Great Lakes are facing imminent threats to their property their infrastructure and to the shorelines themselves due to historically high water levels Great Lakes communities including many in my own district along the shores of Lake Michigan are in critical need of shoreline projects to protect against devastating erosion for those of us who call the region home the Great Lakes forever shapes our way of life it's where we recreative isness it's where we pass along the heritage of our region they've the Great Lakes form the largest fresh surface water system on the earth holding nearly 20 percent of the world's fresh water supply they directly generate more than 1.5 million jobs provide the backbone of a five trillion dollar regional economy and are the home for more than 3,500 different plants and species as I often say we can and should both protect and promote both the economy and the ecology of the Great Lakes however our communities are facing devastating consequences if we don't act to protect our shorelines now the high water levels combined with the effect of recent storms which brought even higher waves and strong winds are threatening our community's public infrastructure including roads bridges and docks have been battered and in some cases actually lost recreational beaches have disappeared and others covered with dangerous debris now habitats have been destroyed and numerous homes are teetering on the edge of dune cliffs or are threatened by the rising water level this amendment which would set aside just 10% of the spending in these particular projects would ensure that communities within the Great Lakes system receive necessary funding through the living shoreline grant program to protect and preserve our shorelines it's imperative that resources are provided through all available options to enhance the shorelines of the Great Lakes and to protects our protect our home in our communities now I understand the ranking members position on this particular package of bills and Senate activity or maybe lack thereof on this yet I do have a responsibility to not only highlight this issue but to advocate for those that are in desperate need and in desperate desperate situations so that is one of the reasons why I will be supporting this package and I ask for consideration of my my my colleagues to help adopt this amendment and whether it's going together as a package or whether it gets dealt with separately in the Senate I know that this is something that we need to look at as a body as a legislative body and we need to act now with that I reserve

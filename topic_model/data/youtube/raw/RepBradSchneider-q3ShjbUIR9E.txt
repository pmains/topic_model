thank you Mr Speaker I rise today to talk about mental health in general and the need for a different mindset about Mental Health and Care in this country specifically I stand up tonight for the countless family members friends neighbors across the country as they endure a struggle with mental health either for themselves or for a family member the number of Americans battling mental illness or disorder is not small in fact over half of adults will deal with mental health issues and one in five children has or will have a debilitating mental illness suicide is now ranked as the second leading cause of death among children ages 10 to 14. think about that suicide is the second leading cause of death this is more than simply heartbreaking we have a problem that's nearly one death every 11 minutes suicide is a tragic outcome for people dealing with with mental crisis but across the country there are so many dealing in other ways especially in the midst of this pandemic working parents trying to make it through the day juggling parents not working trying to find ways to make ends meet kids in remote School losing the opportunity for the social emotional learning that is so critical for their development families juggling remote work and remote school at the same time all of these have contributed to what is truly a mental health crisis in the country in fact as we think about it in the same way that young kids babies born during the Depression were forever known as depression babies it's very likely that this generation and during the pandemic will be covered babies throughout their life it will have an impact beyond that we have the issues of mass violence I live in Highland Park two weeks ago we experienced something that no Community should ever go through but unfortunately too many communities have and continue to do so Highland Park Uvalde and go back to Sandy Hook so many others too long a list to give a comprehensive uh naming of every single community that has suffered from Mass violence but at its core there's something these kids committing and perpetrating these heinous crimes monstrous crimes if we can reach them at an earlier age maybe we can reduce some of that violence or is this an exhaustive list of all the things all the aspects of mental health that affect people we know that the pandemic has made all of us painfully aware of the inadequacies and inequalities of our mental health system too late in the process our system steps in to deal with crises rather than working on helping people have a strong and confident helpful life and Tackle challenges as they they occur we should be providing holistic mental health care and provide support early and often at the Baseline Americans are experiencing anxiety and depression at higher rates and the number of services available just aren't keeping up putting a crisis on top of a crisis for those already suffering from mental health issues then pandemic has increased their symptoms and experts experts worry that we will deal with the stressors and effects long after the official end of this pandemic everywhere I go in my district and around the country I hear stories some heartbreaking some just simply frustrating about people's struggles getting care for themselves and their love loved ones it's not a new problem in fact sharing just a couple of personal stories my first experience of tragedy in the context of mental health my best friend is a young child in elementary school was a boy named David Siegel he was a special kind heart a brilliant young man as he aged we moved apart in Middle School and then I learned that at age 21 he took his own life his parents told that we're told that he felt as if he was locked in a box he was so smart and he could see the possibilities available to his friends he wanted more than anything else what he saw everyone else had but he knew that it would never be available to him because of the Box in which he was locked in his pain was unbearable and at 21 he took his life years later I lost a cousin Jeff whose pain was also all-consuming he tried many times to escape his pain his family tried to help we all tried to help he sought therapy but again that pain was so all-consuming that ultimately was a relatively young man he died by Suicide when we come back to the present moment I've heard from the Anne and Robert H Laurie Children's Hospital in Chicago that the pandemic has increased the severity of the Mental Health crisis in children during the pandemic suicide attempts jumped from a pre-pandemic level of two to three per month to two to three each and every day before the pandemic lury's children would get maybe 50 calls a week for new appointments at the height of the pandemic they were receiving 50 calls every single day a third of clinicians are reporting a three-month wait time for an appointment if they even have the room to begin with in many places the wait is much much longer this massive mismatch of supply and demand impacts the quality of care those with appointments are able to receive providers have empathy and compassion fatigue emotional exclamation and are less personal and less connected with their patients older Americans some of the most vulnerable in our society are at an increased risk high levels of isolation increase the risk of depression cognitive decline in dementia already 20 percent 20 percent of those 55 or older typically experience some form of anxiety and depression to severe cognitive impairment additionally mental health does not only afflict those who have been diagnosed it touches many other parts of our society in 2008 Thomas R Insel then the leader of the National Institute Institutes of mental health estimated that mental illness costs our economy about 193 billion dollars 193 billion dollars each year in Lost earnings 8.4 million Americans are providing about 32 hours of uncompensated care per week to those with mental health care needs whether family or friends leaving mental illness unaddressed results in the increased incarceration of people with unmet mental health needs those dealing with stressors related to mental health are left more susceptible to the overuse of drugs and alcohol despite the pervasive pervasiveness of mental health issue issues less than half of adults with any mental health condition received treatment in 2020. for Americans of color the rate of those getting treatment is even less than the national average I find the current landscape of mental health in America simply unacceptable every day we fail to take strong action to bolster Mental Health Care Services is another day closer to failing our friends our family our neighbors that's why making access to the appropriate Mental Health Resources cheaper and easier is critical I want to share with you one example of how the Mental Health crisis affects one of our most important population groups our youth last year I see the letter from a high school senior outlining her findings about the disparities in Mental Health Resources at her school she highlighted the value placed on new gym flooring and new scoreboards but the lack of investment in Mental Health Counselors she shared that they lost a classmate early in the year to suicide she had also become more aware of so-called suicide websites and social media's influence on our children's mental health I applaud the initiative of that High School of writing to me and voicing her concern each of us has a responsibility to not only reach out for help but to advocate for our neighbors who feel powerless and are left to struggle another story I want to share is that of a dear young beautiful woman 19 year old Orly Shuffling sheffy from my town Orly was a light that shined brightly in fact her name means my light she was a tenacious journalist and beloved friend with a passion for the pursuit of Truth and justice she strongly believed in the need to provide Mental Health Services to the point where she was training to provide confidential peer counseling services to her classmates efficient Health Mental Health Services possibly could have saved orley's life or at least time with us is not about how she left us but it's about the impact she made while she was here an impact that is still felt by so many today no parents should lose their child at such a young age we also lost Brian crater's Young sister Katie who died by Suicide at 25. she was completing her master's degree in social work and active in the community with programs like Meals on Wheels the family is carried on Katie's memory through their Suicide Prevention advocacy work and Brian's participation in the Bank of America's Chicago marathon in honor of a sister our unmet health needs reach from our youth to our nation's Heroes when it comes to Veterans who defend our nation and our freedom we are losing 22 to suicide every day when it comes to our cops and firefighters we fail to recognize that they're on the job trauma is crushing to their mental health and well-being Jeff Smith was a metropolitan police officer whose family lives in my district he was dispatched to the U.S Capitol on January 6 and suffered injuries both visible and not in defending us and defending me that very day his father shared with me that those injuries and the combination of the stigma around mental health and the lack of access to care contributed to his terrible loss we must do better if we want to honor Jeff honor Officer Jeff Smith we must do better if we want to honor our veterans if we want to honor Orly sheffy and if we want to honor all those who have lost the terrible mental health issues we have lost to terrible Health mental issues of all stripes fortunately I have some positive news to share that is giving me hope and optimism about this Mental Health crisis here in the house we pass the restoring hope for mental health and well-being Act of 2022 to holistically address Americans mental health and Crisis Care needs one program I'm glad this legislation will help strengthen is the National Suicide Prevention Hotline which is now 988. moving to the 988 phone number is a once in a lifetime opportunity for America to strengthen and expand an existing Lifeline to everyone and ensure that everyone is aware of this new service the Nationwide number will allow people to call or text a trained crisis counselor who can provide critical help whether it is thoughts of suicide mental health or a substance use crisis no matter where you are in the country a well-resourced 988 line will be able to connect a person in the Mental Health crisis to a trained counselor who can address their immediate needs and help connect them to ongoing care mitigate Health Care spending with more cost-effective early intervention help reduce the use of law enforcement to treat mental health issues meet the rising need for crisis Innovation at a grand scale and importantly help end the stigma toward those seeking or accessing mental health care the creation and launch of 988 fills me with hope and optimism that this will not be a Last Action we we take we will have to make sure that Mental Health Resources are adequately funded for Americans and our health care providers and properly managed if we want to see proper success I will continue to fight for the belief that access to affordable quality Health Care is our right for every American not just to reserve privilege for a select few and with that I want to turn a conversation over to a dear friend and colleague Susan Wilde from Pennsylvania

Mr Speaker I rise today in support of HR 6201 the second coronavirus relief bill fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills were enacted less than three months ago which included record levels of spending on our public health infrastructure this allowed the administration to respond immediately to the coronavirus when the threat became clear last week the House and Senate voted almost unanimously on an eight billion dollar emergency supplemental giving the administration new resources to respond to the virus unfortunately the threat we face has grown more complex and costly and only a week's time the bill before us will provide a second installment of supplemental funds and combate the negative economic effects of this disease that has now been called a pandemic this legislation builds off of last week's bill where we expanded the availability of tests for the corona virus to ensure that everyone who needs to be tested gets tested in his remarks today the president reaffirmed his commitment to distribute millions of tests and speed up how they are processed this bill takes the next step to include more than 1 billion dollars to cover the cost of taking these tests including for servicemembers and veterans we must ensure tester administrated so that people know if they are infected this is the only way we can stop the spread of this virus emergency food assistance is providing the bill for seniors women children and low-income families this includes additional help for children whose schools are being closed as a precautionary measure to keep them safe tax incentives are included to encourage American businesses to allow employees to take emergency leave to limit spread of the virus no one should have to choose between getting a paycheck or infecting other people we have heard many concerns about the needs of small businesses in addition to the tax incentives in the bill and 37 billion dollars is already available from prior appropriations for the Small Business Administration to make loans as we watch the impact of this virus on our nation's job creators I will continue working with the administration and my colleagues to ensure they get the help they need while bringing this bill to the floor has taken much longer than I'd hoped it is time for Congress to pass it this bill will give the president and our public health officials the tools that are needed right now to respond to this quickly changing threat I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this measure we must pass this bill today to help lessen the devastating impact of this global pandemic on the American people thank you and I reserve the balance of my time

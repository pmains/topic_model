we are a melting pot in California we treat our immigrants with respect and have passed laws to protect them and I think that this administration has gone the wrong way and mostly political for the end of being in power and I think it is wrong to use children and their families imagine if your mother being torn away from your child and not being able to do anything about it if you're a father and you're at home in another country and you're your spouse and your child is trying to find a way to protect that child being turned down or being made to wait and then trying to figure out what they're going to prove it or not it is inhumane and it is time that we as a nation stood up and said to them to this administration get with it be compassionate we are not living up the values that this country stands for and I think it's time that we made it clear that we will not tolerate anymore this abuse because it is an abuse towards other people and they have legitimate claims to violence in their country so we must be able to act the fact that they only process a few a day doesn't make sense why not put more instead of putting more guards at the border put more people to work on those claims to make sure that those people are protected

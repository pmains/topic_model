part of solution is is drilling for oil and gas we've authorized the oil companies to drill on close to 70 million acres of land onshore and offshore so far they've exercised I think less than twenty-five percent of those lease opportunities and they need to take full advantage of the opportunities that they have we recently opened up additional offshore lands off of the coast of Louisiana and Florida those need to be to be fully fully developed in addition to that I think most of the oil that we produce in this country should stay in this country and finally to the extent that we realized royalties and tax revenues that flow from these are these leases of oil land those money should be used to help pay for biofuels research to pay for research on wind and solar other renewable forms of energy to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and especially to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels we have actually mandated in the Congress in the last several years that we produce in this country billions of gallons of our new renewable fuels I don't think it makes a lot of sense to take corn kernels of corn disruptive food the food chain make food more expensive to make a biofuel when we can use a waste product corn corn cobs rather corn or corn holders that stalks of corn we can use wood chips any variety of which guys stuff that's not to be used for anything else to create biofuels it doesn't drive it up food prices and we're getting the point now where we can create biofuels that have create a whole lot more energy than is used to create the biofuel and supervised fuels that actually dramatically reduce greenhouse gases as compared to to gasoline so there's great bye great deal of potential here we need to fully exploit it the DuPont company right right in Delaware is a leader in the world in terms of creating ethanol out of waste products corn stalks wood chips and that kind of thing they'll also partnered with BP to to create something called biobutanol which is a form of fuel that has better energy content better energy density than does ethanol it travels in pipelines ethanol is not biobutanol the dupont product is also mixes better with gasoline at different temperatures ethanol is not so it's it's a so the next generation of super biofuel and it has a lot of a lot of promise for us and for the world biofuels to the extent we get away from creating biofuels out of kernels of corn biofuels can reduce our reliance on foreign oil they can help make our air cleaner they can reduce the threat of greenhouse gases and they can put money let me put the money in the pockets of farmers which is not a bad thing either

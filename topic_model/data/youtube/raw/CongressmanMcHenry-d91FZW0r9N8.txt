CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE   TIME TOGETHER THAT WE HAD. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. >> WELL, THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR HIS   KIND WORDS AND FOR HIS   IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP IN THE  CAPITALS MARK. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.  MR. SPEAKER, THE TITLE DOESN'T   DO THE ACT JUSTICE.  THIS IS ABOUT HELPING FAMILIES,  COMMUNITIES, SMALL BUSINESSES,   ENTREPRENEURS, THOSE THAT ARE  RISK TAKERS IN OUR SOCIETY   TRYING TO MAKE OUR SOCIETY   BETTER, MORE PROSPEROUS AND  HELPING FAMILIES IN COMMUNITIES  LIKE THE ONE I REPRESENT IN  WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA BETTER  OFF. MR. MCHENRY: WE NEED TO HELP   FAMILIES, SMALL BUSINESSES, TO   HELP MAKE US MORE PROSPEROUS AS  AMERICANS. AND SO THIS ACT DEALS WITH APP   COUPLE OF THOSE AREAS, IN  PARTICULAR, FOR FAMILIES, SMALL  BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS SO  NECK GAIN GREATER ACCESS TO  LENDING, TO LOANS, TO CAPITAL,   THAT THEY NEED TO HELP   BUSINESSES GROW AND CREATE   JOBS.  WINDOW OF THOSE BILLS TO -- TWO  OF THOSE BILLS TO THAT END THAT  I AUTHORED EARLIER THIS YEAR   WHICH WE PASSED WITH OVER 400  VOTES IS INDIVIDUAL STAND-ALONE  ITEMS IN THE HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES. THE FIX CROWDFUNDING ACT, IN   PARTICULAR, AMEND EXISTING   SECURITY LAWS TO MAKE IT EASIER  FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND   ENTREPRENEURS TO USE INNOVATIVE  FORMS OF CAPITAL FORMATION.  INVESTMENT CROWDFUNDING AND  ANGEL INVESTING ARE TWO OF   THOSE AREAS IN PARTICULAR. TO SUPPORT THOSE IDEAS THAT  ENABLE US TO CREATE JOBS.  THOSE TWO BILLS WERE PART OF   THE LARGER PACKAGE, THAT ARE   PART OF THE INNOVATION   INITIATIVE THAT LEADER MCCARTHY  AND I LAUNCHED AT THE BEGINNING  OF THIS YEAR.  A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT HAVE  MOVED THROUGH THE HOUSE WITH   WIDE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THAT   UPDATE OUTDATED LAWS.  SO TODAY THIS PACKAGE IS AN  IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT  DIRECTION BUT OUR WORK IS NOT  DONE.  WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK  WITH OUR FEDERAL REGULATORS, TO  MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE   AISLE HERE TO ENSURE WE UPDATE   AND ENSURE INVESTMENT  CROWDFUNDING, ANGEL INVESTING  AND OTHER AREAS OF INNOVATION  CAN ACTUALLY BE BETTER DEPLOYED  ACROSS OUR SOCIETY AND TO MORE   PEOPLE.  WITH THAT I URGE MY COLLEAGUES   TO VOTE YES AND ENSURE THIS  BIPARTISAN BILL HAS WIDE   APPROVAL HERE IN THE HOUSE   TODAY. THE SPEAKER PRTE

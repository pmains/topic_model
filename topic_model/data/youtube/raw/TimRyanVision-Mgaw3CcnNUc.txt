um two things one thank you very much and i'm comforted by your uh background because i think you understand these issues um better than most i uh have a suggestion for the administration that i hope you would take back we're having a lot of discussions today about tpp and this trade agreement within that discussion is a separate discussion about trade adjustment assistance because we know we're going to lose jobs throughout the from the trade agreements we want to make sure our folks are ready i think that the president is in a unique position now to ask the the same folks who want this trade agreement to ask them to help us push a transportation bill a robust fully funded transportation bill and that he would be a lot more interested in talking about a trade agreement after a robust fully funded transportation bill was brought to his desk for him to sign and i think this makes investments that we need to make i think he's in a unique political position right now to be able to ask for this uh and as you know the united states chamber of commerce as well as is many of the labor unions are supportive of a robust fully funded transportation bill so those folks uh especially on the corporate side i think could help push some of our friends in congress to get this done and then then we can move on to a separate discussion about trade my issue that i from from our discussion here today is the tiger program we've seen the benefits of this in my congressional district in the city of kent ohio where a 20 million dollar tiger grant has been parlayed into i think 120 to 140 million dollars in other investment completely transformed downtown kent it's benefited kent state university a great deal there's phase two coming now within the within the project because of this 20 million dollar investment and so i think as a committee this kind of program is something that i think if we're gonna move money around this is a program that can transform communities and all of the programs and transportation and housing are very very important and essential in so many different ways but it's hard to see programs like the tiger that are transformative for communities so if you could speak to that and and how we could work with you to make the the tiger program uh move from a kitten back into a tiger yeah well they both purr but look i i think you see the evidence reflected in what we're asking for here about 1.25 billion dollars on an annual basis for tiger because we have seen the catalytic impact of tiger in communities it's not really by the way just the projects that get funded it's also the fact that you know the 95 percent of the other projects that don't get funded end up getting projects off the shelf into the planning phase and many communities find themselves more ready to move forward with other projects even if they don't receive tiger funding and it's been one of the few areas where we've actually been able to catalyze more activity at the state and local levels to get transformative projects done so tiger packs a big punch it always punches above its weight it's always undersized relative to the demand but it's certainly a program that we think deserves to be part of the ongoing work of the department of transportation now

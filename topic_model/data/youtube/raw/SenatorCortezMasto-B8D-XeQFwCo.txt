thank you thank you gentlemen for being here today let me just start with Captain Jones and and Rear Admiral Thoth it pronounced last night for me is it Thoth thank you my understanding is after after talking with our washer tribe of Nevada and California and what I'm hearing from many of our tribes is that tribal specific funding streams to address the opioid epidemic in our tribal communities that was not included in the 2017 State targeted response to the opioid epidemic grants is that true correct so the statute basically limits eligibility to states so don't you think there should be targeted grant funding to address these issues in our tribal communities we certainly would be willing to carry forward however Congress appropriates those dollars or authorizes those are they needed I think we've described today that there is a substantial problem in Indian country and we've taken as many flexibilities as we can I'll take that as a yes all right and then my colleague was talking to you about a culturally appropriate treatment and I believe in it I think we not only do we need culture culturally appropriate but we need trauma-informed treatment as well can you talk a little bit about that both of you do you provide trauma-informed treatment as well when we're talking about substance abuse needs and treatment in tribal community yes ma'am we entirely support trauma-informed care it's it's very important to get to the root of the problem so many patients that are seeking relief from opioids may actually be suffering from untreated mental illness they may also be suffering from economic disparity they may be suffering from historical trauma they may be suffering from a lot of issues that came up through childhood as well and so having an understanding of a person's background a person's culture where a person is coming from is very important to being able to effectively bond with them and to make a connection and to deliver effective treatment thank you I'll just add on our grant programs I think trauma-informed care in the importance of addressing co-occurring substance use and mental disorders are infused throughout our grant programs fantastic and rear-admiral do you have the resources you need to provide that level of care appreciate the question the the IHS wants to be responsive to tribal concerns and I have heard from tribes that there are not enough resources out there certainly any funding that Congress can provide will definitely be appreciated and I also hear from our tribe said it is difficult to get that treatment because they don't always I've heard a lot of conversation about working with our states but the state's already right tapped out trying to find that treatment that they need for substance abuse within their states so then requiring our tribes then work with the states to fight for that money as well it's a little difficult makes it much harder to get the resources to our tribal communities wouldn't you agree with that I think that's really the importance of the STR funding and other training and technical assistance that were applying broadly across the US and even specific to tribes around training and technical assistance is to build the capacity so we could have you know multiple billions of dollars that could be spent on treatment but if we don't have providers who can provide that care whether you're an Indian country or not you're not going to be able to get access to evidence-based care so that is really a core part of the work that we're doing is to build that foundational capacity and then would you agree that a special behavioral health program for Indians that parallels the structure of the existing special diabetes program for Indians to provide substance abuse prevention intervention and other needed behavioral health services might be an answer to addressing these needs of substance abuse needs in tribal communities do you think the diabetes program is a good model to emulate Thank You senator we absolutely think that the diabetes program has been an excellent model emulation of that funding model is something that we have heard from tribes and yes it's an excellent idea thank you and then one final question for mr. Anderson thank you for everything you do first of all I do know you US attorneys a USA's and US attorneys across the country are working very hard in our tribal communities you're tapped for resources I know that I will say that as somebody who worked in my state and law enforcement let me talk to you about this this came up chair Hoeven asked you about this the impact of moving Haida out of the Office of National Drug Control Policy can you talk a little bit about height and how important those grants are and how effective Qaeda is in uh in our communities senator Hyde a certainly an important part of what we do the federal partnership focusing on those high-intensity drug corridors throughout the country in terms of the structure of hideout or its funding that's not something I can discuss today but I do can tell you that they are from a law and federal law enforcement perspective a critical aspect of our efforts to introduce the flow of illegal drugs including opioids heading to and and that end up in our tribal community thank you critical and effective yes and then let me just say this we are back combating opioids now and it is a crisis across the country ten years ago it was methamphetamines it's black tar heroin I can promise you that we are going to unless we address this through treatment unless we address this through dollars and fighting not just not just assuming that law enforcement is going to do it all we are gonna see constantly this shifting from methamphetamine to black tar heroin to opioids in our communities it's something that is a scourge that we need to address and we have to come together on the treatment side and law enforcement side and adequately fund it in all of our communities including our tribal communities really to really combat the crisis that we have across this country so thank you

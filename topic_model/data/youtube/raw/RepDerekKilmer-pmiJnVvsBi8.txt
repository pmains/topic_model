Thank You mr. Speaker I rise to discuss the threat of ocean acidification to my region and others I live in the most glorious part of this world as a dad it is a joy to share the Pacific Northwest natural resources with my two little girls but those natural resources don't just contribute to our recreational experiences they contribute to our economy to in Washington state alone the shellfish industry contributes more than 250 million dollars to our economy and supports more than 3,200 jobs our coast depends on a strong fishing industry but all of that is threatened by ocean acidification last week in Tacoma I listened to businesses and fishermen and researchers detail how we're beginning to see the effects of our changing ocean chemistry it's impacted shellfish we know that but we've not yet begun to comprehend how ocean acidification disrupts our larger marine ecosystem that's why this week I'm introducing the ocean acidification innovation Act which would encourage federal agencies to better leverage existing federal dollars by creating incentives for private sector and researchers to strengthen our ability to research monitor and mitigate the impacts of ocean acidification Mr Speaker we need to act now our economy depends on it thank you and I yield back

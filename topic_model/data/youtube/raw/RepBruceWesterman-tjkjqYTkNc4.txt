joining us now the ranking member of House natural resources he's Congressman Bruce Westerman along with former CBO director Douglas Holtz Eakin gentlemen thank you so much for spending time with us tonight uh first you Congressman President Biden now may declare a climate emergency critics are saying nothing screams lame duck or desperation than that is it an emergency that Biden's agenda stalling well good to be with you it is it is an emergency what's happening to it with inflation and with crosses in our country and energy isn't the root of that and when the word climate comes out of Biden's mouth that basically means another attack on domestic energy we have the energy here that we should be producing creating American jobs and I'm afraid another modern climate emergency is going to mean a higher prices at the pump it's going to mean higher food costs of listening to the comments about the the inputs and the raising chicken we grow a lot of chicken in my district in Arkansas and even if you as you see nitrogen fertilizer costs increase um that translates into an increased cost in grains that go into feeding all kinds of animals so I don't think we've seen the even really the beginning of the pressure on food process with drought with reduction in planted lands because of input costs there are a lot of things working in the opposite favor of ordering food costs energies right there with it yeah that's true we hear Congressman to what the congressman is saying Douglas the White House says this this quote the president made clear that the Senate doesn't act on his agenda he will you know Senator Joe mancha said no to more climate spending but Douglas one year ago today the president called inflation temporary temporary it was just 5.4 percent it has since nearly doubled to an historic 9.1 percent watch that and watch the White House new spin watch our experts believe in the data shows that most of the price increases we've seen are were expected and are expected to be temporary there's nobody suggesting there's unsex inflation on the way no serious economies I think it has to do the ambiguity about the length of that word um some people hear transitory and they're going to think weeks and months I think the lack of specificity about the Cadence that were was implied by that word the temporal Cadence implied by that word led to a level of ambiguity that that wasn't serving the the debate uh uh very well Douglas that needs a U.N translator what is he talking about uh that's just games with words Liz I mean that the the reality is that we could look at the data in the middle of 2021 and see that around the globe where they claim they were big Supply problems inflation had gone up by say two percentage points in Europe and the United States it was already up by six percentage points so you know it was a U.S grown problem it was a policy decision they made with the American Rescue plan uh keeping the the big uh monetary student listen and having quite frankly just a flawed climate strategy which has you know as the Congress has pointed out it's really had big consequences for the U.S it's it's it's really striking if you think back to nearly 15 years ago 2008 last time we had a big run-up in oil prices the US was very exposed to it post 2010 the explosion of the North American Shale uh Revolution suddenly when Global oil prices went up we owned the gas station and we did just as well as the consumers were hurt I mean it was no longer a big deal the U.S and we've now undone that progress and now we're more exposed to inflation and we're more exposed to the threat of recession it's two big flaws in their strategy yeah to what Douglas is saying we see diesel going up it looks like 76 year-over-year Congressman gas is up 60 percent that's feeding through to shipping costs causing consumer prices to go up so the Democrats though are pushing away toward culture issues we had 17 Democrats including ilhan Ulmer Ayanna Presley arrested for blocking a street and an abortion rally at the Supreme Court today you're going to see images of Alexandria Casey Cortez caught on video escorted Away by police with her hands crossed behind her back she was not in handcuffs so she's indicating that she's looking like she was in handcuffed she was not but this is the thing the White House is saying that it's up to OPEC to pump War Biden inherited a nation that was energy independent so you see the Democrats moving toward culture issues where it's kitchen table issues for voters really that's what the the polls show what do you think you're exactly right on this if they're doing anything they can to distract uh American voters from uh the crisis that this Administration in the far left has created instead of solving the problems instead of looking to Texas or Alaska to solve our supply problems why on Earth would they go to Saudi Arabia in the first place why go negotiate with a cartel when you could be creating jobs here in America and as far as temporary inflation it makes me want to channel my inner Reagan to say that uh you know temporary by inflation is the closest thing to eternal life uh here on Earth it's not temporary it's here to stay until you make changes we could get on a different path and start fixing the problems the lower inflation but right now we're headed right back to Jimmy Carter's 19th yeah and into the what the congressman is saying when inflation hit nine percent in the early 70s Doug it stayed there for nine years it gets really sticky and you have real weekly earnings dropping 4.4 percent that's worse than the Great Recession so we want to show you now what Transportation secretary P Buda judge testified about electric cars and the benefits to Americans feeling the ongoing pain at the gas pump watch this of course the more pain we are all experiencing from the high price and price of gas the more benefit there is for those who can access electric vehicles okay the the average electric car costs more than the average American family and by the way electric cars are powered by the power grid which is 80 powered by fossil fuels yeah this has never really hung together as an argument I mean they've got an incredibly you know really risky climate strategy that says we're gonna have the cleanest uh electricity generation ever just solar and Renewables and then we're going to transport across a grid that's never existed and we're going to power every vehicle every home and every factory in America with that that it's not a realistic strategy as even as a climate strategy and it's led to this exposure on the oil and natural gas front it's a terrible policy misstep and it's and it's really uh changing the subject because if you look in the data and they seem to not want to talk about this you can take something like uh rents or homeowner costs shelter costs and they are up from one percent to almost six percent they have shown no sign of going down they're steadily going up there's no supply chain there there's no uh invasion of Ukraine in a house there are none of the things they want to distract and change the subject about that's just policy errors causing inflation and if you look at food energy and shelter that's fifty percent of the American budget and it's going up at 11 a year those are the problems and you know it gets to be the danger zone when late night comedy is weighing in watch this I read that Dr fauci said that he plans to retire by the end of President Biden's term and then everyone turn to Biden like is there anything you'd like to announce too have you noticed that Biden's got a little Feist here lately because when he first came out he was like a soothing Grandpa offering you butterscotch from his coin purse prices of gas are so high that these days driving is the entire date you know it's just like he really spoiled me last night we we drove all the way from my house to the end of the block out he's so romantic okay that's funny stuff your final word congressman well that is funny but you see the the late night comedians turning against uh this President this Administration just like the polling shows uh basically everybody is uh I saw a poll that showed over 90 percent of Americans are concerned about high food cost and high energy cost and this Administration just keeps doubling down on bad policy got it I was in that hearing and the TNI committee with uh secretary booty judge and uh you know it's bad Environmental Policy the way they're pushing for electric vehicles so much at the same time they're pushing for these vehicles they're closing down mines in the United States where we produce the Elements and Minerals that go into them interesting there's no strategy or cohesiveness to their policy got it Congressman Westerman and Douglas Holtz eek in a pleasure how

thank you mr chairman and it is uh truly refreshing to see that we have a chairman and a ranking member who are both concerned about our rural veterans as well and i thank you and i look forward to working with you mr mcdonald first of all i want to thank you for the phone call the other day the opportunity to visit with you um was good and i appreciated the knowledge that you bring your preparation for our visit uh and and your understanding of some of the challenges that the va faces um i i also look i i plan on supporting you in in in um your nomination for this position and i thank you for your service to our country mr mcdonald the hot springs va facility in hot springs south dakota is a critical part of the department's black hills health care system in october secretary wilkie rescinded a a record of decision on the future of the campus which provides vital health care services not only to south dakotans but to residents of nebraska colorado wyoming and so forth i'd like your commitment uh if confirmed to work on moving the hot springs facility and literally the black hills of facilities themselves up into the end of the century with regard to the services that they're providing and literally to lay out a long-term plan for their success for the veterans in the rural areas thanks senator i really appreciate our conversation on this and uh i i committed to you then and i recommit myself to to you now uh to work closely with you on this and uh uh addressing the needs uh in the hot springs uh in and around the hot springs facility in as much as it is such a critical piece of uh the delivery capability uh not only in south dakota but as you say in nebraska montana wyoming the mission act which is what we operate under now for our health care is an item that i didn't vote for i didn't vote for it because it took away guarantees of of a veteran to be able to find a position of their own choice if they couldn't get an appointment within 30 days or if they were more than 40 miles away from a health care facility that the va sponsored um i thought they were making promises in the in the mission act that we might not be able to keep i think you step into the administration of this of this facility of this agency this administration in which you're being asked to do a lot of things and you're going to get pulled in a lot of different directions i don't expect you to be able to see the detail of this chart but this is a chart of the va and what it has you're expected to provide educational opportunities you're expected to provide housing you're expect expected to provide final expenses a final resting place and you're also expected to provide health care to va's across the entire country if you look at this you can you go down 13 levels before you actually get to where a real doctor is at or a hospital is that in the chart and for me that says a lot about the challenge that you face i don't think that's something that a lot of people realize when they talk about the va and what happens when you promise everything to everybody and you lay it within an administration like this whether it's a republican or a democrat administration the challenges of handling a bureaucracy are huge you walk into a bureaucracy with perhaps as many as 380 000 individuals some of which are providing direct care others of which are trying to find reasons why the care can't be provided specifically what my concern is is this right now in the approval process uh when we ask for someone to to participate in the care for the community it's not veteran friendly too many of the approvals are made by people who work to make sure that the veteran stays within the va system regardless of whether or not it's good for the veteran or not and while the flow chart says that the veteran's decision is the veteran's decision as senator moran suggested it always comes back to the va for approval in my opinion it is tailored for an urban veteran with easy access to tertiary services and not the rural veteran who may have to drive well over 50 miles for access to see a primary care provider if confirmed what will you do to afford veterans their choices as to where they receive their health care thank you senator the and i i really appreciated our conversation before on these these questions as well any credible strategy as it relates to rural care for our vets has to have at least three components one community care and community care has to ensure that more timely payment of bills it also has to ensure a more vibrant network of providers providers who want to be part of that network and i think in those both of those cases a more active uh or a higher set of expectations for the third party administrator for example is probably uh wise the second thing is using access to new port new platforms we had a consider a very useful conversation i thought about telehealth as i did with several other members of the committee consolidating those gains and growing those and then third is getting more aggressive about using the authorities that you have given the department to recruit and to fill the vacancies in the facilities that va already has and so among those three prongs of a strategy i think are the answers to ensure that the best medical outcome for the vet which is i read the statute is what you all have demanded ends up being the deciding variable in the equation my time has more than expired mr chairman thank you for your thoughts and particularly the one about timely payments for those providers thank you thank you sir thank you senator

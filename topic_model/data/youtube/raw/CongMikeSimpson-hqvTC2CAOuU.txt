thank you mr chairman thank you mr ryan i appreciate it uh this hearing would be almost funny if it weren't so serious because i honestly don't believe it's anybody within the department of energy or here that believes that a good decision was made by shutting down yucca mountain however it is what it is and we have to deal with what it is and we all know the reason that that the administration decided not to go forward with yucca mountain is does the administration does the department feel like it has to follow public law perhaps as the general counsel that question is best directed to me and the answer is absolutely yes sir public law 107 200 passed in 2002 by congress signed by the president establishes yucca mountain as the site for uh permanent geological repository the aslb board has twice ruled against the department of energy's withdrawing its license application although the nrc commission has not followed up on that in part they stated that congress had a say in this it was not just up to the to the uh doe to decide to withdraw the license application that it had to go through congress do you differ with that opinion actually i do sir with all due respect i differ in a couple of particular points first congress did not in fact as i read the law designate yucca mountain as the nuclear repository in the sense that it directed that it be built what it did in 2002 the way i read the law is that uh it instructed uh the secretary to go ahead and prepare and file an application which of course was done i think it was in in 2008 when it was finally filed well didn't we override the state of utah's object or the state of nevada's objective yes sir you absolutely did that that you did and that is what triggered the process if you will by which the application was filed the question decided by the board and i believe decided incorrectly by the board is whether or not the direction to file an application meant that once it's filed it was now beyond the power of the secretary of energy and the administration to withdraw that application no matter what the secretary no matter what the department no matter what the administration believed about whether that was wise i believe congress in setting up this statute left that authority with the secretary of energy and i believe we've uh applied it lawfully having said that you are correct the board has disagreed and that will be reviewed i believe by the nuclear regulation i can tell you that there are an awful lot of members of congress that would disagree with that let me ask you again the blue ribbon commission as you've said dr johnson is not a sighting commission everyone virtually everyone including the secretary has stated that a deep geological repository will be necessary at some point whether checker mountain or something else we are going to have to have a jeep a deep geological repository in the appropriation bill for 5 million dollars for the blue ribbon commission we stated in there that they could only use that if yucca mountain was in fact an option uh the commission's co-chair stated in their first press conference the secretary chu has made it quite clear that yucca mountain is not an option what's going on with that well as you said and thank very much for the question secretary 2 has said that yucca mountain is not an option and again i think that goes back to we're standing at a very interesting time as you well aware on the start and the restart of the civilian nuclear power industry and as a result given the stand of this administration with the recent conditional loan guarantees that have been issued for the new power plant in uh vogel in georgia we understand that it's very important that we have the best workable solution for long-term disposition of of the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste so i think it considering all the work that's all the knowledge that's gone on in the last 30 years from high performance computing to understanding the geology to understanding the long-lived actinides and and how to make them shorter lived as well as a transuranic waste experience from whip i think that it's prudent to step back and to see what is the best possible solution to long-term disposition but there will be nuclear fuel but we will need a long-term we will need a geological depository sometime because there's going to be some stuff left over no matter what you do i'm sure there'll be some stuff left over and again not to predispose what might be recommended by the blue ribbon commission i i do believe they will consider deep geologic storage i don't know what shape form factor or how deep but again i'm looking forward to their recommendations and working with the blue ribbon commission in the appropriate way to help our nation move forward on managing the back end of the fuel cycle if with the administration's opinion yucca mountain is off the table is anything in any location or site in nevada off the table or just yucca mountain again i i think we're going to wait for the recommendations from blue ribbon commission which is not a sighting committee

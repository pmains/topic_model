Thank You congressman done I appreciate your taking this initiative to bring folks together to discuss unfortunately the need to address the the disasters across America representing one of the most rural districts in America we have a lot of Natural Resources among them a lot of rivers a lot of miles of river in Nebraska and not so long ago the conditions were such that the rivers flooded in the central and eastern part of Nebraska in the West a blizzard hit with the bomb cyclone and created massive damage the the chunks of ice flowing down rivers actually took out a dam probably the first dam to break due to ice floes and the the chunks of ice it's been tragic there's been loss of human life certainly the loss of of livestock and initial estimates are estimating about 400 million dollars in infrastructure damage and another roughly 1 billion dollars in damage to crops and livestock I certainly appreciate the fact that and that President Trump moved quickly upon governor Ricketts request for the disaster declaration and we are working together among the Nebraska delegation both senators all three House members to make sure that we articulate the needs of not only Nebraskans but when you remove agriculture products like is the case ultimately consumers will likely be impacted and this is this is something we should always keep in mind because certainly everyone needs to eat and when we lose the the channels of supply of agricultural products so that is bound to increase the cost of of food and when you look at the the storm that the bomb cyclone that hit it probably couldn't have happened at a worse time of year right in the middle of calving season and so that's a devastating condition here I do appreciate the fact that so many producers I talked to one today instead of a 30-minute commute for a drive to work they have to go 95 miles one way to work because the bridge is out and when one bridge is out in rural Nebraska that it takes a few miles to make up for that and but I think we are resilient and AG operators are resilient so they're they're looking up but we are concerned that here in the next few weeks and in fact there's another storm forecasted for later this week and where folks are bracing for perhaps even more damage but hopefully we can we can get through this so again I appreciate this opportunity to to share what the needs are in Nebraska and I will be introducing legislation to extend a number of tax provisions often provided to disaster areas to cover this year's disasters and so I hope we can offer that support to disasters from last year as well since we are discussing this evening multiple disasters from last year and this year so again appreciate this opportunity I yield back

and so he's joining us again right now congressman welcome back to tmz live hey good to be with you guys thanks so how do you think this speech landed uh do you think that there are people maybe on donald trump's side whose eyes were opened or do you think it's status quo yeah i mean i think from the republican perspective probably status quo i mean when you when you look at kind of hardcore believers you know this just goes back to what they think is just partisanship but here's where it's important obviously joe biden rightly has been reticent to kind of you know focus on other presidents he wants to look forward but he has a responsibility particularly in something so egregious you know we can look at the stats that say 70 percent of republicans believe the election was stolen which blows me away every day still but the other the good stat is something like 60 or 70 percent it should be 100 but of the american people know that the election was fair and that is going to be the number that will be the bulwark against the rise of authoritarianism congressman because you are on the committee looking into all of this uh were you surprised at the the tone of the speech or were you expecting this because obviously you guys have been looking at all of the evidence looking at the text messages and trying to see where all this leads and like harvey said it did sound like president biden was sort of stating the case here starting to make the case for uh some of this falling right at uh former president trump's feet yeah i'm not sure if the tone surprised me but here here's what i want to say about that the you know 180 some minutes the president was sitting there on his on his butt watching television we we know one of two things the best case scenario he was frozen with indecision okay if you believe that okay fine uh probably more than likely as we've heard from when kevin mccarthy used to actually believe that donald trump you know did something wrong we had heard from jamiro butler that he had called kevin and said well they obviously care more about the election than you do and i think the real question is obviously in my subjective mind the president violated his oath by not defending the article one branch of the government as the executive branch that's his responsibility the question from a legal perspective and this is what we really want to know on the committee we don't have the answer today what did the president know prior was he just as surprised as you know most people were by the way i predicted violence a week before or did he know this was going to happen well the donald trump supporters have really started this full court press to install secretaries of state in critical states where the election may not matter because they'll certify what they want to certify in other words donald trump will win 2024 if they have their way if that happens congressman if it happens because this is a possibility now if it happens that the democratic nominee should have won based on the electoral college but it is rigged so that because of what happens with the legislatures state legislatures and secretaries of state that the loser ends up being installed can this country survive can democracy survive if that happens no i don't think so and and what you what you mention is i think the most under kind of reported concern that's very real which is the one thing you saw leading up to january 6 in these memos and stuff it wasn't an outright hey let's just ignore the law it was what are the technicalities of the law that we can use for instance uh is it possible for a state legislature to simply send its own version of electors regardless of how the people vote that's why i think reforming the electoral count act more than anything there's all this discussion of all these things out there nobody's talking i guess we're starting to a little bit we need to reform the electoral count act to ensure that for instance there was one hero in the senate that grabbed the original ballots of the electors had she not done that and the rioters burned them or destroyed them or stolen them that would have been a constitutional crisis because in theory and in reality by the law you would have to go back to those states to recertify and you can imagine the mess that happens there the problem with january 6 wasn't even that day it was that now they can look and say this is where we fell short and here's where we need to install people to make this thing happen and i think it would not i think self-governance could not survive that well they're doing that right now i mean they they are trying to figure that out on how they could have pushed it over the goal line i mean they're doing this with secretaries of state so do you feel like given what you're watching in the landscape and the fact that congress can't seem to pass what you're talking about are you worried that that could happen in 2024 yeah i'm really worried um and i think the key is this and and you know it's really easy to show up and vote for a presidential election there is importance in showing up and voting in midterms in voting in local elections which were all not great at voting and you know like mayor's elections but all of those is where they're targeting now people that vote count that certify secretaries of state which usually get no attention that's important and so i would encourage everybody to be focused on that that's one of the things with my country first movement country1st.com we're focused on is not just congressional races yeah those are those are important but the down ballot races were the real bulwark of democracy lies nobody imagined i never certainly imagined that what we took for granted which is just how the law functions could actually be a threat but it really is yeah it really is what are you gonna do i mean you're not running again um and you are such a strong voice um finally um because we're about out of time what's your plan because you and liz cheney and few others um have really kind of you know picked up the mantle there and you're running with it what are you going to do after november i'm going to pick up that mantle and run with it full time and uh while i'll be doing other jobs that's going to be my focus not a re-election you know i've been in the house 12 years after this term that's enough now it's time to focus on a broader fight and that's what i'm doing through country first and uh so expect to hear more from me i'm not going to go anywhere well you've got an open invitation here great appreciate that con

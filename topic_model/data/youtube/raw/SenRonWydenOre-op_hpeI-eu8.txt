famous Chairman I thought the point you raised this chairman about primary care was particularly important and we have mr. Burrell here and he has gotten into this primary care area I think in a very interesting way particularly bringing providers and patients in together around prevention and to me that's really the ball game I mean we understand that most of the health care bill in this country goes for chronic disease I mean well over half of it and we spend it picking up the damage of heart and stroke and cancer and diabetes and you're trying to figure out a way to bring your providers and your patients together and and reward the patients and I I think that's particularly good since you and I talked us and report and I got together with the Cleveland Clinic and the Oregon Health Sciences Center and have actually proposed financial rewards for senior citizens under Medicare for the first time we lower their blood pressure and cholesterol stop smoking reduce body mass and and the like and I think in the context of the Chairman's question about primary care tell us a little bit about what you're doing to bring together both your providers your docs and and others and the patience to start giving prevention and behavioral change empowering the patients to be part of your new approach well on the patient's side it starts with awareness of risk which starts with a health risk appraisal which we offer for free just the discovery of the risks you have the awareness of the risks you have has a big effect on behavior we ask them to share it with their primary care doctor and we automatically transfer it with that consent to the primary and as an effect on the primaries thinking sometimes we start with financial incentives to the member just to participate and then it moves for financial incentives for outcome you see that you're overweight you see that you have hypertension you see the risks that you have it's one thing to see it it's another thing to actually act on it we want to move to the day we're stronger outcomes produce stronger finance rewards to the member but if you're the only one knows it as a member and your doctor doesn't it doesn't do much good so we give it to our small panels of primaries it's seen by the panel we identify the patients at high risk as evidenced by health risk appraisals and we target interventions together with those primaries for the patients at higher risk so it's an incentive to the member to participate and be aware and to take action and it's an incentive on the part of the primary because it's a global population based incentive model if they can get a better outcome they have a financial reward the member does and the physician does and they're dovetail together and it's that working together that actually causes we think the best result senator one it's just that the risk of being a wet blanket in this and I completely agree with like what you're that does up contrary points of view that's good well thanks so we and on the tree were here when I mentioned this with Anna teach Audrey at Harvard and collaborated as a net and we published a piece in the new england journal of medicine a couple of months ago where we gave patients who had experienced heart attacks their drugs for free so they in fact didn't have risk factors they had already experienced the outcome and despite getting their drugs for free 0 co pays less than fifty percent of them were compliant so there's the ability you know for the doctor to do the right thing they've written for all the right drugs there's the ability to convey information about risk but the reality of human behavior is that we need to grapple with some of the complex that he's associated with it's very discouraging but we've got a long way to go we need to understand it how to get into the psyche of patients there's no question that there are a variety of factors involved here I think what really swung me to this was the work of dr. Roizen new prevention officer at the vivillon clinic and the program that they have put together which essentially is what's an apartment and I modeled our approach with Medicare it really does seem to be working and I think they do try to spend the time certainly talking with patients talking with families incorporating in some of the judgments that you're talking about but they are very clear toby cosgrove and the others have had a long interest in prevention they are very clear in their view that these financial rewards and these are of course not enormous sums of money but the idea of a few hundred you know dollars in conjunction with some of these other kinds of approaches has been successful and since chairman Baucus has given us a chance to kind of be around the kitchen table yeah kick these ideas around hopefully what's great maybe one hour of social networking and the sense of community which is something that we pursue if

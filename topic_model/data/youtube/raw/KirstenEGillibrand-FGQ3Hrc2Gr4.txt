mr. president I rise to speak about the mass shooting in Texas yesterday the lat the latest mass shooting in what seems like a never-ending gun violence in our country my heart breaks for the victims and their families and for the community of Sutherland Springs and Texas we are still gathering all the facts about this specific crime we are still learning about what happened how this murderer was able to purchase a gun whatever his twisted rationale was for walking into a house of worship in a small town and slaughtering more than 20 people including young children with an assault weapon our incredible law enforcement officials are working hard to answer all of that but the most important fact of all is something we already know very well this is yet another case where someone on American soil who had absolutely no business getting his hands on a weapon of war was able to get one and use it to commit heinous mass murder of the five worst mass shootings in our history three of them have occurred in just the past 17 months think about that in a small town in America nearly 7% of the town's population was slaughtered just because they went to church that day the weapon he used was based on a military weapon designed for a war zone but this was not a war zone it was a church people were singing and praying and savoring life I reject the notion that it is too soon to act if not now then when we should ban assault weapons and bump stocks today people who don't want to have an honest conversation say we need to wait well for how long because we wait we wait and we will see evil rear its ugly head over and over again and we are told to wait again we have enough information today for Congress to do its job and try to keep our constituents safe from gun violence we had enough information before yesterday to act but what Congress does not have is the political will to act my friends this must change thoughts and prayers are not going to stop the next mass shooting merely talking about something something for the mentally ill to obtain guns is it going to stop the next deranged person with hates in their soul from committing yet another mass murder and the Second Amendment does not mean that Americans should have to risk getting shot because they walk down the wrong Street in a city or decided to go to a music festival in Las Vegas or a nightclub in Orlando or an elementary school in Newton excuse me in Newtown or a movie theater in Aurora or a church on Sunday in Texas after each of these horrific acts of violence what happened here in Congress nothing more than a month after Las Vegas we still can't even tackle the most obvious fixes like banning Bubb stocks plain and simple Americans are being slaughtered and Congress is refusing to protect them and I hear my colleagues who rightly say we can't pass laws to stop every instance of a deranged gunman who wants to kill innocent men women and children just like our other criminal laws won't necessarily stop every instance of crime but there is no excuse for not even trying everyone in this chamber knows that a shooting in a church is something that should never happen in this country mr. president I think you would agree with that I think everyone who serves in this chamber would agree with that so then why aren't we doing anything to stop this violence why aren't we making it harder for a crazed evil person to get their hands on a weapon of war it makes me wonder it makes me wonder what our colleagues are waiting for are they waiting for the NRA to come in and give them cover and tell them it's okay to act are they waiting for the NRA to give them permission to stand up and do something if the NRA said today assault right right rifles or bub stock should be banned it would be done tomorrow that is the sad truth of this place but we know the NRA won't say that because they want to keep selling these weapons of war to anyone who is willing to buy them no matter how unsafe it makes it for the rest of us Congress has caved in over and over again to the enormous pressure by the NRA in the gun industry which just wants to protect their profits and has ignored the vast majority of Americans gun owners and non gun owners alike who support common-sense measures to keep their fellow Americans safe these mass slaughters continue and Congress has done nothing absolutely nothing to me this is a monumental failure of leadership and it's no wonder that gun violence and mass shootings happen here at a higher rate than any other developed country in the world this has to change it's not enough to solve the individual crime after the fact we have to take meaningful real action to prevent the next one this is what has to happen and mr. president to those who doubt that Congress can actually get something done we already know that depending on the motivation depending on whom Congress is actually listening to Congress is fully capable of moving quickly to enact change instead of acting like it's hands are tied and refusing to do anything which is what is happening right now far more often than not Congress listens to the special interests instead of the people who actually elect them to keep them safe listen to the shameful state of our gun laws now and tell me if you think these laws came about because families in our states demanded them or because the NRA demanded them Congress has turned a collective back on strengthening and expanding our national background check system we should be fixing the holes in the system whatever necessary not just shrugging our shoulders and saying there's nothing that can be done who do you think demanded that we don't fix the background check system was it families in your state or was it the NRA Congress refuses to ban high magazine high-capacity magazines which are literally made for war and let kill killers by a dozen of rounds without having to stop and reload who do you think demanded that families or the NRA Congress still refuses to be on assault weapons which are designed for war designed to kill as many people as possible as rapidly as possible but are given different names so they can be sold in a civilian world who do you think demanded that our families or the NRA Congress is on the verge of passing legislation to make it easier right now for killers to buy suppressors known by many of us as silencers to attach to their weapons and make it harder for the police to do their jobs and catch violent criminals and who do you think demanded that certainly not the police not our families the NRA Congress is dragging its feet on banning bump stocks the inexpensive piece of equipment that the killer in Las Vegas used to turn it's already powerful firearm into an automatic weapon capable of firing hundreds of rounds per minute who do you think demanded that families or the NRA just this February Congress overturned a rule that had prevented people who were so incapacitated that they could no longer handle their own finances from getting their hands on a gun who do you think demanded that families or the NRA Congress even went so far as to pass a law that locked the Centers for Disease Control from studying from studying the issue of gun death the way that they are allowed to study any other cause of death in this country why because it's an attempt to hide the overwhelming data showing that keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people would decrease gun crime who do you think demanded that who do you think demanded that that Congress suppress the facts and the alarming data about gun violence do you think it was families or the NRA mr. president this really has to change Congress needs to start protecting the people that we were elected to represent their voices matter and it really it really does matter who you are listening to their voices matter and they must be heard we must listen and to not change that act would actually help to keep our state safer from gun violence we are the ones that need to act we can't ignore our responsibility to keep our country safe from this kind of violence and to all the people who are watching us right now I would say this after all of these massacres pay attention to what your elected leaders are saying pay attention to what they are actually doing watch how they react look closely and how they use their time here listen to what they say or don't say after these mass shootings did they tell you that we were going to bow our heads for a moment of silence and leave it there or did they tell you that that we were going to fight with every bit of energy to break to actually fix these broken gun laws and protect our American citizens democracy works when regular people stand up and demand action I urge everyone listening today to demand that action to hold elected leaders accountable and to ask them to pass meaningful gun reform now

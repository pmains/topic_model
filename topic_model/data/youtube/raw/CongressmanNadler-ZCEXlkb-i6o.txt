Mr Speaker I rise in support of this resolution I commend the sponsors mr. McGovern miss Lee for introducing it and I do so not because I necessarily think we ought to withdraw all our troops in six months maybe we should I'm not sure of that yet but I do know that we are waging a war that is probably unconstitutional as we did in Libya since World War two we have time after time gotten away from the constitutional command that Congress shall declare war the founding the framers said no the war is too important to allow one person the president to decide on it but we've gotten away from that we got away from it because we didn't have time that was the excuse with the missiles flying over the poles you couldn't call Congress into session but then came Iraq we had a resolution for the use of military force then came Libya no excuse plenty of time to consult with NATO plenty of time to consult with Arab countries no time to consult with Congress I believe that was an unconstitutional and a foolish as it turns out but an unconstitutional use of force and now we have this force in the Middle East in Iraq and Syria we're getting more and more into a war I'm not commenting on the intelligence to that right now it may be that we have no choice but to fight Isis maybe as the Republicans seem to want without saying so we should have a lot of boots on the ground because that's what they're really saying when they say the president's doing halfway or maybe the bigger threat is Iran and we should turn our attentions to Iran instead of tacit Lea lying with Iran against Isis or maybe we should say it's up to the Middle Eastern people they can handle it and pull our troops out altogether that's the debate we ought to have and what are the limits of our commitment if any that ought to be debated in Congress Congress ought to make these decisions support in the name of the American people not the president now because we haven't had an AUMF on the floor we must have this resolution this resolution is not intended to force a pullout in six months is intended to force a debate can I have one additional menard that one additional minute yeah give a gentleman an additional man the gentleman's reckoning gentle this resolution is not intended to force a pullout in six months it's intended to force a debate in Congress in six months let us get back to our constitutional tradition let Congress do its job and if the president submitted an alien left that's too strong or too weak let's bring up a different one but it's our job to make those decisions it's our job to stand before our constituents and say we believe this is important enough to go to war with Isis or with Iran to send more troops there or not and here's why and here are the limitations we shouldn't have boots on the ground or we should that's our decisions to make and our decisions we shouldn't be able to avoid that's what this is about we've had ten years of war 13 years of war the 2001 aumf cannot possibly be relevant now we thought we were voting for three weeks of strikes against bases in Afghanistan the 2002 aumf was to topple Saddam Hussein he's gone I didn't think that was a good idea but it's over the consequences are not over we ought to debate this we are debating a LF we had a past one or not that's our decision but let's pass this resolution now to force that decision on us I

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in strong support of House Joint Resolution 76 which will reverse the Trump administration's harmful new borrower defense rule the initial borrower defense rule was designed to provide defrauded students with the debt relief they are entitled to receive under the Higher Education Act unfortunately secretary de Vos rewrote the rule to make it nearly impossible for future students who are victimized by deceptive institutions to get the relief they need and deserve according to the department's own estimate only about 3% of the loan debt held by defrauded borrowers would be dismissed under the new rule that is not justice for victims of fraud we must also continue our work to update the Higher Education Act to prevent unscrupulous institutions from harming students and taxpayers in the first place the college affordability Act will hold institutions accountable and make college more affordable and equitable for everyone I urge my colleagues to support House Joint Resolution 76 today and the college affordability Act when it comes to the floor thank you and I yield back the balance of my time

thank you very much madam chairman and um during the course of my five minutes i'd like to invite members of the families of our nominees to take a breath remove your masks for five minutes if you wish i know it can be a long haul with those masks on um mr ueda uh great to see you again thanks for being here congratulations on your nomination the sec recently released accounting bulletin 121 this is the sec staff and they stated that reporting companies and most importantly their custodians should hold digital assets as an on balance sheet liability i'm really concerned about that because i think that actually weakens investor protections because in the event of insolvency customer assets are safer from creditors being held off balance sheet and further segregated from the company's assets do you have any thoughts on this elsa thank you for your question on this um uh so i am familiar with the the staff accounting bulletin uh or sab as they like to call it on the sec sab 121 just at a very high level uh and have not had time to become well versed in the details or uh or or to have discussions with the sec staff about it um you know i'll note it it was a staff position it was not approved by a vote of the the members of the commission um there has been a tremendous amount of concern raised that i've seen in in the past week alone about it um and so if confirmed it is something that i would want to look uh much more into and have a discussion with the staff you know one of the other concerns i think is we have a process for whenever there's a new rule of general applicability or you attach new conditions or or requirements on existing rules to approve those through the notice and comment process under the administrative procedure act um and when when you have something that is effectively a rule that calls in the question whether it should go through that process and then also i should say raises questions about the ability of this committee to engage in oversight under the congressional review act of any any rule uh so so if confirmed i would want to talk with the staff i would also want to talk with the federal and state banking regulators as to how this interplays with their regulatory regimes um and then um you know lastly i would just note that you know the staff the saab the bulletin itself expressly states that that it is just a position of staff it is not a rule of the commission nor has it received the official approval of the sec thank you uh for your response i would note that the securities industry and financial markets association and bank policy institute sent me a really detailed letter this morning concerned about the lack of public comment around this big shift in policy and highlighting how this guidance could weaken important safeguards around custody of client assets mr madam chairman um i ask for unanimous consent that it be entered into the record and i urge everyone to take a look at it thank you for your response mr barr switching to you good to see you again too my question for you is do the basil three capital standards estab establish a separate prudential capital treatment relating to on-balance sheet custody accounts senator there are there are particular rules um yes in the in the basel framework capital treatment is different for uh for customer accounts in general i um it's my understanding that with regard to the capital standards uh at basel iii regarding this subject that they do not but that's we'll we can discuss that at another time um and that's because custody accounts are generally off balance sheets from an accounting perspective correct yes that's correct are you familiar with the bank for international settlements proposed prudential treatment of crypto asset exposures i have not read the the bis proposal in this area okay well it it i'll let you know to my knowledge it's correct that this proposed capital framework explicitly declined to create prudential requirements for custody of digital assets and we'd be happy to just send that to you if u.s bank regulators were to impose separate requirements around bank custody activities for digital assets uh or if they were required to be accounted for as a liability on a bank's balance sheet that would be different from international norms as i understand them and so i worry that that might make them competit uh uncompetitive can you commit to discussing this further with me yes i'd be happy to discuss this further with you senator thank you thank you madam chairman um i urge all members to look at this important issues we might need to address this at some point but to all of our nominees again congratulations thank you

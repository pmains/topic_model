alright so those are some of the remarks that the president made this morning in Pennsylvania it's part of a new nationwide tour Pennsylvania is one of several states with a Senate seat up for grabs in the next election clearly the folks in Pennsylvania are very focused on the election and Republican turned Democrat Arlen Specter is one of those who's up for re-election there now one of his possible challengers joins me now Republican Pat Toomey is a former congressman he served three terms on Capitol Hill good to have you here today sir welcome thanks for having me so you heard what the president just said and basically he was very encouraged this morning he said the numbers are headed in the right direction we're down to ten percent not a good number he said for unemployment but at least the numbers are headed in the right direction now what do you think about that well certainly very encouraging numbers this morning guy was pleasantly surprised that so many people were but let's be clear I think it's a little early to celebrate this is just one month of good data and we still have ten percent of American workers out of work too many Pennsylvanians without jobs so we got a long way to go did you feel like he answered the questions today there were a number of people who stood up and talked about small business and how it needs to receive more credit and tax cuts really is what a lot of small business folks want is he is he responding to those questions in Pennsylvania well I think not so far but I you know I understand the president is here to on a listening tour frankly I'm glad he's here I think it's terrific that he's here in the Lehigh Valley and he's here in Pennsylvania and I hope this is a sign that he's going to really start to focus hard on getting this economy moving again I have to say I think that many of the steps that have been taken so far are not very constructive bailing out failing companies massive spending and Hugh unprecedented deficits and debt that's not the way you work your way back to prosperity I've argued that we ought to stop the bailouts rescind the tarp money cancel the stimulus spending that hasn't been committed yet and use the savings to reduce our deficit and cut payroll taxes that would encourage job growth yeah those are very popular notions among conservatives across this country and in terms of using the tarp money one of the things that we're expecting to hear about as he continues this tor is that it's going to take some of that money and put it towards incentives for building green jobs and you know the green sort of industry in this country would you be in favor of that well we've got to be careful how much they decide that the government should spend money to subsidize an efficient efficient energy sources if we're all forced to pay more for energy than then we're paying now we'll have less resources available for everything else that we need so I'm not sure we need a new government spending program or government subsidy program I think what we need is a little fiscal discipline getting our spending in order on a sustainable trajectory which it's not now and then let the free enterprise system and the private sector create the jobs that they can and will do if they if they have that freedom and they don't have some of these looming threats like big tax increases in a health care bill and cap and trade you know before I'm about to talk to the man that you hope to run against a senator arlen specter just a moment from now and I'm curious what you think about how things look in Pennsylvania because there are a lot of folks in your position whoo look at 2010 and say this is going to be my moment if the economy continues to look like it looks right now what are you hearing from the people of Pennsylvania how good do you think your chances are that they're going to want to see change Arlen Specter has been in the Senate for many many years as you well know yeah well you know I think my chances are terrific a lot of people voted for a change last year this isn't exactly the change they had in mind senator Specter seems to change his mind every couple of days whether it's the party he's affiliated with or his position on card check or health care or taxes you name it you know I think what we have is one party in complete control of the elected government in Washington and we're seeing liberal excesses excesses on this health care bill excesses in terms of a cap-and-trade legislation that would be very damaging a Pennsylvania's economy excesses spending so I would bring some balance to that and represent some common-sense fiscal conservatives all right Pat Toomey Republican from Pennsylvania thank you sir for joining us today good to have you thanks for thanks for

we'll also consider the modern labeling act of 2020 introduced by representative Matsui and Guthrie this bill gives FDA the authority to require modifications of outdated labeling for generic drugs in order to ensure they represent accepted clinical uses representatives Guthrie and angle have a bill that would allow FDA to destroy medical devices found to be adulterated or misbranded the FDA already does this with drugs and this will keep potentially harmful medical devices from entering the supply chain we also have a bill introduced with mr. Guthrie that well this is my bill with mr. Guthrie with mr. Guthrie the directs FDA to designate National Centers of Excellence in continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing these centers will help limit drug shortages in the future while spurring a new generation of manufacturing jobs here in the US and then we have a number of bills that aim to improve health outcomes for kids that thank you very much madam chair recognising concerns from stakeholders I have been working in a bipartisan way with my colleague representative Brett Guthrie the Chairman's office and other members of our committee to ensure that we continue to protect patients or creating a pathway to modernize generic drug labels this amendment includes a new provision to clarify that the process created under this bill to update labels for new conditions of use cannot be used as an alternative pathway to initiate safety labeling changes safety changes must continue to go through FDA's existing safety pathway we are making progress and I look forward to continuing our conversations with stakeholders on improving this bill as we move to full committee markup prescription drug labels are the most readily available and trusted sources of drug information and I'm significantly concerned their current law limits modernizing many older treatment labels to reflect the latest clinical evidence the modern labeling Act will make sure that Americans have access to reliable high-quality sources of information to help make the right health care decisions I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill to strengthen the row labels play in informing treatment decisions safeguard our public health and facilitate greater use a lower cost generics with that I yield yield to my colleague mr. Guthrie thank you I think the gentlelady for yielding and I German sure madam chair I accept this amendment urging my colleagues to do the same congresswoman Matsui nurse staff committee staff and my staff have been working too hard to ensure that labels of generic drugs with no brand can be updated to help patients receive the best possible care I'm glad we have been able to work and I bipartisan way on this bill and look forward to this bill going forward to the full committee and I yield back to my friend from California I in the yield of the gentlewoman yield yield to the Chairman does anyone wish to speak on the bill yes I'd like to speak on the underlying bill I think we need to go to to our Republican colleagues the chair recognizes the gentleman is recognized thank you that I appreciate sharing the time or with my friend from New York we worked on this together that this is king from my tour in our tour I think you've heard as well my tour of JFK Airport and what we found whether there were products that that the FDA has the authority to destroy counterfeit drugs but not counterfeit medical devices so if the drugs were packaged or contained or within a counterfeit medical device we had agents say that they had to return to the return address and back and sometimes they saw it come back exactly as they returned it into the to the country so this bill would a would give Authority for them to destroy illicit medical devices which includes combination products and it'll strengthen our supply chain this bill will improve the ability of the federal government to curtail the supply of counterfeit medical products in the United States I really appreciate my friends from New York congressman Engel for working on this bill with and I can yield him the rest of my time or yield back I yield back if you like my time is welcome I'll take your time you're welcome yes thank you Thank You chairwoman issue and chairman pallone for holding today's markup including my bipartisan bill with congressman Brett Guthrie and I want to thank the gentleman for working on this bill with me this bill was called the safeguarding therapeutics Act and it provides the FDA with another tool to protect the American public by allowing the agency to destroy counterfeit medical devices now counterfeit medical devices are a growing public health threat and let me give you an example just this past February the FDA in concert with the Indian government stopped a batch of illicit medical products which included counterfeit combination medical devices destined for the United States market with the growing coronavirus outbreak including more than 100 cases in Westchester County which I represent we can expect that criminals will try to make a quick buck by selling fake treatments and medicines to concern Americans I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this common-sense bipartisan legislation and protect Americans and dangerous medical products I want to again thank my friend the I was Ben Guthrie for working on this with me and she a woman issue I ask unanimous consent to submit into the record a letter of support from the health industry distributors Association in support of our bill HR 5 663 that objection so ordered thank you I again urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this legislation I yield back my time Thank You chairwoman issue I'm pleased that today we're considering a bill that will help to advance continuous manufacturing here in the US the ongoing coronavirus outbreak has reiterated the need for the u.s. to take steps to help reduce our reliance on foreign manufacturing as we heard from dr. Woodcock last fall advanced manufacturing technologies such as continuous manufacturing can help to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign sources of api's increase the resilience of our domestic manufacturing base and reduced quality issues that trigger drug shortages or recalls this bill helps to invest in continuous manufacturing by directing fda to designate academic institutions and other nonprofit organizations with expertise in this area to help advance continuous manufacturing technology and standardization develop a continuous manufacturing workforce here in the US and to make recommendations for how the fda industry and others can expand the use of continuous manufacturing of drugs and biologics and I believe these centers will be critical to helping industry and FDA better understand this technology and to encourage greater adoption of the use of continuous manufacturing that will help to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States the managers amendment incorporates technical assistance and feedback from stakeholders to clarify the intent of the bill I want to thank my colleague representative Guthrie for his support and for working with me on this bill and the amendment and I look forward madam chair to continue to work with stakeholders as I move forward I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and I yield back let your yield Thank You mr. Chairman I appreciate and working with you as well and madam chair I like to speak in support of the amendment I do want to thank chairman pallone for working on this important issue with me and allow me to be part of working on this and during the hearing on HR for eight six six we learned how continuous manufacturer could help with drug shortages that we now face we talked about that in the drug stores we faced in the future and we're at that point where there are issues as we're dealing with the coronavirus I believe this bill is crucial in order to ensure Americans have access to medicine they may need when they need them and urge my colleagues to support this bill I appreciate all the working together and I will yield back to the Chairman I mean

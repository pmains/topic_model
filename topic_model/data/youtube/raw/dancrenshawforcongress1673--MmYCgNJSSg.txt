- Hi, we're Jim and Carmen Crenshaw and our son, Dan Crenshaw,
is running for U.S. Congress. We'd, first, like to thank all of you that have come out and worked
so hard on behalf of Dan, the volunteers block walking, phone calling
- Immersing. - Working the polls. Thank you, so much. And I can tell you, Dan has
been a source of pride to us since he was born. And, all of his accomplishments, we were always amazed that he made it but this one, going for U.S. Congress, was above and beyond and
we're so pround of him. This is one reason why we're so thankful and we'd like to ask all
of you to support Dan in his latest mission. Dan sacrificed so much
in his life, already, and we're asking you to help with a small sacrifice,
whatever you can afford. Please donate and help us work with Dan and get his mission completed. We'd like to thank you again,
from the bottom of our hearts. - Yes.
- And you have something to say.
- Yes, come on Latinas. (speaking foreign language) Go, Dan!
- Go, Dan!

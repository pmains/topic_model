look who's back with us congresswoman cat kamek from how small business and former Trump economic adviser Steve Moore the whole inflation reduction act as a hypothetical I don't know what the White House Press Secretary is talking about congresswoman we like your reaction to treasury secretary Janet Yellen adding to the chaos on White House messaging on inflation watch this I think we'll see a substantial reduction in inflation in the year ahead it's going to take a year well I Believe by the end of next year you will see much longer inflation if there's not a an unanticipated shock it's going to take time to get inflation back to normal levels as we keep our job market resilient we could see setbacks along the way to State the obvious transitory transitory transitory transitory transitory that never gets old congresswoman do you believe this new message and we have to wait until next year oh my gosh absolutely not we know what the cause that is driving this inflation and it's the out of control spending look you don't spend 10 trillion dollars in two years and not expect to have eight nine percent inflation today over 16 billion dollars is owed by American families just for utilities they're not worried about Christmas they're worried about making rent they're worried about groceries they're worrying about putting gas in their car and here we are yet again where people are going to be seeing higher rates if you have a variable rate on your mortgage or your car loan or your credit card which so many Americans have exorbitant credit card debt right now you are going to be paying a price and that is because of the Biden regime they don't want to deal with inflation they want to kick the can down the road they're not fixing it they're contributing to it you know to what the congresswoman is saying you know we may be seeing rates Steve heading above six percent who knows you know both inflation and Fed rate hikes it's a double whamming whammy on consumers it's suppressing consumer spending which is two-thirds of the economy I mean rates have been quadrupling since the beginning of the year you know Steve so where do you see I mean we keep hearing the way to stop inflation and boost the economy is let U.S energy rip unleash U.S energy it saved the Obama White House from a recession after the financial collapse of 2008. what do you think Steve about all this first of all I put no trust in uh Janet yellen's statement that they think inflation is going down next year because as you just pointed out Liz they've been wrong wrong wrong for the last 18 to 20 months you know we prices are 15 now since Biden came into office that's just a massive tax on the middle class and the congresswoman is exactly right that you can trace that back to the massive spending bills that happen and by these first two years now where are we headed I still think we can have a soft Landing uh Liz especially if the congresswoman can persuade her colleagues to start really taking a chainsaw to that budget and cutting out some of that excessive uh spending but you're also right that when those interest rates go up look what's happening to the mortgage market right now with mortgages now at six and a half to seven percent when they were less than three percent under Trump that adds to the cost of selling a house and that's the cost to a buying a house or turning that market so we will see but right now I I don't have a lot I think we're going to see inflation of about five or six percent next year but brizz but the target is three percent so there's still way above where we could be you know to what Steve is saying congresswoman you know we we everybody saw this coming like you know a million elephants marching down the road big governments stepping in and messing up the Trump economy Biden inherited a v-shaped economy coming out of pandemic shutdowns this is true government and competence so what is the what is a house to I know you guys can't do a lot I mean I ain't got taxpayers have to having to report to the IRS on 1099 forms their 600 transactions on phone apps like venmo PayPal and Zell that's going to sweep up millions of Americans they don't know that they had to file 1099s I mean one in four they make extra money on the side by selling something on the internet using these phone apps so you know it's like you get in bed with a government it feels warm and comfortable but then it's like a hippopotamus rolling over and crushing you listen I I am the first one to say you need to keep your government small so you can keep your dreams big a big government is the ultimate killer of the American dream so what we have to do in the GOP is immediately fire the 87 000 IRS agents that were designed to increase the audits on working-class Americans we've got to get government out of the way I am the sponsor and we'll be re-sponsoring the Reigns act which it's not exactly the sexiest Topic in the world Liz but it Reigns in the regulatory environment that is costing trillions of dollars that is going to actually put some pressure on these unelected bureaucrats in Washington who contribute to the cost of goods and services across the board through the regulatory administrative State that's one way we can exert our Authority and we have it on good uh good word that that bill will be brought up and passed out of the house so that's one way that we can do it but by and large until we reduce the spending get government out of the way American prosperity and Innovation can't take root we have to get government out of the way you know and then he got this Steve Senator Bernie Sanders AOC the squad they're wrongfully bullying Senator Kirsten Cinema for leaving the Democrat Party to become independent the oso tolerant intolerant left because it undercuts the Democrats on Senator warnock's Victory watch this does she have the guts to take on powerful special interests no she doesn't she was a corporate Democrat uh who has in fact along with Senator Mansion sabotaged enormously important legislation what is the senator talking about Cinema Center cinema what is he talking I mean Cinema has voted with Biden's agenda 93 of the time she voted for the inflation reduction act she voted for gun laws she doesn't want to get rid of the Senate filibuster that's what he's mad about they want to bully through more attack sites and more governments blowout spending on just a 51-party line vote that's what Bernie Sanders is mad about when we've had that you know filibuster in there for Generations Steve so you're so right but you know it shows how left-wing the Democratic party has become that someone who votes 93 of the time with Joe Biden is somehow way too conservative for the modern day Democrat look I've been to this town for of Washington DC for 35 years when I first came to town there were people like Sam Nunn there were people like dick gephard that there were you know so many Democrats that really were moderate Democrats who believed in balancing the budget who believed in welfare reform who believed in free trade and now you can't count on one finger the number of Democrats and you've got a situation now where Christian Cinema who's maybe a little bit to the right of where the party is they basically booted her out of the party they're bullying her they bullied her they stalked her in airports they stalked her into her bathroom they continued to bully Senator Cinema final word yeah Steve go ahead you're exactly right I mean this is this is a party that has basically been taken over by the radical left okay and it's one reason that you gotta defeat the Democrats in 2024 because four more years of this would be ruined You're So High by the way turn on the speaker sound energy is the single most important thing to get our economy moving there you go Congressman mechanic and Steve Moore pleasure having you both on merry Christmas happy holidays to the two of you it's good to see you both

joining us now with more kentucky senator rand paul look you very s i thought it was brilliant on your part have a constitutional vote and 45 republican senators said it's a non-starter i don't even think the senate should legitimize what was an illegitimate pr uh partisan effort in the house with no witnesses no due process no defense brought in just a snap impeachment and now we're finding out by the way there's a lot of pre-planning to what happened on the sixth your thoughts well basically the impeachment's dead on arrival we know it's going to fail we know it's going to be basically partisan bitter rancor an extension of the election it's nothing remotely close to unity the calls for unity are a farce if they have to go through with this impeachment i think it does drive a wedge in society and people will say oh my goodness how could this possibly be fair or constitutional so it only takes 30 only takes 34 votes to acquit we had 45 to say that even the whole trial is illegitimate and unconstitutional because he's no longer the president so we know what the result will be of this the one important thing we do need to see though is there has been a big lie promulgated out there that he incited violence look i disagreed with the debate i voted against what president trump was asking for but when i listen to the speech and i hear him say go fight to let your voices be heard this and has no one in the country on the democrat side heard a figurative speech have none of them listen to their own speech and how often a politician says go fight win fight for your country but i think they should soak video of all the democrats and the inflammatory and temperate language that they've used cory booker saying get up in the face of these congress people maxine water saying swarm them in restaurants kamala harris even saying let's bail out these people one guy's been bailed out three times by the group that kamala harris supports he's committed violence every time he's gotten out he cracks someone's skull the last time i was at the ball field when bernie sanders supporter committed violence but the thing is is we as republicans were more fair-minded we haven't blamed any of those politicians either for their words or for the actions of any crazy supporters of theirs so when bernie sanders supporters shot up the ball field almost killed steve scalise nobody said it was bernie sanders fault but they need to look at themselves and hear what they've been saying and see the violence associated with their words every day on the internet i am attacked and people say that they wish i had violence committed against me again i had six ribs broken part of my lung removed coughed up blood for a year almost died from an infection and the thing is is on the internet nancy pelosi's daughter has said rand paul deserves it and he ought to get it again the teacher of the year in virginia a big democrat said the same thing half a dozen minor d-list celebrities and actors have wished me harm and nobody says a word about it on the left you know i'm looking at all this not only are they wasting our time and effort then they got 1.9 trillion in this covert package there won't be bipartisan support you know he's ruling by executive order now the reconciliation process and bernie sanders is in charge of the purse purse strings 50 grand loan forgiveness wow uh they voted yesterday and your voter rama to raise taxes on the middle class on small businesses in america turn their their backs on churches in america uh they're going full force to pack the court go ahead you want to add no no evidence of unity and no evidence of bipartisanship we're going to be two weeks into the administration the first thing they're going to do is extend the bitterness of the election with the impeaching impeaching a former president and the second thing they're going to do is add two trillion dollars worth of debt to our country with no republican support zero he had them come to the white house only to tell them no we're doing this only with bernie sanders way or the highway with only democrats so really this is showing you how they want to run the country they do not care what the other half of the country wants about fifty percent of the country is republican about fifty percent democrat actually it's probably forty forty with twenty percent independent were evenly split but the democrats now that finally got in control do not care anything about what republicans think you know you're trying to cut money that you know for example uh 26 billion in additional money this year infrastructure etc and all right so we're spending money on foreign aid what what we're we're literally paying for the creation of think tanks in sri lanka combating truancy in the philippines investing in failing businesses in bosnia improving the the quality of moldavian television and funding a green new deal in peru help me out rand paul because that is madness so i forced to vote on 26 billion dollars worth of foreign aid each year over the next 10 years be 260 billion dollars and i said instead of sending it off to these foreign countries who often hate our country burn our flag chant death to america we still keep giving them money i'd say let's build the roads here at home let's don't build roads overseas no democrats supported this but unfortunately most of the establishment republicans don't support cutting foreign aid welfare either but this is something president trump and i agree on it's also something that about 75 to 80 percent of americans would rather build bridges and roads here in our country not overseas you know i i supported years ago uh connie mack the penny plan you have the three penny plan well one of the reasons it needs to go up to three is because we have a lot more debt than we had before and i don't think any american i think most americans understood through no fault of of anybody else that we all got hit hard in the last year but joe just inherited the vaccines from president trump operation warp speed okay if you cut three cents out of every dollar for five years you can balance the budget based on your numbers is it that easy and why don't we do it every republican that was in the senate a few years ago voted for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution mike lee was a big part of writing this i was a part of this and it balanced the budget in five years so i think that's the gold standard for what we should do anything that takes longer than that is really not realistic and not the truth so i put forward every year a budget that balances in five years the good years the good news is a few years ago i got 16 votes i'm up to 29 votes all republican so i got a majority of the republicans it means i lost about 20 20 21 republicans yesterday and got no democrats to balance a budget so that shows you who cares about the deficit zero democrats and a little more than half the republicans all right and so joe's ruling by executive order is basically ignoring the an entire branch of government more than three times the executive orders at this time in the presidency of obama uh george w bush and donald trump okay and then they're using reconciliation again to ram it down the country's throats with no bipartisan support at all uh is that how we're gonna was this governing to you is that constitutional to you i think what's extraordinary about it is is that he's using all of this sort of executive force which i don't believe is appropriate but he's using it to actually um get rid of american jobs good paying american jobs jobs in the pipeline can be 60 70 80 000 a year some people working on the pipeline make over a hundred thousand dollars a year a thousand of those jobs disappear immediately but tens of thousands of jobs were going to be created not letting oil companies drill on federal land which they have done safely for decade after a decade that's going to create tens of thousands of jobs so really he wants to be remembered for for promulgating executive orders that caused us to immediately lose jobs i don't think that's a good way to get started so that impeaching the president and now getting us two trillion dollars worth of more bailout that'll put us further in debt i think all these things combined show a really poor start to this administration all right rand paul thank you

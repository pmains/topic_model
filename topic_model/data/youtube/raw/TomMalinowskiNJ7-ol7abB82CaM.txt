[Applause] i'm going to kindly come down here i can be closer to you guys can you hear me all right great um thank you all for being here uh i'm i i i've been starting these speeches in the opposite way that i start most speeches by saying that i'm not happy to be here with you right we've been doing this all of us feel this way we've been doing this too many times and we are burdened by the the knowledge the certainty that we're probably gonna have to do it more times and every time we're doing it it's because kids have died somewhere in america they died of something that could have been prevented if responsible adults had actually acted and done what we should do to protect them when when i heard about the uvalde shooting it's hard to express my feelings at that time i thought of those kids i i knew that i should look at their faces and it was hard to do i thought about what their mornings what that morning must have been like for them going to school a a typical day thinking about a math test thinking about the soccer game they were going to play after school thinking about the ice cream they were going to have with their family none of them knew they were going to die i thought about when my own daughter was 10 years old 8 years old and dropping her off at school and i guess we didn't think about this quite as much then as we do now as we have to now i tried to put myself in the place of young parents today parents of young children who unfortunately have to have that thought as rare as these shootings still are the terror of knowing that it could happen affects absolutely every parent and every child in our society and of course i i mourned for those children and i prayed for their families but i also remembered that i have a job i've got a job that only 535 people in the united states of america have it's the only job in america where you can actually do something about this and that job is not to mourn that job is not to pray that job is to act that's what i'm here to do so let me tell you about what's going on in washington there are some negotiations in the senate and they may produce something if they do it's not going to be transformational it may be something modest we may get for example some strengthening of the violent history check system we may get finally an agreement with the republicans to do something about the so-called boyfriend loophole in the in the violent history check system you know that if right now under the law we have if you are an unmarried couple and a partner is convicted of abuse or stalking doesn't even get entered into the background check system that's absolutely crazy so we may get some improvements on small issues like that the republicans say this is all about mental health so they may finally agree to a substantial increase in federal funding for mental health programs that's good i don't think mental health is fundamentally the issue here but i'll take any opportunity to do more to address the mental health crisis in america that would be a good thing but obviously we need to do much more and to know what we do all we got to do is be guided by the state of new jersey you all know we have got in new jersey one of the lowest gun violence fatality rates in america and it's not accuracy think about it is it is it because we have less crime in america no i'm sorry in new jersey is it because we have fewer problems with mental illness in new jersey obviously not do we have children in new jersey who play fewer video games i don't think so do our schools have mo have fewer doors do our churches have fewer doors i don't think it's any of those things we know exactly what it is we've got just as many problems in new jersey as we do everywhere else in the country i hate to say it we have just as much evil in new jersey as we have everywhere else in the country just as much good the difference the only difference is that we have strong gun laws that were designed to protect our children and these gun laws do not interfere with responsible gun owners ability to go out and shoot on a range to protect their homes with a weapon to go hunting in the woods you can do all those things in new jersey lawfully without endangering without having a culture that endangers our children because we know you don't need an ak-47 or ar-15 to do those things if you need an ar-15 if you say you need an ar-15 to protect your house that means you can't shoot straight so let's be let's be common sense about this we got to do a lot more at the federal level we basically have to do at the federal level what we have done in new jersey of course we have to ban assault weapons and we're going to take a vote on that in the house of representatives last week we took a whole series of votes to strengthen the violent history check system to ban the high capacity magazines that allow the shooters and mass shootings to be able to outgun police officers to be able to continue to fire without reloading we passed a red flag law at the federal level last week in the house of representatives we are sending all of these things over to the united states senate and now you may ask me what happens then right give me hope congressman that we can still we can actually get these things done not just in the house of representatives where we have the slim democratic majority and i'll tell you yeah we have a strategy and it is not easy but it is extremely simple it is very very concrete here's what it is we got to elect two more democratic senators who are willing to reform or eliminate the filibuster [Applause] and one of those is running right across the river in pennsylvania right so that's doable it requires hard work and resources but it's absolutely doable and number two part two of the strategy while we take those two more senate seats don't forget to hold the house and that's our job in new jersey because our senators are fine and no one's gonna dislodge them we're going to be we're fine there but we have an outsized opportunity this year to make sure that we keep this gun sense majority in the united states house of representatives and this district which now is going to include sparta happens to be the scene of the only truly competitive house race in the state of new jersey the only one that can go either way and we can and will win this race partly partly because i think these these horrible massacres of children i hate it when this is what it takes to get people out to vote but if this is what it takes we're going to make sure that every single voter who votes you know you know you know our friends and neighbors who vote in presidential years but in midterm elections they they take they take an election off we're going to remind them you can't take this election off this is too important so we're going to do that and on top of that we are going to forge a really impressive really inspiring alliance in this district between democrats independents and responsible patriotic republicans who are through with the extremism in their party including the extremism on guns i know everybody should remember in 1994 we passed an assault weapons ban in the united states congress it was a bipartisan vote one of the leading champions of that assault weapons ban was president ronald reagan who wrote a letter to every single member of congress and said this is what you need to do ronald reagan last i checked was a member of the nra last i checked he was not a socialist he was not particularly woke that's where the country was in 1994. now almost 20 years later we had a we had a vote in the house of representatives not to ban assault rifles but just to raise the age of purchase from 18 to 21 and only 10 members of ronald reagan's party had the courage to vote yes we stand with them we applaud them for their courage and we know that many of our friends and neighbors in new jersey are very much like them they may not be willing to join my party on every single issue but they understand as you said that the fundamental responsibility of government is to protect our security it is to protect our children in particular and if government can't do that then we need new people in government and that's the kind of alliance that my campaign is going to forge with your help so you ready to do that with me

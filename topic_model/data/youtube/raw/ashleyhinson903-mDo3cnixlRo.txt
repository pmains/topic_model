house appropriations and budget committees ashley henson congresswoman welcome thanks for having me mike how do you assess what speaker pelosi said about the massive spending and tax bill this budget process has been broken from the very start mike and we saw that with how they laid out the reconciliation process they they set an artificial target in an artificial deadline and then said okay committees go go forth and figure out how to spend this money now we're hearing from speaker pelosi just today as well oh let's not talk about the money let's talk about our values well the problem is i value american taxpayers and i value iowa taxpayers and they are being completely disrespected in this process the only thing that's bipartisan about this legislation that they're moving forward is the opposition to it we had one democrat vote against final passage yet yesterday in the budget committee now it's not just that massive package the democrats want there's also funding the government beyond september 30th this week bipartisan infrastructure package and of course the debt limit what are your expectations on those issues this week yeah well i think speaker pelosi miscalculated when she tried to tie all of these things together i think she would have had bipartisan support for a continuing resolution to to keep our government open and funded and and keep those essential services going but in essence when they're pushing forward with a three and a half trillion dollar bill which might i add is actually more like 4.3 trillion the way it's written um that's just irresponsible it's reckless it disrespects taxpayers so they have a lot of work to do they have a lot of um dissension within their own caucus but i can tell you that republicans are about targeted spending we're about uh responsible spending and we're about respecting taxpayers in this process you are introducing a measure called the back to work act what are your goals with that piece of legislation yeah well i'm introducing this piece of legislation the back to work act because what we've seen is a government that wants to pay people to continue to stay home just a few weeks ago representative alexandria ocasio-cortez introduced a piece of legislation to continue those enhanced unemployment benefits we don't need these pandemic era policies to be permanent we need to focus on getting people back to work back to health and back normal so my bill would basically pump the brakes on aoc's policies that she wants to move forward with let's figure out what is uh the issue with the supply chain what's the issue with unemployment in this country there are 10.9 million jobs available we need to get people back to work and so um that's what we're working on and that's what that piece of legislation will prioritize to the border what are your assessments of what we're seeing at the border right now yeah it's an absolute surge of illegal immigrants at the border and we've been asking questions uh to secretary murkus which i i heard you played some um some clips from just a few minutes ago we've been asking questions why is this happening uh what are they doing about the border we need to get back to policies that actually worked at the border uh we need to build the wall we need to make sure that remaining mexico policy is actually enforced and i heard the secretary's interview as well and we have a lot of questions about um enforcement they aren't truly enforcing the law we know that we know people are being released into this country and they can't properly track them so we'll continue to hold them accountable for the these failed policies under the binding administration because this is a safety and security issue for iowa families and american families do you get a sense some of your democratic colleagues our colleagues are getting more frustrated with what we're seeing from our southern border well absolutely and and you've heard people in texas texas representatives speaking out about what's happening at the border i had a chance to go down to the border myself in april we had a round table with with local sheriffs for example and they were republicans and democrats and this is not a partisan issue they are crying out for help to keep their communities safe and secure in texas um i i look at it as an iowa issue because every state's a border state interstate 35 comes straight up into iowa so the drugs the human smuggling all of the the cartels that are winning in this situation we need to put a stop to it and it's time the biden administration stops turning a blind eye to the situation at the border congresswoman ashley henson of the great state of iowa live from a beautiful kitchen thanks so much for your time have a great week

great welcome morning everyone thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to be part of today's roundtable I've put together a star-studded list of some of the top leaders in our entire community and we're going to talk about a variety of issues we're having this roundtable of course on June 19th June teen and these are you know really difficult time in our country right now as we're dealing with the horrific kovat virus and we're dealing with issues as it relates to police violence and trying to set in place rules and regulations and restrictions so that we can really improve policing in the United States of America we passed a very important bill this past week in the Judiciary Committee that I'm lucky enough to serve on and I want to talk about that bill and the future of that bill and I brought a very special guest to talk to you today and he's gonna be on for about 20 minutes and then we can open it up and have a full roundtable to talk about the George Floyd justice and policing Act or any other issues that we're trying to lead on in Congress or anything else people on this call want to bring up so our I'll introduce a special guest in just a moment but I did want to recognize in particular my friend Corey woods soon to be the mayor of the City of Tempe congratulations mayor elect woods I can't wait to work with you closely you've been such a great community leader and I really just want to congratulate you for all your your success okay my special guests on this call is someone that I am lucky to work with closely on the Judiciary Committee when you serve in Congress that I'm a rookie in Congress I'm a freshman in Congress when you serve in Congress man you get to meet some of the most amazing people accomplished people people that bring so much wealth of experience and intelligence to the table I love it it's one of the best parts and I would argue that the gentleman has taken time out of his busy schedule to be with us today he's at the very top of that list of people that I'm just so lucky to be able to work with I really admire and respect him and it's just a it's a blessing for me to serve in Congress with a leader of his strength and intelligence and political skill so not only is he my fellow member of the Judiciary Committee but he's also chairman of the entire Democratic caucus as you know Democrats are in charge of the house we are an unruly Bunch and we we have a wide spectrum of political philosophy and the job of the Chairman is to make sure that we are swimming in the right direction on issues of everything that you can imagine including issues of justice and he's just an amazing guy and I really follow his lead is probably the best way to describe it he's a really good man I've had a chance to play a little basketball with him on the Congressional basketball court and I just consider him a friend and so I want to bring into the conversation representative Hakeem Jeffries from Brooklyn the chairman of the Democratic caucus member of the Judiciary Committee and he's given us about 20 minutes of his of his time and chairman great to see you great great to see you good morning to everyone happy Juneteenth it's an honor and a blessing to be able to draw in each and every one of you here such a distinguished group of community leaders doing so much for so many in the communities in which you serve of course it's great to be with Greg Stanton my good friend now I know that members of Congress will often say my good friend the distinguished gentleman from the great state of California or my good friend the distinguished gentlelady from the great state of Texas most of the time members of Congress used a phrase my good friend young we don't mean it but with respect to Greg Stanton let me be clear I absolutely mean it is such a good man a great public servant with an incredibly good heart and an incredibly intelligent mind who is in Congress to do the right thing and to represent all of the people and so I look forward to continuing to serve with Greg on the Judiciary Committee within the house Democratic caucus umbrella and of course in Congress on behalf of this great nation these are challenging times that we are in right now dealing with a pandemic that is both the public health crisis as well as an economic crisis and a moment of national reckoning on the question of race a prior to all of this happening many of us believe that we were in the midst of what I refer to as the third backlash moment in American history history suggests to us that whenever there's been progress in America there's always a backlash and it's a country of course that was founded on high ideals we hold these truths to be self-evident all men are created equally liberty and justice for all land of the free home of the brave a country founded on incredibly high ideals yet at the same exact moment in time we know that there was a birth defect a genetic imperfection during the founding of america on the question of race manifesting itself and in the form of chattel slavery now of course as America continues its march toward a more perfect union that phrase was first used in the Declaration of Independence and we continue that March you have progress that's made in a substantial way with the abolition of slavery and the Reconstruction period the Thirteenth Amendment that outlawed slavery pursuant to the Constitution the 14th amendment equal protection under the law the 15th amendment guaranteeing the right to vote regardless of race in theory the Reconstruction era also saw steps that were taken to try to economically empower the newly freed slaves but it only lasted for 13 years from about 1865 through 1878 and then the North pulls out of the south they had been progress but then the North pulls out of the south followed by Jim Crow the rise of the KKK the Supreme Court deciding Plessy versus Ferguson effectively declaring that under the Constitution separate and unequal is fine a lynching epidemic takes shape race riots occur throughout the nation in places like Tulsa Oklahoma where black Wall Street is destroyed black holes are in Cole's progress of the Reconstruction era followed by almost 100 years of backlash and then of course the new generation rises up Supreme Court decides brown v board of education reversing Plessy vs. Ferguson Rosa Parks sits down so that the rest of us can stand up civil rights movement begins Fannie Lou Hamer and dr. King and John Lewis who Greg and I served with who mentors us to this very day continues to urge us to get into good trouble those leaders rise up and you've got another moment of progress in the United States of America the 1964 Civil Rights Act effectively ends Jim Crow the 1965 Voting Rights Act tries to bring to life two Fifteenth Amendment right to vote Medicare Medicaid Head Start a minimum wage law that's meaningful some immigration reform school breakfast school lunch all part of the Great Society in the war on poverty culminating in 1968 with the passage of the Fair Housing Act real progress in America but as we've learned when there are moments of progress it's almost inevitably followed by backlash and so in 1968 King is assassinated in April and then Robert F Kennedy the senator from New York after winning the California primary perhaps on his way to the White House is assassinated in June and then Richard Nixon tricky dick elected in 1968 running on a campaign of anxiety and backlash related to the progress that had just been made in America pursuant to the civil rights movement sounds familiar y'all - what we're dealing with right now that ushers in a new period of anti-affirmative action anti bussing anti-government that runs through the Reagan era and then of course there's a new moment of progress in America with the rise of the 44th President of the United States of America and the historic election of Barack Obama completing a journey where we went from the outhouse to the White House and there were people who of course then said this is going to be a post-racial America look who just got elected but the historians of course would have warned us that every time there's progress in America it's immediately followed by backlash and so in 2010 the Tea Party rises up running on a theme of we want our country back who took it away we know exactly what that was about and then a state legislature after state legislature after state legislature 180 voter suppression laws introduced in 41 states in reaction to what just happened in 2008 and then the Supreme Court in 2013 strikes a near more blow against the 1965 Voting Rights Act by stripping away section 4 and section 5 the preclearance provision assuring in a new era of voter suppression and then it all culminates with the election of so-and-so in 2016 the current occupant in the White House Barack Obama followed by Donald Trump progress followed by backlash and so we were of the view that we were in the third back last moment in America over the last several years but what history also says to us is that whenever we're in a back last moment a new generation has risen up to help move things forward and usher in a new era of progress and it's our hope that that is exactly what we are seeing right now in the movement for black lives in a movement for social racial and economic justice in a movement to end police violence and brutality once and for all led by young african-american women and men but joined in a multiracial way that we haven't really seen since the likes of the 1960s and the civil rights movement with historic numbers of Americans of every race saying it's time to deal with the racism that is in the soil of America and has been there since 1619 and so we're moving to justice in policing act with great leadership from a Greg Stanton and other members of the Judiciary Committee which is designed to bring accountability to police officers across the line it will prohibit the chokehold as a matter of law and other strangulation tactics such as a knee to the neck it will establish a national abuse of force standard anchored in a principle that de-escalation should be used in the first instance and deadly force should only be as a matter of last resort it will end no-knock warrants and drug cases prohibit racial profiling by police under law in qualified immunity for police officers which by the way results in a standard where you can have the ability theoretically to sue under our civil rights laws a right without an effective remedy because qualified immunity says that police officers are held to the standard of the least reasonable officer on the force could you imagine as a member of Congress if I was held to the standard of service of the least reasonable member of the House of Representatives I'd be run out of Brooklyn y'all and yet we have police officers who have the ability to take your life or your liberty held to a standard of the least reasonable officer on the force that's why we're getting rid of the doctrine of qualified immunity as it applies to law enforcement establishing a national database so we have visibility into officers who have crossed the line and been disciplined and just bringing justice to policing and on up George Floyd Brianna Taylor Eric garner and so many others who've been tragically killed we'll move that bill through the House of Representatives next Thursday and then the fight will continue thereafter to get the Senate to do the right thing and hopefully get something to the President's desk for signature so I thank all of you for your leadership I look forward to one day being able to come out to Arizona to Phoenix to Tempe to the great state out in the southwest but it's an honor to join with all of you virtually with my good friend a great leader Greg Stanton so thank you for giving me an opportunity to share and as we say in DC I yield back the balance of my time Akim I had a whole series of questions for you and you answered every single one of them in your talk that was awesome as I I get to see Hakeem Jeffries operate two or three times a week because he leads our caucus meetings it should be noted that 231 members of our caucus are sponsoring the George Floyd justice in police teen act let me ask you this because this is going to get through the United States Congress but it's going to have challenges in the United States Senate any advice you have for the leaders on this roundtable right now what can they do to try to effectuate the passage of this incredibly important piece of legislation through the United States Senate you know thanks so much great for that question and put the pressure on martha mcsalley know many people that I talk to across the country are in so-called blue states where they only have two Democratic senators that's great but then their ability to use their voices within their state is limited in the moment that we find ourselves in because they can't really advocate as constituents with Republican members of the majority in the Senate and so I think once we move this bill I think we have to make it clear to your senator that we expect action we expect it to be meaningful we expect it to be transformative we don't expect a dog and pony show or a toothless bill such as the one that has been introduced by Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina we want real action and everybody on this call has the ability to make that your powerful voice is heard at a moment where your senator will be paying attention because she knows she will be held accountable for inaction in November Akiba she one more look we've seen this horrific murder of George Floyd the horrific murder of a mod armory Brianna Taylor we saw the racism of that occurred with Christian Cooper that was that he filmed the blatant rape against him and as a result there's been real action on the streets of this country and hundreds of thousands of people maybe more have peacefully protested and demanded positive change and from your perspective as one of the top leaders in the United States Congress how has that peaceful protesting impacted the speed on which this bill is getting through our Congress because this is in in congressional time this is getting through very quickly without question as dr. King said we are moving with the fierce urgency of now because the times demanded and certainly the protests which is one of the two pillars of our democracy right protests on the one hand voting on the other protests anchored in the freedom of speech the freedom of assembly the freedom of expression the right to petition government to demand change and that's what we've been seeing and it's an all hands on deck moment city state and federal level and so we have seen the house act in a meaningful way a real indication that this time is different that America is listening in part I think because we were a captive audience given all that was happening with kovat 19 and being at home and socially distancing ourselves and then seeing this parade of Horrible's that you just laid out Greg unfold before our very eyes and then in the same week the straw that broke the camel's back with a harvard-educated birdwatcher have his color weaponized against him in Central Park and then simultaneously see George Floyd narrate his own death and cry out for his mother in a twin it's and 46 seconds on the streets of Minneapolis and we believe that this time is different because the American people are demanding it Lincoln of course said public sentiment is everything with it nothing can fail without it nothing can succeed public sentiment is with us and so I believe we will not fail in our mission well you everyone you can see why I love serving in Congress and I particularly love serving with the king Jeffrey's you can see why the Democratic caucus has selected this man as the leader of our caucus and he leads with his values and by the way we've talked about the justice and policing Act but I can tell you without his leadership on the Judiciary Committee we wouldn't have passed things through our committee and through Congress not on the Senate side but through our side the DREAM Act which we still need to get signed into law to protect our dreamers it was a good decision by the Supreme Court this past week but more needs to be done to give a permanent place for these young people because the United States is their home the work you've done on the Equality Act the work you've done to restore the Voting Rights Act which did pass the our committee and did get out of the full house gun safety and gun safety legislation so I know our committee has probably known for the impeachment stuff and that took a lot of time and we did a lot of good work on that you were one of the great impeachment managers but the Judiciary Committee is doing a lot of work on the side of justice for our country and I'm just really proud to serve with you so I just owe you one man if I can ever return the favor and by the way you offered to come to Phoenix and I bet you there's a lot of people who are watching this call that took a note of that so as soon as we get through this darn deadly virus you're probably gonna have a lot of invitations to come to Phoenix and and and provide your wisdom to to our community I really appreciate it I look forward to it thanks for having me appreciate everybody on the call happy Joan team all right thanks Hakeem you're the best like a god thank you

we heard them snap a few minutes ago so we came down to see what happened that's all gone my stairs are gone everything i had on the day gone [Applause] living hell it's been bad it's pretty much demolished off the pollens the whole roof is gone i don't know where to even start i mean i must walk 20 circles in my yard before i even touch something it's like it's so much not only are we kicking off another hurricane season today but many louisiana residents are trying to figure out fema's risk rating 2.0 flood premiums and how they're going to impact them so we take a look at some of the concerns and uncertainties around that new flood insurance program risk rating 2.0 is fema's new system for pricing flood insurance now fema claims the 2.0 better reflects the real flood risk for properties rather than using the flood zone approach 2.0 examines a variety of factors to assess the flood potential elevation distance from a flood source such as rivers and bayous the cost to restore and or rebuild flood mitigation efforts and the regional rainfall and flash flood threat are some of the key elements that go into the 2.0 pricing calculation but premium estimates from 2.0 for our area are becoming more and more alarming bridget whitney and her husband perry are long time residents of central in 2021 the whitney's annual flood insurance premium was less than 550 dollars and of course the 2.0 rating came in and now my policy is 645 dollars this year for that same coverage and i'm supposed to be excited that i'm only going to be increased by 18 percent a year the whitneys have been quoted a final 2.0 policy figure of eighteen hundred dollars per year more than three times their 2021 policy now as long as they remain insured their annual cost will only increase at 18 each year rather than immediately jump to that 1800 estimate however at an annual increase of 18 their annual cost will double in just four years so it's kind of scary for us we will be on a fixed income what's your perspective on 2.0 i really don't know i'm clueless as to how they're coming up with the figures that they're coming up with do you see this new rate as a punishment i do i absolutely do 2.0 has left many of us in the industry with a lot of unknowns tara smith is a realtor for berkshire hathaway home services and she's been tracking the changes in premiums that 2.0 has produced in the local area we're seeing some double doubling in the premiums as well as triple premiums in fact congressman garrett graves has seen even more drastic increases we've gone and gotten actual numbers from people and i'll give you an example we had people had preferred risk policy 560 bucks a year going to 5 000 going to 6 000 dollars a year so the obvious question is how are these new rates generated only fema knows i've had clients ask how they go about quoting those premiums or putting that information together and what sources they actually use to compile that information together and and it's just an unknown to us realtors we have as i mentioned been trying to force transparency upon fema to disclose the rates to disclose the methodology uh how they've developed this new system and we require an independent study of their methodology to determine if it's in a legitimate approach or not so congressman what would you highlight with regard to some of your congressional action regarding fema's risk rating 2.0 our efforts in congress to help to pause delay or flat out stop risk rating 2.0 is growing the reality is it's just not sound policy i mean the numbers alone scream that this isn't sound policy we don't want to lie or mislead people in regard to the risk they're experiencing but the solution here isn't to charge people out of being able to live in communities the solution is building the flood protection that they deserve at the end of the day it looks like fema's risk rating 2.0 may prove to be very expensive for many south louisiana residents i think that we are experiencing a disproportionate increase in rates here so given all the uncertainty surrounding fema's risk rating 2.0 whether you currently have flood insurance or you're thinking about adding the protection to your property be sure to speak with an insurance expert at your first opportunity and that's just one thing you should be doing as part of your hurricane game plan you want to have supplies for several days in case the power goes out or if you're cut off by flood waters or debris emergency officials say you should have at least three days worth of supplies that means plenty of water and food at least one gallon of water per person per day for three days you'll also want to have a battery powered radio or hand crank radio so we can keep you informed we have all this information and more in the hurricane center on the nine news app

I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY  TIME.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK  RESERVES.  THE GENTLELADY FROM CALIFORNIA   IS RECOGNIZED. MRS. KIM: THANK YOU, MR.   SPEAKER. I TOO WANT TO THANK MY   COLLEAGUES, CONGRESSMAN SHERMAN  AND CONGRESSMAN CHABOT, FOR  INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION. COVID-19 HAS HAD A DEVASTATING   IMPACT IN THE WORLD BUT SOME   COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN HIT HARDER   THAN OTHERS. IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR, JUST AS   AMERICANS WERE RECEIVING   COVID-19 VACCINES AND THE UNITED STATES WAS SEEING A DECLINE IN   CASES, INFECTIONS IN INDIA BEGAN TO SURGE.  A YEAR BEFORE IN THE SPRING OF   2020, WHEN THE UNITED STATES WAS EXPERIENCING A SPIKE IN COVID-19 CASES, INDIA CAME TO OUR AID AND LIFTED ITS EXPORT BAN ON CERTAIN DRUGS IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST   BY THE UNITED STATES.  IN RESPONSE TO INDIA'S SURGE,  THE UNITED STATES QUICKLY  DELIVERED MUCH-NEEDED SUPPLIES   SUCH AS P.P.E., RAPID TESTS, AND OTHER DRUGS TO INDIA.  THIS ACTION FROM THE UNITED  STATES, THE WORLD'S OLDEST   DEMOCRACY, TO INDIA, THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEMOCRACY, IS ONLY   FITTING. INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE  NATURAL PARTNERS AND COVID-19  HAS ONLY PROVEN OUR TIES ARE   GROWING STRONGER.  THIS RESOLUTION FURTHER SHOWS  THE HOUSE STANDS WITH THE PEOPLE OF INDIA AS THEY WORK TO STEM  THE SPREAD OF COVID-19   THROUGHOUT INDIA.  I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT  THIS RESOLUTION AND

now democratic congressman tom malinowski of new jersey who also served as an assistant secretary of state for democracy and human rights during the obama administration congressman we appreciate you joining us today i know that you were born in poland today's attack was very close to the polish border just your reaction to what happened today and whether the u.s should be doing more to stop russian aggression i think they did this because we are doing more look the the ukrainian military these brave defenders of ukraine have inflicted more casualties on the russian invaders than um than we suffered than the united states suffered in through the entire iraq war they've killed more russians in 17 days than we lost in iraq potentially more than we lost in iraq and afghanistan over many many years and obviously putin is frustrated by that and i think what is what happened here is that his generals are desperately trying to find uh to to to show him that they're trying to do something about the the supply of weapons from the united states from western europe that is enabling the ukrainian troops to inflict such heavy casualties on the russians so it's it's awful but it's not surprising it doesn't mean that the russian army is any closer to western ukraine there's there's absolutely no way of getting there if they can't even take kiev so i i think this is as grisly as it is it's it's it's more evidence that uh the the supplies that we are getting to the ukrainians are having a very lethal and effective uh effect would you anticipate a more direct message from the russians i mean the russians have threatened any convoy that carries military aid into ukraine essentially the base that was attacked today we know was one that was a hub for for that equipment is this strike today a warning from putin to the u.s not to send more equipment in and how can the allies respond to this well it's it's perhaps but it's not going to work i mean obviously we know that if we're if we're giving the ukrainians highly lethal military equipment that they are using to kill russians then of course the russians are going to try to target that equipment that's war and we need to understand what we're what we've gotten into here we're not directly involved with u.s troops on the ground but we are arming ukrainians to kill russians and they're doing it very very effectively and the russians are upset so that's what happens um but it's absolutely not going to deter us in fact we saw the administration uh just just yesterday announced 200 million dollars more in in equipment and and i think we've been very smart uh in in what we're providing we're we're not responding to uh whatever's on twitter in any given moment we are talking to the ukrainian military and we are giving them the the weapons that their troops actually need not the sexy stuff but the effective stuff that they actually need to be successful um and and i expect that to be stepped up what's particularly important now by the way uh anti-aircraft systems and the eastern european countries have some of the more sophisticated russian origin anti-aircraft systems the s-300 system for example i know the administration uh is is scouring the world looking for any country that has those kinds of systems and offering to help to get it into ukraine to protect against these kinds of attacks we've had current and former members of the ukrainian parliament on our air and we've heard from president zielinski that what they really want what they believe they really need is a no-fly zone over ukraine obviously secretary blinken president biden had both said no that's not going to happen at the same time there are members of congress who have said that there should be a no-fly zone over ukraine what's your view on this and and what action is it going to take to actually turn the tide to bring this to an end i think the tide is turning but my view of a no-fly zone is that it would be the highest risk lowest reward option on the table highest risk because it would mean the united states going to war with russia people should people can be for it but they should say that that is what they are for united states firing the first shot in the war with russia we would have to target russian air defenses on the ground in ukraine and potentially in russia and then be prepared to shoot down russian aircraft and dogfights over the skies over over ukraine and lowest reward because most of the devastation that we are seeing in cities like kiev and mariopol and kharkiv is not coming from the sky it is coming from artillery and on the ground it's coming from rocket fire missiles fired from the ground so to have any impact on that and no fly zone would immediately have to become a no drive zone with the us air force firing on every russian unit they see on the ground surrounding these cities again if you're for that okay but be aware of but say it be honest about about the fact that you're advocating for the united states to to get involved in in a war directly with russia and finally i would say i think i think putin wants us to get involved uh in a way the russians don't want to there's no motivation in russia to be killing ukrainians and this is one reason why the russian army i think is slowly disintegrating in in ukraine i think there is more motivation to fight the united states and nato and i don't want to give them that especially if we can help the ukrainians win with the kind of assistance we're providing we have just a few seconds left but i do want to ask you you worked on human rights under the obama administration does what we're seeing from putin now amount to war crimes in your mind and if so what does the world do about that totally uh they are indiscriminately firing on residential areas and big cities and they're doing it because they want to kill civilians there's no question in my mind about that what should we do about it we need to win we need to help the ukrainians win we need to make sure that this terror is defeated and that is what i think the biden administration with help from congress is is on the way to doing here and we need to stay the course with determination and some confidence in the power of what we are already doing congressman tom malinowski we appreciate your time today thank you sir

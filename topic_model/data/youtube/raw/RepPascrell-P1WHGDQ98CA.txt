chairman the President of the United States let's deal with the facts and not conjecture is now a named under oath unindicted co-conspirator in federal crimes that alone is reason to leave no stone unturned spare no effort to examine his president's conflicts of interest and compliance with our tax laws as I wrote to you in February of 2017 asking the both of us to do this on a nonpartisan basis since it's all going to come out in the end you chose not to his cones a co-conspirator his personal lawyer Michael Cohen was pleaded guilty in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York to five counts of tax evasion one count of making false statements to a financial institution one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporation contribution in one count of making an excessive campaign contribution at the request of a candidate we all know the story Michael Cohen paid off the president's Paramore paid off the National Enquirer for a story about another affair with another woman and former Playboy model Trump then paid Cohen for those payments these payments illegal campaign contributions may have been written off mr.

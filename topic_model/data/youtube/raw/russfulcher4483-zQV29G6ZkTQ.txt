Hi, I'm Russ Fulcher. For the past nine
months I've been a candidate for governor of the state of Idaho. I've been
honored to meet with thousands of Idahoans. Many of you have contributed to my campaign in numerous ways. It's been an incredible blessing. When I announced
my candidacy, I was the only candidate prepared to implement a conservative
citizen-driven vision for Idaho. Today there are four major candidates for the
office of Governor and a significant amount of overlap in our conservative
philosophies. My continued presence in the race could actually have the effect
of splintering the support of conservatives. During my entire political
life, I have evangelized that there are politicians and there are statesmen.
The difference is that statesmen earn credibility by consistently placing
their principles ahead of themselves It's time for me to prove that I believe
my own words. Unlike the situation when I announced for governor, today the office
in most need of an experienced conservative candidate is the 1st
Congressional District. If I'm really a servant leader, I need to offer service
where most needed and I'm excited to do that so I request your support as I step
out of the governor race and into the congressional race. I sincerely want to
do the right thing for the people of Idaho. Good leadership recognizes when
there is a need to institute a u-turn Now is one of those circumstances. Thank you

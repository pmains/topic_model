in florida and elsewhere with these vaccine mandates is texas congressional candidate and army veteran wesley hunt great to have you with us sir happy to be on thank you and i got to say you you have one of the most texas sounding names very on brand for texas wesley hunt i mean it's like it's out of a the urban cowboy movie or something like that i thought about that the first time i saw you on the last campaign but we just heard from leo on this vaccine passport investigation in florida and we know texas governor greg abbott uh has just started to really kind of crack down on these types of things with the airlines as well i wanted to get your reaction on this whole back and forth with southwest airlines and american airlines and what's happening down there in texas you know i applaud governor abbott and i applaud governor desantis as well for standing for liberty or standing for freedom look this is a free country these back sand made mandates are actually flat out unconstitutional that's not the role of the federal government to mandate what you should or should not put in your body and that's actually your personal choice but what we do know is that this is part of a socialist agenda by the bible administration to continue to infringe upon your rights to make government bigger to control your everyday life we've got to stand up against that literally this is the reason why i'm running for united states congress and a couple of weeks ago i was at a football game i was watching the texas a m fighting aggies and i watched 80 to 100 000 young people at this stadium living their lives having a great time and making their own personal choices that that's what needs to happen in our entire country i'm vaccinated that's my choice and i cannot force another american to do that that's ridiculous i may or may not have stormed a field once upon a time after a college football game myself no i i'm with you i saw these kids you know and i as much as i um you know i i love to see alabama go down i was rooting for texas a m as well everyone wanted to see nick dave and nick saban take one on on the chin and he did and you know you think about that you saw and i and i looked at the video of the kids on the field and i thought here we are i mean somebody at least is acting like the pandemic is behind us and i think what we saw from that it's it's the the people that are going to decide when this pandemic is really over i mean the the public health officials they may be trying to do their best and give us the best information but they've lost the confidence of so many people it's the government's role the federal government's role to inform the public and tell the truth about public health issues but it's not the government's role to force you to do something and like i say we're seeing it in texas a lot particularly in texas and and in florida our economies are doing well our states are being run efficiently and we are moving on and moving beyond this and look this is something that we could take seriously i'm not saying that but at this point let's get on with it let's move on let's be safer about it let's learn from the past and let's make sure that we don't infringe and trample our rights as we move forward we do start to see kind of the nansen signs or the green shoots or whatever you want to call it of people wrapping their arms around this idea of federalism i always say that you know when it comes to politics there's always like this kind of newton's third law every action has an equal and opposite and sometimes unintended consequence of happening you know the the byte administration tried to grab all this power and people are now starting to stand up

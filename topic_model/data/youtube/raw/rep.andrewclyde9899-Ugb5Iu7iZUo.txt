welcome to the show well thank you very much I appreciate the opportunity to be on FRC it's good to see you today tell me are the moves by Governors Abbott DeSantis finally waking people up to the situation at the border do you think well I think that they should be commended because um you know if a city is going to declare themselves a sanctuary City then I think that they just said to the entire country we are a magnet send us the illegals that we're a sanctuary City we'll take care of them we're happy too Martha's Vineyard did that San Francisco's done that you know the numerous other liberal cities uh Washington DC here I think all the mayor should open them with welcome you know with or welcome them with open arms I mean I think that's exactly what it means when you create to a sanctuary City and so I've applaud the governors of both the Florida and of Texas and you know any other Governors that want to send them send these illegals to the sanctuary cities I think it's a great idea well does that mean that you're surprised by the reaction they've received when these uh when these migrants have been sent to these cities I'm shocked I'm shocked I would think they'd be happy about that but you know obviously Martha's Vineyard wasn't very happy about it they rounded them all up and within 48 hours or so ship them to a military base really I mean the hypocrisy of the left is just astounding and that's what the American people are seeing here yeah I hope the governors of these states send more of them up there you know don't send 50 send 500 um because they need to be understanding the pain that the border states are feeling they need to feel that they need to see that because it's the policies of the left that have created this crisis and disaster and you know they want the border states to feel it but they don't want anything to do with it yet they're the ones that created the crisis they supported President Biden President Biden made the executive orders that created the executive orders that that made for an open border and you know Latin America is simply responding to these policies now Congressman there seems to be some disagreement among Democrats about whether the Border actually is secure last week vice president Kamala Harris said that it was Secure and ABC's news's John Carl asked mayor Adams from New York City about that let's play clip two vice president Harris one week ago said that the border is secure do you agree with that do you think our Southern border is secure I believe that we can continue to coordinate better to make sure that it is secured properly Congressman how do you interpret that well when he says secure properly I mean he gives it away right there it is not a secure border the Border has not been secure since President Biden took office I mean when he stopped the construction of the border wall That's evidence right there uh when you see people pouring across the border and then our government funding transport of them further Inland in fact when I was in McAllen Texas last year I was on an airplane going from McAllen to Dallas and there were 12 illegals on that airplane two of them sitting right beside me on their way to Philadelphia courtesy of the Federal Government funding the travel via 501c3s you know it's inexcusable the blind Administration has caused this crisis the country needs to know that it is a continuing crisis it's not something that's come and gone it's ongoing in fact actually it's getting worse so I think that um that this is a huge issue for us it's causing crime to increase uh it's causing governments to spend money on illegals where they shouldn't have to money money being taken away from citizens it's a disgrace and this needs to stop and and I I just think that um that the country needs to drastically change course here when it comes to leadership we're speaking to Congressman Andrew Clyde from the great state of Georgia and Congressman there's a lot of conversation about this certainly the actions of Governor Abbott and Governor santis have gotten the nation's attention there's a lot more conversation about the the Border situation because of the busing decisions that they have made do you think that this conversation and essentially getting some of these Sanctuary cities and blue State Governors and Mayors to become involved in the situation is that going to change the posture of the Bible Administration do you think it'll change their behavior you know I I hope it does I really do um but I'm not very confident that it will because I think they have a nefarious end here and that is that they want to increase the population um of the of the blue states that are losing population and uh and I think they want to do that basically uh to keep the Congress the population so that the census uh will the congressional seats in those particular States um and then they want it as we heard um earlier uh last week they want to turn them into voters they want to give them amnesty and they believe that they'll vote for Democrats um but uh you know this is wrong and I think the Mayors in these cities are going to feel the pain of it and I think they should feel the pain of it because these are policies that the left has created and the left has to take responsibility for them and the American people need to know that and they need to make a change make a change in leadership Congressman last question on this subject lots of issues that the voters are concerned about heading into November where does this rank for voters do you think well I think probably the number one issue is inflation um and after that it's inflation and um it's inflation uh I think that um uh this will this will come down a little bit below that um probably a crime is is after inflation and border security I think directly relates to that so I think it's in the top three or four uh when it comes to what what voters are actually looking at um and I mean you've got the Second Amendment issue as well uh with the bind Administration trying to take our guns and trying to um uh you know cancel us as a first you know our first amendment I think that's a big issue for folks and they're experiencing that individually when they when the big tech companies cancel them on you know cancel their voice online so there's a number of issues that The Binding Administration has created and um I don't couldn't tell you the exact order except I'll tell you inflation's number one yeah a congressman on a switch gears on you a bit you proposed a new bill called the protect unborn uh the protect The Unborn act excuse me tell us what you're trying to do there thank you yes that is a great piece of legislation uh and it is defunding the two Biden executive orders um that uh 14076 and 14079 that President Biden issued in July and August of this year and those two orders are in response to the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Roe v Wade and to send the the subject of abortion back to the states which is where it belongs I think what President Biden did was this huge overreach of the federal government he's trying to legislate here and he's not in the legislative branch he's in the executive branch he is supposed to to Faithfully execute the laws as Congress the representatives of the people pass them and that's not what he's doing he's trying to create his own law and trying to push push abortion Services um funded with Federal money down to states that prohibit it like my state of Georgia which prohibits abortion we have a heartbeat law um and if if a heartbeat is detectable then abortion cannot be performed but for President Biden to to sign these executive orders just flies in the face of what the Supreme Court has done and might build the protect The Unborn Act is designed to strike down these two executive orders and to defund them and I was proud to introduce it last week with 90 Republican original co-sponsors so it's got a lot of support as it should because it protects the innocent unborn it protects states rights it recognizes the authority of the Supreme Court and uh and it tells the bind Administration that they have overreached that legislation of course is more evidence of why elections matter of course that will not be Advanced by the current Speaker of the House and so for those who are interested in seeing that and other pro-life legislation frankly Advanced that's going to be determined by the voters uh this coming November now Congressman we know that the Hyde Amendment has been in place for a long time and it prohibits already the use of federal funds for abortion why does that not take care of this situation well I think that you see that President Biden is simply ignoring federal law it is federal law there's a number of things that President Biden I think is requiring here um and or asking the Departments within the federal government to do that violate the law and uh you know it could go to the court but it would take as as we have seen you know a year year and a half of the courts to actually make a decision and to strike down these executive orders so I think we need a more immediate solution so a legislative solution I think is the right one and hopefully we'll have the majority in January and we'll be able to advance legislation like this uh in January to strike down his executive orders I mean just go ahead you know final question for you about a minute left less than that you and 43 of your colleagues sent a letter to the Veterans Affair secretary Dennis McDonough demanding he rescind the new VA rule that provides abortion Services through VA Health Care uh where does that stand right and that's exactly what I was about to mention I mean you have the VA responding to President Biden's executive orders which were basically telling the administration or the executive agency is hey find where you can to push abortion Services into states that are preventing it and it's unconscionable that the VA would be spending money designed to provide Health Care to Veterans on abortion Services federally funded abortion services

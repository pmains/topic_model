this is really when i took over chairman in january 2015 it was in march 2015 that was revealed that hillary clinton ran most of her emails through a private server uh not only is this committee the old general oversight committee of congress we have specific legislative jurisdiction on federal records so that really began my work in this committee's work for the last six years investigating some of this corruption the obama administration this represents from my standpoint the unequal application of justice hillary clinton was exonerated uh this this uh the email scandal the mid-year examination investigation morphed into the crossfire hurricane scandal i mean i find it shocking within two weeks of president trump entering office two of his phone calls to world leaders were leaked to the press this is unprecedented it's actually what what uh spawned our investigation into the leaks to show the 125 leaks in the first 126 days this cannot go on this is dangerous to our democratic republic unfortunately my efforts to uncover the truth have been severely obstructed by the agencies involved by entrenched bureaucrats that have every incentive to keep it hidden this is an email that the gsa produced to us and you can see it's it's we can read the whole thing except for the the mobile phone number of the sender of the email this is the exact same email produced to us by the fbi as you can see almost everything is redacted there's no reason for things to be redacted there's nothing involving or harming national security here might embarrass the agency but doesn't harm national security this is what we've been dealing with this is the resistance we have encountered in our investigations into abusive power we simply don't have time to indulge in hyper partisan investigations that simply don't advance the interest of the american people therefore i do not think today's hearing is an appropriate use of our committee's time resources uh or quite frankly credibility i've been a nonpartisan journalist for nearly 40 years in local news cnn cbs pbs and the national station group sinclair i've witnessed a dramatic devolution in my industry as we've allowed ourselves to be transformed into tools of political and corporate interests pushing narratives slanting information on the news and online and seeking to shape public opinion rather than report facts and various views this means today's media landscape has allowed some of the biggest and most important stories of our time to be covered in a fantastical and one-sided often inaccurate and incomplete way or perhaps escape coverage entirely while important violations of law and constitutional rights by powerful interests go unchallenged we have to confront the fact that our intelligence structure and some insider federal agencies have proven more powerful than congress the legislative or judicial branches more influential with the media and largely immune from oversight and after the most egregious violations from prosecution cbs where i worked at the time publicly announced in 2013 that forensics proved my computers were remotely hacked and my work remotely monitored and the cbs news systems were accessed in the spy effort as well after the forensics definitively proved the government was responsible had secretly installed a keystroke monitoring program exfiltrated files listened in on me secretly activating audio looked through my work photos then remotely overwrote computer logs to try to erase their tracks when we discovered them nothing happened zero during my nearly 24-year career in the fbi i investigated and managed numerous significant counterintelligence cases and specifically russian counterintelligence investigations i have been speaking up at some personal risk not for political reasons but rather out of my concern that the integrity of the fbi and the trust that the american people have traditionally placed in the fbi have been imperiled by the faulty and reckless actions of those former fbi leaders nearly four years ago a series of crimes were committed in full view of the public and to date no one has been charged it was the one set of crimes inarguably committed during the course of crossfire hurricane the fbi's investigation of russian interference in the 2016 election and the possible involvement of the trump campaign for general flynn it was the beginning of a twisted journey forced upon him by political opponents and professional rivals and ending only last week with a presidential pardon for america those leaks are the centerpiece of one of the most remarkable crime sprees in our history classified information leaked serially to prestige press organizations for the purpose of prosecuting a campaign of political warfare against a sitting president reporters rarely if ever actually saw the classified documents they relied on badly spun accounts of the documents fed to them by a circle of intelligence leakers there really has been and there is an unholy alliance between liberals democrats and the media one of the things i've criticized is that at the beginning of the trump administration many news organizations announced that they were suspending their normal ethics and standards that dictate how their news organization typically deals with things such as use of anonymous sources that they were suspending these because they said they needed to suspend their standards to cover a uniquely dangerous president and i've argued and i think you've observed that i actually think there's no more important time for us to keep our standards and ethics than when we're covering somebody that maybe we don't like or we have strong feelings about that's what standards are for and instead we saw this lifting starting in the 2016 time period and this changing of everything i come from the left i'm familiar with left-wing bias what we've seen the last several years has nothing to do with left-wing bias what we're talking about now is not a normal media it is a platform for information operations it's not just about partisanship i think because there's no accountability time and time again then they may say oh people need more training we'll reiterate our policies this has happened over and over again and they know again from administration to administration some of the same people nothing ever happens to them so the behavior doesn't change this is not the fbi i knew or worked in this not the fbi agents who worked tirelessly and analysts and other support personnel who worked tirelessly every day this was a hijacking of the fbi i think you all understand that i've not gotten a great deal of support for these investigations over the last six years um i think the attendance of this hearing shows that congress is a paper tiger the reason these people aren't held accountable is there's no way to hold them accountable who investigates the investigator who prosecutes the prosecutors that is an enormous problem and it's certainly what i've come to understand in the six years trying to do this you know trying to get this out it bothers me in terms of the reflection and the impact on our democracy and our freedoms this is serious and yet we've got a couple senators attending this hearing and i've got my ranking members saying this isn't even this isn't even an appropriate hearing for this committee to have there's the problem crossfire hurricane was a case that was open against u.s citizens in members of a presidential campaign unprecedented never been done before you would think it would be handled with care marked all over that decision-making process but it doesn't it doesn't appear that way so they literally took fourth-hand information the fbi received information from a friendly foreign government which we now know to be australia who in turn had a conversation with george papadopoulos who in turn received information now known through joseph mifsud that the russians had suggested they had information damaging to the clinton campaign i'm not sure how you rally all of that together to make sufficient predication for in opening even a preliminary investigation a limited investigation they they went ahead and opened a full investigation which gave them the ability to use all of the fbi's investigative powers against u.s citizens so i think congress needs to first investigate have all all the access to all the information and then if we see potential criminal activity we refer those cases to the justice department if there's a conflict there then you set up a special counsel so we've done this completely backwards and here we are four years later and we're only now starting to uncover the the extent of the corruption and the corruption is incredibly troubling it should have troubled every member of congress every u.s senator every member of this committee but it obviously doesn't because apparently corruption is partisan if it's corruption in the side of your party not worried about it i'm worried about it regardless what we're looking at in the media now is not simply about partisanship they are serving as a platform as a sword and shield for the oligarchs you're absolutely correct and if you look at the major washington media press organizations the washington post and the atlantic this is precisely what's going on the problems i track have more to do with outside influences both political and corporate understanding the first two decades of this century very clever ways to get their nose under the tent at news organizations and get their people hired and use non-profits and llcs and crisis management firms and global law firms to shape what we do effectively and shape the terms of what we talk about the language we use the stories we don't report and i want to thank all the witnesses for just what you do in your careers you know what you've contributed to our to our republican as benjamin franklin so famously said it's republic if we can keep it and it's a real concern when you when we see what's happening here you know the abuse of power i'm highly concerned

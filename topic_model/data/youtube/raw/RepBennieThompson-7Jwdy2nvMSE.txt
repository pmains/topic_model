what kind of message does this send a terrorist that'll kind of congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi is chairman of the Homeland Security Committee which has just scheduled hearings for next week how did this happen congressman well I think clearly you correct the system fail and what we want to look at is the difference between operational systems and coordination we had two federal agencies that should have been in constant communication with each other and obviously the system failed mr. speaker should not have been able to get into Canada and back into the United States undetected else's be right but it also appears that this border agent did some freelance work here and somehow decided because we're told he didn't think speaker look too sick he saw his name on the Lord but he still let him through well that that is clearly not the protocol if the person was flagged on the computer he should not have been allowed we will look at that as one aspect of it but the question is how could mr. speaker landed in Canada if he was on a notice the Canadian authorities should have been notified in a timely manner so that if he landed in Canada he should have been detected there also so there are a number of vulnerabilities that this situation has brought to our attention that we will look out I look for in the committee hearing so if you remember a sleeper cell is already here in the United States or someone overseas watching this how vulnerable that we appear to be seems that the system failed us that not only the the one of the busiest port of entries between Canada in the United States we couldn't even stop the guy from getting on an airplane in Italy well that's correct and we knew he was in Italy so clearly it means that we will have to from a top to bottom look at our system this hearing will be designed to look at exactly what happened look at exactly what was supposed to have happened and try to fix it there are no excuses but in this situation CDC and Department of Homeland Security should have been able working together in a coordinated fashion to prevent this from occurring and that's the purpose of the hearing this coming Wednesday we know mr. speakers password was swiped and at that point immediately popping up a screen would be a warning that this guy has a problem so we know that also the board an agent to made a decision that ok didn't look so sick he let him go through but we also understand there's a more common problem of what is called Lane flushing and to alleviate congestion of one of the fourth busiest ports of entries along the border we understand that that some cars are allowed through much more quickly than others how familiar are you with that process well we heard that complaint recently we schedule another hearing we're meeting with the secretary shirt off this week to find out what the problem is too many instances where something they happen occurs white and wood man more accountability from the secretary in these situation than others we just heard Mr Speaker apologize in an interview on ABC News particularly to the passengers who were exposed when the flight do you buy that apology tonight well uh you know that's his personal opinion he should not have put all those travelers at risk our system should have not allowed him to travel we now find out that they are two no-fly lists and we're not certain which no-fly list mr. speaker was put on was he on the terrorist no-fly list or was he on the other no-fly list we can't get verification from DHS on that so there are a number of things that we are trying to get information on also and we've been told that some of it is classified so we hope between now and our hearing on Wednesday whatever the information shortcomings are we'll have it available to the committee members that he and we will look forward to it being disclosed to the public down the road as well representative Bennie Thompson thanks so much for your time and I appreciate it thank you it seems like a whole

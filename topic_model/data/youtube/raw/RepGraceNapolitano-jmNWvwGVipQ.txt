i'd like to thank the co-chairs of the congressional mental health caucus i'm a woman of grace napolitano and congressman tim murphy for sponsoring this briefing today greatly appreciated so the focus of our briefing today is on the importance and tremendous value of samsa grant programs and what they specifically do to help children with mental health challenges and very important to have a packed agenda so i'm going to launch right into introducing our speakers beginning with administrator cam hyde of the substance abuse and mental health services administration who will share with us the need for trauma-informed practices in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems next who will be speaking is dr anthony manorum who is the director of the center for traumatic stress and children in adolescence at allegheny general hospital in pittsburgh new pittsburgh pennsylvania rather and he will explain to us what childhood traumatic stress is and how we can treat it next we'll have christine marsh she's a licensed clinical social worker and director of the child abuse and trauma services in tulsa oklahoma and she'll talk about how her site has been able to integrate trauma-informed practices into their system of care programs in their site and then finally we will have jordan gettys who is a youth advocate for the maryland coalition for children's mental health and she'll share her personal story about the trauma that she's had in her life and the challenges that she experienced but what serves the supports that she received which helped her to ultimately become resilient first i'd like to welcome the co-chair of the congressional mental health caucus congresswoman grayson paultano who will explain to you all what some of the work that they've been doing lately with mental health can you guys hear me because i rather than get up and results thank you all of you for coming uh and as you all are aware of may is mental health month and we're celebrating it by kicking it off with this forum um to be all the community activists all of the organizations work together we need you to erase your voice here in congress because uh is the stigma that keeps everybody from actually putting any face on it and of course children don't vote so we need you to be the voice we need to speak up you need to inform and educate not only the staff as well as a member can get a hold of them but ensure that you under that they understand the critical need for funding at the local level because then you avoid having more expenses for the communities for the nation uh as people grow older and are not able to face their their own uh trauma uh to pamela high thank you for being here to the panelists thank you everybody for spending some time with us um we try to address mental health early in my area we started a program with samsa thank you very much and 2000 on the pilot project which is the basis for my bill 151 the mental health and school act uh the teachers tell me they can start at a kindergarten level because they can begin to identify issues that children begin to exhibit at that early age my program starts at middle school and then on the high school uh it so far it was beginning three middle schools in one high school it is now in 14 school 15 and growing we haven't lost anybody that started off with uh the uh promise was uh um suicide prevention latin adolescence but the program treats any child um the uh bipartisan i'm sure tim will come in a little bit later but we also have on my bill three republicans and 75 democrats and thanks to tim murphy and thompson and steve austria that are on our bill uh the accomplishes we've been able to have in the last 14 years have been in congress is that we have been able to ensure that the funding for samsa has maintained at least uh somewhat more stable than even with all the cuts uh from the original 212 million uh 27 were only cut so we saved a few dollars there we also had a letter opposing these cuts that was handed not only to our leadership on both sides but also to the president it was a joint caucus letter again i thank you to hear me speak so i will then okay thank you god good morning good morning i am i don't like to use the mic actually but i've had a little bit of a cold so i'm going to go ahead and use it so make sure everybody can hear i actually first want to start off by thanking the groups that organized this briefing the national federation of families for children's mental health mental health america the center for mental health law and the national alliance of mental illness i appreciate a whole lot being included in your event and on the panel of such distinguished speakers especially i appreciate the opportunity to talk about what stance is learning and the work that it does with all of you i also want to thank congress the congressional mental health caucus for its support of this briefing but also just its general support and particularly representative napolitano you've been a tremendous champion for mental health for samsa for children's mental health issues and we just can't thank you enough so thank you representative murphy who i understand is also going to be here his first hand experience and knowledge as a child psychologist has also enabled him to bring a strong understanding of the issues and a passion to improve our nation's behavioral health so this year we all celebrate the seventh national children's mental health awareness day and actually i should just take a moment to appreciate gary blau lisa rubenstein and all the staff from samhsa wave your hands have done tremendous work on this and all year long to make this an incredible event so thank you guys for all that you do this is a day designed to raise awareness of the importance of promoting positive mental health and the importance of preventing and treating mental health and substance use problems in children and youth our focus this year is on what we're calling heroes of hope the adults who offer a positive and stable long-term influence to help young people thrive and reach their full potential heroes of hope uh that support of adult can have a really large impact on any child's life one adult can make the difference and the impact can be particularly important for children and youth who've experienced a traumatic event these traumatic events can include witnessing or experiencing physical or sexual abuse violence in families and communities natural disasters wartime events and terrorism long term or multiple deployments of apparent military service accidental or violent death of a loved one and a life-threatening injury or illness there's lots of types of traumatic events what these events have in common is the ability to affect the daily lives of young children long after the trauma itself has ended and even into adulthood for youth who have experienced such events a hero of hope may be the person in their lives who are the reason that they stay in school get a good job stay away from drugs and become productive contributing members of their communities and frankly be able to handle adversities in adulthood including potentially mental health issues one of the first steps to helping a young person is to identify the issues that he or she is having so today sansa is pleased to be releasing a new publication titled mental health and substance use problems of children and adolescents a guide for child serving organizations and one of the unique facets of this guide is that it includes principles that guide screening for mental health and substance use problems developed by a federal partnership it's the thing that our country and our communities and our congress people ask of us and that is to collaborate at the federal level so this includes many agencies within the united states department of health and human services also the united states department of education the department of justice's office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention and the department of defense in addition the american academy of pediatrics reviewed and approved the guide and it provides detailed information about how to identify mental health and substance use problems very early it also includes a compendium of appropriate screening tools for children and youth and in addition it includes information about early identification and the guide also includes sections about highlighting information and resources specific to a number of child serving settings including homeless and domestic violence shelters child welfare settings juvenile justice settings early childhood education primary care substance use and mental health studies we recognize that kids in these settings are almost universally going to have experienced traumatic events and need our collective uh wisdom and help the guide shows how behavioral health is embedded across all these sectors that serve children it's important that we screen our young people early and because the earlier we recognize a child's mental health needs the sooner we can help early recognition and intervention can actually prevent years of future disability and help children and families thrive everyone should learn to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental health problems and seek help if they exist some of those signs include things like changes in appetite decreased interest or withdrawal from friends and normal activities over or under reaction to physical contact sudden movements and sounds angry outbut bursts or aggression a change in sleeping patterns frequent complaints of headaches stomach aches or fatigue avoidance or withdrawing behaviors heightened difficulty with authority redirection or criticism and emotional numbing or expressing no feelings at all now for any of us who are parents we know that sometimes these are descriptions of normal adolescents so making a distinction requires some health and assistance and sometimes we want people to know those signs and symptoms and to know how to ask for help these symptoms require our attention and they could mean that a child has experienced some type of traumatic event because more than 25 percent of american youth have experienced such a serious traumatic event by the time they are 16 and sadly many children suffer repeated and multiple traumas for a child or youth traumatic stress can interfere with their concentration and learning and can cause developmental delays traumatic stress can lead to problems with mental health substance use education behavior employment and other activities of life and as the number of traumatic events goes up so too especially without treatment through the physical and behavioral health repercussions from depression to alcoholism drug use suicide attempts and even physical issues such as heart and liver disease as well as social issues such as family financial and job problems so trauma has a financial cost we have data that suggests that one type of trauma trauma child maltreatment can cost as much as 210 thousand dollars in a year for a child who's experienced those issues evidence also suggests that behavioral health problems put these children and youth at risk for worse behavioral health and physical health problems later in life and they link frequently to increased risk for obesity diabetes heart disease and a variety of chronic physical health conditions so we are talking a lot these days about reducing the cost of health care and improving our nation's health we cannot do that without addressing children's mental and emotional health because they have a direct relation to the cost of health care so we have to be committed to the prevention and treatment of these issues in a public health way we tend to focus on behavioral health issues of social or moral problems they are in fact a behavioral health and public health problem that we need to address in that way we have to focus the hearts and minds of parents providers and communities and increase the emphasis on behavioral health because the hearts and minds of our children are literally at stake for children and youth who've experienced a traumatic event heroes of hope can make a really pivotal pivotal difference in their lives and help these young people gain enhance and demonstrate resilience which is their ability to successfully adapt to life-changing situations and stressful situations so sansa is also really pleased today to release some data that shows just how important the impact of heroes of hope can be on young people so we have a short report called promoting recovery and resilience for children and youth involved in juvenile justice and child welfare systems this report looks at children and youth who've been receiving services through a couple of our programs comprehensive community mental health services program for children and families that's the long-term title uh we call it the children's mental health initiative and the donald j cohen national child traumatic stress initiative or sometimes we refer to that as nitzi we use a system of care approach and the organizational philosophy and framework that's used inside the cnhi and it's a proven technology designed to create a network of effective community-based services and supports to improve the lives of children and youth at risk for developing serious mental health conditions as well as their families the report contains data from the nitsy which is the network of samsa grantees from academic clinical and community entities that collaborate on evidence-based practices integrating trauma-informed treatment and practices into all child serving systems and promoting effective community programs for children and families exposed to a wide range of traumatic events so the report that we're releasing looks specifically at children in the child welfare system and the juvenile justice system these are systems that sans is partnering with a lot these days because the youth in these systems have a higher rate of mental and substance use disorders and are more likely to be exposed to potentially traumatic events and face significant challenges the short report shows that upon entering our cnhi funded systems of care 34 almost a little over a third of the children and these involved in the child welfare system and over a fourth of the children involved in the juvenile justice system had experienced fewer or more types of trauma as they came into those systems in fact these children and youth were more likely to have made a suicide attempt as well six percent of the youth involved in child welfare attempted suicide in the six months prior to entering the cmhi program despite those challenges there's really good news in the report we know that samsa initiatives help these children in youth build resilience and recover by connecting them with supportive adults such as heroes of hope that we're talking about today and providing informed trauma-informed evidence-based treatment in many cases such treatment comes as a result of training received through these grant programs and among those in these child serving systems trained through our national child traumatic stress network centers high proportions of them and many cases over 80 percent report a greater knowledge of child trauma and its impact a greater knowledge of trauma-focused evidence-based interventions a greater knowledge of screening and trauma exposure and a greater knowledge of assessment for trauma exposure this greater knowledge combined with the actual coming in contact with adults who become heroes of hope is having a decided impact on young people just one example is that the children and youth who receive services through both cmhi and our national child traumatic stress network for those in the juvenile justice system they showed a marked decline in law enforcement contacts children served in cmhi program and child welfare system showed a marked decline in suicide attempts in fact they were reduced by half from the pre-six months to the beginning six months of going into the program and within a year it was down over 80 so we're literally saving lives in these programs but i have i have a picture of them as well the point here is that every child every child should have at least one adult who cares enough about them to have their picture in their wallet that's what we want heroes of hope to carry kids pictures who care about them and make a difference in their lives as we continue to spread the word about the importance of addressing mental health and substance abuse problems i actually invite all of you to consider becoming a hero of hope yourselves because as the data show a caring adult is who is there for a young person who stays in it for the long haul can make all the difference thank you very much i am truly honored to be here this morning mental health awareness day i have spent over 30 years in my career dedicated to children's mental health and specifically in regard to the impact of trauma and trying to develop effective treatments for children and families as was mentioned earlier the national child traumatic stress network was started in 2000 as part of the children's health act and it is part of the donald j cohen initiative child traumatic stress initiative which is administered by samsa the the mission of the ctsn access to care for children and families as opposed to traumatic events traumatic stress network is the single most important initiative that i've been involved in my career it has advanced the awareness of the impact of trauma on children and the dissemination of evidence-based practice for children and families exposed to trauma in a way that no other initiative that i've ever been involved in in my career and i would tell you that there are very few things in your professional career that you would describe as a game changer in regard to an area that you work in the national child traumatic stress network has been a game changer we're not only the professionals who work in this area but for children and families exposed to dramatic life events you can see on the map of the programs that are represented by the national child traumatic stress network there are some that are clustered in the northeast for programs that were started after the terrorist attack of september 11th and you also see some cluster programming in the gulf region as well which were started after hurricane katrina but a large number of programs scattered throughout the country including affiliated programs as well i want to acknowledge uh today the american psychological association for sponsorship of my participation in today's briefing and an apa's true dedication to bettering the lives of children and families in fact i have the good fortune and honor in 2008 to be part of apa's presidential task force on ptsd and trauma and children adolescence which really created a number of important educational resources for children and families and professionals who work with children and families exposed to trauma you know trauma is sadly very sadly embedded in the lives of our children um there are the large national events that we're all aware of things like september 11 hurricane katrina but there are the everyday events that people don't talk too much about i'm talking about sexual abuse and domestic violence and physical abuse and community violence and bullying in our schools and administrator hein mentioned 25 of children experiencing a traumatic event by the age of 16. the sad fact is that most children experience trauma experience multiple trials so we're not just dealing with one traumatic event in our lives we're often dealing with men which deeply affects their well-being so what is traumatic stress well you know traumatic stress is something that children experience when they're exposed or witnessed or hear about trauma but the best way for me to describe the traumatic stresses would be this think about our soldiers who have been in iraq and afghanistan we know that something on the order of 20 of our soldiers when they return from combat from being overseas experienced post-traumatic stress disorder we have great compassion for our soldiers who come back with those mental challenges this is the same kind of issue that many of our children exposed to trauma experience post-traumatic stress disorder and other traumatic stress symptoms and not only do they experience changes in their psychology but there are changes in their underlying neurophysiology as well it affects their brain development at a very young and vulnerable age and particularly very young children can have very intense reactions and as i mentioned earlier trauma is really embedded throughout our society and our schools and our families and our communities and it's really reached epidemic proportions in our society there are a range of problems and symptoms that children may experience and really it's the full range of emotional and behavioral disorders that children experience in childhood but traumatic stress does encompass ptsd and affecting children's ability to relate socially their ability to do well in school their ability to have relationships that are constructed now the most important thing i think for me to say this morning is this without effective identification without effective assessment of these children without effective treatment these children will go into adulthood and be at serious risk for serious psychiatric problems mental health difficulties the potential for suicidality for depression over utilization of medical services basically their developmental trajectory is deeply affected by trump it changes their course and without help it's very difficult to get back on course the aces study that i mentioned on that slide adverse children experiences study one of the most important studies looking at the long-term impact of adverse traumatic events on children if you have four or more of these events during childhood which many of traumatized children have your lifespan is short can we think of a more dramatic impact than that that experiencing traumatic events shortens your life and leading to other adverse consequences so without help these children are deeply effective we've had the good fortune in pittsburgh our center for traumatic stress and children of adolescence we started in 1994 and we've been part of the national child traumatic stress network for the past 11 years as a treatment development center along with my colleagues uh judy cohen and nestor devloger we have developed a treatment an evidence-based practice called trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy we have actually done 12 clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of tfcb2 when children receive this model and it involves families they're caretakers we've got evidence to show that 80 to 85 of the children and families who participate get marked improvement but it's a good start we've also had the good fortune to disseminate our treatment across the country we have a web-based course associated with the medical university of south carolina now over 120 000 mental health therapists around the world have taken our web-based course we've also done a train the trainer program where trainers have been trained to do tfcbt trainings around the country in the last three years our trainers have done over 400 trainings and 15 000 mental health therapists in america have been trained in this specific evidence-based practice this is just a slide on the tfc2 website the national child traumatic stress network is all about collaboration and we've had a good fortune in our participation to work with the category three community center sites specifically we've worked with christine's family and children's services of tulsa one of our trainers is located in our center at 780 fcdt we've also been collaborating with the pennsylvania systems of care grant which will include trauma-focused training in the near future and our the training coordinator for the pennsylvania high fidelity wrap-around as part of the systems of care has been part of our consumer advisory board for the past 10 years i would tell you that to see children in our clinic that been deeply affected by trauma can be very sad but on the other hand we also know the important resources and support that these children can recover we see most of the children with whom we work recovery i would also tell you that the best thing that's happened in the past 10 or 11 years and one of the critical things related to the national child traumatic stress network has been the creation of evidence-based practice that effectively helps these children and secondly that these evidence-based practices have decent been disseminated across the country largely because of the national child traumatic stress network i would tell you also by way of closing that our involvement in the national child traumatic stress network has facilitated our ability to disseminate our model around the country in a way that no other initiative that we've been involved in ever has thank you very much i am the director of child abuse and trauma services with family and children services in tulsa oklahoma i wanted to tell you i've been there for just over 17 years and my title used to be the director of child abuse services and so we became a part of the national child traumatic stress network and then we were able to add the word trauma as we realized the importance of how much that impacts how we serve the children and our hiv we heard dr mannarino talk about the ncts mission statement and i have it up here again because i want to highlight how much it is related to the mission statement of my organization they are interconnected and reliant upon one another family and children's purposes became aware of ncts and students was spending soon after the inception of the national child traumatic stress network we became a funded site for the first time in 2003 and from that time on the national child traumatic stress network became a core component of our agency's understanding and implementation of trauma-informed care for children and families we see them out again and why is this relevant in tulsa oklahoma there are over 100 centers and members who make up this dynamic network oklahoma has greatly benefited from the wealth of these resources and we have made important contributions back to the network as well the university of oklahoma is a member organization they have taken evidence-based practices and trauma information approaches and made them culturally relevant for our native american population not only in the state of oklahoma but across the united states as well our outlook on the department of mental health and substance abuse services who currently funds our systems of care services has also looked to the network for guidance and how to also incorporate trauma-informed care for our systems and care recipients family children services works closely with individuals such as judy tony esther i'm calling these folks by their first name because honestly i have to pull from my head their last names because we know them so well we also network with patricia vancourt out of california chamberhouse hip and out of california we never put joyce saucia from louisiana robin harwich joven amani out of new york charles wilson out of california barbara bonner out of oklahoma a little bit more about family and children services specifically we're a comprehensive family and mental health service agency and we do operate a child trauma center the outpatient services that we provide are specifically for ages 0-18 when i first came to the agency the age zero was not in our in our literature it was not on our books we did not have clients who were zero years of age three four years of age were much more common today we are serving infants and their parents and families and over fifty percent of the children that we serve are ages zero to six we also provide a family preservation services which is a partnership that we have with our child abuse system in the state of oklahoma these services are home-based services and we are supporting the families who are either at risk of abusing their children or they've been determined to have abuse their children and we recently became a new systems of care wraparound program for children ages 0-12 with a specific focus on those who have mental health issues and trauma issues combined our goal is to link our systems of care and family preservation services with the trauma-informed practices that we have obtained through our national child traumatic stress network membership we serve over 2 000 children specifically in my childhood use and trauma services program through two samsa funded grants our agency has been able to implement three distinct evidence-based trauma-informed treatment models dmcbt pcit and cpp our extensive collaborations and partnerships have been developed at the local state level and includes having our own statewide trauma-focused cognitive behavioral training this has been done in partnership with our oklahoma department of mental health as well as our agency and others in the community leveraging private funding so that we can also provide cfcbtc to other institutions such as our therapeutic foster care agencies in oklahoma part of our other collaborations have included participating with our oklahoma department of mental health or excuse me our oklahoma department of human services and child welfare our agency is currently participating in a breakthrough series collaborative helping our department of human services child welfare learn how to have a trauma impart system to hopefully provide sustainable placements for our children who are in state's custody outcomes we wonder excellent outcomes while i don't have the percentage of the percentages of our outcomes here you heard earlier from tony as well as pamela that these children are reducing their trauma symptoms their attachments are strengthened their parenting skills are enhanced and families are being healed this is one of our visual outcomes this is from a child who was in treatment with us this is a seven-year-old little girl who did experience sexual abuse and was exposed to ongoing domestic violence for some time she was able to report the sexual abuse that she experienced by her mother's boyfriend to her mother and she was able to report it after one incident of sexual abuse which is very uncommon for the kids that we see who usually endure abuse for quite some time before being able to report this mother was able to leave this domestic violence situation place her children into safe housing with her the children were able to remain with her because of her quick actions and her responsiveness in getting herself her children into treatment what a great outcome this is so let's talk a little bit more about our systems of care and the growth it's had in oklahoma our oklahoma department of mental health has leveraged federal and state funding to be able to support our systems of care they have had two children's mental health initiative cooperative agreements for the systems of care of our 12-year period and we leverage funding by asking our oklahoma legislature to match our funding they have received this match funding for all that one year which was a specifically economically challenging year for oklahoma some of the outcomes from our systems of care include having a 47 reduction in contacts with law enforcement a 48 reduction in arrests 53 reduction in school detentions 30 reduction in suspensions from school and 30 reduction in outcome placements having a statewide systems of care is close to fruition for the state of oklahoma our goal now is to be able to take our trauma-informed information wrap it into our systems of care so that our families who are receiving systems and care services can have access to evidence-based promising trauma-informed practices we want to be able to provide interventions such as seeking safety motivational interviewing child parent psychotherapy parent-child interaction therapy trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and many others that the network supports we're hoping to achieve a combination of excellence by integrating the systems of care and the national child traumatic stress network information what has this national collaborative experience meant to us well as tony mentioned we do have a national child traumatic excuse me trauma focus cognitive behavioral fair treatment trainer as part of our organization this has been instrumental to the state of oklahoma we have been able to partner again with our mental health services and our university of oklahoma to be able to support and sustain those providers in our state in learning tfcd we've also been a part of all of the ongoing learning collaboratives within the national child traumatic stress network which include work groups such as child welfare work group a secondary traumatic stress work group our zero to six work group which focuses on infants and young children our family and youth involvement we can't do any of this without input from our families and our youth and of course the sexual abuse work group so we're looking at the new proven treatments making sure that we have the correct assessments out there before we became a member of the national child traumatic stress network we thought we knew what was going on with some of our families we treated until we were able to use the right assessment tools and have the right approaches we misdiagnosed children post-traumatic stress disorder is not on our radar for the young children we serve i personally have diagnosed a two-year-old with post-traumatic stress disorder and never would have done so 17 years ago we access the webinars through national child traumatic stress network and we promote all of the information and materials that are provided by this network through the state of oklahoma our military families stand to benefit from the work from the national child traumatic stress network as we prepare to receive many of our service folks back into oklahoma and help their families reintegrate with one another so we plan to continue our network connections we plan to have a benefit not only for ourselves but to provide information back into the network so that we can all continue to grow we are happy now that we are not asking what's wrong with you that we can ask what's happened to you thank you i would now like to welcome congressman tim murphy good morning everyone great to be with my colleagues uh and uh to thank you all for your work uh what you've been doing and continue to do uh the issues involved with mental health uh that my colleagues in california worked on are extremely important to us we recognize their value from a cost perspective that we're continually going to our other colleagues let them know for example when you have chronic illness your likelihood of having undiagnosed mental health problems doesn't and you have mental health issues that you're cost of we also are aware that the issues involved with the children of our returning veterans uh some 300 plus thousands of them with post-traumatic stress disorders are also ones who uh will be dealing with these problems with recovery i also want to make sure i point out that there's a great value in being here and developing strong working relations with friends of congress if this is your first time to come to the hill adult company last time it's your 10th time for just getting started because what has to happen now in case for me i'm a psychologist i've practiced for 30 years and so in terms of my clinical skills et cetera i'm one minute on my side of the island the only person that has that skill set which i can teach my colleagues particularly when we're behind closed doors when it comes time to get red cotton excited to do and you've got to have a relationship with something like i've got with dr matarino who is always asking me to call an email uh he doesn't bug me but i know he's there when i need him call him many times i tell him the information on this and actually say he is his work was instrumental was a couple years ago what was that issue i talked to secretary bailey's to traumatize children uh because of the advocacy work that he did and let me know is extremely healthy and what happened in exchange i had receptors surveillance system you may not be aware of this because i don't expect the cannabis sector know everything that it's in their bills uh she had taken some money and put it into the program for homeless veterans good idea except that's not the purpose of hhs that's the va multiple programs of homeless veterans he said well you're batting that you're cutting this or traumatized children treatment and you could tell she wasn't aware of what happened but it was extremely valuable so we want to continue to do that to work together and build those things that i hope you'll build those kind of relationships plus i know back home tony's got my back and that's going to focus on those things but uh as this happens and you're certainly aware that children with mental health problems uh if not treated growth to adults with bigger problems they end up being a huge drain on services against the year they're not done right so the educational areas the criminal justice areas and community areas serious problems and continue on we want these kids to grow up healthy you know it's amazing go to any country around the world war-torn impoverished successful whatever it is kids are loved but what happens over time are the problems that they face when they don't have the resources to overcome them they can be children discarded uh who are serious problems and that's what we want to overcome so i think that let me also say this about the children almost three years ago three years in august i joined asian church and i'm a psychologist there i work at the walter reed national military medical center used to call the festival hospital emerged i work at ptsd and traumatic brain injury for sailors different arrangements for men and we do have a lot of resources we're focusing on that we don't have a lot of resources to help their children let me tell you we are woefully understaffed in the navy in the army the air force and having mental health professionals there and one of the things that i put into the defense authorization of the last year which was to call upon the surgeons generals on the branches of the military to find ways to get more mental health personnel into the military it used to be they wanted people as graduate students got to take a break until they get in they learn to be an enzyme they get to be a lieutenant and work for the uniform and do some great work and these brilliant clinicians that work there then after a few years they're out we've got to have people who were not just at the dawn of their career but the people there i mean so that's also my recruitment some of you have something going on teaching martial a beautiful market but uh but also recognize that it is something that we're going to have to continue to make sure we have the funding in the budgets to make sure we have the treatment personnel there and work more with civilian groups to understand them let me lay this out it is in our best interest to learn about those things but it's also my best interest not to treat in an area you're not qualified for it just as i recognize in my work before dealing with children with a wide range of problems i also know there's some areas that was not a purpose when you treat them that's a professional advocacy and i remind people that look if you have feelings against the wars that you have not willing to take the time to learn about a lot of aspects the military jargon as one soldier told me the third time i have to explain to this therapist but an imran was i knew it was time to take a ride or if the person wasn't even going to understand this but what the good news is there's a lot of extra training out there continuing education credits a lot of people are dedicated learning stuff good keep keep doing it but when it comes to children your efforts to continue to focus and make sure we're out there doing the right thing giving guidance to congress what we can be doing a long way to facilitate it that is so important when you're dealing with a 16 trillion dollar debt there's a lot of people saying we've got to make cuts and yes we've got to make serious cuts so the explanations you have while you're here is how you continue to fund things and saves money let me leave you with this lesson how this it works we have to rely on something called the congressional budget office when bills come through and they tell us if they're going to cost i know this is an ongoing frustration of course your congressman people say oh well let me do this it's going to cost money right just even though we know early treatment saves money congressional budget office calls that dynamic scoring they said you can't prove it's going to save money so we're going to say it's cost so you have to compartment lots of research on lots of studies to say this is how it actually saves money this is how we should show you this is worthwhile spending with the return of two to one three to one now it's our job that that raised minds out to say okay we have to somehow convince colleagues about the congressional budget office they still come back and say no spending we can't prove it's going to save money we have to really be well armed with great research to help help us together on that that's our mission all right let's keep working together let's get these things done with this country let's think of our next generation and thank now i'd like to welcome you youth advocate jordan and that's kind of what my story is um maya storage coasters in middle school um up until then i had been uh very happy and uh i played sports and i had friends and i was really energetic and enthusiastic and you know wanted to be an archaeologist and jacob and all and it was just a very very panel experience and then i got into middle school and i i didn't change the same way that my hands changed and i started with i received sexual orientation everything when i became a kid i didn't want to talk to her and it got worse and more source and i i swear stops started using post sport until finally they got to school to change to change locations so so i moved to a school about 10 minutes away that i didn't know it which actually was a lot better the there was no way i could talk to anybody and i was when i first started depressed you know i guess even all day long just being away all night i didn't want to do anything wrong but the school didn't want to do it because it was very smart always this is really high and early in school and uh so i set up my mental health issues for competing for schoolwork it got bad enough that at the end of my three years they changed all my medications i learned about self-injury and then i left a week later with like on medications and by time i entered high school the next year i was um started a school where i still had no services um because i was intelligent so i would probably do services and i didn't put on a medication that made me gain over the course of the next two years or so 120 hours makes you through your hours because it's on the kitchen so and then so then so i get to go to the doctor and help me tell me that exercise with a couple um kids and i can't talk to anybody because i'm too terrible i would go weeks without talking to anybody at school and try to put myself to um to have about 60s but it actually helped i started feeling whether um one of the big problems was that i had a character school i had a therapist involved in writing a psychiatrist no one actually talked no one really coordinated so it was almost it was just coming across and i didn't know how to deal with things how to deal with being bullied there's actually a very good set of very good psychiatrists and teachers and people would actually talk for once and uh and i had one student plan and i started to do a lot better and i actually got in high school and then i graduated and after i graduated was gone and the plan was gotten smart so i'm going to go to college and i was in this thing that a halfway house um kind of it was an athletic program for transgender and things just got more scarce and then about a year later i started coming again but when i first went in my parents finally like you know you need to move you need to fix and spring road which is a hospital that basically when you go there you're very cool and and yeah i came from a normal top normal other school experience i have loving family i i'm intelligent you know i had friends i played soccer and and here i am 18 and a half and about to be sent to a lifelong institution amazing what um um i was trying to get better and the question i get asked anything else you know that i haven't seen what happened what talked what changed and there were really two things and her job was really just kind of like was just the case stuff but she became she became a kind of a blender and she was that one person that was me to my institution to my therapist as well as my psychiatrist how that affected me but i wasn't i didn't know that i was a bad person that i had that i had these which is huge but really that wasn't really an option and the president that i graduated from we have 40 students and when i say that i am not i'm not the rule i'm the exception as far as getting better before these services i wouldn't because out of all of people who i know who graduated i know five that are pregnant i got ready with the year of evening i know several that are detailing several that are dead we have several that are still necessary for us and these are kids who are like me who i mean like not means successfully came from like much better environments but uh a lot of interest at night you know like smart kids that could have done amazing things and and could be here standing where i am speaking to you but they are because i kind of lucked out that i got those that extra support later and i mean it does it it saves lives and it helps it gives it gives someone a chance to get better and to do what they're meant to do and i mean i'm doing everything with the creation now i've been doing various i've i've worked actively i've testified in minneapolis i'm trying to go to major in college because it makes we had time degrees questions but it's 10 o'clock and the next group has to come in but you all heard some excellent information today about trauma about mental health and their services that help children have these issues so i really do hope that you'll answer congressman napolitano and congresswoman congressman murphy's call to continue to support these programs thank you i neglected to introduce my staff actually does all the work and i took the credit honey i love you already nathan is our communications director but thank you all of you but clearly the message that my colleague said get to know your member of congress talk to them inform them and educate them because if you don't then it makes our jobs harder because there is no money that anybody wants to put out unless there's somebody pushing thank you very much

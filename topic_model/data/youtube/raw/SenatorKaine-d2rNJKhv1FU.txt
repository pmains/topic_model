for some more congressional perspective we're now joined by Republican senator saxby chambliss who was in st. Simons Island Georgia and Virginia a Democratic senator Tim Kaine who joins us from Richmond senator Kaine I'd like to start with you if this vote were held tomorrow would it pass and would you support it sir major I think if we have this vote I am confident that Congress will rally behind the important principle that the use of chemical weapons violating an international norm that's been in place since the 1920s is unacceptable and that we need to engage in action even military action with international allies to stop it so I believe when that case is made and it's not only made two congressmen to the American public I believe that we will rally behind the principle that use of chemical weapons is wrong and it can't go unpunished senator Chambliss do you agree and what are the ramifications you fear most about an authorization that leads to a military strike in Syria well first of all I'm glad we're going to have this debate in Congress I was supportive of the president take in the early action but he hasn't done that and now that it's been delayed as much I think that Congress does have a role to play years the debate should be interesting but here's the problem that I see major john mccain just said he's absolutely right the president has an obligation to make his case to the congress but he also has an obligation to make this case that the American people my constituents are war-weary they don't want to see us get involved in this for the last two years the policy of the administration has been regime change several weeks ago that changed to trying to tilt the balance more in favor of the opposition now if you read this resolution that was sent by the White House to the speaker yesterday it seems that that policy has changed again and the military action is being asked to deter further use of chemical weapons so the president has an obligation to make his case he has not made that case at this point in time and the debate in Congress is going to be really interesting senator Kaine do you believe there is a coherent strategy before the American public and if not you believe the president is obligated to go before the American public in something akin to an oval office address explain not only the history but the motives and the likely outcome of a engagement in Syria major that's exactly why the president's decision to come before Congress's is so powerful and I'm so happy that he's done it because how does the American public get educated the best way to educate the American public about a matter like this is to have that full debate in Congress that the framers of the Constitution intended they intended that before or when the nation initiates military action it should be with the approval of Congress that's in the Constitution but it reflects a very important judgment as well and that is this we should not be sending servicemen and women into military conflict if they don't have complete confidence that the nation's political leadership is behind them and so what this debate in Congress will do is it will educate the American public about the important principles at stake against use of chemical weapons and it will help them understand and help Congress come to a consensus about what needs to be done I agree with secretary Kerry we are strong when we act together but we are when we r divided if the president were to do something without congressional support it's just not fair to the men and women we ask to fight our battles to send them in not knowing whether the American public or Congress backs a month secane are Virginians as senator saxby chambliss just said as Georgians war-weary and you think there really is anything conceptually valid in the assertion that there can be a limited military engagement in Syria major my citizens Virginia is so connected to the military you know whether the active-duty populations all the military leadership at the Pentagon you know we've got ships based out of Norfolk that are already on station in the Middle East and more likely to go we are very connected to the military and ensure after 12 years of war post 9-11 folks do have a sense of fatigue and even a sense of skepticism about assertions with regard to you know presence of weapons of mass destruction and that puts a burden on Congress's shoulder and the president's as well to make the case this is a challenge you know I have been maintaining we need to update the War Powers Act of 1973 because we've gotten sloppy in this the president's often overreach in Congress often wants to evade responsibility evade votes rather than accept the consequences I think this could be a very historic and important debate and again if we can reach a consensus we will be much stronger as a nation and the likelihood of success of our actions will be will be I think right senator Chambliss Secretary of State said the credibility of the American government is on the line has this been a credible week for President Obama as a commander in chief well I'm afraid that what is shown is there is weakness there and you know the world is watching our allies how would you define that weakness centers our adversaries well I think the weakness is that he said again yesterday I'm going to take military action well the world is saying you know your predecessors whether it was Bill Clinton Ronald Reagan we could go back even further when something like this has happened and the national security of the United States has been put at risk then presidency in a time of crisis presidents make tough hard decisions and they lead and there's weakness here on the part of the president so I think it's not been a good week for him but he's made this decision to come to Congress and it's going to be a very very tough debate and going back to your question of whether or not it can pass I would say if the President cannot make his case to Congress then it's not going to pass he's got to come out and really be in depth with respect to the intelligence that we know is out there he's got to be in depth with respect to what type of military action is going to be taken and what is our current strategy and how does a military strike impact that particular strategy senator chambliss you'll have the last word senator Kaine senator Chambliss thank you very much we'll be back in one minute with the report from Syria thanks major

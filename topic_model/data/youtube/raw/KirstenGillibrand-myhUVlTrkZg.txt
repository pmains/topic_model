we are particularly pleased that senator gillibrand has come to john jay this morning today you have demonstrated your commitment to public safety by announcing legislation designed to create an effective federal response to the deadly practice of gun trafficking in america so i'm honored to present to you senator gillibrand one challenge that is always at the forefront for me is how do we keep our children and our families safe from terrorism to war to gun violence and the gangs this must be our top priority over the last several months i've been working closely with congresswoman mccarthy mayor bloomberg the brady campaign new yorkers against gun violence to author the first comprehensive legislation to crack down on illegal trafficking of guns and stop the flow of these illegal weapons into our communities now i want to recognize my colleague congressman carolyn mccarthy thank you for being here and thank you for your incredible life's work on this bill and other matters uh congresswoman carolyn mccarthy the senator mentioned that 70 percent of guns coming into our state are used in crime here in new york city 90 percent 90 percent of the guns that come into our city are used in crimes our voices need to be heard and we as a team are going to keep pushing until this country is safer than ever before mayor we just can't afford not to act not when we see a 15 year old girl shot in our streets and when our own soldiers are shot on american soil we've got to have the courage to stand up and i'm grateful that senator gilbran and congresswoman mccarthy are doing exactly that i'm pleased to welcome police commissioner kelly thank you very much senator the legislation proposed by senator gillibrand and congresswoman mccarthy and my judgment is truly life-saving this bill does not provide any new regulations on individuals who wish to sell or give firearms as a gift to law abiding family members friends or neighbors it creates an incentive to conduct a background check before the gun is exchanged these are exactly the kinds of solutions that we need to stop gun violence in our communities

thank you madam speaker i rise to offer an amendment to prevent price gouging and to lower fuel prices at the pump families across my home state of new hampshire are seeing gas prices rise higher and higher to an average of more than four dollars and 62 cents a gallon today yet while they confront tighter and tighter budgets oil companies continue to rake in record profits and pay out huge dividends to stockholders one oil ceo has observed that his company is quote a cash machine his peers would agree four of the largest big oil companies collectively made 27 billion dollars in profits during the first quarter alone this year and during testimony before the energy and commerce committee last month six big oil ceos refused to scale back stock buybacks and to help lower prices at the pump these companies would keep over charging consumers our families and our small businesses in order to keep generating higher and higher profits despite the fact that the price of crude oil fell over the past month the price consumers pay at the pump has continued to escalate markets are supposed to be responsive to supply and demand but in the face of renewed demand as we've gotten people vaccinated and reopened our businesses and gotten america back on track big oil would rather keep prices and profits high than to increase supply for families in my state the amendment that i'm offering today will enact legislation that i helped introduce along with congressman mike levin the transportation fuel market transparency act it will establish a new unit at the federal trade commission devoted to protecting the public interest by monitoring fuel markets to facilitate transparent and competitive market practices target fuel market manipulation and enable the ftc to hold bad actors accountable the fd ftc should be able to go after oil companies if they willfully inflate the price of gasoline or manipulate the market we must use every resource and every tool possible to address high costs for consumers it's unacceptable that while americans struggle and sacrifice oil and gas companies are maximizing profits and they're doing it at a time that we're recovering from a global pandemic and we're seeing a russian invasion of ukraine nothing is standing in the way of oil companies expanding production problem isn't government regulation the problem is big oil keeping supply artificially low and prices artificially high and americans have had enough we've got to do all we can to give our constituents the relief that they deserve and i urge my colleagues to support this common sense amendment and i reserve the balance of my time

joined Now by representative Jen kiggins of Virginia Beach Republican of Virginia thanks for joining us yeah thanks for having me tonight our initial reaction this is your first state of the union what was your reaction and what was it like being in the room it was awesome to be in a room I've only watched on television so to be in the room it was actually mind-blowing but I was actually surprised at how partisan the president was tonight I thought he could have acknowledged a little better that we have a new majority in the U.S House of Representatives and the American people have spoken and they spoke on a lot of issues that brought voters out in November and he simply didn't touch on them he really didn't talk much about the board he really didn't talk much about National Security and the Chinese threat and that was surprising I really thought there was a lot of empty promises a lot of words but no action uh you are a veteran uh you're also a nurse practitioner he spoke a lot about health care issues tonight what was your reaction especially from your experience in the medical field yeah so I'm a geriatric nurse practitioner so my patient population really realized Social Security Medicare these are important issues to them so I was really glad that he acknowledged that Republicans really want to look out for for those things we are not here to cut either of those items but you know there's a lot of room for Health Care Improvement especially nursing home reform you know a lot of just transparency and health care costs things that I would support as a healthcare provider so there's a lot of work to be done I can't wait to be an advocate for that patient population what about moving past the cap of putting a 35 cap on an insulin even for those outside of Medicare yeah I mean he was right insulin for those people who are diabetics that is an issue I have a lot of patients who struggle with with this really essential medication that they need on a daily basis so we have to work together to find partisan solutions that are fiscally conservative but but that we agreed that we can actually lower the price of not only insulin but a lot of our other Pharmaceuticals because you deal with older Americans a lot of strong reaction especially when the topics of Social Security and Medicare and their future came up what was your impression of that I was glad that the Republicans stood up and said hey no who what are you talking about you know you could hear us kind of in the background and we pushed back on him when he said there were Republicans out there that want to cut Social Security and Medicare we do not want to do that we've made that very clear tonight even on the sunset Visions which the president had brought up is that on the table at all those are my patients again I am not here to cut Social Security nor Medicare uh when it because your military background as well he said some things about the military it's supposed to be about our security what was your impression I really wish he would have focused more on our national security and the threats that are out there not just our Southern border which that's a humanitarian crisis that's a huge threat to our national security but also look at what happened last week he never even talked about the surveillance balloon that came from China that flew all across our country before we actually reacted on it China's watching out there and it's so important for me that our friends trust us and our enemies fear us we have to restore that American strength for our military this is representative Jen kagans of Virginia revenge of Virginia Virginia Beach she represents thanks for joining us tonight

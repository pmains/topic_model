me right now is iowa congresswoman and house budget committee member ashley henson congressman it's good to see you thank you so much for being here your thoughts on how this plays out are you expecting a vote the week of february 22nd well maria it's good to be with you this morning i think what i would say in general about this process is uh they're pushing this through with a process that doesn't provide full budget committee oversight we we haven't even had our first official meeting yet that's coming up later today so i'm disappointed that taxpayers didn't have a seat at the table through this budget reconciliation process to push through this 1.9 trillion dollar package and we're talking about a package that's filled with things like blue state bailouts 350 billion dollars going to states like california new york and illinois that have chronic budget mismanagement problems and i can tell you one thing i've been on the road here in iowa in my district um was out yesterday hearing from folks they don't want their tax dollars going to bail out these blue states and so i'm trying to make that very clear in my work on the budget committee well that's one portion of it the other portion of is this fight for 15 an hour right congresswoman i mean there's a new report from the congressional budget office that finds a substantial minimum wage increase to 15 will reduce the number of americans living in poverty but it will also cost 1.4 million jobs lost over the next four years your reaction to what you're hearing as your colleagues on the left push through 15 an hour yeah i think it's it's wrong for iowa it might be right for blue states like california new york and illinois where the cost of living is higher but in states like iowa and in iowa's first district where about half of the jobs here are small business jobs it would be a job killer um as you just referenced and a 15 minimum wage would mean hours cut jobs cut more automation and that's exactly what i'm hearing from business owners on the ground just yesterday i was at cubs auto in in grinnell iowa uh you talk about someone who's built their business from the ground up and wants to continue growing and building that business that would just stall that progress in a time when you know our businesses are already hurting they need that relief the ppp program and and things like that that are included in these bipartisan covet relief packages none of that is being talked about um in a bipartisan manner in this package that democrats are trying to push through right now so you've got spend tax and cancel as the three key words for the biden agenda spending we're looking at 1.9 trillion dollars right now probably going to go to a vote third week in february february 22nd is what i'm hearing next is revenue raise right what kind of tax increases are you expecting uh to be proposed from your colleagues and can you do anything to stop this well we're definitely going to be loud about this maria because honestly when you look at the budget reconciliation bill i went through it last week in my office and i can tell you i i couldn't believe when i was looking at the instructions to raise the deficit to these committees so when you're looking at the targets of how much they want to increase that deficit it's alarming and i think the only way that they're going to be able to pay for it and reconcile all that spending is to to look at tax increases so i'm going to do everything i can to fight against that we're hearing that they may be looking at the tax cuts and jobs act at repealing some of those provisions um again right now is not the time to be pulling the rug out from iowa small businesses and that's exactly in my mind what they're trying to do here and that's not right iowans are worried about getting that relief feeding their families and and that those kitchen table issues are really what is important and i think uh the folks in washington have lost sight of that so i'm going to be fighting the back against any tax increases i ran as a taxpayer advocate maria when i came to washington um back in the district i can tell you that i'm continuing to fight for taxpayers every day well look bernie sanders is the chairman of the the budget committee in the senate elizabeth warren is increasingly a very important voice she wants a wealth tax so these are some of the ways that they're talking about paying for this do you expect taxes to go higher this year given the fact that you're in the minority and can't stop it well i think that there are some uh reasonable folks out there in congress who hopefully will help me fight back in that you know our majority or our minority is almost a majority we're very close and so i think we'll be able to fight back against that and hopefully there will be some reasonable people who will say no to raising taxes we don't have a blank checkbook congressman we'll be watching thanks so much congresswoman ashley hinson

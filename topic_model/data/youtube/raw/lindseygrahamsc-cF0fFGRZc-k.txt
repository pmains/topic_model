get reaction to all of this from one of the administration's leading critics on Benghazi South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham senator thanks for being here let's start with your reaction to this day and that news conference well I think it's an insult to the intelligence of the American people inquired frankly a disservice and disrespect to those who sacrifice their life in service of their country to suggest that the goals in the email had nothing to do with four Dead Americans his offensive let me read the third one the goal to show that we will be resolute in bringing people harm Americans to justice nobody else was killed except in Benghazi so who were they trying to bring to justice if not the killer people in Benghazi so this one line clearly indicates that they were worried about the deaths of four Americans and to suggest that this whole email doesn't relate to the political problems associated with a failure in Benghazi is affront to my intelligence and a disrespect to those who died was this email classified and then Declassified this email was requested back in August from by a subpoena from the house it took a court case for us to get this a lot of it was redacted so now we know who was on the email chain it was the political shot they had a so Benghazi is a political problem seven weeks before an election and they formed a political answer the answer given about Benghazi by Susan Rice was the best available political answer and was disconnected from the facts there was no protest caused by video and we did not do all we could to secure facilities throughout the region including Benghazi Benghazi was a death trap they were successful they got away with changing the narrative from a coordinated terrorist attack to a protest caused by hateful video as you can imagine you mentioned politics there is some pushback from the other side Tommy Vitor the former NSC spokesman was on another channel he said this today unfortunately now we have another round of stories about basically nothing which is what the whole debate about the talking points has been all along speaking political motives Lindsey Graham is trying to fend off a tea party primary that's why he seized on this issue it's an open joke of his up on Capitol Hill people know why he's doing this so you know there's certainly politics and all of this your response my response is that if I am doing something wrong for political reasons I should have egg on my face and I should be punished by the people of South Carolina if what he is saying is a bold-faced lie and that I'm correct that this administration the truth from the American people about a coordinated terrorist attack because they will more worried about the president's reelection than telling the truth to the American people about why four people died they need to be held accountable what's next more witnesses in a new process how can you close the books on Benghazi until you call Ben Rhodes less call Ben Rhodes and heaven explained this email if it wasn't about the four Dead Americans why did you mention we're going to bring those people to justice with harm Americans and does Speaker Boehner because of all of this change his mind about an independent hope so the house has done generally a good job but the process has been disjointed I'm tired of five minute rounds of questioning or members of Congress been four minutes giving speeches I want to joint select committee so you can look at the CIA the State Department and DOD as one unit and I want a professional investigative team to get to the bottom of this you hear the critics not only Democrats there are some Republicans who say okay enough is enough it's time to move on we've got they've been up there they've answered all kinds of our questions and we didn't get what we wanted to get how do you respond to that what is the end game here eight on this particular effort 18 months after the tech not one person has been captured responsible for killing the Dead Americans 18 months after the attack we finally get an email that shows the White House created a narrative completely different than the intelligence there was no intelligence about a video there was no CIA report blaming the video causing a protest we now have the smoking gun so I would tell the American people 18 months later we're finally getting to the truth and thank God for an independent judiciary because this is a damning email and if it were not for a court you would never know about this to the American people 61 percent believe they're being misled this positive that right after the attack three days after the attack they did not give a damn about the intelligence they wanted to create a political narrative to protect the President and I think most Americans find that offensive and I'm not going to stop into somebody's held accountable for allowing it to be a death trap somebody be fired for not coming to the aid of these people for nine and a half hours and somebody ought to be fired for lying to the American people and I don't believe Ben Rhodes did this by himself somebody in the White House higher up than him in my view concocted this story because they were worried about the re-election not telling the truth and when Susan Rice said I have no regrets I gave the American people the best evidence available that's a bald-faced lie the politics here does it affect Republicans to continue down this road you know when I wanted to get to the bottom of Gitmo I was a hero when I challenged the torture policies of the Bush administration because I've been a military lawyer I was doing the country or service you've got Americans in harm's way as I speak tonight many of them in uniform and throughout the Foreign Service feel like that they've been let down by their government and the colleagues that serve their country that their death has been dishonored and what happened was was distorted for political reasons if for no other reason somebody needs to be held accountable about lying about how those who died what does it matter senator Clinton Secretary Clinton excuse me the difference between a coordinated terrorist attack that you should have planned for closing the consulate rather than keeping it open does matter the difference between the spontaneous event a rise of terrorism a broader foreign policy failure is substantial you cannot let these people get away with this any more than you could let Richard Nixon get away with what he did

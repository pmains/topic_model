welcome to another edition of talk of the town with Justine wet track that's me I'm the director of news and information here at radio works join me each tuesday at twelve-thirty on am 7 30 k w/oa as i talked with local experts and officials on crime courts emergency management and everyday safety any kind of public issues going on in the area that has people talking in your town I'm talking today to Jim Hagedorn he is he was a Republican Party's 2014 congressional boy everything you just did so what you did so wonderful he is already announced his candidacy for the first first congressional district in here in Minnesota and I am so happy to have you here today so thank you for joining me well thanks for the opportunity Justine oh you're very welcome you're already making the rounds you've well yeah we announced last week that back in the race here for Congress in the first District and we did run in 2014 we achieved 45.7 percent of the vote against congressman Walz which was the highest percentage vote so far that any challengers received i'll be the first republican to try to go back to back against him and you know there's some precedent for that here in Minnesota congressman climb up in the 2nd district congressman Peterson they actually were on the ballot three times before they were elected and sometimes you get these big districts and it takes a while to get your name out there it takes a while to build your organization and to attract them the financial resources in order to wage a campaign against incumbent and we're going to give it 18 months and give it everything we have to take back the seat for the Republican Party well you you did very well I think your name is is very recognizable you you have certainly been Oh talking to a lot of people shaking a lot of hands we we see here your face all over the place so and well that's what a thing I see a really great and the liberals don't like that but what we did in the last campaign is we we worked real hard to do the main street campaigning is what we call it other people would say retail politics get out meet people on Main Street shake hands answer people's questions and just kind of crisscross the district and try to get knowing that way we were outspent 621 in the race against congressman Walz and you know I want a late primary in August and we only had ten weeks for the general election so under those circumstances I think we we did very well and we're in a excellent position to continue building from that campaign to it to finish the job here in 2016 well i know that i can say that there was a lot of people that told me personally oh yeah I met him and I think that's something that's really worth saying because I don't know that a lot of other people that are running for office would have that be said about them well you know like when we started the race last time I told folks we were going to spend an enormous amount of time shaking Hanson we took about 75,000 hands in there and thought I am and we wouldn't meet people at county fairs and parades and they said they I saw you two three times and I said well I'm just going to keep approaching you until your vote for me but yeah my philosophy is this if you want to represent people of southern Minnesota in the Congress in Washington is a very important job but you have to represent reviews best thing you can do is get to know them before you get there and then I think try to stay in touch with them after you're there and one difference i have with congressman walz is that you know he's it's been six years since he had a town hall where he fielded questions from people on whatever subject they wanted to talk about and I think you need to be accessible to the people you represent absolutely now what are some of the things that you I feel like I've talked to you so many times that I don't know where to start um what are some of the things that you feel are some of the the most important issues not even going forward some of the ones in the past that have that have come up maybe maybe where you and mr. Walz differ well we differ on virtually everything actually they're very very few that's a very few issues where we where we agree but that I think the defining issues of this campaign this is this is a very important election you'll have a presidential campaign which is going to you're going to have a Republican and Democrat looks like mrs. Clinton and then a whole bunch of Republicans but there's going to be a big difference of opinion as to which way the country should go should we continue to follow this big government hi regulation approach to the economy that that President Obama has the son that the policies that congressman walz supportive or should we get back to more free enterprise you know capitalism with less regulation and more opportunity for people to invest their capital expense that will be a big difference it also going to be a big difference on foreign policy we've we've seen some problems in the Middle East arise here under the President Obama under the policies of congressman Walz has supported it's a sad deal but the Middle East and North Africa there in chaos the Muslim extremists are rising up the Christians are being slaughtered us prestige out the door I think we need to get back to more of a peace through strength policy and one in which we defend the United States of America's borders and protect the country from people coming here from other countries we need to screen properly we're not doing that and we've seen under unfortunately the policies of President Obama that Minnesota has become a terrorist recruiting haven and that's his own US attorney said that so those are two key issues foreign policy the economy I think defending agriculture and farmers here in southern Minnesota or rural way of life is very important and then our values and on all these points we can we can talk about it in death but the congressman and I have different philosophies and viewpoints and and I certainly would represent the people differently than him boy there really are going to be a lot of changes coming up in this election aren't there with with with it being a presidential election year and it's really hard to know what's going to happen from here on out well the people of the country are going to have an opportunity to to make a big change or to continue what's going on and I mean if you look at the economy I don't know too many people who really believe that this is a strong economy right now economic growth is stagnant I think it was point zero two percent in the last quarter we have the lowest job force participation since Jimmy Carter and you know Jimmy Carter gave us an economic plague of biblical proportions that's not something we want to emulate wagers are flat and it's really difficult for people to get ahead because their disposable income is shrinking with higher and higher costs and I believe a lot of the problems are there's just too much government in in the marketplace there's too many regulations too many big government programs and the tax code needs to be updated and so if we need to kind of weed out that extra government give people an opportunity to use their capital try to get people to invest in their businesses to grow business or expand business and help people get higher paying good good jobs and right now I think the country is on the wrong track and we need to get back to what works how do you go about weeding out extra government well a couple of things one is these big government programs like Obamacare I really believe that you can sort of track the downward trend in the economy especially with people being forced out of full-time labour full-time jobs too when Obamacare was first implemented and it's costing business and costing people a lot of money they talk to people all the time especially in the last campaign a young lady from albert lee who said that she's now working two part-time jobs working more hours and making less money because of obamacare and they have a limitation under obamacare work if you have more than 50 employees working full-time it kicks in and it hurts businesses so a lot of businesses won't hire people full-time labour but another way that you kind of weed out the government the excessive government in in the economy is through regulatory reform right now the Obama administration is being very aggressive in implementing big government regulations especially out of the EPA but other agencies as well that are dominating industries were destroyed the coal industry in six years we're putting a lot a lot of regulations on farmers and on small business and I saw one statistic where regulations out of Washington are costing manufacturing companies in the United States upwards of thirty thousand dollars per employee that's a lot of money to be pulling out of the economy to comply with federal regulations a lot of which are excessive so we need the Congress to start making the decisions as to whether or not regulations go in the place not these executive regulatory agencies like EPA that our honor control so I would be for regulatory reform congressman Walz has voted against that concept time and again and he supports that type of big government stuff that Obama's doing the economy all right this is Justine Wetterich you're listening to talk of the town on kwo a and my guest today is Republican Jim Hagedorn who announced his candidacy last week for Congress in Minnesota's first District we'll be right back after this break

uh mr chair i after listening to the discussion i thought mr massey got closest to what probably should be the discussion about this bill and you know i spent years in the army reserves 27 years i've assembled and disassembled an m16 probably a hundred times mainly for the purposes of cleaning cleaning the weapon i've also owned rifles shotguns revolvers nine millimeters i still do um the problem is the nomenclature and the way that this is described it's it's very murky and if that isn't fixed i don't think this bill is worth the paper it's written on because what you're going to do is once again cause confusion we've seen this before with the previous assault weapon ban because of the way it's named and it's cosmetic differences is the best way to describe it a pistol grip on an ar-15 and and the stock of any 280 winchester the difference is really going to be related to the nuances of the way the gun is put together the way it's assembled so it's the first point i wanted to make i thought that mr massey was doing a good job of demonstrating that assault weapon is is a term um certainly weapons of war is is uh you know used on a regular basis to generate a reaction i believe so that was the first point i wanted to make i think that mr massey's on the right track the second thing is there's been a lot of discussion on our side of the aisle as well as the other about personal protection but the fact of the matter is in my state in the state of wisconsin and maybe you're not even aware of this but there is a culture of hunting sportsmen and probably the best example is deer hunting over a nine-day gun hunt in the state of wisconsin which is a family tradition generation after generation after generation come together for those nine days there's a deer camp that's set up somewhere typical anywhere in wisconsin i have 80 acres we have a deer stand right in the backyard and we sit out there for nine days the the thing you don't understand is there are 530 000 licenses sold for those nine days do you hear that 530 000 deer hunting licenses and they all go out in the woods and they're everywhere and every one of these individuals either has a rifle or a 12 gauge okay there's no like mass hysteria during that period of time but i think it's just it's a gap the people that aren't around guns aren't familiar with guns it's not part of their own personal culture they don't understand it they look at a gun sitting on the table and they think danger there are many many many americans that don't feel that way at all about a gun on the table so you've got a bill that's been drafted that i think misses the mark on the description by far and the second part is the people that aren't in this room are the people that are part of this culture and it's not about personal protection for the most part they're sportsmen they hunt pheasant they hunt whitetails they hunt ducks and they are the ones who are saying why are you going to infringe on my second amendment rights i've done nothing wrong i've done nothing wrong i'm a responsible gun owner in america that uses it for a very specific purpose and in wisconsin it's hunting and yet you're going to take away my rights because of somebody that's absolutely psychotic and needed a mental evaluation that was never done prior to a mass shooting there's got to be a better way of doing this and i would hope that this committee would continue to explore what that is instead of just throwing out a piece of legislation and saying this is going to fix this because you know what the problem is you're fooling everybody including the people in this room this is not going to fix the problem it was tried once before and was unsuccessful and if it's tried again today it's going to have the same result and i yield that jim

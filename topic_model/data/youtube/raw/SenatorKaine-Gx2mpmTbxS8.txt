now for the interview tonight is Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia senator Kaine it's really nice to have you here thanks for being with us tonight great to be back Rachel so you intimated in these remarks about Merrick garland that the Senate may not be proceeding with holding hearings on his nomination because of basically a fundamental disrespect for President Obama sort of D legitimizing him as a president what were you getting out there Rachel I I think that's a very serious concern the the rationale that the Republicans use we want to wait till the next president and let the people decide is what we call in civil rights and I used to try civil rights cases a complete pretext that's not the way it's been done in the past the Constitution doesn't take away a president or a Senate's powers in the final year of a presidential term and so they're doing something with this president that they've never done with the 43 presidents that preceded him my my parishioners and my church my neighbors my friends in Virginia they look at it either it's got to be an attack on the nominee but we know that's not the case because they announced the blockade before garland was even nominated an attack on the legitimacy of the president or an attack on legitimacy of the court there's a lot of learn that this president's nominee has been given has been given second-class treatment not because of the nominee but because of the because of the character of the President himself and that is very very painful for people to contemplate about the nation's first african-american president that they wouldn't pay him the respect of having a hearing and having a vote on a nominee in the way they've done with with other presidents do you think so this is a very very painful perception that's being left by the actions of the Senate especially in the case of a Supreme Court nomination where the court says equal justice under law engraved in stone over the entry into the Court itself I'm sorry to have interrupted you there sir what I was going to ask is raising the issue of this being the first african-american president that issue of legitimacy do you think that is the through line that explains the way Republicans and the conservative movement have treated President Obama do you do you think fundamentally it is about race that there's a racial element to the resistance to him that people should be more explicit in discussing Rachel there is an attack on his legitimacy that I think is just fundamentally different than what's come before you can attack him on his policies I have argued with the president over this unauthorized war but look they met to decide right when he was inaugurated that they their their success was going to be trying to stop him from being reelected you've seen a congressman shout you lie to him on the floor of Congress you've seen people questioned whether he was born in the United States question is faith question is patriotism as you recently pointed out the president sent up a budget this year and neither Budget Committee in either house and I'm on the senate budget committee would even have a hearing to discuss the president submitted budget which has never happened since the Budget Control Act was passed in 1974 and now they're treating his supreme court nominee in a manner fundamentally different than they've treated any other presidents before and so this is a deep concern of an awful lot of people there is another explanation at a psychologist there is another explanation and that it's a it's an attack on the court itself just like FDR didn't like what the court was doing and so he tried to take a nine-member court and expand it statutorily it's been set at nine justices since 1869 you could look at what the Republicans are doing here and saying they're artificially trying to maintain a vacancy at eight rather than nine to artificially shrink the court and weaken it for more than a year in order to get what they want I think it's one of those two explanations either it's a fundamental attack on the legitimacy of the president or it's an attack on the Independence of the judiciary and neither make me feel too good what did you make today when the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump released a list today of 11 possible Supreme Court pics of his own I wonder what you think either of who's on the list or about the fact that he has released this list well I think you know what I'm glad he's released at Rachel because I think what we're going to be able to do in this presidential campaign and Secretary Clinton I'm confident will be the nominee will be able to talk about the cases that the court has before as cases dealing with access to health care for women image raishin writes the president's proposal to deal with climate change collective bargaining the civil rights for example voting rights cases are before the court and in in presidential campaigns usually the court is kind of theoretical who might you a point in the future but right now we have a vacancy the courts already dead like three or four times this vacancy is going to cause problems and we're going to get a chance to talk about what a Hillary Clinton appointee would do in these fundamental questions and what these 11 individuals who do I haven't researched him enough to know how to predict that but i have a feeling based on everything I've heard from Canada Trump about the way he would approach the court that we're going to see stark differences that will really matter to the American public

all right now to emit survive it's taken off in Louisiana it is one of the Senate races that everyone is watching this one's going to be a barn burner Republican congressman Bill Cassidy now challenging democratic and government Mary Landrieu to bypass the president pass the Keystone pipeline the house is already putting a bill in place to do just that now we have made repeated attempts to get senator Landrieu on help Springs the journal that might happen in the meantime congressman Cassidy with us now so congressman first have you gotten a response to the senator is whether she would support this effort to bypass the President and vote for opening up the pipeline so only indirectly she is supporting a non-binding resolution so I gather do be voted on by the Senate of course the operative term is non-binding well what is it what's the resolution in the Senate that somehow the their non-binding resolution the Senate favors construction of the Keystone XL pipeline now a non-binding resolution does nothing to create jobs for 20,000 Americans and those nothing to bring that energy to the coast for to be refined into products which the rest use I'm not sure non-binding does much of anything but what it does give you the opportunity have your cake and eat it too which I've always told us a stupid expression congressman because you're going to add the cake and what is a week for damn thing but having said that I'm wondering a lender is playing a very fine line here right i mean it's important for jobs in your state and elsewhere and jobs in general but the fear is that environmentalists and those concerned about another Gulf type disaster get ticked off are you afraid about taking that group off if you say first let's make it clear it is environmentally better to ship it by pipeline down to the coast where on the Gulf Coast using American environmental standards it will be refined into usable products it is environmentally more harmful to pipe it to the Pacific Coast ship at the canada so that they can refine that with lacks environmental standards and that stuff blow over to us so i would say it is the environmental sound thing to ship it by pipe down to the Gulf and I don't have problems with that we have some of the safest pipelines in the world in the United States but you know Congress and I had darryl hanah here yesterday at Fox Business Network which if you don't get you should demand and she was pointing out to me she's a big environmentalist as you know let's change yourself to the White House fence and protested opening up the Keystone she said that did we don't even want this little we would put it on the market and sell it abroad and and and she immediately said then what's all the fuss for I reminded her that if the Europeans had another option rather than depending on Russia for its energy that would be a very big reason but nevertheless they're saying that that it's isn't about jobs this is about oil companies getting richer you say what so the State Department said there'll be 20,000 direct jobs that will be created by this these are working class jobs people with better wages and better benefits whose children will go to better schools and whose future for that family will be brighter for Daryl Hannah to kind of minimize the impact upon those families is a show incredible insensitivity to a group of Americans who are having a very hard time now she can fuss with the State Department it's the State Department that says this is about at least 20,000 direct jobs congressman good seeing you again senator Lee group you're watching it's that is watching you're always invited on in the meantime

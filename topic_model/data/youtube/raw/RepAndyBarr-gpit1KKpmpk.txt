you mr speaker after a divisive election season allegations of election fraud objections to the electoral college and impeachment a friend of mine on the other side of the aisle recently asked what would it take to unify our country my answer is that certainly not this legislation which from my standpoint is the most divisive unconstitutional and destructive piece of legislation in my time in congress they call it the for the people act but it should be call for the politicians act because it would force taxpayers to fund political campaigns including the campaigns of politicians with whom those taxpayers disagree maybe a better name would be the election power grab act because it would normalize the chaos uncertainty and irregularities surrounding mail and voting in the 2020 election by centralizing the administration of elections in washington d.c commandeering states to permanently expand mail and voting without safeguards legalize bowed harvesting disregard voter id laws permit same-day voter registration without citizenship verification among other egregious measures mr speaker election laws should make it easy to vote and hard to cheat but this bill would not only make it easy to cheat it would effectively make it legal to cheat and at a time when half of americans have lost confidence in the integrity of our elections this bill will only drive distrust and division higher for the sake of ending division in our country i urge my colleagues to vote no on this power grab of our elections and i yield back

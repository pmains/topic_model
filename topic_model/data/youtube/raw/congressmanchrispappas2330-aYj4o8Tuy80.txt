is representative pappas online i am here there you are we'll go to you next uh representative pappas terrific well thank you very much uh mr secretary it's great to be with you and i think as you can see from this hearing today conversation around infrastructure is a marathon and not a sprint and we appreciate your endurance here it's going to take some more to get things over the finish line but we appreciate your commitment and uh really appreciate the exchange of ideas here now i know a lot of folks have been highlighting local issues one i want to bring up to your attention is a critical project in my district you may be familiar with it uh based on your time here in new hampshire it's the capital corridor rail project which would extend commuter rail from massachusetts to nashua and manchester new hampshire and when you talk to our business community about where they're building new headquarters or looking to expand when you talk to workers who are looking to put down routes and start their careers one of the top things that they're all looking for is access to public transportation and particularly rail access so i think that it's critically important that we look to support projects like this our state dot is right now working on preliminary design and financial planning for the project uh they would seek to access new start funding which can be a challenging process certainly for states to navigate one of the concerns that i have around this particular program is just the unknowns around commuting patterns after covid19 whether or not that could add a wrinkle to projects being able to move forward under new start i certainly don't want to see any temporary changes in patterns that are caused by covet 19 to slow down or stop a project that's going to be so crucial to the long-term economic vitality of um a region like the one that i'm from so i'm just wondering if the administration has considered whether any changes to new starts would be appropriate or needed uh to ensure that worthwhile projects like this one in particular isn't going to be halted because of any uncertainties that have arisen around coven yeah we certainly want to make sure that uh there isn't disruption to worthy projects uh and especially those that are uh uh so far along in in the design and vision process uh so uh we're gonna make sure through the relevant agencies fda in this case that there's a close pattern of working with applicants to to see how those impacts might have arisen due to covet and do everything we can to keep good projects on track well terrific and one other thing i wanted to highlight and i hear it a lot from my cities and towns and communities that uh either are looking to create local or regional networks of bike and pedestrian infrastructure it's just the lack of a dedicated funding program that can support not just doing a sidewalk or doing a rail trail but to really build out some really significant networks that could help drive a local economy increase tourism promote recreation and get some cars off the roads i think um you're probably aware that uh half of american uh trips that people make in uh their daily uh life are within a 20-minute bicycle ride and nearly a quarter of uh all trips that people make are within a 20-minute walk so by dedicating some additional funding to active transportation i think we can really help create communities with amenities that are walkable and bikeable that are have connectivity to one another and i'm hoping that you would take a look at our uh connecting america's active transportation systems uh it's a 500 million dollar dedicated uh program that uh congressman huffman and i are hoping to reintroduce in this congress and hoping to incorporate in an infrastructure package and just wondering in the remaining time we have if you have any thoughts around active transportation and its role in an overall infrastructure package well thank you for your vision initiative on this because this is absolutely part of what it means to improve transportation in the 21st century uh you know this would the importance of active transportation was i think poorly understood in the 1950s when uh the the last time we really had an opportunity to think this big around infrastructure but this time around we know a lot of things that that were less well understood then that vehicle transportation has a role but that there are congestion mitigation benefits health benefits environmental benefits and community benefits to active transportation that under the right conditions it can be done in all kinds of climate as people of new hampshire have demonstrated and as countries around the world in very northern climates have been able to demonstrate with actions that have moved them frankly further ahead than where the u.s is right now so this absolutely has to be part of a meaningful vision for the future of surface transportation and would welcome ways to incorporate that in forthcoming legislation

hello everybody Anthony is also here with another weekly update this woman from the Western Reserve National Cemetery in Seville and so busy week back in the district these are almost like big movies handful of things that we did whatever we're all we try to basically visit with as many constituents and businesses assumedly possible so that's the walk with us but three sort of highlights that I want to mention number one here at the Western Reserve Cemetery so our first bill that was signed into law a sustainable sabbatical process and as you've heard we talked about before the idea behind that bill came directly from this cemetery and a lawyer who had talked about before and so we wanted to come here via the leadership team that would also restore the cemetery and you kind of see the fruits of our labor so very excited to be here always always look like that an honor to be at this Cemetery so that was number one number two also the veterans front we had another one of our medal ceremonies the Maps Museum if you haven't been there you should go it's amazing they have holes to again historical aircraft how many different items that you can look at and read about the great veterans in our area I think community that we've presented awards or medals to over six veterans we had a Purple Heart recipient round star and all different types of folks so just a testament to how strong our veteran community is here and how lucky we are to have heroes living into the most our community very humble people don't typically talk about their services of just amazing folks and so that was an honor my favorite things as members just to do those and then lastly we had a roundtable on a suicide mission in particular you've seen sites so there's been an 80% increase in these suicides in the last decade in our country for those down at Stark County this is hit hard in 2017 I where we had a rash of suicides that our youth community happened that one recently and so I introduced a bill that I'm hoping to get through the house this week but it's already passed on committee which would help fight that by providing research that the more dollars to understand the issue so that we can come back and obviously an enormous issue that can't imagine with the pain for community the family of students but we had a great round table we had providers we have the medical community and we had survivors families who had loved ones particular life and and we also have community leaders around the table and so the good news is I think our our community is committed to doing everything we can the sort of contagion that happened at the start was largely ended your always vigilant obviously but but I think the progress that we've made is really important and my hope for this roundtable was that you know we have a start with one bill but that hopefully and we can take the ideas out of it and really come forward with some more ideas in Congress to make sure that this doesn't happen that we can reverse what is a very alarming trend right now so that's it for this weekly update as Louis thank you for having to be a representative Thanks

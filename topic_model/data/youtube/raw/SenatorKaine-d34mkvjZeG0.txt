 SLAM] >> SECRETARY BLINKEN, THINK YOU FOR THE TIME YOU SPENT TODAY. IT IS AN IMPORTANT HEARING AND THERE WILL BE MANY MORE. I'M GOING TO A SECOND ONE IN ARMS SERVICES COMMITTEE. I WILL SPEAK FROM THE HEART TO SIGN -- PART TO SET OUT WHAT I'M THINKING AT A COMPLICATED MOMENT. I'M THE FATHER OF A MARINE, I COME FROM A STATE THAT IS VERY HEAVILY AFFECTED BY THE WAR OF THE LAST 20 YEARS, ONE OF THE STATES ATTACKED ON 9/11. IN THE WEEKS OF AUGUST IN EARLY SEPTEMBER, THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT I'VE DONE. I'VE WATCHED AFGHANISTAN ON TELEVISION, TALKED TO ACTIVE-DUTY VETERANS, TALKED TO YOU AND OTHER COLLEAGUES, I HAVE VISITED THE PENTAGON FOR THE PENTAGON EMPLOYEES COMMEMORATION OF THE 9/11 ATTACK, I WENT TO ARLINGTON ON 9/11 TO GO TO THE FIRE STATION WHERE THE RELIEF EFFORT WAS SPEARHEADED, I HAVE ALSO GONE TO FORT LEE AS YOU HAVE TO SEE THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE TO HELP AFGHANS WHO HAVE STOOD WITH US, INTEGRATE INTO AMERICAN LIFE BY THE EXPO CENTER TO SEE THESE FAMILIES TRAVELING HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD STILL TRAUMATIZED BUT LOOKING FORWARD TO A CHAPTER WHERE THEY CAN BE FREE. I HAVE A LOT OF EMOTIONS. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE. THEY ARE SADNESS AND ANGER AND PRIDE AND RELEASE. SADNESS. I AM SADDENED BY THE UNNECESSARY DEATHS OF THE 3000 OR SO WHO WERE KILLED ON 9/11. I'M SADDENED BY THE DEATHS OF MORE THAN 7000 U.S. TROOPS, I'M SADDENED BY THE DEATHS OF MORE THAN 8000 AMERICAN CONTRACTORS. I DOUBT THERE HAS BEEN A WAR IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES WERE MORE CONTRACTORS DIED THEN TROOPS, BUT THIS GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR IS ONE SUCH WAR. I'M SADDENED DEATHS OF 400,000 INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN OUR ROCK, AFGHANISTAN, AND SYRIA -- IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN, AND SYRIA. I'M SAD FOR THOSE THAT HAVE TO LIVE UNDER TALIBAN RULE. I'M SAD FOR THE FAMILIES OF THE 13 TROOPS KILLED. TO LOSE A CHILD IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IS HORRIBLE. WAR IS HORRIBLE. IN THE LAST DAYS OF WAR, IN THE LAST DAYS OF WAR THAT HAVE BEEN DECLARED OVER AND IS WINDING DOWN, I DO NOT KNOW HOW THAT WOUND COULD EVER HEAL. YET THOSE 13 DIED TO SAVE THE LIVES OF ABOUT 120,000 PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO LIVE IN A FREER AND BETTER SOCIETY BECAUSE OF THEIR HEROISM. I AM ANGRY. I'M ANGRY AT THE TERRORIST IMPULSE. I WAS ANGRY ABOUT IT ON 9/11  2001, THE URGE TO DESTROY WITH THE PLANES FLYING INTO BUILDING AND KILLING PEOPLE INDISCRIMINATELY, YOUNG, OLD, AMERICAN, ALL NATIONALITIES, NO RELIGION. THAT INDISCRIMINATE URGE TO DESTROY, TO BLOW UP A DEMOLITION VEST AT THE KABUL AIRPORT AND KILL 13 AMERICAN TROOPS AND HUNDREDS OF YOUR UN-COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN FOR WHAT? THAT ANGERS ME -- YOUR OWN COUNTRYMEN AND WOMEN FOR WHAT? THAT ANGERS ME. I'M ANGRY THAT AFTER 20 YEARS OF INVESTMENT IN AN AFGHAN FORCE, DRAMATICALLY BETTER EQUIPPED THAN THE TALIBAN AND LARGER THAN THE TALIBAN THAT SECURITY FORCES FAILED. THE ONE THING I WOULD BE CRITICAL OF YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS THE SAME POINT SENATOR ROMNEY WAS MAKING EARLIER AND SENATOR RUBIO. THE NOTION GENERAL MILLEY SAID THAT NOTHING I OR ANYONE ELSE SAW A COLLAPSE OF THIS COLLAPSE OF THE GOVERNMENT, I DO NOT THINK THAT IS TRUE. I KNOW IT WAS NOT THE CONSENSUS OPINION OR THE MOST LIKELY POSSIBILITY BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A COLLAPSE WAS NOT 0%. AND IT WAS NOT 1%. IT PROBABLY WASN'T 10%. IT WAS PROBABLY BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING IN THIS COMMITTEE. THAT WAS ALWAYS A FAIRLY -- IT WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT HAD TO BE GRAPPLED WITH. I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WILL GET INTO OVER THE COMING WEEKS IS, IF THE ADMINISTRATION SAID NOBODY COULD SEE THIS COMING, THAT PROBABLY SUGGESTS THE CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS A REAL POSSIBILITY WAS NOT ALL THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. MY ANGER AT THE COLLAPSE OF THE SECURITY FORCE, WE HAVE TO GET INTO IT AND DECIDE DID WE TRAIN THEM WRONG. DID ARE EQUIPPING THEM LEAD TO CORRUPTION? WHERE THE GOOD FIGHTERS THAT LACKED CONFIDENCE IN THEIR LEADERSHIP? DO WE WANT THINGS FOR AFGHANS THE AFGHAN LEADERSHIP DID NOT WANT FOR THEMSELVES? WE HAD GOOD INTENTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE WANTED. WE CAN'T GET 30% OF AMERICANS TO GET A VACCINE. WE CAN GET 30% OF AMERICANS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RESULTS OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. IT WE REALLY THINK WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT THE CULTURE OF ANOTHER COUNTRY SHOULD BE? I AM PROUD. I AM PROUD OF THOSE WHO SERVED IN SOME OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS. FROM FIRST RESPONDERS HE RAN INTO THE BUILDINGS ON 9/11, TO THIS GENERATION OF AMERICANS, MANY OF WHOM DID NOT COME FROM MILITARY FAMILIES BUT VOLUNTEERED TO SERVE. NOT SERVE ONCE OR TWICE. THIS IS THE ONLY GENERATION I BELIEVE OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY THAT HAS SEEN 5, 6, 9 DEPLOYMENTS. INJURED, WOUNDED, CARRYING SOME INVISIBLE SCARS THAT WILL AFFECT THE REST OF THEIR LIFE. I AM PROUD OF THEIR SERVICE. I AM PROUD OF THE COUNTRY AND VIRGINIANS FOR WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN WELCOMING AFGHANS HERE. THE OUTREACH FROM VIRGINIANS TO MY OFFICE, FROM OUR VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY. FROM CHURCHES. WHERE DO WE DONATE? WHEN I VISITED FORT LEE AND DULLES, HE HEAR THE AFGHANS EXPRESS APPRECIATION TO THE UNITED STATES. EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THEIR TRAUMA AND ANXIETY ABOUT THE NEXT CHAPTER, TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE  IN A PLACE NOT UNDER TALIBAN RULE, I'M PROUD EVEN AMIDST ALL THE CHALLENGE, THAT IS THE WITH A LOOK AT US. I AM PROUD OF THE MILITARY. THIS MISSION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MISSION I WILL EVER UNDERTAKE. THE LAST THING, AND YOU MIGHT INDULGE ME BECAUSE I MAY GO ANOTHER 30 SECONDS PAST, I'M RELIEVED. I AM RELIEVED A CHILD BORN IN FAIRFAX TODAY IS NOT BORN INTO A NATION AT WAR. SOME WILL CHALLENGE MY CHARACTERIZATION, BECAUSE THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE. AMERICAN TROOPS ARE DEPLOYED A LOWER THE WORLD. THERE ARE RISKS AND THREATS BUT WE HAVE BEEN A NATION AT PERMANENT WAR FOR 20 YEARS. WE WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE THAT NATION. NEVER. NEVER. WE WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE THAT NATION. I HEARD A COLLEGE STUDENT SAY RECENTLY, I KNOW NOTHING OF WAR BECAUSE WITH AN ALL VOLUNTEER ARMY SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO, BUT ALL I KNOW IS WAR. ALL I KNOW IS WAR. PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD THE COURAGE TO SAY THIS NATION IS NOT A NATION THAT SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY AT WAR. IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR PEOPLE TO WRAP THEIR HEAD AROUND THE NOTION THAT THOUGH THERE ARE SERIOUS THREATS FOR US EVERYWHERE, WE ARE NOT A NATION THAT IS AT WAR. GROUND WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IT WILL TAKE PEOPLE A WHILE TO GET USED TWO IT. SOME PEOPLE WANT TO SAY NO, WE HAVE TO BE ON THE FRONT EDGE AND BE ON A PERMANENT WAR FOOTING AT ALL MOMENTS FROM NOW INTO INFINITY. I AM RELIEVED. I AM RELIEVED THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS CHILDREN BORN OF THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT BEING BORN INTO A NATION A

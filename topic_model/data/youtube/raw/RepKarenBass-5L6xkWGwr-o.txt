thank you thank you very much mr. chair for your leadership and the ranking member I wanted to speak about the resolution HR 358 calling on the government of Cameroon and armed groups to respect the human rights of all Cameroonian citizens to end all violence and to pursue a broad-based dialogue without preconditions to resolve the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions the situation in Cameroon continues to decline and to be frank Congress the international community and Cameroonian citizens who I receive regularly in our office either in person or by phone are concerned about where this country is heading the tensions in the Anglophone region are not new people have felt disenfranchised and marginalized since the end of colonialism but as we heard the current situation arose in late 2016 after the government was heavy-handed in its response to the Anglophone protest movement killing protesters arresting hundreds and deploying government security forces on the other side the Anglophone movement has also transformed there are elements that are now a separatist movement separatists have become more and more militant and have been accused of committing abuses including killing security forces attacking and burning down schools and attacking citizens people in the Anglophone region feel deeply wounded over the course of the last week or so in my office we have received hundreds of calls from people saying that there is genocide in the Anglophone region meanwhile the government has said that there is no-one to negotiate with and the separatists do not want to come to the table what this says to me is that there are serious work to be done to bring both sides to the table to end this conflict and to determine whether or not genocide is actually taking place I do not aim to tell this country what to do what we here in Congress want to do is to encourage dialogue in order to make sure that Cameroon is not the site of a civil war the government must recognize that it is facing a real national crisis and the international community is watching and activists must realize that peaceful nonviolent is the only way to get people to hear their cause this resolution h.res 358 calls on the government of cameroon and armed groups to respect the human rights of all Cameroonian citizens to end all violence and to pursue a broad-based dialogue without preconditions to resolve the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and to send the message to Cameroon in the world that we remain engaged in the world I also want to express my support for the legislation HR 3463 Coda's ease act that representative Smith has worked on for a number of years I am glad that we are voting on it today in this markup but I also look forward to the second half of the bill being discussed and marked up in another committee and taking both sides of the bill to passage on the floor with that I yield back

thank you madam chairwoman I'm I'm concerned that a 2020 launch date demonstrates deep in sensitivities around how Libra could impact u.s. national security the global financial system the privacy of people across the globe criminal activity and international human rights mr. Marcus I have a number of questions so I'm gonna let's try and move as expeditiously as possible are you taking any steps to ensure that the dollar is not overtaken as the leading international currency that undergirds global economic stability yes congresswoman and the the first of many steps is that the dollar is most likely going to be the the predominant part of the reserve 58% generally speaking you're about 19 I don't know what your numbers are in terms of well congressman did that the first the the dollar will be one of the the predominance of currency backing Libra and and then the other part is really the engagement that we currently have with the g7 working group with the Fed and with the Financial Stability Board will continue to engage in those conversations I serve as also as the vice ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and I'm hoping to understand how the US government could effectively implement sanctions if Libra were to take off as you likely know North Korea uses crypto currencies to evade our shanked sanctions all the time if the Treasury Department demanded the librelucha libre association blacklist certainly bruh addresses in order to comply with US sanctions how would Libra respond congresswoman just I want to make a strong point here because it's really important whether Libra launches or it doesn't launch there will be other networks there are other networks there are other cryptocurrencies and those are not coming here I'm not suggesting it's okay if others made us sanctions it's okay if Libra does I am absolutely not saying that congresswoman and that's why I'm saying that we are here and we are engaging with Vince and the Libra association will be also registered with FinCEN and we will have strong AML kyc program as well as from all of the wallets operating here in the united states of course full enforcement of sanctions and and then some Libra could have significant geopolitical implications frankly from a human rights perspective perspective for instance to despotic leaders could ban Libra and penalize users how are you approaching establishing appropriate human rights safeguards as you develop the Libra platform a congresswoman I believe that one of the driving forces of the Association being Financial Inclusion we will have the right representatives around the table and orally specific organizations because your folks sure couldn't answer that to us yesterday when I asked which ones are you specifically working with to address the potential human rights impact so we have Mercy Corps women world's banking and Kiva that are already founding members of the Libra Association and there will be more organizations that have dedicated all of their lives and energy and addressing the very problems that you're raising I'm curious to understand how you think the Libra platform would interact with section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which prevents state and local law enforcement from protecting citizens from illicit illicit activities for instance if Libra is explicitly being used to further a criminal act negotiated on facebook Messenger congresswoman section 230 as I understand it relating to a plot of Facebook technology product and have we have the protections of section 230 I don't believe that this applies to payments terracing criminals use Facebook to fundraise to recruit and connect with buyers Facebook's moderation just does not seem up to the task and Libra could make it I believe even easier for these nefarious actors to move money before launching Libra and potentially compounding the situation how will you be able how will you be addressing the digital back markets that run rampant on the Facebook platform a congresswoman the first way we will do that is ensuring that on the calibra wallet everyone who opens calibra account has to identify with a government-issued ID and as a result we will have strong identity and a full staff team to address my time is as expired I yield back

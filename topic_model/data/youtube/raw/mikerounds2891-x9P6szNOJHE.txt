thank you mr chairman secretary mcdonald it's good to see you and i i think this is a a great opportunity to sit down and talk about what's going on in the va and to learn from you from your perspective what's what's happening um i'd like to talk about um specifically the the implementation of of the uh the mission act yes and um and about kind of what's going on with with regard to referrals outside of the va facilities themselves yes um i think the clarification that you could provide on the referral coordination initiative particularly how this initiative affects veterans access to the community care i think that's the area that i really want to focus on you may have seen the results of the investigation conducted by usa today that was released earlier this month this report points out examples of va act actively denying access to community care yeah i presume you're familiar with the article i am and we dug very deeply into each of the instances and obviously can't talk about a lot of that and in fact i'm not even privy to myself to each of those cases but we've our team was up here yesterday talking about this we dig into each of those cases uh to make sure that we understand what happened well i i think we've got a real problem and i think it goes back down to dollars and cents um i have concerns that these examples are not isolated and and and that they could be the result of the implementation uh of the rci in a way that diminishes veterans choice yeah i just don't i don't i don't agree with it well let me share with you the reason why my concern yeah when a va primary care provider refers a veteran to community care because they believe it's in the veterans best medical interest does the referral coordination team have the power to override that decision no and in fact it's not it's not even the primary care provider's decision it's the veterans decision and so and and so our job is to make sure that the veteran is aware of his options and that we move with dispatch to execute his options and that it is in fact best medical interest that determines that question i i think this may be where the problem is because i think um if if the veteran actually makes the decision himself that's one of the reasons why i challenged the the mission act in the first place was i didn't read the law that way and i'm not sure that a lot of the folks that are implementing it read it that way either and i'm just i'll just give you an example the department's guidebook on the referral coordination initiative features a call script a framework that members of the referral coordination team can use when speaking to a veteran who is eligible for community care the call script framework recommends rct members remind these veterans and i quote you should know by choosing the va we can better coordinate your overall care because we have the results of any services or tests in your health record just seems to me that it i'm not sure it's appropriate for the rct members to be suggesting you know that the va might be a better option for a veteran even after a veteran's primary care physician has determined community care is in the best medical interest and i i don't think that's i don't think that's the way it was sold to a lot of folks here and and i'm not yeah that you would see it either yeah like i mean i i don't um i mean in in effect well let me put it this way gao released a study last month wherein they found that care in the community is more difficult to coordinate it's more difficult to get lab results it's more difficult to get test results and therefore more difficult at the end of the day to coordinate that care for that veteran that's not my finding that's not the referral coordination initiatives finding that's the gao's finding but either it's at the end of the day either it's the veteran's choice or somebody else is making the final decision and see i i really do think it should be the veteran's choice it is the veteran's choice that's what the law says and and yet um i think a lot of veterans feel that that's not the way it is and in fact it within this article there's one item that really was i think pointing to the facts and the concern that i think senator blackburn had tried to address a little bit what i really feel strongly about the part of the article says dr kathleen kim who is the san diego va chief of staff said physicians sometimes incorrectly try to relocate patients for treatments her hospital can offer which would be internal and administrators are regularly educating them to help keep veterans at the va and then the direct quote because of the nature of the mission act the va is sending a lot of care in the community and frankly we're worried that we're not going to be able to pay the bills end of quote see mr secretary i i really think there's more of a driver here with regards to dollars and cents than what there is to making sure that the primary responsibility is to get that veteran the care that they want and and i'd really like to explore this but more of my time has expired but i i i think we've got a serious problem here that's not gonna go away yeah well um look i mean uh the i'm just looking at the month by month obligations for care in the community so going up september 2 billion dollars 67 million 412 193 bucks so we had basically um four months uh above two billion dollars a month um that's significant investment in the community at the same time this is uh so this is by definition outpatient care correct satisfaction ratings for outpatient care north of 90 that doesn't mean we're at 100 and i didn't deal a lot in the 90 tile myself but 90 percentile is good i'm like a 70 down guy but the that's not to say that there aren't problems there are it's a big system you know when i find a problem i snuff it out but to suggest that by design we're breaking the law is an overstatement that's what the article suggests we took it very seriously including with the team in san diego to get to the bottom of it as you i think would expect us to do what i believe is that we are giving best available care to our veterans including historically high levels of care in the community i think that ultimately reflects the veterans interest i want us to compete for access to that veteran and i i like the idea of competing but i want it to be on a field that says we can provide equal or better care and the veteran makes the decision and we do and that's what the gao concluded and and i i appreciate your thoughts on it and i'd like to pursue it further i look forward to that very much thank you thank you thank you

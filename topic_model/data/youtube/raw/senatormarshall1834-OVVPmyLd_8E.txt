senator is recognized thank you mr president i rise in support of our amendment to prohibit funds in this legislation to be used to promulgate fund or enforce president biden's unconstitutional vaccine mandate on private employers as a physician i'm confident the vaccine has saved lives my wife and i have got the vaccine my parents got the vaccine and they're waiting to get their booster but whether to receive it is a personal choice between individuals and their doctor not mandated via unconstitutional executive actions that the administration recently acknowledged they didn't have authority to put in place no president exists in american history for punishing private employers who don't enforce government vaccination addicts astonishingly house democrats included fines up to seven hundred thousand dollars on businesses that have unvaccinated employees as a way to pay for their out-of-control spending make no mistake this vaccine mandate is not about public health or science if it were we'd recognize natural immunity we'd recognize natural immunity as a highly effective way to combat the virus

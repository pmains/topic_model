so part of this morning's hearing is to really get our witnesses take on what direction we need to be doing what efforts that the committee needs to be following with regards to implementing the changes in the dairy title so let us begin with the opening statements and we look forward to hearing the witness's testimony as we understand as I stated the dairy industry in America is facing a crisis this hearing is just one part of the subcommittee's efforts to continually to respond to those challenges there will be subsequent hearings and workshops around the country as we work with the United States Department of Agriculture to implement the new title addressing these critical problems I believe is one of the highest priorities of this subcommittee in speaking with our chairman Colin Peterson I know how much he feels that this is critical we all represent important parts of America's dairy country the United States so the reality is as we've lost over almost 20,000 licensed dairies in the last 10 years 20,000 licensed dairies nearly every day it seems another nationalist story about the family farmers making tough choices on to sell having to sell their dairy they don't do it by choice my family's been involved in the dairy industry for three generations I know how families fill the dairy is a part of their sum and substance and in California we have the nation's top dairy producing states dairies that have been passed down from generation to generation including the one I grew up on so this issue I have a lot of personal reflections on but let's be clear about the facts the dairy industry provides nearly 1 million jobs in the United States an economic impact of over 200 billion dollars in my district alone dairy contributes over 2 billion dollars to the local economy when we lose a dairy farm we lose those jobs we lose the investments that the farm provides as I said we worked hard in the last farm bill to make changes in the dairy safety net yesterday I met with the United States Department of Agriculture undersecretary bill Northey they told me that they are making progress in getting the new dairy Marjan coverage program implemented this morning as some of you may know the United States Department of Agriculture will announce an online decision tool that will let farmers estimate how the dairy margin coverage could work for them and that's welcome news because we're pushing them to get this this process out there as soon as later this week we hope the USDA will send out letters to dairy farmers that participated in the margin protection program and let them know what premium refund our credit they will be able to receive these updates are good news but unfortunately the expected start of the dairy margin signup is still June 17th I appreciate the priority that secretary Purdue and the USDA has put on implementing the dairy program but I know time is of the essence for many of these dairy men and women they are looking as to how long they can survive and therefore when they've had to endure years of law low margins when their input costs exceed their receipts on a monthly basis how much longer can they hold on and of course the loss of the dairies over the last 10 years or a reflection of that that loss of equity that that loss of dairies when we look at the dairy industry across the country and the regional challenges that we face I've learned clearly in the 15 years I've been in Congress that one program doesn't fit all farms equally and so when we made the changes last year we tried to take count that's why I strongly supported the more risk management agency insurance products for dairy farms and made sure that farms could participate in both the dairy margin coverage and livestock gross margin insurance for dairies both chairman Peterson and our previous chairman who was here worked very close to entering trying to make sure that we kept all the options in the menu in addition to a thorough farm bill implementation oversight the subcommittee will also focus on other issues impacting our dairy farmers and what are they or their trade and labor u.s. dairy is fighting hard in global markets to face these challenges we are hoping that progress is being made on the reauthorization of the u.s. MCA or NAFTA to whatever you want to call it but Mexico is a top destination for the United States dairy industry and it needs to be maintained and I believe expanded and while the us-mexico agreement allows Canada to keep the bulk of their current domestic system under a supply management scheme which we actually looked at here some five years ago recent international trade commission economic analysis indicated that the proposal forecasts if we implement the new United States Mexican Canada trade agreement that would provide an additional 300 million they estimated ich '''l dairy exports under the agreement frankly I hope we can do better that's positive but I think more can be done so the last area that is of critical need to our dairy men and women around the country is a reliable workforce trying to come up with an immigration solution for agriculture as long overdue some of us have been laboring on this for many many years under multiple administration's i've been calling for comprehensive immigration reform i don't think that's going to happen in this congress but maybe we can get something done incrementally to provide a more stable workforce for the dairyman and women and agriculture industry in general we in Congress need to find ways to address these challenges with both current and future workforce needs including an access to a year-round visa program and whether or not modification in the h-2a actually is a way to do that and it remains to be seen but there are things that need to be done clearly I know from my experience and generations in California working on a dairy was always considered a high-skilled valuable good-paying job considered a blue-collar job basically among agricultural workforce because it's year around and there are a number of benefits that that come to working in a dairy so I hope a legislative fix that where you're working on will come to fruition I take to heart secretary sunny produce call for legislative reform and I hope that he will continue to be engaged in this effort as we work on a plan so with that said we have our ranking member here and I would refer to him for a an opening statement and we look forward to doing right by our dairy farmers or men and women who work every day because cows are milked 365 days a year to put that food on America's dinner table every night so I look forward to the conversation that we have and ranking member razza I will defer to you for an opening statement

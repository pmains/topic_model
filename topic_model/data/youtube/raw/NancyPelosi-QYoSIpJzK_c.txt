good morning yesterday was a great day the united states senate voted to give 100 of americans everyone in this country a tax cut we all agree that that's a good idea the only thing standing in the way of middle-income tax cut is the house republicans the republicans want to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to give an extra tax cut to people making over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and what is the effect of that it makes the middle class pair pay more it increases the deficit and it increases our borrowing from countries like china extending the middle income tax cuts is very important for what it means to individual families that's for sure what it means to our economy that money will be spent injecting demand into the economy creating jobs and what it means in terms of certainty for our families for our businesses and for our federal budget it's a matter of fairness we call upon our republican colleagues to bring this bill to the floor this today they could do it we have it today to be on the president's desk signed into law for this weekend we absolutely must do it though before we leave for the august break yesterday to get our work done democratic ranking members of every one of our committees sent a letter to speaker boehner and the republican committee chairman with a clear message we must begin bipartisan negotiations immediately to replace the sequester with a balanced deficit reduction plan it all better went on to say is we must initiate this process now it's long overdue must initiate it now and complete it by september 30th the end of the fiscal year to avoid any uncertainty and the devastating consequences for our economy small businesses and the middle class we can avoid the sequester if we just come together at the table in a balanced and fair way

this was kind of like the MRAP was a totally different thing but the program seeming like an idea where the Army and the Congress can work together to do the right thing we did in that in equipment now we're talking about the type but our soldiers and how we take care of them now you made great strides and I was little but you and Senator Mikulski was saying about in recent years in suicide prevention last year's doubling of army guard suicide shows that the army fall short when it comes the needs of the army guard and reserve and they don't have a base they're not going back to a to a port or a base where you can have the services on within a limited geographical area a state like Vermont which has no active duty installations the guy reduces outreach program to reach out to personnel where they live in home towns across the state they may be talent the one I live in with 1500 people they may be in one with 100 people or they may be in a community like Burlington that has people available and our own adjutant general Mike do boom I believe you know told me that there have been many potential suicides have been averted by by this outreach now the funds needed to preserve these programs are less than 10 million dollars for the remainder of the fiscal year all right these programs going to be funded and for this year and for the future well sorry first of all I I want to thank you for the advocacy you showed for the 86th infantry brigade combat team that did deploy and then redeployed through Fort drunk and I think illustrated the progress we've made in trying to bring back redeploy and then demobilize our garden reserve what you've highlighted and other members of the committee have highlighted are the problems that are inherent within the operationalization of the reserves mcgard and reserve which was within the army conceived of in past times as a strategic reserve ready to get launched one time for a major nation threatening you know war or conflict has now been in for the last 10 years integrated fully into the deployment of the army through an operational reserve and in doing that what we've identified are our shortcomings and challenges in providing care for National Guard and Reserve Soldiers and Families when they get back to their communities provide that care is a little bit different than going back to a base go ahead after no question port hood or somewhere out sits and that and the in the rules that govern access to that care are quite different I mean a while the soldier is on active duty if the soldier incurs an injury or an illness is a consequence of that deployment or that training to go to appointment is no question we have ready access to the military units and military health care and our truck your network for that matter that it does become a challenge when soldiers are redeployed and demobilized and then sent back home where they may face environments and you're not alone in vermont and facing this problem i'm working very closely with the garden reserve i think one of the major efforts that major-general ridgestone who is in immobilized preserve esteem south out of michigan and a a physician in practice but has left his practice to work with us and orchestrate a program to look at how we can better support the garden reserve we've been looking for the last couple years at exactly how we can better care for and reach out to the garden reserve through TRICARE and other in other efforts though we're looking at the programs that are threatened by them the loss of funding circle well please look carefully let work with my my opposite we've had no after redeployment we talked about the warrior transition program and I know there's a pilot program established at Port drum which still has some issues to work out prior superior than what it was the 86 head before it though and I just would like to see these things around the country because it's when you know you've been on you've been in Iraq and you've been Afghanistan as I have and you see these people on the field you can't you can't look at the soldiers going to say well that one's a guard member and that's you can't tell nor yeah I they do these any different now one other question and actually I I passed us out to all of you general to you and Avril Robinson General Greene I've long supported improvements in military medical care through information technology increased use of it of supported military medical decision-making tool called chart the office of the secretary of defense plans to mandate be used by the services in pre and post deployment health care screening the recent say but an army doctor the American Journal of Psychiatry linked deployment screenings to improve mental health it outcomes your service is going to be using chart and what interface for your readiness systems had my Robin so much right there sir I can swing at that one I'll take a swing at it I'm not familiar with chart so I don't know whether we will be using it or not but I can certainly take this for the record and get back to you would you please I certainly will do that thank you sir I'm and for the army i'm not familiar with that as well but i will this is a good point for me to make a pitch for this behavioral health system of care that that Major General horoho has taken personal leadership in it allows us to look at programs like chart or any other program in an objective way and do a head-to-head comparison with our existing systems and see if it delivers a better outcome so I think this is on I mean we all want to save the day we want the best outcome and I'm just pushing make sure we have it in general green and sure that all three of you feel and please do give me something for the record on this gentle green yes sir and I'll take the question for record on the chart specific question I would add that we now have almost five years of data from our electronic health record and so leveraging the data that's in Alta and basically linking that with the pharmacy transaction databases as well as the m2 we are now leveraging informatics to try and get to new levels of decision support that will really change medicine over time I strongly believe that if we can get better information to the patient so that they make sound decisions that we can then also get them to the healthcare team which can augment and give them you in further information we will see tremendous change in medicine because we'll be able to pinpoint prevention back to the what's necessary but take a look at this one because and take a look at the DoD directors of it because there has to be polyp to make it work and that's why I'm I'm most concerned about a I worried very very much it's some of the brave men and women we've deployed Paul off the off the screen because they're they're not treated properly or or whatnot I I don't pretend to be knowledgeable in this but I know when my wife was working as a registered nurse she saw a lot of these people that should have been out as a different time should have been out could have been out and then I'll go to some places where the cares is superb and the person might have committed suicide somewhere out so it might have dropped out the screen somewhere else would be had a debilitating illness that could have been corrected I wasn't and so I we asked them put their lives on the line and I I mean yeah you know that you you believe that as I do it I think we owe something when they come back so let's see what this is going let's see what the directors are and let's see what what the implementation might be

[Music] the American economy is back unemployment is at its lowest rate since the 1960s and small business owners report being more optimistic than ever before cutting taxes and rolling back federal regulations has allowed American businesses to thrive and since these tax cuts went into effect the average family can expect to bring home more than two thousand dollars extra a year I've seen the evidence right here in our district talking with families and workers from our part of Texas have confirmed that this economic growth is not just about numbers on a page it's making a real difference in their lives in the lives of their family I'm proud to have supported making these tax cuts permanent and will continue to work for lower taxes getting the federal government out of our business and for pro-growth conservative policies that benefit workers and families here at home

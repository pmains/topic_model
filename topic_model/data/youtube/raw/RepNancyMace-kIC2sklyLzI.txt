here to assess whether the vice president really is just too smart to do things like you know answer a straight question or solve the border crisis her policies created is congresswoman nancy mace of south carolina i couldn't believe this you know this is this is the art this is the explanation she makes a complete mess of it and it's because she's too intellectually curious i mean what are they i mean what is this about well is she intellectually curious enough to look at a map and find her way there it's just it's curious that i mean over 150 days now into biden's presidency and our borders are vice president harris has yet to visit the border literally she has spent more time steve addressing climate change in space than she has on addressing her border crisis and think of this tonight in may of this year there were 150 000 more migrants along our border in may of this year than in may of last year and this is a massive crisis and she's just looking the other way exactly the numbers are just staggering i mean we see them you know we're down there you know fox is down there we're seeing these numbers bill milligan reporting on it you've got this just a sort of non-stop flow of course all of it in response to their policies they said she said it you know in the in the campaign she said that she wanted uh to have free health care education all of it's a human right whatever has come in will pay for i mean and then now they turn around and say oh we want to solve the root causes the root causes are their policies no absolutely and don't forget steve that in the middle of covid when teachers were not teaching in classrooms they were urging teachers to volunteer to teach migrant students out along the border and in california as well so and rather than american students that were left at home and left behind even worse and we've seen smugglers actively advertising their deals online on social media you've got fentanyl is up uh over 300 percent uh at the border as well human trafficking and uh the arrests of uh criminals uh with who who are rapists at our borders up over three thousand percent and so this is a massive humanitarian crisis that's not being addressed at all exactly yeah massive and the thing i'm just really interested in your perspective you know you're there in congress you you know you you i know because we've talked about it you you want to work with people you're seems a reasonable person you've got common sense on these issues your democrat colleagues there what is the motivation behind this i mean people say and you hear this a lot that they genuinely want open borders because they believe it helped in the end they think it helps them politically people come in they end up here and they vote democrat is it really as cynical as that in your view it well it's that it's open borders and it's hr one will help them politically but i mean that god's honest truth is that nancy pelosi has a stranglehold she's a chokehold over over the democrats in congress unfortunately there are a few that do try to reach across the aisle and work with republicans and democrats alike but those are they're unicorns really and at the end of the day she's the most powerful woman in congress and she's being led by the left and she's bullied by aoc and the hamas squad they're in charge as well which is why we're seeing what many of us thought would be a moderate administration take a sharp left turn all of a sudden doing more damage in the first six months than we thought possible in four years that's exactly right it's what i was saying at the beginning because they're actually because you've got real machine politicians in charge now in the democratic party you've got biden kamala harris pelosi they're machine politicians they don't really believe in anything they don't have values and principles they don't they didn't come into politics to do things just to be somebody and therefore they just get blown around by wherever the pressure's coming from and all the pressure now is coming from the activists left they're in charge right and to be a powerful somebody i mean we've seen nancy pelosi whip votes at the door when democrats are coming into the floor of the house when they don't have the votes in the chamber and and folks that that go to congress they do get intoxicated with power and it's really sad to see that happen and you look at the u.s senate in the november election this was not a mandate on socialist policies school lunches in an infrastructure package we haven't a senate that split 50 50. we have a house that has the slimmest majority in a generation and they're shoving down all of these terrible policies art and sculptures an infrastructure package this is not what the november election was about

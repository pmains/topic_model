hi this is congressman luke tomorrow welcome to another edition of the blaine bust thanks for joining us this week i want to talk just a little bit about one of the bills that came up uh this week it's called the prenatal non-discrimination act which basically says that you can't discriminate for sex whenever you have abortions so in other words if you have a predisposition to having a particular sex child and you find out that as a mother you're pregnant with the opposite sex a lot of times folks will go in and have an abortion based on the fact that they don't want a boy or girl or whatever for their next child and we believe that's wrong and the bill was trying to protect the unborn from that standpoint we're one of the few countries in the world that don't have a ban on something like this and we believe it's very important to again protect the unborn this is just another one of the ways that we're trying to do that and we believe it's a very important bill that we all got behind a lot of other interesting things went on this week from the standpoint of the appropriations process another couple of bills came to the floor under open rule which means anybody and everybody can get up and discuss and amend the appropriations bills and again this is something very unique from the standpoint hasn't been done for a long long time in fact whenever the opposite party was in charge of the house over the last several years practically nobody got to offer any amendments whatsoever the bills were drawn up in the back room sent to the floor and we were voted up or down now everybody gets to participate with your democrat republican independent whoever and have the opportunity to have your amendment or your view voted on on that particular issue so again it's a way to open up the process all of these things were done on the floor of the house where the televised hearings are televised activities that go on every day so that you the the the citizen can see exactly what we're doing what we're voting on who's offering the amendments what kind of amendment it is uh again we believe it's very important to the transparency of the process allowing you to see into your government see how it's working so with that have any questions about anything that's going on give us a call i look forward to seeing you on the road take care bye-bye

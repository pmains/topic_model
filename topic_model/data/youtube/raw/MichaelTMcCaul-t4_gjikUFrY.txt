good evening I'm Bret Baier illegal immigrants out of jail thanks to the sequester the administration's opening gambit in this last second political chess game giving hundreds of illegal immigrants get-out-of-jail-free cards caught just about everyone by surprise while White House officials insisted today that the decision was made by career officials immigrations and customs enforcement officials without impact input from the White House it came just two days before automatic cuts in the rate of spending growth really kick in correspondent William Lajeunesse has the amazing details from Los Angeles I'm not sheep after years of arresting illegal immigrants at the border and on the streets federal agents charged with protecting the homeland are now pinching pennies releasing hundreds of felons and non-citizens already behind bars the cost is ten dollars a day as opposed to one hundred and twenty dollars a day when they are held in a detention facilities in a statement Tuesday Immigration and Customs Enforcement claims potential budget cuts mandated by the sequester prompted the release of some three hundred inmates in Arizona alone on Saturday and perhaps more later as ice made clear yesterday the agency released these low-risk non-criminal detainees under a less expensive form of monitoring to ensure detention level stayed within Isis overall budget it's a policy that's soft on illegal immigration ice currently holds some 30,000 criminal non-citizens in prisons around the country Latino advocates long criticized jail detention as inhumane and pressured the agency to develop alternatives today several Republican Congressmen accused the administration of using the sequester to justify the illegals release it's a policy they want to effectuate they're using sequestration as a guys to to get that policy done and I think it's again a reckless one in a letter today congressman McCaul asked I swear and how many detainees it planned to release along with their criminal records the detainees in question are not dangerous criminals they pose no risk to society cops say otherwise theft burglary robbery aggravated salt Arizona Sheriff Paul Babu says the inmates released into his County are anything but nonviolent he fears many will reoffend and disappear this idea of supervised release is laughable these are all people who are multiple border crossers they could never stop them crossing an international border how on earth are they going to provide supervised release and supervision over these criminals I says these detainees are required to call in and some may wear an ankle bracelet while free they're not supposed to leave and must promise to show up in court history but suggest many won't and catching them is more expensive than jail but more on this with the panel William thank you

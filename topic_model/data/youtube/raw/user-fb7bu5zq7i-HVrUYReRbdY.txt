. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. MRVAN: THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE KEEP KIDS FED ACT WHICH WILL AIM TO ENSURE OUR COMMUNITIES, SCHOOL, TAKES CAN PROVIDE HEALTHY MEALS TO CHILDREN THIS SUMMER. AT A TIME WHEN PARENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND PRICES AT THE GROCERY STORE IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH, I'M GRATEFUL FOR THIS BICAMERAL, BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY. THROUGHOUT MY CAREER I HAVE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE TO STAY IN TOUCH. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT WITH OVER 60 NUTRITIONISTS FOR THE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS WHO HAD A SENSE OF URGENCY AND CONCERN NOT ABOUT THEIR JOBS BUT ABOUT RISING COSTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE YOUNG PEOPLE. K-12, WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE MEALS IN A ANYTHING DIG ANY FIED MANNER TO BE EDUCATED AND OVERCOME OBSTACLES AND MAKE SURE THEY WERE FED AND READY FOR CLASS. THAT BEING SAID, TODAY I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN SCOTT AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR EXAMPLE TO SOLVE THIS IMMEDIATE AND PRESSING CHALLENGE. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO ENSURE THAT WE CREATE THE IDEAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT ALLOW ALL STUDENTS TO LEARN AND THRIVE. TH

we are learning dribs and drabs about what the president might address on the economy for example talk of a tax on billionaires as well as a Wall Street tax uh quadrupling the proposed amount to one percent on stock BuyBacks for corporations Senator John thune the South Dakota Senator at that the Senate minority with with us on that and what he thinks Republicans and those in the audience and how they might respond to that Senator these taxes I just alluded to what do you think well I think it'd be very um you know fitting for a Democrat president particularly Joe Biden to make the centerpiece of his economic agenda raising taxes because that's what Democrats do when they're in power Neil we ought to be talking about instead is how are we going to grow the economy how are we going to create jobs how are we going to tackle inflation how are we going to make America energy independent again and what are we going to do to re reduce spending and we don't have a revenue problem this country revenues are up in fact they're up at historic levels what we have is a spending problem and that's exactly what uh the focus of his remarks ought to be about but I'm sure as is the case with Democrats when when they're in power what they do is they grow and expand government and to do that you got to raise taxes so they'll say it's going to be taxes on the rich but as we all know from past experience what may start out is the tax on the rich ultimately creeps down into the middle class and and that's the exactly wrong prescription I think for the future of this country if you're serious about creating jobs and growing our economy well they come right back at you not you specifically Senator and say Republicans are rich ones to talk about watching the spending 8.2 trillion dollars added to the debt under President Trump now good chunk of that quite rightly was for covet an emergency relief I understand that but they come back and say who are you to judge us well what I can tell you Neil I know a lot of that was covet but but now we've got to get our house in order we've got 31 trillion dollars in debt you know there used to be a time when your debt got up in the 75 percent of GDP range you start worrying now we're well north of 100 of GDP and and this is this is a spending problem and coming out of Colvin there's so much money flushed out there into the economy which contributed largely that's one of the big reasons for inflation and then the the reconciliation bills the Democrats passed in the last couple of years but honestly we have got to get spending reigned in and under control and the president can work with us to do that or he can take the easy way out which is to talk about again taxing the rich Republicans in time I've been here almost every budget battle I've been a part of Democrats want to spend more Republicans want to spend less with one exception and that's defense they're always willing to cut defense and they proved that again this last year but if you're serious about taking care of the National Security interest of this country about getting our economy back on its feet about making America energy independent and controlling our Southern border you know there's a lot of work to do and this these are all in my view failures of this Administration I'm sure he's going to try and talk tonight about all the positive things that have happened but we've got a death that's out of control Southern border it's out of control a country that has gone from energy dominance to energy Reliance and and we live in an increasingly dangerous world you know um Senator on that uh the economy first off the Administration has been talking about the 517 thousand jobs gained in the latest month the fact that our unemployment rate is back to what it was in the early days of the Nixon Administration and they say that's the wind at their back and are back Janet Yellen went so far as to say the treasury secretary we don't have a recession when we have more than a half a million Americans getting jobs what do you say well they got it they got a good report and we all hope and you know and wish for the best in the economy but you have to you have to understand you know what what is going to affect the economy long term are structural changes policies that you put in place that increase the incentives for investment in our economy increase the desire of businesses to grow and expand their businesses and create better paying jobs and if you're raising taxes and and doubling down on regulation and making it harder for America to get energy more expensive for energy and if you've got this rampant inflation even though you might be growing you're still going to be all those gains are going to be eaten up in the form of inflation so there are lots of problems economic problems out there Neil I don't expect the president to talk about those but they're out there and the reason that the he's not doing well with the American people right now is because they don't feel like they're doing well well then can I think a lot on that point Senator you know Kevin McCarthy and the houses you know they are working to tie whatever discussions go forward on raising the debt limit to spending and to spending cuts more to the point do you support that tying the two well I think there I think this this has happened eight times in history when we've had a debt limit increase where Congress has actually done something about the debt I think it's an appropriate time to do that I think you think the way they're doing it at the house you would many of your colleagues in the Senate do not agree I'm talking about your Republican colleagues you think it's a good strategy well I think that getting the and I think the White House ought to be open to I don't think you can take a position like the president did earlier we're not going to negotiate I think this this Republican majority in the house is coming to the president saying meet us halfway let's do something to address spending and debt in this country and the debt limit increase is the perfect opportunity to do that so certainly I'd support that I hope they they meet with success got it all right Senator thune always good seeing you thank you very very much thanks Neil

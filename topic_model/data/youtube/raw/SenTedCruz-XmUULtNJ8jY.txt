senator Ted Cruz pitched his new education reform plan to businesses in Austin today it would allow businesses and individuals to donate to scholarship families could choose which school to go to public private or a trade school you'd write the donation off of your income taxes on your corporate taxes senator Ted Cruz sat down with fans political reporter Phil praisin to take a closer look at the policy are there any income requirements to this because I could see the fear being that this is going to be you know to save rich families money to send their rich kids to expensive schools so the federal legislation doesn't impose them it leaves it to the States but but if you look a lot of different states have created tax credit programs much like this and and most of them have imposed income requirements you typically have something like say they're eligible for families that are say 200% of poverty that's that that's one line that a number of them use that would be up to the state of Texas I think they would certainly be a significant likelihood that Texas would decide the means test it but the federal legislation doesn't mandate it because each state might answer that question a little bit differently under the Texas school finance system most the money follows the kid to the schools so I think another thing that people will be worried about is if anything that encourages kids to go out of the public school would lessen would make the pot of money smaller well this legislation allows States if they so desire to send that money their scholarship directly to the public school they're in I mean so the one potential could be more money public school that's up to each day how structure this legislation gives dates that flexibility senator Cruz's program would be up to one hundred billion dollars over ten years half for k-12 half for trade schools or Workforce Development

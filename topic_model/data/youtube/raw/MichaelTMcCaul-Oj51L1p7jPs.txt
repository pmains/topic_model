a few reports out that shows the fbi found a lot of warning signs before the fort hood massacre but the bureau did not investigate the shooter because the shooter was a muslim according to that report the fbi considered the muslim issue too sensitive to pursue that's according to a gop lawmaker who saw the review conducted by a former fbi director among the findings here we're told the fbi learned that the accused shooter the army psychologist major nidal hassan sent emails back and forth with the radical american-born cleric anwar al-balaki thirteen people died dozens more wounded in the attack at the army post back in o-nine a judge recently delayed the shooting suspect's court martial until next month catherine herridge is live in washington this afternoon a whole lot of disconnects here kat well that's right chef if we have reported at fox news as part of our ongoing investigation of fort hood the fbi initially thought major hassan was a communications specialist when the abbreviation coms meant commissioned officer and as a result the fbi did not send out a warning about hassan fearing he might read it the fbi's washington joint terrorism task force or jttf chose not to interview hassan superiors because they feared hurting his career prospects in the military hassan who has now grown a beard in defiance of army regulations exchanged those emails with the american cleric in yemen who was killed last year by the cia and this fact was never shared by the fbi with army investigators i believe the fbi uh through their joint terrorism task forces had information about mr hassan major assan's communications with mr olaki in yemen perhaps the number one terrorist next to bin laden specific communications that should have put them on high alert senior fbi agents on the hassan case have faulted the army because hassan's hassan pardon me had glowing performance reviews that did not reflect the fact that on at least three occasions shepard hassan openly justified the use of suicide bombings and bin laden's writings in the classroom wow are we expecting to get a declassified version of this report at some point so people like you can look over it well we are the federal law enforcement source i told fox within the last hour that the fbi wants to push out a declassified version of the fort hood report by the end of the week and it could actually come as early as today members of congress who have oversight of the bureau are also calling for an immediate release i think the american public and others have to see what his recommendations are so we can then see is the fbi being held held accountable are they going ahead and do what judge webster recommends so yes i will see it and then we will press that to be made public fox news was first to report last week that the report contains 18 formal recommendations the key here is how many of those recommendations are already in place by the fbi because the webster report was more than two years in the making shepherd catherine herridge in washington catherine thank you you're welcome the troubled

Thank You mr. chairman first we all on this side of the Diocese of bragging about our own States but in this case I cannot fail to mention that a lot of the preparation for montenegro secession to the to NATO on the military and security side came through the partnership with the Maine National Guard we have been working with Montenegro since 2006 and I'm extremely proud of the work that our men and women have done in order to facilitate a very important geopolitical development so I wanted to preface my remarks with a real recognition of the work that was done from by those good people from Maine I've often thought that if you woke up somebody in 1780 in England and said when do you when are you living very few would have said oh the Industrial Revolution or an Italian in 1500 or n asan's of course in other words we're not really aware of the era in which we live but listening you today has helped me to focus my thinking I think we're in a new era of conflict we talk about the Cold War we talk about hot war we are in a warm war with Russia that involves everything from cyber to disinformation to political disruption to coup attempts and military invasion in the Ukraine for example and I think that's very very important insight that we cannot just act like this is a continuation of what's gone on for the past 10 years or 20 years or 50 years the second piece of that recognition and this goes to your testimony mr. Wilson you had a chilling observation I wrote down the Kremlin has drawn its own lessons from the muted response of the free world we are not treating this with the seriousness that it deserves mr. Bukowski would you comment on those thoughts absolutely the Kremlin knows that it cannot confront the directly so it uses every available if you like soft power tool to conduct a campaign of subversion to divide and eventually dismantle the West and I've actually put this in mind and this is an active strategy that is an active strategy from the very top around the presidential administration there is a strategy we've often heard the put in is an opportunist he uses opportunities to conduct his strategy but there is a strategy there is a purpose there is an ambition it doesn't necessarily mean Russia will be successful in fact many times as we've seen in Montenegro it's had the reverse effect but they but they will be if we don't respond if we have to respond we have to respond we have to not only push back I would say even further I would say we have to go more on the offensive visa vie Russia not militarily but in the soft power tools where they use this information we should use counter disinformation in other words to inform the Russian public more accurately what the Russian government isn't telling well in 1999 we dismantled USIA for example a terrible geopolitical mistake in my opinon that we have either at our disposal that we fund I think we should be helping and throughout countries that are most vulnerable we should be strengthening their institutions and one of the main institutions is a free media also the social media we haven't touched on this but the social media there are initiatives in different parts of central Eastern Europe for example the elves in Lithuania that are fighting the trolls on the internet to get accurate information across this is something we should be focusing on we actually could learn quite a bit from the central Europeans that are on the let's say the most vulnerable countries on the border of Russia I've always thought it was ironic that we seem to be losing the information war and we're the people that invented Facebook and Hollywood precisely because they've subvert it there and used it for their purposes you know none of these instruments these instruments are neutral depends how they use we assume the abuse for the right purposes that people would be smarter and get more intelligent that's not necessarily the case in a few few seconds I want to go to a much more specific question mr. Wilson we been talking a lot about gas and energy as a as a geopolitical weapon isn't the right word but a geopolitical force the difference is though and I wanted to ask you a more detailed maybe and get back to me on the record the differential between the price of pipeline delivered gas and and LNG there's a three to four dollar premium on LNG to liquefy ship and deal it with I and my question is can the can the Russians counter the LNG threat if you will simply by lowering the price of their pipeline delivered gas which currently in the US I'd Penry held I think is about three bucks so a brief answer if you would on that question in other words is is LNG the weapon we think it take to use the word weapon the force that we think it might be because of the price differential delivered to the customer right it does have an impact I've just come back from hungry which is a particularly particularly Len G has done in the region both psychological American LNG is in the game and commercial the Russian Gazprom is already fed in hungry we will sell one dollar cheaper than any offer you get an LNG through Kirk Island terminal which they can do because they don't have to pay the shipping but that still has a real concrete effect of introducing market economics and into pricing and frankly if they if they are taking Russian gas but they have an option of others if the Russians are forced to play into the market that's where we win and that's the problem we have right now and people are willing to make those pretty substantial capital investments for LNG liquefaction and de liquification I would say it's not a simple answer it took far far too long to build the first LNG terminal to get this Kirk pile island pipeline going so it's not it's not clean cut this is partly why we've been focused on these infrastructure connections running north-south through Central and Eastern Europe because the Soviets built everything west east and these structural funds started to do east-west they're these major gaps from the energy corridors running north-south for the eastern flank of our alliance and that's a problem here Thank You mr. chairman thank you and I thank you for your holding this hearing I think this is very very important hearing

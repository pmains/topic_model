[Music] this is NewsCenter one at 10. [Music] good evening everybody I'm Kevin Stanfield with NewsCenter one this was a big day for the state of South Dakota not only that but the Black Hills and Ellsworth Air Force Base we're talking about the unveiling of the new B-21 Raider bomber stealth aircraft here and I'm joined by Colonel uh Joseph Sheffield who is the commander of the 28th bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base first of all Colonel thanks for your time I appreciate it thanks for having me on I appreciate it give me uh for those of you at home maybe that watched it watch the live stream feed of the ceremony you were there in person what was that like and what was your reaction can you tell me it's a it's an exciting time it's exciting time for Ellsworth this exciting time for the Air Force an exciting time for our nation this is the first time in over 30 years that we've unveiled a new bomber and so it was a historic day to see what the new platform that'll be the backbone to air power in the Air Force and long-range strike and so to be to see that and be present as they unveiled the B21 is exciting time not only for myself but for the whole community and the whole Air Force I like the way you put that though it's been 30 years three decades since the last time we rolled it was the B2 correct and so is this pretty typical to go decades without an upgrade so to speak well um it was it has been 30 years for us now so uh it it this has been uh a plane and a plan that's been in the making and uh the B-21 looks to be again the the the backbone of the Air Force long range strike well into the future we have a long time where we'll have the B1 around he'll continue to to do its Mission and it is the backbone currently but as it continues to age and as we begin uh going towards the future the B-21 will take its spot there so it is uh it it's an exciting thing I've got a suspicion that a lot of people really you know the term stealth or stealthy stealth technology a lot of people have just kind of a nebulous idea of what that means can you kind of bring it more into Focus for us what is stealth and how it applies to an aircraft correct well if you think of stealth ultimately what it is it is to make it difficult for enemy uh anti aircraft or enemy defenses to to see and Target the aircraft so uh the B2 which is our current low observable stealth aerocraft it was uh built in the early 90s okay and so as I said that was the most recent bomber and now here we are in 2022 and you can imagine the technology that you have whether it's on your phone or whether it's on your computer whether it's in almost everyday use a lot has changed in 30 years I like the way you put that so much has changed technology wise in 30 years and the same applies with the fence it really does it really does so the B21 ensures that we can access any different contested airspace around the world and make it difficult for the enemy to to Target and engage us okay they're both on the Flying Wing plant form design so what's the difference between the 30 year old B2 and the brand new B21 it's uh it's it's those upgrades that we talked about the technology uh and the design and development and the ability for it to continue to get upgraded as we move in the future okay but it's a smaller aircraft am I correct it it is a it's a long range where it has the payload it has the the range required it has the persistence and so it'll be able to provide that uh InterContinental strike that it's needed so Conventional Weapons plus nuclear yes the B-21 will have both a conventional and nuclear weapons as a dual capable aircraft let's talk a little bit more about the capabilities of it my understanding and correctly correct me if I'm wrong is it it has a longer range than the B2 is that correct most of the specifics on the aircraft haven't really been released and are open uh for discussion but yeah it definitely has the the weapons capability has the range capability has the persistence capability as well as the communication and linking with our current aircraft that we we fly with as well as our Coalition Partners so it'll bring all that to bear there as we as we move forward into the this Century as as we have near peer threats and competitors that are challenging uh our our uh us as a nation all right we're talking with Colonel Joseph Sheffield who is the base commander at Ellsworth Air Force Base we're talking about the rollout well not necessarily the rollout but the unveiling of the brand new B-21 Raider stealth bombers so we're going to take a quick break here on NewsCenter one and we'll be right back [Music] team Center one I'm Kevin Stanfield we're coming to you live by the way from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley California and it's just up or down the road from the unveiling Palmdale so I'm not from California so it was up or down the road east and west east and west very good so earlier today if you weren't aware we had the big unveiling of the brand new B-21 Raider stealth bomber and and so we're joined Now by Senator Mike rounds and who is also there at the ceremony welcome thank you for your time sir it's been a good day for South Dakota and a really great day for the entire country all right let's delve into it what was your initial gut reaction to the ceremony being there they did it right uh they they've started for the public this was an opportunity to see the stealthy B-21 they laid this thing out in front of us in a way right at sundown uh one in which uh if anything I've told some folks I say what does this thing look like and I just say just think Batman and uh and and that's what this is this is a this is a a stealthy aircraft which is the most advanced aircraft that we have ever had uh in the defense of our country and in this particular case it is beautiful and yet is it is mysterious it is not something that you're going to see out and about a lot right now because we don't want people taking pictures of it we don't want them to see the Unique Designs that go into the creation of this particular aircraft and we don't want them to see what the surface looks like for as long as we can keep it under wraps but tonight under some some special lighting and so forth that was pretty spectacular well one day it's going to be flying over rapid and box elder and Ellsworth obviously it will yeah that'll be a sight to see well we've got the uh as as I think the current will probably have said we've got the first training Squadron and we've got the first operational Squadron coming to Ellsworth which is a long time in coming but at the same time the Ellsworth Air Force Base is still very very busy with b1s that are running at a real high rate mq-9s which are fully operational and now here they are working hard to do bed now and there are not a lot of air bases in the United States that have multiple missions all going full speed Ellsworth is doing a great job all right maybe you can uh chime in with what the colonel was talking about when we say the word stealth stealthy stealth technology what does that basically mean I'm I'm thinking a lot of our viewers may not know exactly what that means when the sun comes out you can see things because in the Spectrum the visible light spectrum you can see light bounce off of something and it comes back with an aircraft that you don't want radar to see and that's the primary way in which they look for for aircraft in the Spectrum those radar waves don't bounce back they don't go back to where they're transmitted from they're either absorbed within the skin itself or they are offset or they're bounced someplace else and so what you've done is you've hidden this aircraft from radar but there's more than that because there's infrared which looks at heat signatures from engines and so forth this is a sixth generation stealth aircraft there's not another one like it any place in the world and and what it does is looks at a very wide range of what we call the electromagnetic spectrum and it protects the the pot the aircraft from being detected in multiple areas on the electromagnetic spectrum visible light is only a small part of that okay I'm going to pose a question to both of you gentlemen with this B21 Raider aircraft now what does it mean when it comes to a coalition of forces how does the B-21 Raider play a part when a coalition is involved well Center well the Coalition is uh that's Central to any time we are going to deter an adversary and also when we need to fight with an adversary so with the B-21 Raider it will be again the key fundamental striking platform for long-range strike of what any of those adversaries are or to turn in any of those adversaries and we'll continue to train with our Coalition Partners whether it's in exercises whether it's in contingency operations and so we absolutely look forward to continuing to exercise and train and employ with them because having that Coalition and their strengths and their basing and their locations will be key for us as we move forward in the future in the Air Force and the B-21 that's one of the strengths of the new raider is the the ability to communicate digitally with other not only aircraft but forces on the ground in my am I right in that let's just say that it has the ability uh communicate with other forces okay and but it's more than that it senses things so it can be a monitor of what the bad guys are doing and when it can monitor it can share that information with other Allied Forces okay here's another question for the both of you uh during the rollouts or the unveiling ceremony they said that this B21 will be the backbone of our bomber Fleet so and they mentioned for years even decades in the future how do you propose to do that you want to start a shallot go ahead look we expect this particular platform to be available for the country's use for probably the next 50 years but if you were to take a look at an aircraft that's 50 years old the B-52 bomber is still part of it yeah but we have 141 bombers in the entire fleet right now that includes our our B-52s our b1s and our b2s we're looking at purchasing a minimum of a hundred of these b-21s and I suspect by the time we're done we'll probably have closer to 200 of them but so this will be the backbone but over that time period the same platform with the same equipment in it is not going to be the same do the same job 50 years from now so what is in this platform that we've not been able to do in other platforms is similar to what we call a plug and play where certain pieces of it will come out and New pieces will go in easily and you can change software easily you can change the hardware that runs the software easily just like switching out a hard drive and a computer or something like that and only on a much more advanced scale yeah yeah and at the same time to modernize it but even as you know the kernel will share the B1 is carrying weapon systems today that were not in existence when the B1 was built now the same thing is going to occur with the B21 and the weapon systems of choice even 15 or 20 years from now are not even invented yet today but the B21 will be able to because this will be the platform when you when you build it and you make it last you know what the dimensions are of what you can carry and as long as you know what the dimensions are of what you can carry you can design your weapon systems to fit that that that product do other militaries forces around the world have anything comparable to this no well right now the United States is the only Coalition partner that has bombers and so the long-range strike capability that Ellsworth burnings day in and day out with the B1 is a unique capability and unique requirement for our National Defense and for those of our allies the B-21 is absolutely Cutting Edge technology and its stealth capability and its dual role capability and being able to integrate and with like we said with our allies but also to to penetrate and get access to maybe airspace that would be try to be denied by potential adversaries thereby holding any Target viable for the B-21 well speaking of our adversaries do do Russia do China have anything comparable that you know of that you can speak to China is rapidly developing their character or their weapon systems they've chosen other types of weapon systems but they recognize that we are the leading competitor and they have made it very clear that they don't like the rule of law that exists right now that was made up by Western countries they've decided that uh they're far enough away from the United States and and our allies that they want to take back a lot of the area there in the South Pacific region and the 50 of all the trade in the world goes through the South Pacific seas and they would prefer that we pay them homage for that trade than to allow it to be open for free passage Taiwan is another example they've made it very clear they'd like to have Taiwan back Taiwan produces a heck of a lot of really very very high quality chips that are used in all sorts of things but they've made it clear that they're going to continue to develop not just their air Land and Sea capabilities but also their cyber capabilities and most importantly their space capabilities the two words that I heard during the unveiling ceremony was one backbone the other one was deterrent can you flesh that out a little bit you you Colonel you spoke to it a little bit can you flesh that out so our viewers know a little bit clearer what how the B21 is going to play in that deterrent role absolutely the desire of the U.S military the desire of the Air Force the desire of a bomber is to be able to with strength avoid war in other words making the decision calculus of the adversary is high enough that they don't want to risk it they don't want to pick battles or or situations in the United States so with this new bomber and its ability to strike any Target around the world its ability with its range and its flexibility and its weapons load thereby providing a strategic deterrence for our nation and allies okay all right we're going to take another quick break here on news center one I'm talking with Senator Mike rounds and Colonel Joseph Sheffield who is the commander of the 28th bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base talking about the unveiling of the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber we'll be right back foreign NewsCenter one at 10 I'm Kevin Stanfield and we are broadcasting live this evening from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley California just a little a few miles away from here earlier in Palmdale California there was the unveiling of the new B-21 Raider stealth air stealth bomber that is and it was a big ceremony and it has a ripple effect it's not only affecting this or going to affect or is already affecting the state of South Dakota it is affecting already the Black Hills area and a little more putting it into a little more of a focus into the Rapid City box elder neck of the woods as well so in this segment we want to talk with the city leaders box elder in Rapid City let's start on my far left here we have city councilman with Rapid City Jason Solomon Jason thank you so much we also have the mayor of Rapid City Steve allender mayor thank you very much and then also we have the mayor of box elder Larry Larson Larry thank you so much again all three of you were at let's see two of you were at the ceremony right now and so I'd kind of like to get your first reaction first of all your your Rea uh visceral reaction to the ceremony you want to start sure I'll start um it was pretty amazing I mean the the way the lighting was set up and the smoke and the drums and uh I mean you couldn't help but smile and just feel a you know a sense of Pride as far as where we are in the U.S I mean this is a this is an amazing bomber so we're really lucky to be a part of that mayor Allenby well it was a very dramatic ceremony and uh justifiably so also very humbling I thought to see the hundreds of professionals both from the Armed Forces not only from the United States but there were some other countries represented here as well and then all the professionals at Northrop Grumman who have been working on this for quite some time and then to have this unveiled and to see the emotions on everyone's face it's you know it's a little bit overwhelming I'm gonna I'm gonna pick on you a little bit Jason if I can right now so generally speaking there's been a lot of talk I know I've been doing a lot of reporting and doing shows on on the B21 coming to Ellsworth Air Force Base and how it's going to impact not only Rapid City but box elder of course so this in my view brings it one step closer this is this is really kind of the makes it a little more even more real would you agree with that 100 I think first of all I think just as Americans this makes us proud when you see that unveiling today a lot of us watched it online or are on television I think that's amazing as a South dakotan we couldn't be more proud and I can tell you as an Airman myself it gives me goosebumps to think about that we have the best military on the planet and and it's exciting and I think that kind of enthusiasm is contagious for Rapid City in the surrounding area because we have a real opportunity here to level up and be the best place possible so when I think about this coming into the region I think about all of the things that we're going to have to do to be ready for it you have to think about the future and how can we reach for remarkable and not settle for status quo and so I think that is what inspires me about the new bomber and the new mission that we're going to have at Ellsworth Air Force Base and it's exciting no doubt about it we should all be excited in Rapid City and box elder and the whole region the whole state this is a big deal and uh I can't wait to see that bird fly over our area for the first time so mayor allender then your take on this as far as rapid is concerned well we've been briefed on the um on the proposed build up of Air Force personnel uh for the deployment of this B21 and it's a you know it appears to be a very smart uh build up and uh we have this current Mission the B1 Mission uh and then we'll see the b-21s coming in and I imagine that that'll mean a you know eventually some uh dwindling of the numbers of b1s over time but uh because I think it's a very well thought out very well planned out uh transition and so a couple of hundred Air Force personnel per year up through 2040 2041 that's uh that's pretty reasonable and and predictable and so I think Rapid City and box elder will continue our positive relationship with Ellsworth Air Force Base and the men and women who work there and we'll do everything we can to make this transition for them in their careers uh the best that that they'll see anywhere okay Mary a lot mayor Larson you and I talked about this exact same thing and and we spoke about how this is kind of a misconception that people may be thinking that you know here comes the B21 boom and it's all it's just going to hit us like a sack of potatoes but you put it uh in it's a ramp up it's a gradual ramp out and so you want to flesh that out a little bit well as as mayor allender said that's exactly what's going to happen it's it's a couple hundred uh personnel with family is a year till 2041 but we're still trying to get ready of course and even without the the B-21 being there we have a military base that with lots of families there that we want to have their quality of life be a little better we want them to be proud to be in box elder Rapid City in the Black Hills area and so from our standpoint anyway we're working on a lot of different things I mean we've got nine different housing areas being built in we've got the Liberty Center that just opened up with the state-of-the-art equipment and indoor track we've got our children's museum that's moving forward we've got another event center that the military can use and a lot of businesses that are calling that are very interested because they've heard of the B-21 and the military families moving in they're they're excited about being a part of this so we're we're growing about 12 percent a year that's a that's a big deal on the Rapid City side of things I mean it's definitely going to have a huge impact on box elder how's that going to spill over to the Rapid City side of things well the the people of the Rapid City region including box elder and Ellsworth they're part of this they're part of our extended family and so with the additional Personnel the additional housing that will follow all of the Commerce that's related to that there's significant economic impact to Rapid City in the in the Black Hills area from Ellsworth Air Force Base it's all going to stay in boxelder no no not at all and but this is this is a big economic impact for everyone and that's a that's a nice bonus effect but that's not the primary that's not what we're mostly happy about we're happy to be here supporting Ellsworth Air Force Base so that they can play their part in the Global Security plan to to keep our nation safe okay Jason let's talk about reactive and proactive when it comes specifically to the B20 B21 Raider Mission how is rapid being let's let's focus on proactive first of all and then maybe we can take a look at the reactive as well well the the thing that's happening in Rapid City in the surrounding area with Ellsworth being a big part of it is is not the question is it whether we're going to grow it's what kind of growth we're going to have is it going to be a good and Healthy Growth or we will we just wait and let it happen to us we have leaders in our community who have worked very hard from day one to make sure that we're trying to do our best to get out in front of it I think what this does is it revitalizes our energy to work together as a region to make sure that we are doing our part to get out in front of the growth that's going to come as a result of this added Mission as well as the other growth that we have what does that mean exactly to get out in front well you're talking about uh managing where housing is going to go you're talking about infrastructure investment you're talking about Public Safety here's the deal best thing Rapid City box elder and all the surrounding areas can do is be the best place possible that means good governance wise stewardship that means safe neighborhoods that means flourishing families Vibrant Community great quality of life all those elements that make a community amazing is what's going to help and enhance the quality of life for the Personnel at Ellsworth Air Force Base which in turn well we pray and hope helps them keep our nation that much safer and so that's we're going we're committed to not only being proud to be a military Community but cheering them on and being their biggest fans and I think that's something in our community we're very proud of we love our country we love the people who support and defend us and we're ready to do our part to make sure that we're we can handle everything that comes to make their life as good as possible let's do this let's take a quick break here on NewsCenter 1 at 10 and we'll follow up with you mayor allender on this uh and again the uh the discussion of proactive reactive all right and then we'll get to you Mary Larson all right all right all right you're watching NewsCenter one at 10 I'm Kevin Stanfield [Music] back on NewsCenter 1-10 and I'm Kevin Stanfield and we are broadcasting live this evening from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley California just down the road from a pretty uh pretty big party earlier this evening near the unveiling of the new B-21 bomber stealth uh stealth aircraft so we're getting a little bit of reaction from not only the leaders up at Ellsworth Air Force space but Senator Mike grounds and right now we're talking to the leaders of Rapid City and box elders and gentlemen we left off with the discussion of being proactive versus reactive now mayor allender again focusing on Rapid City what you're doing proactively well I think to prepare in a nutshell I think we've got a great interface with Ellsworth Air Force Base through the military Affairs committee and also through the Ellsworth Development Authority and so we have a number of planners city and county and and Air Force planners talking together trying to predict the impact of this build up over time and what needs to be done and so in the proactive side I think we're doing and have been doing all that can be done between the multiple organizations reactively I think we're just going to be have to remain fluid and be able to respond and re react in case that plan changes or catches some of us off guard by an unanticipated component but I think we're doing a lot have been doing a lot all right and then mayor Larson I'll let you have the final word for this one I mean you've already as far as box elder is concerned have been taking the lead as far as you know Liberty Center just happened making green spaces it's all quality of life that you've told me before what else is going on well the proactive side as mayor allender said you know I think he mentioned earlier that we were working together and we have great working relationship with Rapid City and Pennington County Mead County with the Air Force Base and basically with a lot of the the mayors that we've talked to in the Black Hills area a good example of one of the things we're doing that's proactive thinking ahead remember I said we had nine different housing areas being built in and while right now we might have a enough water we're working with Rapid City to come up with a way because they have a lot of water and can afford to give that some of that to it and I'd give some of it I wish it was given bye some water from them at a reasonable rate and uh so that but that's that's a good thing you know um it's that Spirit of cooperation together yeah we're working with Rapid Valley to do the same thing so that's what I'm talking about you're thinking had you being proactive we're working on a again with Rapid City in a lot of areas getting water all the way from the Missouri River all the way out here again thinking ahead for the families that will be here not five years maybe 10 maybe 30 years from now all right gentlemen thank you so much for your time I appreciate it thank you all right another quick break on NewsCenter 110 we'll be right back with Senator rounds foreign we're back on a very special edition of NewsCenter one tonight at 10 and I'm Kevin Stanfield we're broadcasting live from the Simi Valley area of California and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library now earlier today just down the road in Palmdale we had a very special event the unveiling of the B-21 Raider stealth bomber is a big production a lot of people there including Senator Mike rounds and again thank you for your time this evening now you are also here not only for the unveiling ceremony but you're here at the for the Reagan National Defense Forum tell me a little bit about that correct every year there are a group of Defense professionals come together editing they and they invite some of us political types as well and we talk about what's going on with the armed services the branch the different branches of government and particular branches of the Pentagon but basically the defense of our country the politics behind it a little bit but more along the lines of what we need to make our country stronger what the greatest risks are and what the the climate is around the rest of the world that's going to be a threat to us so tomorrow I'll be one of the presenters in the afternoon on a on a panel which will discuss the indo-pacific region and that's a great one for us because when we talk about the b-21s Tilt bomber that's what that bomber was made to address you piqued my interest with that statement what is the biggest threat to our country right now right now the the challenge for us our competing countries are are topped with China China has made it very clear that they intend to expand that they do not like the laws that the world is working under right now because they consider them Western in nature and they think that they should that they should have a say in in how things are run they don't believe in copyrights necessarily they don't believe in patents necessarily because they don't understand why why someone can own an idea and they've shared that with us but basically they would like to rewrite some of that they would also like to be able to demand that we recognize them as the defender of the South Pacific region and that means also paying homage for that defense and about half of all of the trade in the world goes through that area so for us it's a big deal and freedom of the season is a very big issue and right now China is kind of trying to challenge us on that okay all right so let's bring this uh let's bring this home if we could to bring it home to not only South Dakota but focus more in on the black hills region uh I I don't know about you Senator but I can't escape the irony in all this because it wasn't too long ago in 2005 that that Ellsworth Air Force Base was fighting for its life and you were an integral part of that fight and now uh 2015 20 years down the road code you know we're we're hosting now a B-21 Raider Mission this would not be possible without what happened in 2005 and subsequently to that how here's what we had uh they were going to shut elsewhere down in a Brack they call it which is basically the committee was going to put it out and basically shut this down along with a number of other Air Force bases army bases and so forth but what happened was the people in South Dakota came together the people on the Black Hills came together Rapid City box elder that whole crew came together and said we're not going down without a fight this is too important and we really were convinced that Ellsworth had a real value to the defense of our country and at that time the B1 was the most active bomber just as it is today and they only had one other place where they were going to put them and if there was a hurricane down there if there was a major storm whatever they had only one Landing Strip there and we felt that they should have two bases and they agreed with us finally but I remember the day that we asked people to come and this was a bipartisan effort and we had Republicans and Democrats representing South Dakota at that time and I was governor at the time but our Congressional Delegation was bipartisan and the people of South Dakota came together the people in Rapid City the Black Hills came together and when the brat commission came to have a hearing we had over 10 000 people show up at the convention center they gave them a parade down Main Street with Harleys with Harleys and lots of flags yes they came out they inspected Ellsworth they saw what we had um and John Thun had been working really hard at adding additional airspace the Potter River Basin he worked hard on that that was a key part of this component and people of South Dakota the people of Rapid City basically said we're going to show them just how proud We Are of Ellsworth and the chairman of the committee on that day looked at us and said you've got one heck of a hill to climb on this one really all I could think about was the people in that group in the Black Hills of South Dakota and I remember responding to him publicly saying we're not afraid of heels here because in South Dakota we don't just walk up hills and not only do we do that we climb mountains heck we carve them and we don't just carve part of them we carve the whole mountain and I remember it was such a a great afternoon and it was such a special time to see all these people that really believed in the future of Elsewhere therefore space if it wouldn't have been for that day and the people coming out and sporting I don't think Ellsworth would be here today since that time folks have put together we've got an Ellsworth Authority we've got a team of people that are constantly working at making the quality of life better for our Airmen we're making the infrastructure better we're making the base safer and that's because of people in the in the Box Elder area in the Rapid City area the Pennington County area working together saying what are we going to do to improve this base and it's paying dividends now and curious what happened I don't know how much you can tell me but what was it like behind the scenes when you go from saving Ellsworth Air Force Base from the Brack list establishingly establishing the Ellsworth Authority and then turning your sights to maybe hmm can we get this new bomber at Ellsworth how did that all happen one step at a time okay but a lot of people supporting the idea and trying to figure out how can we be one step ahead of the process what can we do to make our opportunities a little bit better than everybody else's and we've done our best to try to work with the Air Force with the Department of Defense we've been supportive of their programs particularly with regard to the B1 with the MQ-9 with the Powder River Basin additional airspace up there which is critical for training but then when it came time to actually show interest in the B-21 we've been all ears and we've been working with them and letting them know that we're going to be supportive of this because this is good for America it's a major part of the Trident the our defense of our country with air with fixed base missiles of nuclear missiles for a deterrent a submarine based missiles for a deterrent but the bomber has always been one of the Mainstays and that's the third part of it and we haven't had enough bombers and we have more threats now than we've had in a long long time as other nations have continued to grow their military we've been kind of taking a break over the last 20 years and we've you know we have a tough time just maintaining the ammo that we need right now and that's showing up in Ukraine and so it was time to focus on a new bomber one that would stand the test of time for the next 50 years the B-21 has been on time and on budget and um and and it's proven itself to be a platform that can that can be upgraded and uh it's going to be here for a long time okay this was a great day for South Dakota a great day for the Black Hills Ellsworth Air Force Base my final question for you would be so there are a lot of people who are enthused about the B-21 Mission coming to Ellsworth there are a lot of people though and I've talked to a few of them that are worried because this is South Dakota we like our South Dakota way of life and everything's going to change what would you say to him I don't think it's going to change we've had an Air Force presence here for well ever since after World War II and and and and what we've actually done is we've added another mission uh at one time we had a whole lot of people out here because we had the Minutemen basis here in Western South Dakota they went away the Black Hills is going to continue to grow in population but the elected officials the city managers uh the the folks that have been elected have been planning for this Edition this is a small part of the growth that you're going to see in Western South Dakota and part of it's because of the quality of life we've got here part of it's because of the tax structure it's a great place to raise a family we've got a great educational system so it's not just the additional folks coming in for Ellsworth that's going to be a small part of the growth that we're going to see over the next 30 to 40 years in the western part of South Dakota so this will be a part of it but it's not going to be the overwhelming part of it but we want to make sure we are doing is providing this quality of life that an Airman can look at and say this is where I want to raise my kids this is where I want to retire this is something that I'm going to go out and maybe I'm going to have to go someplace else for a while but I want to come back here and when you bring that type of expertise in other things come as well we're going to have contractors that are going to be working on the systems file within the B21 for years to come these folks are technically Adept their families are going to be moving in with them they're going to add to the community they're going to add value here they're going to bring businesses with them and that's going to grow our economy as well that's a healthy thing to have and we can still protect the Black Hills of South Dakota all right thank you so much Senator I appreciate your time pat all right and thank you for joining us have a great evening everybody thank you there are those Among Us who look to the heavens and dream of soaring dream of Conquering the sky dream

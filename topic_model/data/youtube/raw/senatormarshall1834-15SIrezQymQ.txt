marshall thank you madam chair dr jones do you consider the fentanyl crisis to be a public health emergency yes and there is currently a public health emergency declared for the opioid crisis okay thank you like every state my home state of kansas is now a border state that's right as you can see from this map behind me kansas kansas is literally at the crossroads of fentanyl trafficking with three major arteries coming out of mexico piercing the heart of our great state and all three bisecting the nation's busiest east-west byway we are now at ground zero in fact just recently officers in kansas city kansas seized nearly fifteen thousand fifteen thousand fake pills laced with fentanyl during a two-day bust fentanyl is now killing a kansan almost every day is killing over 250 americans every day sadly fentanyl is now the number one killer of young adults poisoning deaths and i mentioned and i stress these are poisoning deaths from synthetic opioids particularly fentanyl have increased by more than 600 percent so where does it come from and why is it so cheap as we all know the fentanyl precursors are made in china and yes you could call this china's revenge on the west for opium war in mexico chinese chemists and their cartels convert these precursors into fentanyl and they lace fake pills like adderall or xanax or percocet they or they mix them with illicit drugs like meth and cocaine or simply they sell it in various pure forms unfortunately this is one supply chain from china that's not broken it goes without saying with an open porous southern border the supply is abundant driving the street price down for where oxycodone tablets maybe cost sixty dollars you can pay two to six dollars for a fentanyl tablet one final point i want to go back to returning to this fake pills concept dying from fentanyl is poisoning it's not an overdose that's poisoning if an unsuspecting student takes a fake adderal pill they purchased online or wherever they purchased and dies that's poisoning and the criminals should be tried for murder at least that's how i see it mr chester with securing borders and decreasing smuggling impact the fentanyl crisis uh yes senator i mean as as i said uh in in response to senator murphy as well the men and women that we have at our southern border are the finest we understand but you agree it would have a significant impact dr jones same question would securing our borders and decreasing the smuggling the easy access to fentanyl impact the crisis i would reiterate uh mr chester's points about the efforts in the national drug control strategy to address but they're not working you can reiterate the points but obviously with a 600 increase in deaths whatever we're trying to do reiterating the points forming committees talking to people something's not working dr jones do you believe we should apply title iv to drug smuggling across the southern border title 42 is rooted in protecting public health from communicable diseases so while there is a declared 319 public health emergency for the opioid crisis it falls outside of the scope of title 42. okay um mr chester you stated that first the most important action we can do right now is to get more naloxone out you know as a physician that's like telling me to give people with brain tumors tylenol to say that that's the most important thing do you really feel that giving out naloxone would have a bigger impact than securing our borders senator by by most important thing what i meant was most important thing in saving lives now because it can reduce an opioid overdose but that is not exclusive of all the work that's being done at the southern border and with other countries and with the postal inspection service and all of the other means that we do to keep the drugs out of our communities the naloxone is designed to reduce and overdose death and save a life immediately you know what we're doing now is we're putting a finger in the dike and the entire dike is giving away if we don't secure our borders this epidemic is only going to get worse mr chester you also stated that the u.s routinely engages with the people's republic of china to address shipments and you go on to say the prc's actions in that regard have a direct and positive impact how can you objectively quantitatively substantiate your statement when we're seeing a 600 percent increase in deaths i know you're talking to them i know there's collaboration but what's your objective evidence that says that china is doing anything to slow this machine down the best example i can give you is the work that we did with china prior to may of 2019 when china class scheduled all fentanyl-related substances and as a result the direct shipment of fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances from china to the united states went down to almost zero now that was in 2019 that that was in 2019 yes sir and now the traffickers moved from producing finnish fentanyl into precursor chemicals which they supplied to mexican suppliers and that went up but that that speaks to the dynamic and interactive nature of very determined profit driven so quantitatively what have you done that can show me that we've impacted that what what what is there any objective evidence that we've impacted china's uh supplying this i mean they're sending it to us like we send wheat to them they're the the number of seizures of precursor chemicals and pre-precursor chemicals in the western hemisphere has been consistently high and in many of those cases that was due to cooperation with chinese officials or subsequent to the seizure the information was sent to the chinese officials so that they could take action and hold the individuals responsible well thank you man i'm sure i yield back but the point is the seizures are going up because objectively china is not doing is not stopping the supply of these precursors thank you i yield back

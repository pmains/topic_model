joining us now democratic congresswoman karen bass of california she's a member of the house judiciary committee and a former chair of the congressional black caucus jason johnson of course still with us um congresswoman your thoughts to joe biden saying what everyone that was on our air yesterday noticed and said and what jason and i have been talking about since the top of the hour well what an incredible breath of fresh air it just makes me hope that these next 13 days go by as fast as possible imagine a president acknowledging the differences in terms of treatment it was shocking yesterday and to have that acknowledged by the incoming president it just feels fills me up with incredible hope and then today the appointments that that he made you know long-standing civil rights activists uh who are going to be a part of the department of justice was very exciting with vanita gupta and kristen clarke congresswoman eric swalwall said on this program in the last hour that what he wanted to get to the bottom of in any investigation of what happened yesterday on the capitol was whether or not there was help from the inside and i don't know exactly what he meant members or or perhaps the police what what what are your concerns in that area and do you share his wanting to get to the bottom of that well i absolutely believe that we have to get to the bottom of it you know ironically i had told my family that i was very worried about being out on the street in dc uh yesterday and and the day before but that i was going to be in the capitol and that was the safest place in the country needless to say i would have never imagined in a million years that the capitol police would have been overrun like that it is just inexcusable it's my understanding that their forces over 2 000 people and there were 500 on duty and so what is the explanation that's why i thought it was so important to publicize the pictures they acted with complete impunity i mean as you mentioned a few minutes ago and so i do think that we have to look at everything you see officers taking selfies with trespassers they comp they uh committed violence vandalism and so how can all of that happen you can't even bring a purse in the capitol without going through security how do you bring in a flagpole well have you had any conversations with capitol police or have have they offered any explanations yes i did have uh um discussions with capitol police now it was just you know uh ad hoc just talking to them and asking them what the heck happened here and basically they said that they were just overrun i said why didn't you arrest people well we couldn't arrest people because there were too many protesters and it really enraged me because i could only imagine what would have happened had it been a black lives matter protest or had the majority of the protesters been uh african-american that was domestic terrorism they found molotov cocktails people were armed they found i don't know if they were fake or they were just bombs that didn't go off i mean just imagine that watching people catapult on the capital using ropes you know vandalizing pelosi's office standing on statues it was just unbelievable and how on earth did that happen you know it reminded me of kyle rittenhouse after the kenosha wisconsin after the shooting of jacob blake he walks down the street with a rifle in his hand after having killed two people shot one person the police officers giving water and send him on his way the disparity that exists in this country when it comes to policing but you know what we won the senate yesterday i am hoping that as soon as president biden and vice president harris are in we can get the george floyd justice and policing act signed we can get the john lewis voting rights bill signed so i'm thinking in a hopeful way as well

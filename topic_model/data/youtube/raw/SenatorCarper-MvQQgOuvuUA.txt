you know on a day that's beautiful it's uh i almost feel like we have not a care in the world but as it turns out we got a whole lot of carers and among the cares that we have are when we uh pull up to a gas pump and fill up our vehicles with uh with uh with fuel uh we send a lot of money to places around the world to uh to countries that are unstable on democratic and i'm afraid that uh in too many instances they actually use our money to to try to hurt us and we ought to be smarter than than doing that there's a the national security aspect to what senator merkley's uh trying to do here sometimes we lose sight of but it's a very important part of it and i just applied his efforts to help make sure that as we move toward 2016 when the requirement of fuel efficiency fleet average reaches 35 miles per gallon that we won't just stop there that we'll keep on going we're trying to set a good example in in delaware delaware for uh for many years was the only uh state in which there was auto assembly operations and uh we lost it literally in 2009 within a six-month period our chrysler plant durango's hybrid durangos we lost our g implant where we built pontiac solstices and saturn skies they went away and the idea was at least at the time that neither plant would ever be opened again well guess what we're going to open uh the gm plant it's already open and the work's going on and then late next year we'll have about 2 500 people there building a fisker product uh fisker product kindred fixes one of premier uh auto designers really in the world and he's starting a small car company and they're gonna be building vehicles that'll get about 80 miles per gallon 80 miles per gallon drop dead beautiful cars with that kind of mileage and what we want to do is to incentivize more that that is that's what's possible you know with the chevrolet volts and we have nissan leaf we want to make sure that when people call our offices as they have whether it's uh jeff or or or michael bennett they call our office and say oh i'm concerned about the price of oil we want to be able to say well there's like here's a list of 40 vehicles that you can buy in this country that actually get 30 or 40 miles or 50 miles per gallon and think about this the next time you're making a purchase so what that's one number one get ourselves off of foreign oil at the same time while we do that find ways to develop products cars vehicles in this country that we can build with new technology and sell not just in this country around the world the fiscal products that we're going to be manufacturing late next year at our old gm plant in wilmington delaware uh we'll go about half of them be sold in this country half of them be sold around the world got a fixed uh wilmington port of wilmington auto terminal we're ready to roll so that's number one uh that's what i call turning uh taking uh adversity and turning it into opportunity uh number two i i come to work uh almost every day on the train and i drive my car we live uh just about 10 minutes from the train station in wilmington and i get on the train and uh right across the uh the right by the train station is a we have a line of cabs so people can come to take the train by a cab and then right across the street from the train station's a bus station and so you have the opportunity to drive your own car have the opportunity to take a cab to the train station you have the opportunity to bus maybe an interstate bus or local bus and you have the the opportunity to walk i mean there's like it's multimodal it's a multi-mode we come down on the train to uh uh to uh bwi just south of baltimore people can get off the train take a shuttle go catch a plane and that's the that's those are the kinds of connections that uh that are smart and and makes sense and the idea is to kind of like make them all work together in an intermodal way and to meet the the individual needs we have as people part of what uh senator murphy's trying to do here is to to not only ensure ensure that people have smart choices for more energy efficient vehicles to reduce sort of depends on foreign oil but also to make sure that we have options to get out of our cars trucks and vans and maybe take a cab maybe walk maybe take a bus maybe take a transfer train in our in our neighborhood we take septa but uh make sure that we have those options available and that that we used it and i was pleased to offer legislation in the last countries called clean tea that helps to actually make a fair amount of money available for for that purpose and i'm delighted that uh senator merkley's included that in in this uh in this bill the last thing i'll say uh we centers and tend to say a lot of things through the eyes of our own state than that and in our city we have a little company called dupont they've been around for a long time and they've just they've gotten very much into uh the business of biofuels they think it should be possible for us to fuel ourselves and to feed ourselves and it wasn't that long ago that you'd raise an acre of corn and maybe get 75 bushels of corn off an acre before long we'll be up to 200 250 bushels of corn for acre and i've never been a big advocate of corn ethanol as an ad as an option to fuel our vehicles but the idea of using the the stock of the corn the ears of the corn the leaves of the corn create cellulosic ethanol cellulitic ethanol that actually has better energy density travels better in pipelines mixes better with gasoline there's all kinds of biofuel work that's going on we need to do more of that and some of it is really exciting better energy density fewer environmental consequences and again the legislation that he's proposed uh moves us in that direction so think about it more energy efficient vehicles that's great number two help people get out of their cars trucks and vans and take other modes of transportation that makes sense they're not kind of linked together in a smart way and number three for those of us are still going to be needing fuel to fuel our vehicles and we can't harvest the wind maybe just yet off of uh rehoboth beach delaware but we'll be able to to grow our way out of this with with uh fuels that are a lot smarter than corn ethanol that's the way we want to go in the direction we need to go this man is leading us and i'm proud to be in this parade with him thank you you

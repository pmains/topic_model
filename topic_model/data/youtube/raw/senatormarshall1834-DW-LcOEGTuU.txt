joining us to discuss is republican senator from kansas roger marshall thank you so much for joining us senator marshall so i'd like to get your thoughts first on this infrastructure plan this deal that allegedly has been met and apparently uh senator joe manchin may be on board as well uh your thoughts on that just adding more spending on top of the rising prices and the inflation that we're already seeing how will that impact things oh my gosh i've been telling people for months to grab your wallets this is the tax tax and spend bill from hell for everybody it's going to drive up inflation it's going to keep us from having good roads bridges and schools in the future because we'll be trying to pay off of our debt i think that this is a non-starter on the other hand i wanted to share with you that most republicans are in favor of an affordable infrastructure plan that leads to good roads into good bridges something that paves our way towards a great future but here the white house again is putting up roadblocks down every path that we're trying to take now senator i want to come to you because you know at some point people's heads start spinning we start talking about trillions of dollars after more trillions of dollars people can't even comprehend that amount of money truth be told we can't even spend that amount of money that's why there's so much back loaded money in that going out five years seven years eight years why can't we get some type of consensus amongst common sense uh senators and and members of the house to just say why don't we reallocate the money we've already allocated to deal with the eminent threats facing the american people you know that's a great question but that's exactly how i would pay for the infrastructure a bill that i want to do i think i would repurpose a trillion dollars at setting there and use it for infrastructure rather than social programs but you're absolutely right and we on a bipartisan basis the senate has done exactly that but this white house continues to reject it because they want the leftist socialist policies uh that's driving their party right now and this a 3.5 trillion dollar plan it includes i think what 600 billion dollars in new infrastructure but uh their definition of infrastructure as we've discussed before includes social programs it includes family planning it includes climate change um a lot of things that folks don't consider real needs when it comes to real infrastructure you know you're right and one more point just following up with with joe's comments there is that i cannot understand three and a half trillion dollars but i do understand many americans are paying a hundred dollars more a week for gasoline right now that's what we're feeling right now this will continue to impact inflation but you're right this is not an infrastructure bill this is uh the gringo deal this is social regulations uh adding more and more regulations and don't forget the tax part of this they want to drive up your taxes which is going to kill the economy now i want to you know think one of the things we haven't talked about enough in my opinion is the impact that this type of inflation has on seniors you talk about those individuals living on a fixed income who sat down with financial advisors came up with a pool of money they thought would last them for the rest of their lives they may need to go back to those advisors and find out uh that turns out they're going to need to start adding more money finding new resources or tightening that belt in ways that are not possible yeah joe that's spot on again just great economic analysis here that inflation is really the greatest social injustice you could do to somebody this is a regressive tax and people who are going to really fulfill it are those young hard-working families living paycheck to paycheck as well as well as seniors like my parents are at home living from paycheck to paycheck as well so this type of inflation disproportionately hurts those that are that are economically challenged yeah remember back in june uh when federal reserve chairman jerome powell said this about prices going back to the prices that you were referencing listen really the problem now is is that uh demand is very very strong incomes are high people have money on their uh in the bank accounts uh demand for goods is extremely high and it hasn't uh hasn't come down we're seeing the service sector reopening and so you're seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there so we have this rebound in spending along with this widespread supply shortages and they've come together and created what we're dealing with now with the rise in prices that everyone's going to have to pay for and then on top of that what you were just referencing taxes that are on the way that really aren't going to just impact what the top one percent it's going to impact everyone across the board yeah exactly so these as long as we have these socialistic policies inflation's going to continue as long as we keep borrowing money as long as we keep printing money as long as we keep paying people more to stay at home but then to go to work we're going to continue to have bottlenecks in the manufacturing sector you know we don't and we don't have truck drivers to drive their products to market after we make them as well so these policies are what's driving this crisis it's one crisis after another that this administration is creating absolutely well senator marshall we appreciate you helping to sound the alarm on this we look forward to touching base with you again soon to see how this continues to develop down in dc thank you so much talk to you soon you're welcome thank you everybody

and we've seen some of those real policies make their way into our backyard right here in Marion Iowa so my boys are in the Lamar School District they're about to get off the bus hopefully in about 10 minutes but just before the end of the last school year they pass the policy that allows for a boy to go to school and say that he wants to be a girl they can use the girls bathroom girls locker room even room with a girl on an overnight field trip if they associate and the kicker is they're not going to tell the parents so I think that's apparently wrong parents should be deciding what's best for the well-being and the mental health of our children not the schools and they've clearly decided that they know better but what do we know parents matter kids belong to parents kids don't belong to the government and we have to stand up and stand against those who continue to lure the line and indoctrinate our kids foreign

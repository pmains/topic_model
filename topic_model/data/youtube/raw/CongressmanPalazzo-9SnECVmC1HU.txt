  PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OUR OR PO ROUSE BORDERS AND THE   INABILITY OF WASHINGTON TO GET   THINGS DONE. EVERY DAY THAT WE FAIL TO SECURE THESE BORDERS, MORE DRUG   RUNNERS, HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND   VIOLENT CRIMINALS INTO OUR --  ENTER OUR COMMUNITIES. IT IS TIME WE QUIT PLAYING   POLITICS AND GIVE THE AMERICAN   PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT AND WHAT   THEY VOTED FOR.  THOUGH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS   PUSHED THE TOPIC INTO THE  SPOTLIGHT, THE IDEA OF A WALL IS NOTHING NEW. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABA WALL  FOR DECADES. THIS IS NOT A WORK IN PROGRESS.  THIS IS A FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP. PRESIDENTS, REPUBLICAN AND   DEMOCRAT ALIKE, HAVE FAILED TO   SECURE OUR BORDER. IT IS TIME FOR THE PRESIDENT TO  TAKE EMERGENCY ACTION AND MAKE   NO MISTAKE, OUR BORDER SECURITY  ABSOLUTELY CONSTITUTES A   NATIONAL EMERGENCY.  EVERY KAY OUR BRAVE SOLDIERS ARE BREAKING THEIR BACKS TO SUPPORT  OUR NATIONAL SECURITY ACROSS THE GLOBE, YET WE CAN'T SECURE OUR   OWN COUNTRY HERE AT HOME.  IF YOU WERE TO ASK ANY OF THEM   WHAT THE PRIORITY IN THIS NATION IS, I THINK YOU'D RECEIVE A  RESOUNDING SUPPORT FAR BORDER  WALL AND BORDER SECURITY.  WE SIMPLY CANNOT CONTINUE TO   OPERATE AS WE HAVE.  THE TIME HAS COME FOR OUR  PRESIDENT TO TAKE DECISIVE   ACTION AND I URGE HIM TO DO  EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO BUILD THIS WALL. I YIELD BACK THE BALANCE OF MY   TIME.

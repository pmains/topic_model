okay at this time um i'd like to call up united states representative for hawaii's first congressional district congressman to my colleague and friend congressman our incredible guests that are here today and to our friends that are watching aloha you know as i stand with you here today and as i am with you today i have so many conflicting thoughts and emotions we of course here are on hello grounds we are on ground that for centuries now has stood for the very best of humanity and yet we are on ground that would at a bare minimum tolerate the overthrow of the planet we are on grounds that is educated and advanced equality opportunity compassion and justice and yet has seen so much toleration and tragedy towards our country's indigenous people we're on ground but just six or eight months ago we celebrated the passing of one of the great icons of the civil rights movement john lewis and yet it is this very ground that saw an attack on our capital by our own fellow citizens a lot of contradictions and yet this was also the ground that could heal came to 120 years ago he spoke then of the urgency and despair of a people facing extinction in their own land and that was no idle concern it had happened to other indigenous peoples throughout our country and throughout the world there were just perhaps 40 000 native hawaiians left in the world the life expectancy of native hawaiians in 1910 was 30 years they were increasingly living not on the land but in the tenements of honolulu in dire circumstances and yet kuhio entrusted his people to this still new country a country that frankly had not shown that it was deserving of that trust the hawaiian homes commission act as congressman kelly and said was his singular accomplishment but what was kuhio's legacy what did it all add up to you know history is fickle we're all judged by our successes and failures our achievements and our shortcomings always in hindsight of course but i would say this about kuhio looking from the distance of history and as someone who is not myself made of wine first of all he was the right person at the time not just for native hawaiians but for all of us for all of us whose ancestry and what lies in what the kanaka maoli did not unlike many of their brothers and sisters feed from his faith in this earth in fact we now number you now number hundreds of thousands throughout our country fulfilling responsibilities at every level of government and society and finally i would say that kudio as the first native hawaiian leader to step forward on the national stage shows what proud and principled and capable hawaiian leadership is except for so many of us going down the road but history is never complete and today we are just at one moment in history and the hawaiian homes commission is a perfect example um as one kanakamali leader said recently she said it was beautifully conceived and yet imperfectly administered implemented and it is its own story and now we have to turn that page and today i follow and support congressman connelly in finding the next chapter for yesterday's achievements are just tomorrow's foundations and yesterday's failures are just tomorrow's opportunities and so i am to sit here with you all uh just so deeply humbled with the responsibility for all of us for whom hawaii is our home partner with you and these next chapters is

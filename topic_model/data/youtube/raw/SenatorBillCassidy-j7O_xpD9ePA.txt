thank you madam chair um mr mr ness we was recently widely publicized that oil being released from the strategic petroleum reserve was going overseas and so i inquire with industry they tell me they're at 95 capacity so when the administration decided to release more oil for whatever reason they didn't think about the need to process that oil into gasoline now we inquired further and we found that due to a variety of reasons demand destruction policy regulatory pressures associated with a desire to move away from petroleum-derived fuels that isn't the driver that's the administration's policy there's been a closure or repurposing of seven petroleum refineries since the start of 2020. there's been two additional refineries with total capacity of four hundred thousand barrels per day announced that they will close a repurposed by the end of 2023 now is it at all possible to lower the price beyond demand destruction is there any reasonable way to lower the price of the pump if we have lower and lower refinery capacity as we go forward no matter what our oil supply is senator cassidy i think those numbers are astounding and uh i urge this committee to look in to some of the demand destruction on the refining side and certainly uh what about the regulatory process you mentioned regulatory if the regulators are making it hard to keep it open uh and therefore they're closing because the cost of compliance is so expensive um any thoughts on that there are serious concerns uh throughout industry when you look at the rin credits on the conversion of these fuels now to bio biofuel facilities which are taking basically oil and gas refining supply off the market in a conversion of those because of the value of these credits and a lot of that so just just for people who may not be familiar with this there's tax credits encouraging the use of the manufacture of biodiesel that makes it more profitable to make biodiesel kind of a a niche product but that takes refining capacity off to produce gasoline which americans are paying so much for and some of this is ethanol which means that corn which could be used to lower the price in the grocery store to feed people in ethiopia is being used to make biofuel um as a um you know we all know the reasons why we do it but nonetheless we're diverting food stock uh when there's inflation in the grocery market to make biofuel and wrens is how you encourage people the refineries to use it but the rents have become more expensive the rent costs are punishing to american small refineries in particular punishing the larger fighters but under the previous administration the small refiners were not required to buy wrens as i recall i'm told that this administration is recalling this is requiring the small refiners to buy these rents which increases their cost of production which is putting them out of business is that a correct assessment you are correct they are trans transitioning those refineries to uh biofuel refineries which we have one in our own state about 20 000 barrels a day uh about a diesel refinery uh using bakken oil that is now uh it's a good project for north dakota overall but the overall uh assessment of of demand daily in production and supply of oil and gasoline should be looked at in this in this discussion so the person who's watching this from home on c-span may see are watching on youtube or whatever when the administration says they're doing everything possible to lower the price of gasoline they've actually got a set of policies which are putting refineries out of business which makes it absolutely impossible to lower the price at the pump no matter how much oil we release from the strategic petroleum reserve or begged the leader of saudi arabia to release senator i would say we need to look at american oil and gas production opportunities and and support that production that will hopefully also drive drive the price of crude oil lower which is the feedstock for all of these facilities i get that but on the other hand if we don't have refinery capacity we can produce all the oil in the world we're not going to get there correct you are correct our consumption is not going down it's going to go up i've been calling for an operation warp speed in which instead of just looking at one part of the supply in isolation without considering my gosh we got to be able to refine it that would look at everything as a continuum work out the regulatory policies in a coherent fashion so when the president gets up and says he's doing everything possible we can actually take him at his word except then reading about how refinery capacity is being destroyed because of regulations and being frustrated because we're paying so much at the pump um madam chair yield thank you

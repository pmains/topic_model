[Music] joining me right now is kentucky senator senate foreign relations committee and homeland and governmental affairs committee member rand paul senator it's great to see you this morning thank you so much for joining us you didn't want to spend any more money right you're looking at 22 trillion dollars in debt and raising your hand one of the few to do so in the senate well it's not that i don't want to spend any more money it's that we have no money i mean we're on a normal budget year we borrow about a trillion dollars which was already a big problem for us but then we've added three trillion in borrowing this spring now we're on par or on goal to set to borrow maybe another trillion or two and it's money we don't have so the virus came from china and now we're borrowing money from china to pay for the virus it isn't good for the country it doesn't make us stronger and ultimately there will be repercussions in fact i talk to investors every day who say there are undercurrents of real worry about adding so much debt in such a short period of time and that perhaps the stock market's rise is illusory and that there will be a correction as people begin to realize how much of the unemployment may stick with us for a long time yeah i'm really glad you're raising this and you continue to be the person with uh the responsibility uh awareness of this federal deficit and its impact ted cruz also raising his hand about this skyrocketing deficit during the coronavirus pandemic reaching 2.8 trillion dollars between october 19 and july a 224 increase from the same period last year in terms of the deficit senator what is the solution then how do you get the economy back up and running get the money that people need to feel secure to go back to work well first of all if you're going to pass out free money you should pay for it and one way to pay for it i have an amendment that would actually pay for another two trillion dollars or the previous two trillion dollars that would be simply freezing federal spending for three years i think that's the least we can do but ask your democrat guest how many will vote for it and ask your republican leadership guest how many people will vote for a freeze but a three year freeze uh prevents us from spending an additional two two and a half trillion dollars and actually would pay for this in a responsible way and i think wall street would respond very favorably if you were to say you know what we've done this in this dire circumstances but we're going to pay for it by freezing spending i think wall street would say my goodness that's for the first time in forever congress is actually acting responsibly but in addition you have to open the economy here's my fear because fear mongering is spread throughout the media on many of the different channels we're going to get to november or december and if the economy's still closed and these governors and everybody's still going hysterical and saying we can't open the schools and we can't do this you know what's going to happen in november and december they're going to come back and want another trillion or 2 trillion we can't keep doing this when you print money or the fed creates money or we borrow it there are repercussions i talked to a fairly wealthy investor the other day who said that they are very very concerned and they think it's already baked in that wall street is beginning to know and to understand what the ramifications of all this borrowing will be on our currency the value of our currency they point to gold at about 2 000 an ounce and gone up dramatically in the last year as people already hedging their bet against the dollar yeah i mean this is one issue that basically makes the us more reliant on china right and here we are in an economic uh in economic software with them in terms of many of the behaviors that we've seen i want to take a break with you but come back senator and talk more about what you would expect from the chinese communist party in such an environment as we have rates at rock bottom levels and 22 trillion dollars in debt stay with us we're talking with senator rand paul and we'll be right back with more welcome back and back with me this morning is kentucky senator rand paul and we're talking about 2020 and the economy and senator we're talking about all of this debt and the process right now of coming up with more stimulus that means spending more money markets have not cared about this because we've got zero percent interest rates so you're not seeing the cost of holding this debt but markets don't care until they care right and then you have a market disruption what are your thoughts on the debt that we have right now and this ability to spend more money and impact markets and the economy you could have said the same thing between 2002 and 2007 that the market didn't care about everybody buying homes with zero interest zero percent down and that they didn't care until they cared and you're exactly right all of a sudden they cared and what happens with the markets from my perspective is that it becomes like the tail of the emperor has no clothes when they finally discover that the impression of clothes like oh my goodness sempra has no clothes and they scoot away from these investments and you have dramatic things happen in the market i mean there's gradualism in the market but they're also dramatic things so right now the federal reserve manipulates interest rates i don't think that they are true market interest rates they keep them very low the government can borrow lots of money and pay it back at a very small amount as far as the fees however there comes a time when i think the federal reserve cannot control interest rates one indication already though that the market is not complacent about the debts is the price of gold um you know gold price is probably up 40 in the last year or more or maybe higher than that but uh gold at two thousand dollars an ounce is an indication that at least a certain percentage of the investors are covering their butts on this that are concerned about what happens and what i don't want to see is an unraveling of the currency where everybody says we're so strong with the reserve currency we literally are the cleanest shirt in a closet full of dirty shirts and there is a time in which people recognize that and i don't know if it happens gradually that other currencies rise to prominence or if it happens suddenly but i don't want to see us have zimbabwe's currency anytime soon senator let me ask you about kamala harris you've worked with uh senator harris in the senate for years they held their first appearance as as running mates joe biden and kamala harris did yesterday they both slammed president trump and his handling of the economy but the president told me moments ago that if biden was elected we could see the greatest economic depression in history your thoughts on what we need to know about senator kamala harris as the vice presidential pick and will we actually see a recovery in the economy should the president get reelected what is the impact under vice president biden you know a few years ago i worked with her on some reforms and we did work pretty well together as we've gotten closer to the election i think it's harder for her to work with me and we've tried very hard in recent times to fix one of the bills she's advocated for and it's ended up being more symbolism and partisan red meat she's thrown back and an inability really to actually talk with my office we've tried repeatedly to talk to her in her office and we get no feedback we only get public sort of you know admonition that we're somehow a racist or something that i think is very unfair and i think that's a dumbing down of things that happen as you get close to elections i do think the democrats made a good choice in the sense that i think they need to reassure their voters that should should biden's mental health and mental faculties not be sufficient that there's someone younger who's mentally able and agile enough to occupy the office and i think that is a concern and more and more for people in the middle they will be concerned as the debates unfold whether or not president or a future or possible president biden has the mental faculties to run the country and so i think that will become a more significant issue as we get to the debates and i think they're petrified of the debates because i think president trump will run circles around uh joe biden so so what you're saying is we should really be looking at kamala harris as a potential president should joe biden step back for any reason maybe the cognitive issues we should really be looking at kamala harris differently than we've looked at past vice presidential candidates yeah i think there's a much higher percentage chance that she would have to fill the real role and duty of the presidency but i also think that we should be looking at um biden's sort of uh a belief that he has to buy off certain constituencies on the left so his uh sort of trying to get the bernie sanders vote he's having to become so progressive that even though he says he's not for defunding the police he's just for shifting the money around and so you know when uh somebody interviewed the president i can't remember and they said oh well mr president he you know biden's really not for defunding the police well he has said he will shift the dollars around how is that different than defunding the police i think he has accepted a lot of the agenda of the radical left and i think there is a middle part of america that isn't very partisan doesn't watch the news channels doesn't talk politics all the time but it is worried about their safety and uh you know i think there's a large portion of the african-american population that lives in chicago that has felt left behind for so long with the violence in the streets that nobody seems to care about the teenage kids that have been killed in chicago time and time again unbelievable you're right you're making a lot of important points senator thank you sir we will see you soon senator rand paul

so wyd Thank You mr. chairman mr. Chairman I want to echo your comments with respect to health care costs and for our witnesses this week's congressional quarterly the cover page says a crisis in plain sight as Washington does nothing the challenge of an aging population is quickly overwhelming the system and that is why I'd like to turn to Medicare to get a reaction from both of you the longer I go and and of course the program has changed pretty dramatically since gray Panther days and I think I've talked about this with both of you the ball game to a great extent is those with multiple chronic conditions seventy percent of Medicare costs go for those with three or more multiple chronic conditions so to a great extent if we can find ways to ensure that those folks get quality care that is more affordable we're going to go a long way to fix Medicare now I think they're generally is bipartisan support for approaches that integrate services that we move away from this approach where someone who say has diabetes or pulmonary health issues just goes and gets services physician by physician and ends up without a care plan eventually goes to hospital emergency room the accountable care organizations go certainly in the right direction in this regard but it seems to me that considerably more has to be done and I be interested in your views on this question of how we're going to deal with what I think is really the heart of an effective reform strategy with Medicare and that is dealing with those with multiple chronic conditions and either one of you to go first well this is I think you're absolutely right senator and this is just the sort of thing I had in mind when I said we don't have all the knowledge we need right now to like write a piece of legislation that mandates how to do the care integration we have mortal earn some of the innovations going on in the private sector or hopeful as you know there are individual examples of individual medical systems the do it better and save money there also is a whole array of state-run demonstration projects particularly focusing on integrating care better for the dual eligibles that are starting up this year and we need to rigorous pursue these and rigorously evaluate these and try and set ourselves a goal that as we learn how to do this in ways that both improve quality and save money as you suggest then we need to adopt them and implement them in in Medicare and Medicaid sadly we don't have the silver bullet or know exactly how to do it yet but as you say it's one of the most important things for us to learn and adopt as we find the answers again it's a very important problem the Medicare system was designed for an era of acute care as the the primary medical expense we now have chronic hair as its leading problem in multiple comorbidities as the the typical expensive Medicare patients so moving the focus on that and integrated care is very important I would I would say a couple things number one I've started an organization called the partnership of the future of Medicare with Ken Thorpe bipartisan effort to guide reforms that are sustainable for Medicare we've put out some quote guardrails good do's and don'ts on Medicare reform which I can provide to and we will be happy to and one of the things that going forward is we need more options that provide the integrated care we are concerned about the cuts to medicare advantage because it's an integrated platform you may or may not like that I don't want to get in a debate over Medicare Advantage per se but having less not more as a mistake you need patient buy-in you cannot simply litter the landscape with smart health innovations and expect the world to change patients have to buy in both interruption I interrupt you on that point because senator Portman is here and he and I have introduced the first bill that essentially would reward those who stop smoking lower their blood pressure lower their cholesterol it's really based on the work that was done at the Cleveland Clinic and Oregon Health Sciences Center I gathered that you feel that those kinds of behavioral changes it's time that that would be part of the program yeah and I'd love to see I don't know the specifics will be happy to look at mr. Greenstein you are right with that because i think in senator baucus we all remember that in the Affordable Care Act we began to start to integrate those preventive incentives and Senator Carper did some particularly good work on that as we recall for those under 65 but we haven't begun to build that in in terms of those over 65 and I think Oregon Health Sciences and the Cleveland Clinic kind of provide that that model and I think it's time for those kind of behavioral changes and I appreciate both of you being interested my time is up sorry Grassley

  BILL --  >> HERE'S SOMEONE ELSE WITH THIS HISTORY, JOHN. THIS IS CHRIS MURPHY OF  CONNECTICUT. >> WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHY DO YOU SPEND ALL THIS TIME  RUNNING FOR THE UNITED STATES  SENATE? WHY DO YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE  HASSLE OF GETTING THIS JOB, OF  PUTTING YOURSELF IN A POSITION  OF AUTHORITY, IF YOUR ANSWER IS  THAT, AS THE SLAUGHTER  INCREASES, AS OUR KIDS RUN FOR  THEIR LIVES, WE DO NOTHING. WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHY ARE YOU HERE? IF NOT TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AS  EXISTENTIAL AS THIS. THIS ISN'T INEVITABLE. THESE KIDS WEREN'T UNLUCKY. THIS ONLY HAPPENS IN THIS  COUNTRY. AND NOWHERE ELSE. NOWHERE ELSE DO LITTLE KIDS GO  TO SCHOOL THINKING THEY MIGHT BE SHOT THAT DAY. NOWHERE ELSE DO PARENTS HAVE TO  TALK TO THEIR KIDS ABOUT WHY  THEY GOT LOCKED INTO A BATHROOM  AND TOLD TO BE QUIET JUST IN  CASE A BAD MAN ENTERED THAT  BUILDING. NOWHERE ELSE DOES THAT HAPPEN  EXCEPT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND IT IS A CHOICE. IT IS OUR CHOICE TO LET IT  CONTINUE. WHAT ARE WE DOING? IN SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AFTER THOSE KIDS CAME BACK INTO  THOSE CLASSROOMS, THEY HAD TO  ADOPT A PRACTICE IN WHICH THERE  WOULD BE A SAFE WORD THAT THE  KIDS WOULD SAY IF THEY STARTED  TO GET THOUGHTS IN THEIR BRAIN  ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW THAT DAY. IF THEY STARTED TO GET  NIGHTMARES DURING THE DAY,  RELIVING STEPPING OVER THEIR  CLASSMATES' BODIES AS THEY TRIED TO FLEE THE SCHOOL. IN ONE CLASSROOM, THAT WORD  WAS "MONKEY." AND OVER AND OVER, THROUGH THE  DAY, KIDS WOULD STAND UP AND  YELL "MONKEY" AND A TEACHER R  PARAPROFESSIONAL WOULD HAVE TO  GO TO THAT KID, TAKE THEM OUT OF THE CLASSROOM, TALK TO THEM  ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD SEEN, WORK  THEM THROUGH THEIR ISSUES. SANDY HOOK WILL NEVER, EVER BE  THE SAME. THIS COMMUNITY IN TEXAS WILL  NEVER, EVER BE THE SAME. WHY? WHY ARE WE HERE? IF NOT TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT  FEWER SCHOOLS AND FEWER  COMMUNITIES GO THROUGH WHAT  SANDY HOOK HAS GONE THROUGH,  WHAT UVALDE IS GOING THROUGH. OUR HEART IS BREAKING FOR THESE  FAMILIES. EVERY OUNCE OF LOVE AND THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS WE CAN SEND, WE ARE  SENDING. BUT I'M HERE ON THIS FLOOR TO  BEG, TO LITERALLY GET DOWN ON MY HANDS AND KNEES AND BEG MY  COLLEAGUES, FIND A PATH FORWARD  HERE. WORK WITH US T

on and thank you for joining us for this important town hall on insulin affordability um we're very very pleased today um to have you all participate with us and learn more about this important topic i'm delighted to kick this off by introducing u.s senator alex padilla senator padilla is california's junior senator he's the proud son of immigrants from mexico and attended los angeles public schools he is a california man he is a graduate of mit where he earned a bachelor's of science degree in mechanical engineering he serves as the chairman of the senate judiciary subcommittee on immigration citizenship and border safety he is also a member of the senate committees on budget environment public works homeland security and governmental affairs judiciary and rules before becoming a member of congress the senator served as california's first latino secretary of state and was a state senator senator padilla is also a past chair of the los angeles community or the los angeles the american diabetes association's los angeles community leadership board today he lives in the san fernando valley with his wife and their three sons welcome senator padilla so thank you lisa and thank you everybody for joining us today to talk about the important conversation about not just bringing down costs for working families but bringing down specifically the cost for essential medical care before i get into the topic of today i know we have a viewers from throughout the state of california so i just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that yes i in my office are aware of the shelter in place order uh in in and around the uc berkeley community so if there's anybody that's joining us from that region please uh we have to continue to heed the advisories of law enforcement until uh we learned more about the situation and everything is uh cleared uh to be safe so uh with that uh just wanted to return to the the topic at hand and say that i'm proud to be a long-time partner of the american diabetes association as lisa mentioned back in 2005 when i was serving on the los angeles city council my involvement as a volunteer and as advocates with the los angeles leadership council including serving as a chair of the local council soon after that i was elected to the california state senate that was in 2006 and it should surprise no one that the very first law that i introduced and was eventually signed called on the state of california to be the first state in the nation to require chain restaurants to post calorie information directly on menus and menu boards in an effort to address the growing rates of obesity and diabetes by uh giving individuals and families the tools they needed to make informed decisions when eating out manual labeling yes california was the first state in the nation to adopt the law uh was later included in the affordable care act and is now national policy so my involvement has been uh for a long long time and i got involved in the cause because of my own personal connection uh to the issue and to diabetes yes diabetes runs in my family uh not just uh cousins and uncles and aunts but my mom uh worked hard to manage her type 2 for many many years and many times it was a struggle it was a challenge i'm happy to share that publicly because to talk about it more but also i know that our family is far from alone in managing diabetes in fact more than 3.2 million californians are living with diabetes and rely on insulin to survive and maintain their quality of life diabetes is especially common and prevalent in black and latino communities and that's why lowering the cost of prescription drugs is so critical affordable health care too often is a question of life and death no person should have to ration their insulin or any other drug because of the cost and no parent should have to debate a trade-off between paying the rent or the mortgage and paying for insulin that keeps children safe and healthy that's why i'm proud to be a co-sponsor of the affordable insulin now act together working with my colleagues in the senate we'll be introducing a bill that would require medicare and private insurers to cap out-of-pocket insulin costs at 35 per month today californians with diabetes spend collectively 39.5 billion dollars every year just on insulin that's just on insulin so we're working to bring down the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs and other medical care to help put money back in the pocket of working families because at the end of the day health care is not a luxury it is a human right and families are already feeling the impact of higher prices in other areas including the gas station and the grocery store at the same time corporations in a number of sectors are taking home record profits so now is the time for congress to act to put a stop to outrageous prices for insulin that millions of patients depend on to survive and uh before i turn it back to you at least i know we're getting ready for a great dialogue here but i did want to offer a few words in spanish for spanish language media and our spanish language audience is not important i want to thank all the advocates

so welcome to all of our esteemed panelists and we'll begin dr prieta with you we've seen historic movement around insulin affordability and we would love it if you could share with our audience a little bit more about how that's unfolded thank you lisa and i also want to thank senator padilla and your staff for holding this town hall i've practiced family medicine in the valley for over 35 years and because of the genetic predisposition to diabetes that so many of our people have this has been california's own version of the diabetes belt and it has been ground zero for the diabetes epidemic for more than the last decade one of the most frequent complaints i've heard is not just how my patients are feeling what we should be talking about but that they can't afford their insulin and their diabetes supplies and other medications so they the ada is very pleased that so many people in and out of congress are paying attention to insulin affordability now but we've been working on this issue for over five years we convened a working group of experts and stakeholders who released a white paper on policy recommendations on insulin access and affordability ada experts and people with diabetes and parents of children with diabetes have testified before congress before state legislatures we've pushed for insulin copay caps and have now had those adopted in 20 states and the district of columbia we've worked with the administration with the bipartisan diabetes caucus other members on federal policies to impact a greater number of of people in need besides supporting the insulin affordability provisions that were in the build better act we have endorsed the affordable insulin now act that senator padilla mentioned and we strongly support the congressional diabetes caucus proposal that includes reforms to insulin rebates and a 35 monthly copay cap on out-of-pocket costs for patients for their insulin we support this legislation because it puts patients first which is in health care what we should always be doing our main objective is for people with diabetes to pay less at the pharmacy counter for the insulin that they need to live one in four insulin users have reported that they can't afford their medication and they ration or skip doses so that they can afford other life essentials so we at the ada think the diabetes caucus plan is a good thoughtful approach it targets multiple drivers of the cost of insulin it holds both drug manufacturers and insurance companies accountable for higher costs and and i'd like to make one final point insulin is not a new treatment or drug it was discovered and isolated from animals over 100 years ago and for many years for decades we used animal insulin from slaughterhouses to treat diabetes the last major innovations in insulin happened in the 1970s when scientists figured out how to make an exact copy of human insulin and in the 1990s when the insulin analogs were developed there's no good reason for insulin to be so expensive and it has only happened because we've put systems in place and incentives in place that have distorted the market and i think congress can do something to fix that thank you thank you dr prieto michelle welcome the health trust has been such a great partner for the american diabetes association on the issue of insulin affordability and we're glad to have him here today um so i'll turn it to you over to you thank you so much lisa and i first want to thank senator padilla for sharing his family's story with diabetes this story actually made me remember a day a few years ago when my son came home from middle school and found his dad a type 1 diabetic on the ground unresponsive suffering from low blood sugar and everybody's okay now but like the senator insulin affordability it's really close to home so i am michelle lew ceo of the health trust in san jose california in the heart of silicon valley and we know that some people think silicon valley is all teslas and billionaires and that's partially true but the reality is that a third of households in silicon valley don't make enough to fulfill their basic needs at the health trust we want everyone in our community to be as healthy as possible regardless of their income their zip code their race their gender etc as we've heard the majority of californians either have diabetes or pre-diabetes now here in our county santa clara county while only 10 of the population is diagnosed with diabetes one in two county residents have pre-diabetes and diabetes doesn't affect everybody in our county equally we're seeing a higher percentage of latino african-american and also vietnamese adults being diagnosed with diabetes compared to the white population and while the gender breakdown of folks with diabetes is similar between men and women we are finding that women are more likely than men to ration insulin due to the cost nearly 40 percent of americans don't have enough savings for a 400 emergency and the average cost of insulin is about 450 a month so the question for all of us i think becomes how much is the cost of insulin preventing americans with diabetes from acquiring savings for emergencies those emergencies could be a pandemic or a financial crisis caused by a pandemic and how much is the cost of insulin keeping individuals with diabetes in poverty especially in areas like silicon valley where the cost of living is so high for us access to affordable insulin means that individuals will be better able to regulate their diabetes they'll be able to fight illnesses better and prevent or delay long-term health consequences that accompany diabetes frequently such as vision loss or even amputations by capping insulin prices people with diabetes will not only live longer lives they'll live fuller and healthier life here in silicon valley and our work at the health trust we hear the stories of real life residents who are making that gut-wrenching choice between buying insulin paying rent or putting food on the table we can and in fact we must fix this problem and that's why we're so glad that senator padilla is leading the way for us thank you lisa i'll turn it back to you thank you so much and before i transition to dr kaufman i just want to make her uh send a reminder please put your questions and comments in the chat box and we'll begin to address them all right without further ado dr kaufman um we will welcome your remarks today thank you lisa and i'm just so honored to be here today with all of you and particularly with senator padilla who i did work with decades ago on some of the issues that are so close to his heart including diabetes and his real interest in diabetes came through so early not only for his own family but his constituents and obviously for all americans so thanks for all that you've done senator padilla and so many of you um are aware of what i want to talk about which is what have we learned about diabetes from the copic pandemic um we know we saw in the paper all the time articles one after the other of the more grave outcome if somebody had pre-existing diabetes or were diagnosed at the time of a covet infection with diabetes much higher need for hospitalization much higher complication rate and particularly mortality forty percent of the people who died with covet had diabetes or glucose dysregulation and one in five individuals who were hospitalized with diabetes in covid died within 28 days of that hospitalization but you know it turns out it's not all equal for people with diabetes and one of the factors that we know is a particular risk is when somebody has poorly managed diabetes their glucose levels have been high for a while other metabolic factors are at play that involve some of the other vital systems particularly the cardiovascular system and as a result of that compared to somebody who is well managing their diabetes and has their glucose ranges and these other metabolic factors relatively close to the ideal those who have been poorly managed are where the excess issues really occur and 42 percent of those individuals when they were hospitalized with cova died compared to those well managed when hospitalized with covid only 14 percent died so then we have to step back and say well why is somebody not optimally controlled when they know they have diabetes and they know they must manage their glucose value well there's a myriad of factors that lead to that but one of them and maybe the most important one is affordability of the medications and particularly of insulin because all type 1 patients need insulin but by the time somebody with type 2 diabetes is likely on insulin they're far down this disease paradigm so we need to look at what does it mean to not be able to access enough insulin and we've quoted but the study was done by a group called dq a with association with the american diabetes association in 2020 and surveyed 5 000 individuals with diabetes and asked about insulin rationing and 25 percent so one in four said that they had been rationing insulin during the coping pandemic so what does that mean skipping insulin doses taking less insulin what does that lead to high glucose values metabolic dysregulation and all the risk of needing to be hospitalized having complications needing ventilators and having an excess of mortality and i know this personally as a physician in southern california not far from alex's original district um and working at children's hospital where we do take care of not only children but young adults and i had a young adult patient who had just finished graduate school and this guy is going to be a star but in the midst of the culprit pandemic he didn't have a job although he was still on his parents insurance he was now responsible for managing his budget for the first time something that's not so easy to do and he could not figure out how to afford getting enough insulin paying his rent and buying food so he started rationing his insulin and when i saw him on a virtual visit and could see that he'd lost weight and looked at his glucose numbers and they were significantly out of where the range they should be he finally admitted and was immense shame that he was rationing insulin he was missing doses maybe three or four a week each other dose he was taking maybe 20 percent off so that he could stretch out each bottle of insulin to last longer because he couldn't afford it so i'm just so glad that there's massive efforts to address the affordability of insulin and something that could lead to the end of insulin rationing so thanks for allowing me to be part of today's event thank you dr kaufman and i'm going to turn it over to edgar rodriguez thanks lisa and hi everyone at this point we'll transition to some q a uh so if you please can submit your questions in the chat box uh we'll go ahead and do about a couple of minutes before we have to wrap up here so we'll give folks about a few seconds dr prieto i see a question from carl dinwiddie who's asking will this legislation address the issue of insurance companies not doctors determining the best brand of insulin for patients so yes the diabetes caucus proposal does address this we don't have exact language for that bill yet um there are a couple of different bills those of you know the legislative process you know there's there have been bills passed in the house uh there's a an identical bill and a new proposal in the senate uh eventually those will have to be you know brought together and and passed with the same language but yes we do expect to address this issue as well as address the the factors that make insulin so affordable so unaffordable uh for people who are still uninsured great uh so you know further questions i think we can go to closing remarks and i just want to remind folks you know we'll be sharing a copy of the recording uh so you can have for your records afterwards so turn it back to you lisa thank you thank you so much um i'll invite senator padilla to make closing comments well first i want to thank you lisa and uh our three panelists for a great discussion uh for those who tuned in even you know we had a couple only uh one uh question which means i think we answered a whole bunch in the course of the conversation uh it's uh good to be with all of you in this virtual round table session and uh as you heard the high cost of insulin affects countless californians in very real and profound ways and not just a 3.2 million californians who live with diabetes but by extension uh their families their friends and their communities when i referenced my mom earlier right we all have a personal connection whether we realized it or not uh we learned quickly that it wasn't just about making sure that mom got the the care that she needed and what it meant for her diet would have been for her physical activity but what it meant for us as a family and so mailing just think of the millions and millions of families in california alone going through that same experience and for that matter across the country so the time is now given you know where we are on the diabetes front where we are with pre-diabetes where we are with the uh impact of covet and where a lot of families are in their home economics so we must take action now to lower the cost of insulin because it is literally life-saving essential medical treatment and so that's why i'm a proud co-sponsor of the affordable insulin now act on the senate side as dr pietro mentioned we'll get a senate version through hopefully in the near future reconcile it with the house version that's been approved and get something to the president's desk the american people deserve no less and i'm confident this will get done because i'm proud to once again work alongside the american diabetes association in advocating for this bill together we'll get the bill done and we'll continue working together to raise awareness about diabetes and improved treatments and therapies will lower the cost of life-saving health care and look forward to staying together in this fight thank you lisa thank you so much and thank you for elevating this issue um and the american diabetes association has made this one of their top priorities we simply cannot have one in four families fighting to stay healthy with diabetes and make ends meet so we appreciate your championship of this issue and support and we look forward to having continued um progress on this issue in congress so thank you all um for joining us today thank you my esteemed panelists and i look forward to connecting with you all in the future

from Arizona dr. Gosar Thank You mr. chairman dr. Gruber in your testimony you stated I'm not a political adviser nor politician I like that statement I'm a dentist by trade impersonating politicians so I want to commend you on that but there's something very similar about you and me is you're very astute to detail like me right I like to think I pay attention detail yes yeah because the beauty is in the detail right often that is the case yeah so did you lie about any of your comments when you publicly were some of the aspects that we saw on on television where those outright lies or were they just not politically Pleasant they were not lies they were not lies so they were truthful in regards to a stalwart evaluation of a process right they were once again my inexcusably trying to conjecture about a process about which but I want to go back to this say you weren't lying you were very truthful about the process I was once again try me it may not be politically savvy or you know like as we say red meat but what you were doing this you were very honest in regards to the process once again I was making statements about which I really didn't have the expertise to make to make oh I don't know about expertise so let's go down that right knee we just talked about beauty is in the in the detail you're very astute about the economic aspects you had your inclinations and models with Romneycare you've actually had these models with Obamacare so you're very astute in regards to this I mean being from MIT I mean that's one of the most prestigious claimed environments in the world right I believe so yes and and when you're proud of a product you you really are vested in that product so you're going to be very watchful as it takes place as it changes as a Moore's and maybe as it has contradictions right I was very proud invested in the model the numbers I produced yes yes so I'm gonna go back to it so you were very honest in your evaluation of what transpired that's we saw the real Jonathan Gruber in there I mean I watched you last night for almost four hours on all the different aspects I read body language extremely well so you were in your element when you were talking about the critiques of of this health care law so let me ask you something so so who helped you with your testimony today and who signed off on your testimony today no one signed up in my testimony it's my own testimony I did receive assistance from my counsel did you also have assistance from HHS the administration the minority staff tomato I did not okay now were you coached in any way what to say I the words that are written I said on my own as I said I did work with my counsel and preparing them okay so when we had numbers of my colleagues asking you in regards to numbers you're pretty astute with numbers right you know those numbers once again the numbers that I produced in terms of my micro simulation modeling I'm very confident miss Taverner you're also pretty good with numbers aren't you I mean I've been what watching the bantering back and forth and when the other side asks you a question you're very prepared with numbers but when we ask you a question you're very inappropriately responsible to numbers but you're very good with numbers because you hear them all day long do you not I do hear numbers you do I agree I agree so you know this this preponderance of looking at the following rate of dollars being spent in health care I'm gonna go back to the microcosm called dentistry did anybody even think about this I mean what kind of access the gentlelady from New Mexico talked about access did that ever come into your aspect that the deductibles are so high and in the dental aspect that no one's using them did that ever occur to you you know if you look at what we did around the dental proposed and final rule last year we actually tried to make some accommodation they're to handle the deductible to improve it few months well that's nice I mean you know changing around some of those aspects but you know from my standpoint when people don't actually get care you're actually creating a bigger problem okay you know the gentleman from Maryland is aware of the domani driver aspect when people can't pay for it reduces access children go walking around and without getting health care and all of a sudden we have a child that dies you're aware of that situation somewhere the situation that occurred so so once again it becomes at that fourth part you know because I heard people on the other side over here saying this was the most transparent process really it didn't involve anybody on this side and I'm very aware or well aware of of having you know bipartisan type of application to healthcare because healthcare is a personal sport the patient has to be involved and it's not a Republican or democratic issue but it became a very democratic issue they used reconciliation a lot of gimmicks to pass it we were deceitful and now everything that we've done I mean everything instead of acknowledging the problems and being truthful on it we hear a tortured language you know from the gentleman to your left this this was outright the wrong way to go so from from that standpoint it sickens me to actually hear what I heard today from both you and from Mr Gruber it's sad you know that we're playing with people's health care when they deserve something better and and frankly not having the facts is disdainful Congress has a right to those facts that we've seen this perpetually with this administration from fast and furious to Benghazi to here to the IRS it's disdainful equal branch

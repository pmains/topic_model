all right let's bring in democratic congressman tom malinowski now of new jersey he serves on both the foreign affairs and the homeland security committees and also of note he fled communist poland as a child with his mother uh sir thank you so much for being with us i'm not sure if you just heard but the uh brother of the mayor of keeve just said that everyone survived that mario theater bombing i know we want to obviously validate that we want to confirm it he said but this was luck uh i wonder what your reaction is to that and especially as you see russians the russian military targeting civilians like this well thank god if if that's true um but it doesn't change the fact that the russians unable to move forward which is good uh are are just pounding away at civilian targets in these cities uh hoping that somehow that uh that gives them a stronger bargaining position that it'll wear down the ukrainians it's not going to work but it is going to kill a lot of innocent people and it's the reason one reason why we've got to step up our support to help the ukrainians beat this back the ukrainian government says that ukrainian forces are performing counter-strikes against russians particularly they're doing this outside of kiev do you believe that to be true do you believe that to be effective what do you know i i think they're being very effective look the it's day 21 and the russians haven't even managed to surround kiev this is not the way the war was supposed to go according to all of the the experts and they're doing well because they're brave because they're defending their country and and also because of what we've given them and and we should we should not underestimate the the strength of what we have already done with the weapons that we have given the ukrainians and more on the way they have killed more russians in 21 days than we lost in afghanistan and iraq in 20 years that's absolutely extraordinary and it gives me confidence that as horrible as the suffering of the ukrainian people is right now they are winning and the russians are losing those casualties you're talking about do you think that that ultimately leads to the downfall of vladimir putin i don't know and i don't think we can count on that i don't think we should base our decisions on any expectations about what the russian people will do to putin what i do hope is that the russian military will in effect disintegrate around kiev around kharkiv around these cities we've we've seen massive casualties as i've mentioned among the russian troops there are desertions there are russians leaving their vehicles uh when the fuel runs out at some point there is there is a more realistic prospect i would say that that this army just disintegrates and that putin cannot sustain it anymore uh our sanctions also help in that respect let's not forget we have we have sanctioned the russian economy back to the 1930s and that also affects the ability of the russian government to support these troops in the field uh for the long term we have just learned i should mention that president biden is going to be speaking with xi jinping of china tomorrow and this of course is coming as we've learned that china may be willing maybe open to helping russia which has requested military and economic assistance what is your reaction to that and what do you think that biden should communicate to she he should communicate that if china wants to get get involved with russia here then china is going to be subject to the same types of blocking sanctions that have devastated the russian economy and i don't think the chinese will do that we'll see i i know of several instances in which the chinese have refused russian requests in recent days to help and the chinese statements have gotten more supportive of the ukrainians in the last few days i think china is is aware of which way the wind is blowing here but there are still very significant dangers ahead i don't want to mislead anybody i want to ask you about something that senator lindsey graham said he has repeated his calls for russians to assassinate putin and he was asked if he still stood by that earlier call he said yeah i hope he'll be taken out one way or another i don't care how they take him out i don't care if we send him to the hague and try him i just want him to go what do you think of that well i can understand the sentiment but i i don't think it's i don't think it's a wise thing for american elected officials to say because it's the sort of thing that that the russians can play on their propaganda networks uh back home to to to whip up patriotic sentiment at a time when putin is struggling to do that i don't want to give him any any propaganda lifelines um look look he putin is losing but a defeated putin is also a dangerous putin and i think we do have to be we've got to support the ukrainians but do it in a careful way i think the russians want to bring us into this conflict i i think that may be putin's last gambit as he sees his forces unable to move forward in ukraine if he can bring us in and in effect terrify us into believing that world war iii is possible ironically his negotiating position from his point of view might grow stronger um and so i want to keep helping the ukrainians close the skies give them the anti-aircraft weapons planes if that will help continue to give them the anti-tank weapons that are devastating the russian military but i do also want us to be careful not to bring the united states unnecessarily into this conflict in a direct confrontation with russia because ironically i think that would help putin sir thank you so much congressman tom malinowski we do appreciate your time

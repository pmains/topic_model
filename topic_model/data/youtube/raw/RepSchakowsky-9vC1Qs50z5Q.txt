hi it's congresswoman jan chakowski well 50 years ago claiborne pell of rhode island decided that it was important to help young people go to college to provide some funding federal funding to make it easier and it was a good idea 50 years ago but maybe it's even more of a good idea now because you know the cost of college tuition and the co the cost of getting a higher education has really skyrocketed so we have been able over time to raise the amount of the the pell grant in fact just last year we did that still though you know we're only talking about even at the maximum somewhat less than seven thousand dollars but that can make a big difference to people and i heard from uh people in my district including katharina who said it really enabled her to continue her college education over six million students in the last this in the last year of the college year were able to take advantage of that of that grant if you're interested in finding out more about a pell grant and if you are eligible you can go to studentaid.gov and find out more information but we certainly need to i think it would be great if we were able to um do some more debt forgiveness of all the people who owe so much on their on their college debt but the pell grant is the single largest federal grant that goes uh that is used by americans to get a higher education so it's very very important we celebrate that 50th anniversary right now and find out more if you think you may be eligible or even if you're not sure check it out

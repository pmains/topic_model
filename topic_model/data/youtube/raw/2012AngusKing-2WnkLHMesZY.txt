so let's talk about education i know that's an area that um you with particular interests when you were governor and in light of technology uh how do you see you know the new technology interacting to make our education system work a little better well i think we need to take it to the next level frankly to free teachers from the drudgery so they can do the fun part of teaching but if you can do for example online homework the kids do it online they answer the questions it goes into the school's computer the next morning the teacher comes in they're all scored they can see how everybody's doing they can see oh yeah all my kids got the ma got the subtraction problems but they missed the multiplication problem so let's spend some more time on multiplication you can target your teaching much more effectively the test should be a diagnostic tool instead of just an assessment tool um my context as you know i'm with walch education and where we're focused on k-12 education so there's been a lot of good discussion about technology and especially it tends to focus on one-to-one interaction between a student and a computer or a device or a website it's uh it's a way to remove drudgery from the teacher's day-to-day job but my my concern and my question is what's your perspective on developing and promoting tools to facilitate the student-teacher interaction in a standards-based classroom and to remove some of the drudgery of the teacher's everyday work removed from the student teacher simple interaction that we focus on today when i talk to teachers who have used the laptop project the most common term the most common word they use is engaged and if you have students who are engaged you can teach them anything if you have students who are looking out the window you could be thomas jefferson and and socrates and not teach him anything then the students by this mysterious process take ownership of their own education because ultimately that's what you want is you want students who are who are saying wow that's cool i didn't know that you know and they they touch on the on the picture of the whale and it suddenly comes to life and swims you know it's it's harry potter's moving pictures book the the innovative industry in this country is in dire need of highly technically highly educated people so from your perspective what do you think the political leadership could do to encourage or incentivize students to take up disciplines such as technology engineering science math frankly i don't think we've done a good enough job communicating to young people what what's out there part of that is the kids have all been told you have to go to college and it's not cool to work with your hands and i think we need to be thinking about the fact that you know these are really good jobs maybe they take they do take some level of technical training because they have to run cad machines and those kinds of things but they don't necessarily require a four years of college the other thing is you know i think the society gets what it values and we have to value more these these kinds of disciplines uh maybe maybe if engineers made more than investment bankers this problem would go away but that that would be that would be the way i would look at it how does maine prevent brain drain or how does maine encourage its students to stay in maine rather than seek opportunities elsewhere i think the first thing is economic opportunity i mean people are going to leave as they have throughout history to find better jobs and if we can develop the kind of economic opportunity with companies like national semiconductor here or fairchild or idex or some of the companies that are growing up in the bangor area and around the around the state that's the best thing oxford networks you know my son matt here did you have to leave you know uh but yes absolutely so keep creating that kind of opportunity

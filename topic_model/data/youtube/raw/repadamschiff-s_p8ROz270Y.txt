the members of the january 6th select committee leading the questioning this week california congressman and the chair of the house intel committee adam schiff good to have you back here on sunday morning matters congressman and let's start here i'm wondering among the committee has there been really that smoking gun and if so what is it for the american people especially those voters who do back trump uh you know there actually have been several smoking guns this week we had a couple powerful hearings in one of them you had the republican house speaker from arizona basically talking about how donald trump and rudy giuliani asked him to do something that would violate his oath that would violate the constitution they told them no in certain terms he was not going to do it we heard the secretary of state in georgia describe the call that he had with donald trump which donald trump asked him to find eleven thousand seven hundred page votes it didn't exist asked him to recalculate somehow that he would so that he could become the winner and again this republican secretary of state said he wouldn't do it uh and we we saw an election worker for whom the president made false claims of fraud uh and we heard the attorney general say that what donald trump was saying his own attorney general saying it had no merit and yet he ruined this this poor woman's life um and and then later in the week a second hearing uh where you had top justice department officials similarly his own people say the president wanted us to intervene in a presidential election in a way that was not appropriate for the justice department would require them to violate the constitution uh and they were prepared to quit on moss rather than do what he wanted you know so you're talking about how the committee really laid out the case and congressman kinzinger republican was that by design to have him lead those hearings on thursday and and second part of that why hasn't the doj themselves put an investigation forward and made their own case well um you know the each of these hearings is essentially chaired by a different member of the select committee so i was given responsibility for the one on tuesday that was the state pressure campaign my colleague a republican adam kinzinger i handled the department of justice here and on thursday uh and in the next hearing it will be other members that will play in the lead role in terms of you know why is that the congress acting about the justice department interestingly on the same day that we had the hearing on the justice department and the president's efforts to get uh jeffrey clark named as acting attorney general because he would do the president's bidding mr clark reportedly had his uh house searched by investigators so they executed a search warrant so it does appear the justice department is acting also you know i'm wondering um what's the end game here and the punctuation uh i know that we'll have hearings uh i guess delayed because there's some new video you guys are going to be looking at in july and i'm wondering what what really is the punctuation here will this committee at the end say we are not only recommending but urging the doj to press charges against the former president we will have a couple more hearings next month we will then work on our report uh we will also work on our recommendations about how to keep the country safe in the future from this ever happening again i hope that we will in the fall have a hearing or hearings over those recommendations uh and we will discuss uh probably after these hearings finish in july uh whether we should make criminal referrals to the justice department but it's important to note whether we make referrals or we don't the just department has an independent responsibility to act on evidence of the violation of federal law so we may put our own stamp on it by saying we believe you should investigate these things i don't think we're going to be saying that we believe somebody is by you know guilty and should be convicted that'll be up to the justice department but we may make referrals to say we believe the law may have been broken here and we think you should investigate yeah i'll kind of finish on this your republican colleagues um they say that they need a chance to maybe do a rebuttal is there would you support um if they wanted to bring after these hearings close out if they bring something to the table in response to what we are seeing on television and what we're seeing play out well you know of course we have republicans on our committee so the committee is is bipartisan really nonpartisan um those who are complaining about not having a role in the committee uh including now the former president um were the same people who vetoed an independent commission which would have been made up equally of democrat and republican appointed uh commissioners donald trump didn't want that uh now he is acknowledging today that was a big mistake he's blaming mr mccarthy for that but no doubt he had a big role in that mistake uh mccarthy and mcconnell i think were both doing his bidding uh when they uh essentially rejected an independent commission so they're really not in a position to complain at this point okay real quick they're telling me wrap in my ear but i wanted to get this in do you believe the former president donald trump will run for president in 2024 i do i do believe he will run and at this point uh he still has the support of a majority of that party um of the republican party i hope the republican party though will return to its roots of being a conservative party a party of ideology and not a you know personality cult around the former president all right congressman adam schiff appreciate the time so much

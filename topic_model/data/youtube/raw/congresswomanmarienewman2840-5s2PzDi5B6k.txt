but let me talk a little bit about something that's really frustrating me and really irritating and that is when folks talk about a labor shortage and what the real issue is is we have a child care shortage we have a health care shortage we have an affordable housing shortage we have a shortage of affordable pre-k and there is a shortage of folks being paid properly for hard work so what we really have here and this is particularly frustrating when i hear that there's a labor shortage and then our friends across the aisle block every single uh possible thing we can do to make that better and to boost our economy so that's super frustrating for me and by the way you can't say we have a labor shortage and then block immigration it just doesn't work that way and you can't say immigrants are stealing jobs when you're saying it doesn't work that's just common sense it's math so it doesn't work but let me say something else mr speaker if i can have a little more time is that you know if we do things like expanding paid leave medical leave if we make sure that folks have access to child care and have real free child care guess what moms can get back to work because moms let's be honest about it moms are frequently the primary uh caregiver and we can get them back to work uh 300 000 of our moms in this nation have been forced to quit so they have to take care of uh their kids and i also want to just mention something else that's astonishing not that just that it's 300 000 people that have left the force of the female nature it is that um in addition to that about 70 when you take all of the sources of child care whether it's ymca moms and dads that are in other jobs and working three jobs at a time or it is our school system or just general day care and child care about 70 percent of our child care system was lost during the pandemic so of course it's hard to get a break because guess what the reason we have this amazing package set up this way that we have roads and bridges that will be repaired and broadband uh delivered as well as child care and health care and in-home health care and all the things on the human infrastructure side you know why because when mom and dad go to fix a bridge guess what they need someone to watch their kids all day that's why this works so well together and that's why we have to pass

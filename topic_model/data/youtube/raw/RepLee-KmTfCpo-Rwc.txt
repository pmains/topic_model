and joining us now is congresswoman barbara Lee isn't it your obligation as a congresswoman to be at the inauguration you know I thought about this very carefully and didn't come to the decision lightly actually I decided last week and put out my statement i believe it was last Thursday that I was not going to attend it it's not an obligation to attend a celebratory event I agree with the peaceful transfer of power I respect that I know that President Trump is that the present electron will be sworn in and I respect the office of the president but when you look at the inauguration and when you look at the continuation of this divisive pneus this bigoted approach to government and then when you look at some of the nominees that he's presented such as Senator Jeff Sessions who has a history of voting against and working against civil and human rights for everyone you know I can't celebrate that when you look at the denigration of women when you look at the fact and I heard one of his representatives say earlier he's going to live up to his campaign commitments wanted to build that wall wanting to impose a ban on Muslims I can't celebrate that and so in good conscience I'm going to not attend and I'm going to work to help organize some of the resistance to some of the policies that look like will be moved forward you say what really moves view is the divisiveness the divisions that this is creating but you're saying you're not wanting to celebrate the inauguration on Friday but don't you think that further perpetuates it by having more than 25 30 members of Congress not attending something that celebrates the highest office in the land absolutely not today of dr. King's birthday we're celebrating the life and legacy of dr. King and dr. King in several of his speeches one bush I'm talking about today in april of nineteen sixty-seven fifth silence is betrayal there's some of us who have got to be clear about where we are how we're going to resist some of the very terrible backwards policies that this administration is proposing now yes we will work to create jobs and do whatever else we can do with the president if it makes sense for everyone but for someone he not been a supporter who has not said very clearly that he supports people color the marginalized most vulnerable too poor for someone who's putting cabinet members and who won't even disclose their ethics or you know make their financial disclosure statements available someone who has campaigned with Russians support and influence and I'm having a foreign power working their campaign the way the intelligence community has presented to us so far you know we need to think about how we move forward if not in good conscience celebrates it if I reversed it if I said that we were going back to when President Obama was being inaugurated and Republicans came out and said the same thing that you're saying which is I can't support this president in good conscious and i am going to boycott his inauguration what would you say to that let me tell ya let me remind you what happened on senator Mitch McConnell you know and others decided on that day that they were not going to support President Obama in any of it they decided and hit couldn't I'll argue that you're doing the same thing I'm not doing the same thing because i am not celebrating this inauguration i'm working action to try to bring some unity and try to help resist an agenda that's going to be more divisive I'm trying to help bring women and people of color and the Muslim community in the LGBT community together to talk about how we protect the games and how we move forward and how we're not going to allow us to move backwards and I don't think dr. King would want us to not out this what about representative John Lewis he's a civil rights icon we're talking about civil rights on a day like today Martin Luther King jr. Day he is not attending the inauguration he says he's skipping it and he also says that he doesn't see Donald Trump as a legitimate president do you agree with that well first John Lewis is an icon he's a moral leader he's a civil and human rights leader so when John Lewis speaks the world quite frankly liz's a few agreement editor he calls into question the legitimacy of our next president you know you're asking me to say yes or no to a question that we can't answer yes or no to yet I just don't know because we haven't had the investigation and what I am saying is we need to have an independent investigation by a buyer part bipartisan Commission to determine how and what the level of foreign power and Russian influence was in this election once we know that then we will know I was one of those who protested the certification of the electoral college and it was based on what the intelligence community had provided to us which John Lewis has has laid out in terms foreign power interfering in this election so I'm not prepared to say yes or no I don't know but what I am prepared to say is that the American people deserve to know if in fact this this presidency now will be influenced by the Russian government it's not a matter of who won and who lost i will give you that that you don't feel like you can say it yet whether it's legitimate or not i think what my issue with john lewis is and I'm not taking anything away from him I respect and I admire that man for what he has done however when he comes out and says that the president is not a legitimate president before the investigation has been completed I do have an issue with that do you have an issue with that John Lewis is to be applauded because he is a moral leader he would not have said that how do you not believe that and so we have to look where we're going with this intelligence committee and but do you think that could undermine our country or our president no I don't think so because we know that we need to have a full disclosure of what took place and I don't think that undermines I think congressman Lewis is right on point in terms of a Russian power of a foreign power the Russian government influencing the outcome of the election but what I do say is the American people deserve to know what the issues are what the facts are we need this fluent in the next time while that all plays out the investigation because that could go on for some time you're saying you won't go on Friday but then when it comes back to work day where you go to work working together because this country is clearly divided like people need to come together and have some type of immunity after Friday's celebration what will you do then i'm a member of Congress and i'm going to continue to represent my district first of all you go secondly i'm going to keep pushing for these independent and this is an independent investigation so the public will know exactly what took place thirdly i'm going to find hopefully we'll find ways to work with the white house in terms of you know providing eckin growth and opportunities for those who have been shut out and also fight against good budget cuts that are taking place and I think firstly we have to do is make sure that 20 30 million people don't lose their health care and so I mean we're doing that right now to try to prevent the repeal of the Affordable Care Act trying to prevent them from cutting Medicare so there's a lot of work to do trying to prevent them from eroding a woman's right to choose trying to prevent the administration from deporting arms our young dreamers but we'll be working very hard to try to make sure that we represent our constituents in the best way possible congressman we appreciate you coming spending the Congress to thank you tonight

- Hello everyone. My name's Dan Crenshaw. I'm running for congress
to be your representative. The path here wasn't easy. My first test, I lost
my mom when I was 10. It made me stronger. I used that strength to become a Navy Seal where I encountered my second test. I was hit by an IED blast in Afghanistan and was nearly killed and I was blinded. But I kept my faith and I persevered. Doctors told me I would never see again. I had faith that I would and I did. And I deployed again twice more. I went on to Harvard. I did my master's degree in public policy because I listened to God's path for me and that is one of public service, it is one of good governance
and conservative values. And I know now that my
path is not just defending the constitution from foreign enemies. It is defending us from over taxation and over regulation
and federal over reach. It is defending our Christian values and the left's attack on our traditions and our history and our culture. It is protecting our borders
and enforcing our laws. I hope to have your support. Thank you.

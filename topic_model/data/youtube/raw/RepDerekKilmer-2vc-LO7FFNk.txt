reaction the gentleman is recognized for one minute thank you madam speaker today I rise to call in the house to pass the Employment non-discrimination Act which passed the Senate with bipartisan support it's bill with simple premise the people should be hired and fired and assessed based on their capabilities and job performance not on prejudice it would take the common-sense step of extending federal employment non-discrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity I spent a decade work in an economic development and the research by Richard Florida and others is pretty clear one of the prime drivers of economic growth is tolerance and yet in 29 states its leaguer legal to fire an employee because of sexual orientation the rights granted in my state shouldn't end at our borders failure to act on this doesn't make economic sense it doesn't make legislative sense and it doesn't make moral sense but I'm not here just as an economic developer I'm here as someone whose faith dictates that I love and respect all people and live by the golden rule and I'm here as a dad of two little girls I want my daughters to grow up in a country where discrimination is a thing of the past where folks can't be treated differently because of their gender or who they love it's time to pass Enda thank you madam Speaker I yield back gentleman's time is expired for what purpose does the gentleman from North Carolina seek recognition

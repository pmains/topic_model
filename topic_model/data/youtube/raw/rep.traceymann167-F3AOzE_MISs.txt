remarks about ensuring that agriculture is in the pole position in these discussions and that we highlight the climate solutions that are produced by agriculture while our producers feed fuel and clothe not only the country but really the world i probably grew up on a farm in quinter kansas population 800 or i was a fifth generation to live in my house my folks and my brother still run our farming operation you know we raised corn milo wheat had a pre-conditioning feed yard spent thousands of hours on the tractor combine doctrine sick kevs really a privilege to get to grow up there and i think it's important in these discussions that we all remember that agriculture also is the lifeblood to keeping a lot of our basic values alive that we hold dear in this country those values being you know faith family looking out for our neighbors working hard you know the values that are central to us as americans are supported by agriculture which makes these discussions all the more important i proudly represent the big first district of kansas one of the biggest ag producing districts in the country we are number one in the country on beef production we are number one in the country on wheat production number one on sorghum production number three on corn production we also have biofuels food processors dairies that's a privilege and honor to get to get to represent these groups my question um also was for mr duvall so i don't if you remember this mr ball i was our lieutenant governor of kansas and uh you and i um we're in southwest kansas and garden city and um checked out some water technology farms and spent the day together really enjoyed that day would have been almost two and a half three years ago you know one of my big takeaways and my question will be for you mr duvall like i said is and i think one thing we got to continue to highlight is we all should be encouraged to hear about the strides that american farmers and ranchers have made in addressing and mitigating carbon especially with the reduction of agriculture share of greenhouse gas emissions from 24 in 2010 all the way down to 10 percent here in 2019 so in nine years we've gone from 24 down to 10 percent remarkable and i guess my question um for you mr deval is can you explain how that reduction was made by farmers and ranchers in the us in your mind um even as they continue to provide a safe reliable and affordable food supply it's amazing accomplishment we need to keep highlighting it and just curious to know your perspective many of your members were part of that and and how do we go about accomplishing that sure and there's not one answer that answers that question because because you know we talked about all of them here uh the opportunity to participate in the programs through the usda that are partnerships and and uh and incentive based uh our farmers have latched on to that uh technology that has come from the research from uh whether it be the plant and how we can not have to disturb the soil to get rid of weeds but we can control them with other other products and we could do it um with gps and and precision plant of farming uh so we have just come a long way in the techniques that we use but if we can do that because of the technology and we could go so much further if we go back and talk about streamlining the approval of these new technologies coming uh increase the research and we can even do more to not just lower our emissions but to help uh take in so take care of some of the problems of the emissions from other areas of other industries so there's not one answer that one one answer that answers that question our farmers are received and they are technique technical savvy uh and and they will take advantage of every opportunity and we got to have broadband to make sure that we can take care of to use utilize those new technologies that's coming in the future because precision agriculture is here and our farmers aren't wearing overalls anymore that's right they're carrying computers and ipads around with them to get the job done and broadband is important to that and you're part of the state and that travel that that visit was wonderful i absolutely fell in love with that part of our country well glad glad yep glad to have you and you really touched my next question and that is you know in my view we've rural broadband has got to be part of this discussion because to really continue to improve on carbon we've got to have precision agriculture and rural broadband is the technological underpinning of that so i could not agree with you more mr duvall thank you for for all of our you know panelists today really appreciate your time and with that i yield back

, MR. SMITH. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR TWO MINUTES. MR. SMITH: I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFERREES. I WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RECK RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND SENATE BILLS. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY HOLD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE AND I HOPE WE GET TO A STRONG WORK PRODUCT THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF. THE HOUSE VERSION OF THIS BILL, THE COMPETES ACT, TRULY IS A NONSTARTER FOR HOUSE REPUBLICANS, NO SURPRISE. FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE SENATE AS WELL AND ACTUALLY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT'S MY CONCERN. WHILE IT WAS MESSAGED AS LEGISLATION TO COMBAT THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S PREDATORY PRACTICE, THE TRADE PROVISIONS IN HOUSE BILL DID LITTLE TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD WITH CHINA, ADDING HURDLES THAT WOULD HURT AMERICAN CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. INSTEAD, THAT BILL ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES WORK DURING A WORK FORCE SHORTAGE BY EXPANDING AND DELINKING THE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FROM NEW TRADE OPPORTUNITIES. IT ADDS RED TAPE AND NARROWS ELIGIBILITY OF TRADE PROGRAMS LIKE G.S.P. AND M.T.B., THESE ARE RELIEF MEASURES WE KNOW HELP SMALL BUSINESSES AND MANUFACTURERS IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE BILL ALSO EXACERBATE OURS SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS BY MAKING UNVETTED CHANGES TO THE DE MINIMUS RULE AND IT ALSO FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ADMINISTRATION'S LACKLUSTER EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH CHINA IN THE INDO PACIFIC AND AROUND THE WORLD. THE SENATE'S BIPARTISAN APPROACH, WHILE IMPERFECT, ADDRESSES CHINA. IT PROMOTES SMALL BUSINESSES, BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY AND MORE THAN ANYTHING IT EMPOWERS AMERICAN CONSUMERS RIGHT HERE AT HOME. IT OFFERS A CLEAN RENEWAL OF M.T.B. AND RETROACTIVELY EX-TANDZ G.S.P. AND EXPANDS THE PROCESS WITH RHETT ARE ACTIVITY AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THE GREEN NEW DEAL WISH LIST. LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON A FINAL PRODUCT THAT HOLDS CHI MA ACCOUNTABLE. I REITERATE M

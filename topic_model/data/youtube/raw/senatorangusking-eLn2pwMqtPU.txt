today senators Kamala Harris Ed Markey and Bernie Sanders introduced the monthly economic crisis support Act it would send a monthly check to individuals and families making less than one hundred and twenty thousand dollars until the corona virus pandemic subsides that is just the latest plan floating around the Capitol for more on the federal government's response to the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression we're joined by independent senator from Maine angus King the senator it is always great to have you these numbers were awful today and when I talked to people across the country mostly around the New York City area and outside the outskirts they'll tell me that the stimulus checks were a good start they'll say the SBA loans are a good idea but they haven't quite worked the way that they need them to what is Congress planning on doing next and and how quickly do you guys need to act well we ought to be at we ought to act soon and we've been here for a week now and done nothing in terms of the kovat response and I think that's a failing and apparently next week there's nothing scheduled either there may be some discussions going on there are discussions going on in the background people are trying to put together what the next package should look like one of the things Katie that is very important and somewhat contentious has helped to the states and we talked about the states as if it's some kind of big amorphous shape but actually it's people and most states the money flows back to communities so we're talking if the states don't get help we're talking about layoffs and we're talking about layoffs of people like teachers and first responders and people that are processing unemployment claims I mean it makes no sense so that should be a part of the next package also some additional focus on testing okay the the numbers today are awful and the the economic impact is is is awful the problem is it's going to continue to be awful until we deal with this underlying health problem and the best way to deal with that short of a vaccine or a cure is absolutely a massive increase in testing and for some reason the administration is resist doing that they've increased testing somewhat with great pride they said last week we was 300 thousand a day it ought to be in the range of two to three million a day and so we're still off by a major factor and until that starts to happen all of the economic things that we're talking about are just pasting it over what really bothers me is we had sort of a contract with the administration if you will the American people held up their end of the deal we shut down we took time off we self isolated we did all those things but for two months we haven't had a consistent plan the only thing consistent about the plan is its inconsistent and we haven't had this expansion of testing which everybody says is critical in order to bring this thing under control so yes we're talking about more but a lot of the activity should be taking place at the White House and then I just read the CDC guidelines that were killed somebody said they were too prescriptive whoever said that didn't know what prescriptive meant prescriptive means they were rules they weren't rules there were recommendations really well written very thoughtful and this administration is even denying people advice about what the best practices are the the issue with the federal I don't know at what point that you sit there I don't know what snorty Chuck right well because I don't know what you guys can do what any more you can do to motivate the federal government to take over testing so I want to set that aside because I don't know what everybody has said and done everything possible to say mr. president you guys got to own testing and they've made the decision to do it the way they've done it so let's move to the economic prescriptions what is the best way to handle this is it the aid to the state's industry by industry or is it taking over payrolls essentially where's your head on this well I'm listening and interestingly you know is that there are people in other countries that have gone to the sort of direct payroll support interestingly Josh Holley Republican senator from Zuri is talking about that and you rarely hear Bernie Sanders and Josh Hawley use in the same sentence but I think that's something we got to think about but yeah but but all of these things are hiding us over kind of things and they need to be done and the cares Act and the aid to the businesses the PPP unemployment insurance all those things were and are critically important but it just makes me mad as hell that we're doing these things in the meantime not doing the things that could actually get us out of this mess all right let me which is very quickly senator your limit very quickly you're somebody yes you caucus with the Democrats but you you break you break your back trying to have relationships with Republican senators can a group of them I mean Lamar Alexander is one of the few who publicly has been saying testing testing testing this is the only answer to any of this is testing can a group of Republican senators go over to the president say enough mr. president you want to reopen the economy take over testing well it interested me enough just this morning about half a dozen said just that Shelley Moore Capito Lamar Alexander Dick Shelby the venerable chair of the Appropriations Committee stated so hopefully this message is going to go through I sent the president a letter almost two weeks ago as a member of his reopening task force saying make this a Manhattan Project put Joe Dunford former chair of the Joint Chiefs in charge give him the authorities of the National Defense of the defense production act and let's make this happen but so far for some reason they just and I honestly don't understand it unless they don't want to see the numbers but they just have resisted this winds response everybody on the planet says this is the only thing that we can do effectively in the meantime to reopen safely and you know if he pulls it off then he gets to be a hero I mean that's the other part of this it is actually politically beneficial to him to if he would do that but it is what it is senator angus King the independent caucuses with the Democrats remain Thank You Kate

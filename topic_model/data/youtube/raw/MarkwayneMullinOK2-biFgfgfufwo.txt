hey guys we're finishing up another week up here in washington dc and what we're seeing is is is the democrats running more towards this socialist takeover and forcing a bill down the american people's throat by saying it's the buildback better plan just because you put a fancy name on it doesn't mean that it's actually what it says it is i mean let's think about why are they having to build that better it's because of their disastrous policies they've put in place since january 20th let's just think about this since january 20th we've seen an absolute disaster take place on our southern border we've seen inflation at the highest it's been in 40 years we're paying more at the grocery store for everything if you go the gas pumps right now for me i drive a diesel truck an f-250 i have to use my credit card twice to fill it up because the pumps cut off at a hundred dollars this is absolutely ridiculous what's going on and and the democrats solution to it is oh i know it will do we'll take more money out of the private sector we'll bring it to washington dc because they know how to spend it so much better and then we're going to make government bigger and force more regulations and more policies on you boy that seems to work really well they're doubling down they're going to spend trillions of dollars and say hey we're not going to worry about paying it in our generation we're going to let the second and third generation figure out how they're going to pay for it guys this is absurd if you can't figure out that they are truly moving towards socialism guys i don't know what it's going to take you to wake up and see this i mean what they're doing is truly taking over the private sector they're choosing winners and losers they're not allowing the the consumer to choose they're saying oh you don't actually know what you're doing see us in washington dc we know what we're doing all of us in nancy pelosi's office and and those of us that work at and joe biden's administration we know better we're just trying to protect you kind of like the vaccine mandate guys this is absurd we have to continue to fight back and push back and say we don't want socialism we want the republic we want the democracy to which our founding fathers had envisioned for us to stand up and build a great nation on which we have been able to do when we get government out of our way may god bless you and may god bless united states of america

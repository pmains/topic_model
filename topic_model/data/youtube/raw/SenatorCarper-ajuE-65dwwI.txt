the average time it takes mr chairman uh and colleagues uh to fill a vacancy on the d.c superior court uh which you've all been nominated to serve in is over three years over three years if we've done that in the state of delaware it should have all been thrown out of office it's just appalling justice denied justice delayed as justice denied but what's more the superior court here in the district of columbia has among the highest case filings per capita in the u.s i'm told with 83 000 83 000 case filings in 2019 alone and so not only is the court struggling with vacancies it's also confronting a substantial workload these needlessly lengthy judicial vacancies have burdened the dc circuit court and the court of appeals delaying justice for our fellow americans and as i often said said i'll say it again justice delayed is justice denied the nearly three seven hundred thousand seven hundred thousand americans who live in d.c pay taxes they serve our country many times in uniform they start businesses they care for their neighbors their friends and colleagues just like the rest of us and yet they are not treated like every other american from our 50 states congress approves of their budget uh they have a better credit rating than we do and we have to approve their budget we confirm their judges and we subject them to a higher federal per capita income tax rate than any other of the 50 states and to make matters worse we in congress take our time when it comes to accomplishing these tasks toward that end i'm glad that we're considering these nominees today mr chairman i look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle including my fellow former governors we have some recovering governors on this panel along uh with me they include senator houston senator scott of florida but uh we uh i want to resolve these uh the issues of these judicial vacancies and with that i thank you for the chance to offer those comment

a congressman barr in an era in which there seems to be no issue that is even remotely bipartisan does this one at least get in the ballpark well i hope so and i hope that this uh hearing is more about an impartial fact-finding exercise as opposed to political grandstanding or an effort to justify excessive government interventions in ways that would actually harm investors you know i think there is going to be undue scrutiny of payment for order flow in this hearing i think there's going to be undue scrutiny of short selling when of course we know short selling is an important part of hedging it's an important part of the capital markets the proper and efficient functioning of the markets in terms of price discovery and the provision of liquidity i hope that the scrutiny of payment for order flow doesn't end up leading to an overreaction by regulators to undermine the democratization of access to the capital markets we've seen great innovation with the robin hood and other uh online trading platforms to give retail investors access to the capital markets to expand participation in saving and investing that is a good thing we should celebrate that and volatility and a handful of stocks that didn't have any systemic impact in terms of the broader market should not be a justification or a predicate for an overreaction by regulators

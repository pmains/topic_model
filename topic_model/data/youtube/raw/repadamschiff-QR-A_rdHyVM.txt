joining us now congressman adam schiff of california he is chairman of the house intelligence committee congressman it's great to see you this morning i'd like your reaction to the speech well i think all of us were so impressed with the president zilinski but also horrified by those images it was just devastating to see these beautiful cities being destroyed so many innocent civilian lives being lost to me the image of a father holding the hand of their child who's under a sheet at the hospital deceased is just devastating so i think it can't help but have an impact on an already deeply sympathetic congress and you know the the issue that zolonski has been bringing up bubbles from day one right uh some kind of of a no-fly zone uh is that something that you think the united states could get behind sometime well i i think it's still very difficult jose for the reason that we would need to bomb russian air defense systems within russia we would be in a shooting war with russian pilots and and that would profoundly risk essentially a war between the united states and russia but there's a lot i think we can do to help ukraine shoot down those russian aircraft bring down those missiles and i think the president is going to be announcing later today some of those efforts to supply ukraine with stronger more capable as well as more numbers of these air defense systems that may be among the most important help that we can give as well as more javelins to take out russian tanks more ammunition and other supplies so we've done a lot already we're going to do a lot more but i still think at this point no-fly zone would put us at too much of a risk of the united states being in direct war with russia carson what'd you think of zalensky's call for creating a new alliance of countries that can stop conflicts immediately well i think he's right about the fact that the international rules based orders really failed to keep the peace if one nation in europe can essentially invade and bully its neighbor in the way russia is doing with ukraine and the world is powerless to stop it then the the system we set up hasn't worked so i think he's right about that uh what what new architecture would be more successful i don't know but as i was listening to him speak i was thinking about whether we could form a a broader global lines of economies that would agree essentially to wall off from the world economy and even broader terms any nation that would invade its neighbor yeah you know i was reading last night the charter of the united nations 1944 1945 sorry the 24th of october charter and among the things that says article 42 it may the united nations may take such action by arc or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security and yet congressman it seems like there really isn't any action that the world can take to stop a unilateral invasion like that i mean the us has put a lot of sanctions on russia their economy is crumbling uh it hasn't changed putin very much well we have to make sure jose that ultimately it does that that russia and putin are unsuccessful that this is a colossal failure if we can do that i think it will be a deep discouragement to other nations that are contemplating their own aggression against their neighbors uh so there is a lot riding on this as president zielenski said so eloquently today it's not the freedom of ukrainian people alone but people all over the world and will have a deep impact on us here at home so i do think he's right that their fight is our fight and we need to continue to rally the rest of the world as we have been to resist this russian aggression congressman i'm just wondering how do you think this ends you know it's it's a it's such a question that you know i think nobody has an answer to uh maybe the closest could be putin but maybe he doesn't even have an answer to this right now but how do you think this ends uh you know this is a question i've been asking since even before the invasion began which is what's putin's end game here how does this come to an end i think the problem is that putin's war plan was based on on a either a lie or a miscalculation that the ukrainian people were going to somehow welcome them with open arms and not resist and that the rest of the world wasn't going to come together and really punish russia uh the way we have with sanctions but uh i think you know uh this has caused putin to double down what will get him to head to the exits ultimately i think uh only when we could bring about so much pressure on the russian economy uh and uh on russia militarily in ukraine that putin begins to fear for the longevity of his regime i think nothing less than that is going to get him uh to back down uh unless he thinks that his own hold on power is slipping yeah or his own hold on his own life i mean that's that's really a question that you know if you look back at history i mean it seems though he's put himself in a very difficult situation to get out of right that's exactly right and this is you know the terrible tragedy that you could see happening which is um as ukraine was resisting and so courageously uh and as the consequences went up and up and up for the russian people economically that putin would merely dig in and this is what he's done to the point where he's left himself practically no way out i think as a practical matter the only way to shorten the length of this terrible conflict is by continuing to raise the costs on russia until they can bear those costs no longer and uh tragically uh that that doesn't help the ukrainian people much in the near term but i think that's the only path out of this congressman it's always a pleasure to see you i thank you very much for being with us this morning thank you

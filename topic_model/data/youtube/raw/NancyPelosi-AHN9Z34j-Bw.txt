Conyers and i will tell you shame on them shame on them this bill reauthorizes bottle for five years at the same levels as the Senate it protects victims amen does the gentleman seek additional time all right I will yield myself 30 more seconds to engage in a colloquy since we're shaming on every organization that protects women would you tell me who supports the Republican version of the bill name somebody well mr. Conyers I could say I do and I know that we have a list of them and I will tell you this mr. Conyers that I have SAT quietly and tried to behave here but what I have I offended when I hear that this does not protect victims I am offended when i hear that we are politicizing something that was politicized on the other side in the other chamber i am by the other side of the aisle so i have very much concern about that because as someone who has been in the situation who has been on the scenes of these crimes we are trying to reauthorize something that is very important to victims across our nation victims not politics and that's well I where I stand on this issue well I Lauren I saw 30 seconds more I've asked why hundreds of organizations are supporting it and you say shame on them I was supporting the Republican measure and you say I am well I'm glad to know that and I think that just about tells everybody where the logic and the support for this bill is there is none it's a Republican not a prank but a serious blow to women and that's what the organization's know and that's why gentlemen I'm heaven fire they're opposed to this bill animus x expired the gentlewoman from Florida we reserve in our time gentlewoman reserves the balance of her time

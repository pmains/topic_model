welcome back to capitals tonight joining us from our DC bureau is Texas congressman Roger Williams who's just back from a trip to the texas-mexico border thanks so much for being one with us congressman thank you well you're just in mcallen over the weekend friday i believe touring that border region and also got a chance to see the new detention facility can you just talk to us a little bit about what you saw when you were there well we focused and we went down we want to not only talk to the border ages but also to some of the local officials and some of the community and volunteers and we found out from the local communities mainly the mayor of McAllen that you know what they want they're doing and they're doing a fantastic job to with some tough circumstances but you know what they want is they want to see these young people go through the process as quick as they can to begin to reunite them with their with their families they also would love to see this 2008 law that's talked about a lot right now a change so the border folks have a little more flexibility to move some of these people through the through the system and they're also really worried about the money they're good they're out of right now I mean mcallen is projected to have 1.5 million dollar in the expense by the end of the year and they don't know where it's coming from the federal government haven't hasn't talked to them about that it also local people are really concerned about that and then we went by to the center as you mentioned to visit with the Border Patrol and what a job they are doing under some really really tough circumstances my my hand goes out to the 22 the hard work and effort they're putting in but you know what we saw we saw and quite frankly to see young people like this there and their families have spent their life savings and they're risking their lives to come over here it's it's truly a tragedy of course I would hope that President Obama speaking about amnesty and basically his administration inviting these people up here is part of the problem we have but what you see is a very organized facility with this separated quite frankly two age groups and and and and sex and to see these young people that want to realize the dream it's hard but at the same time this is a land of law and we've got to rule by the law we've got to be able to process everybody and get them sent back and reunite them with their family so I think we need to do that the Border Patrol will tell you they need a thousand more folks in the Border Patrol which I think frankly could come from the military some of the pink slips at the presence giving our military we probably could use some of those experienced people in the Border Patrol and of course yesterday Governor Perry putting a thousand more or that thousand national guard down there next 30 days was a was a wide wise move and then they will also tell you about the 2008 law that will allow them to turn these folks around quicker as if they were from Mexico or Canada which they think is very very important so that's kind of where we are the Borg Patrol is doing a great job they need help and I'm as a congressman representing Texas I'm anxious to give them what they need congressman you spoke with some of the business leaders there and some of whom are concerned about what closing the border could mean can you talk a little bit about what you are hearing from them and some of the ideas that you know might kind of ease their minds moving forward on that well that's a good question the business community is worried because they're worried about it from an economic standpoint if you just sealed off the border there's a lot of trade going back and forth between the two countries every single day one of the one of the business leaders said you know we have ten thousand people a day going back and forth to our borders that are doing business with us as opposed to the number of funeral 815 across the border illegally so they're really concerned about squeezing so tight that it becomes an economic issue for them and I think that's a viable concern certainly from the business community that we have to make sure when we begin to tight and strengthen the border and do with federal government supposed to do by by a protective order that we don't cut out the economic value that the two countries bring to each other I mean you're about to go on August recess shortly do you think anything can get done and what do you guys do in Congress why not approve this 3.7 billion is requested from the president for the emergency funding well I think there's some things we do I think the first thing we could do was address this 2008 law that as I said earlier allows the Border Patrol to be more flexible and quicker on reuniting these people with their families I'm not interested in giving President Obama a blank check for 3.7 billion dollars because it doesn't really do anything secure the border it has it has expenses in there and have nothing to do with the situation we down there well that we find ourselves down there and so I think this can be handled by really focus on the laws that we have on the books why didn't somebody try that is working under the existing law that we have instead of trying to ask for more money more money more money which doesn't fix the problem so I think we can address this issue before we head out in August but it necessarily doesn't get fixed by giving the president 3.7 billion dollars is there a proposal that you do support perhaps the corn and cuellar a bill or anything along those lines whether corny Cuellar bill is a great attempt to to improve things there are some issues there I have a I have a problem with what I would like to see is i'd like i'd like to see a thousand more Border Patrol people on the border that's a request that from the from the Border Patrol we're getting our thousand men from the National Guard from governor 30 days I'd like to see us address the 2008 law that will treat those coming over from non-contiguous countries like those that that that that do come from contiguous countries and I'd like to see how we're going to pay these communities back the money that they're out by doing a fantastic job under under you know difficult circumstances so that's kind of what I want to see happen is more strength on the border their request and process these young men and women and these young children through quicker and began to get some similarity back at the border you know you go back in the 80s you go back in the 90s we had a lot of this Prada people coming over from Brazil at the time but the Border Patrol will tell you the difference was they could turn them back around and it would ease the pressure because people found out you can't go to America and you can't stay america got to do it in a law-abiding way I think we can begin that pretty easily and begin to send that message and possibly slow the the immigration down and save some of these people that are hurting themselves and actually dying and to get up here congressman Williams good luck there in Washington with the time that you have left thank you for being with us

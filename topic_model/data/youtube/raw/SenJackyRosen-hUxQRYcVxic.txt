or i want to talk a little bit though however about clinical guidance for all our practitioners of course their support staff to prevent and treat monkey pox because i would say many clinicians maybe a majority of clinicians have not directly treated monkey pox and may have not seen a wide range of cases so it's critical for clear guidance to be widely available to all medical professionals and i would also say their support staff who don't do answer the phones take the questions in the room when they're doing their own histories and physicals it's important for treatment and prevention and so regarding monkey uh prevention i've concerns about the not just the slow rollout of vaccines to vulnerable populations and i appreciate that you have been doing significant work to make the vaccines more available but with all these vaccines rolling out there's a new covert vaccine it's a flu vaccine there's a pneumonia there's a shingles of course then there's other things that people might get tetanus this or that for adults i'm talking about adult population it's a lot of confusion about boosters can i combine vaccines and so um i'm really really concerned that um the cdc dr linsky what are you doing to mount this public information campaign on the wide variety of vaccines important ones available we don't want someone to maybe not get a shingles my parents both had it's very painful how are we going to do that at pharmacies and public spaces even besides our doctors people may not be going to a doctor a clinic but maybe they're going into their local drug store or grocery store every week right yeah so thank you senator for that important question and i think one of the things you raise is one of the challenges that we've seen um first with kovid now with monkey pucks and one of the places i would really welcome congress's help we don't have a mechanism in this country by which we inform all clinicians of a new outbreak or a new disease so this has been through a lot of public education we've had a massive amount of outreach we have health advisory networks that we reach out to when we put out a health advisory and we've done four for monkey pucks they reach about a million clinicians we've done what we call clinic clinician outreach webinars and calls coca calls they reach about six thousand clinicians we put them online they reach about another ten thousand each one that we do we've done several of those i personally have sent a letter to all boarded clinicians through the double amc working with each state to try and send letters out to inform people of a disease that they may have never heard of and may have never seen but tomorrow might walk into their clinic so what do they need to know what are the protections that they need to take and how would they diagnose treat and and care for a patient with this infection so that has been a lot of the work that we've had to do during this um during this outbreak i will say from a health worker safety standpoint at least as far as monkey pox is concerned we've seen very little outbreak in healthcare workers we have had one diagnosed healthcare worker after a needlestick injury um but we have seen very little um healthcare worker outbreak uh due to our personal protective equipment and the outreach that we've done in telling healthcare workers how to protect themselves what about the broader idea of that we have this fall so many vaccines that are available we'll just say to the adult population preventative vaccines for that we normally have flu shingles pneumonia for a few of those now a covet booster now potentially a monkey a monkey pox uh shot how are you gonna just get this out to con patients consumers people in general so we do a lot of provider calls for that as well our advisory committee on what if you're not going to provide or how are you going to get it to the average person well so we've been doing public uh we've been doing press conferences we've been doing advisories um as we've rolled out both the bivalent booster we have a massive flu campaign that we roll out early in early october which we will again do this year one important thing i want to just highlight though is that we at cdc and we in this country do not have a mechanism like we do with children you listed adult vaccines i believe there are 13 of them that are advised adult vaccines we do not have a mechanism in this country to finance adult vaccines the way we do it at vaccines for children's program so when we look at the equity of getting vaccines to rural populations to other populations we do not have a mechanism by which to do that in an equitable fashion the way we do for children that is a big constraint that we have right now thank you i know i only have 20 seconds left but dr fauci i just want to ask you quickly we have monkey pox so medication to treat the infection but they're symptom management we hear a lot of talk about about opioids i know it's very painful monkey pox i don't know what the treatment might be but what kind of guidance are you giving the medical community about effective pain management as it relates to the neuropathy i would imagine that uh monkey pox causes there are medications for the neuropathy but the importantly particularly when it's on the mucosal surface be it the anal rectal mucosal or the urethral mucosa that can be extraordinarily painful we recommend and the hospitals do this anyway i think that's pretty common knowledge it is an acute not a chronic pain so it's the kind of thing that you would not hold back on any type of pain medication just because you're concerned about addiction the the discussion that we've been having about fentanyl and the opioids is not using it for chronic pain this is not chronic pain this is very acute pain that usually resolves itself within a period of a couple of weeks but you certainly don't want your patient to suffer inordinately by holding back pain medications similar to that pain of shingles in that same way thank you my time's expired

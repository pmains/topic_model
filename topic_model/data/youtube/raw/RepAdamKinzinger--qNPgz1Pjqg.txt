POLITICALLY, BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT GUNS. >> PRESIDENT BIDEN AND SENATOR  TED CRUZ IN A DEBATE OVER GUN  VIOLENCE THAT'S BECOME ALL TOO  FAMILIAR. ONE REPUBLICAN WHO HAS CHANGED  HIS POSITION ON GUNS IS  CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER OF  ILLINOIS, HE JOINS US NOW. CONGRESSMAN KINZINGER, LET ME  JUST ASK YOU STRAIGHT UP, WE  HEARD FROM SENATOR MURPHY THAT  HE THINKS THAT SOMETHING  DIFFERENT MAY BE HAPPENING THIS  TIME, THAT HE HAS FAR MORE  ENCOURAGING CONVERSATIONS WITH  REPUBLICANS NOW THAN EVEN AFTER  NEWTOWN, WHAT'S YOUR SENSE? I MEAN YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY WILLING  TO DEAL ON THIS, BUT DO YOU  THINK SOMETHING WILL GET DONE? >> IT DOES SEEM THAT WAY. FIRST OFF, I WANT TO COMMEND  CHRIS FOR ONE SPECIFIC THING,  I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE HE SERVED  IN THE HOUSE, IT'S EASY IN THIS  BUSINESS TO START THROWING OUT  THINGS REPUBLICANS AREN'T GOING  TO DO AND MAKE A CAMPAIGN ISSUE  FOR NOVEMBER, I THINK HE'S  WILLING -- DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A  CAMPAIGN ISSUE -- HE'S FOCUSED ON WHAT I CAN DO AT THIS MOMENT. THAT'S A HARD THING TO DO. I DO THINK WE'RE ON THE TRACK OF MAYBE GETTING SOMETHING. LOOK, THE REALITY IS, I ACTUALLY THINK THE RAISING -- IF WE CAN'T GET IT DONE -- I THINK RAISING  THE PURCHASE OF A GUN IS  NO-BRAINER. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PARKLAND SHOOTING, BUFFALO, THIS SHOOTING, THESE ARE PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 21. WE KNOW THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN  DEVELOPS AND MATURES A LOT  BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 AND 21. WE RAISED THE AGE OF PURCHASING CIGARETTES  FEDERALLY TO 21. >> THE ISSUE OF RAISING THE AGE  IT'S REMARKABLE TO LOOK BACK AT  ALL OF THESE SHOOTINGS AND SEE  HOW MANY OF THEM ARE DONE BY  INDIVIDUALS, MEN, YOUNG MEN 18  TO 21, EVEN NEWTOWN, THE SHOOTER WAS 20, HIS MOTHER ACTUALLY GOT  HIM THE GUN, BUT MANY OF THEM  ARE BOUGHT LEGALLY, BUT LET ME  ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR JOURNEY ON  THIS, BECAUSE YOU -- YOU WERE  ONCE AN A-RATING FROM THE NRA,  YOU OWNED AN AR-15. DO YOU STILL OWN AN AR-15? >> I DO, YES. >> HELP ME UNDERSTAND, HOW DID  YOU GO FROM BEING SOMEBODY WHO  WAS RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE GUN  LOBBY ON THIS TO SOMEBODY WHO  THINKS IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THESE LAWS? >> LOOK, IT'S A JOURNEY OF, YOU  KNOW, GETTING SICK OF SEEING THE MASS SHOOTINGS. YOU KNOW -- LOOK, I'M A STRONG  DEFENDER OF THE 2nd AMENDMENT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I BELIEVE FOR A STRONG REASON THAT AS A  PERSON WHO APPRECIATES THE  2nd AMENDMENT WE HAVE TO BE THE  ONES PUTTING FORWARD REASONABLE  SOLUTIONS TO GUN VIOLENCE. THE REACTION OF MY COLLEAGUES TO THE NRA TO SAY, IF YOU WANT TO  COME AND TAKE MY GUNS, I'M GOING TO GO WALK AROUND, I'M GOING TO GO INTO THE MICHIGAN  STATE CAPITOL WITH MY A.R., BY  THE WAY CAN I MAKE A POINT THAT  OPEN CARRY ESPECIALLY WITH ARs  IS ONE OF THE MORE INSANE  THINGS. TO WALK INTO THE STATE CAPITOL  OF MICHIGAN WITH A GUN BECAUSE  IT MAKES YOU FEEL TOUGH, THESE  ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT 2nd AMENDMENTS ARE DOING NO FAVORS  TO DEFEND THAT. FOR ME I WOKE UP THE MORNING  AFTER THE VEGAS SHOOTING, I HAD  SHOT A BUMPSTOCK BEFORE,  I HEARD THE AUDIO FROM THAT  SHOOTING, I KNEW THAT WAS A BUMPSTOCK AND  I CALLED FOR BANNING BUMPSTOCKS  THAT WAS ULTIMATELY DONE AND  BECAUSE OF THAT THE NRA SAID,  KINZINGER IS A RINO, OR WHATEVER THEIR LANGUAGE WAS, AND I  REALIZED ESPECIALLY THEN, NRA  ONLY CARES ABOUT RAISING MONEY  ON YOUR BACK, THEY DON'T GIVE A  LOT OF MONEY TO PEOPLE, THEY CAN GET PEOPLE UPSET. THEY'RE COMPETING WITH ANOTHER  GROUP CALLED GUN OWNERS OF  AMERICA, YOU THINK THE NRA IS  CRAZY, LOOK AT THE GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA, THESE ARE THE ONES WHO  THINK THERE SHOULD BE ZERO  RESTRICTIONS OF OWNING GUNS. THE NRA HAS BECOME, IT'S GONE  FROM DEFENDING RIGHTS OF GUN  OWNERS, IT'S BECOME A GRIFTING  SCAM, AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS  LOOK AT THE LAST FEW YEARS OF  THE GRIFTING SCAM OF THE NRA TO  KNOW THAT'S TRUE. >> THE GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA, I  REMEMBER COVERING THEM AFTER THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING. THEY'RE OUTRIGHT IN SUPPORT OF  MILITIA MOVEMENT IN THE COUNTRY. BUT THE NRA ITSELF IS,  YOU KNOW -- HAS HAD HUGE ISSUES  WITH ITS BUDGET, INTERNAL  SCANDALS, NOT THE FORCE IT ONCE  WAS, BUT THE ISSUE STILL SEEMS  TO HAVE AHOLD ON REPUBLICANS AS  MUCH AS EVER NOW. >> LOOK, I THINK THE RIGHT TO  KEEP AND BEAR ARMS IS IMPORTANT  TO REPUBLICANS. IT IS TO ME TOO. BUT FOR SOME REASON WE GOT  LOCKED INTO THIS POSITION  OF WHERE WE CAN MAKE A  DIFFERENCE. YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, FLORIDA,  RAISING THE AGE OF BUYING GUNS  TO 21, THE RED FLAG LAWS, THIS  IS FLORIDA, RIGHT, THIS IS RICK  ON THE SCOTT, THIS IS RON  DESANTIS' STATE, THERE WAS NO  BLOWBACK, LET'S DO THAT KIND OF  STUFF NOW, BECAUSE, LOOK, YES,  IT'S ULTIMATELY A MENTAL HEALTH  ISSUE, SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE A  DECISION TO PULL A TRIGGER, BUT CAN AN 18-YEAR-OLD BUY AN  ASSAULT RIFLE THE DAY OF HIS  BIRTHDAY WITH HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION, AND STILL KILL  20-SOME PEOPLE WITH 150 COPS  STANDING AROUND? OBVIOUSLY YES. WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP OR  MITIGATE THIS? THIS IS -- JONATHAN, YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO, I TALK TO PEOPLE  OVERSEAS ALL THE TIME, THIS IS  EMBARRASSING, THEY LOOK AT THE  UNITED STATES AND SAY, WHAT'S  GOING ON? WE CAN HAVE THIS RICH TRADITION  OF KIND OF INDIVIDUALISM AND GUN RIGHTS, YOU KNOW I'M A BIG  STAUNCH ADVOCATE OF CON SEALED  CARRYING IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BUT THIS ATTITUDE, FIRST OFF,  YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO  DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS TO TO SECOND  GENERATION. SECONDLY, YOU'RE PLAYING TOUGH  CAMP OUT THERE WHILE REAL PEOPLE AND INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE DYING. >> BEFORE YOU GO THE AR-15, YOU  OWN AN AR-15, LAS VEGAS, IT WAS  AN AR-15, THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB,  SANDY HOOK, UVALDE, SO MANY OF  THESE ARE WITH THAT WEAPON, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO CHRIS MURPHY WHO  SAYS THAT THE AR-15 SHOULD BE  BANNED, STRAIGHT UP BANNED? >> I SAY THAT I'D LOVE TO GET IN A CONVERSATION WITH HIM IN A  GOOD WAY. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THIS  REAL DISCUSSION, AND I DON'T  MEAN THAT AS POLITICIANS, I  THINK IF THERE'S A WAY WHEN IT  COMES TO ARs IF THERE'S A  SPECIAL LICENSE YOU NEED TO OWN  ONE, ARE THERE WAYS WE CAN  ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO OWN  THEM -- LOOK, AGAIN, WE ALL HAVE TO ADMIT, 99.9% OF AR OWNERS ARE NOT WALKING IN AND HAVING MASS  SHOOTS. I'M DEFINITELY READY TO ENGAGE  IN THAT CONVERSATION, AND MAYBE  INCLUDING NOT SELLING THEM  ANYMORE. THAT'S FINE. TO ME, AGAIN, I'M FOCUSED ON  SAVING LIFE NOW. AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT'S THE  FIRST THING WE CAN DO TO  MITIGATE THIS SITUATION? RAISE THE AGE TO 21. RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE THINGS WE  CAN DO TO STOP IT. >> CONGRESSMAN KINZINGER,  AND LET ME ALSO SAY, I KNOW YOU'RE AN IRAQ WAR VETERAN,  MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND, THANK YOU  FOR JOINING US ON THIS MEMORIAL  DAY WEEKEN

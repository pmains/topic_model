Mr. Speaker, the Republican health care bill
is a giant step backwards. It will leave millions of Americans without
any insurance and many more paying more money for less coverage. Worse, it will reduce protections requiring
insurers to treat fairly those of us with pre-existing conditions. Instead of this disastrous plan, we should
be working together to improve health care -- building on the progress of the ACA and
finding solutions to what isn't working. Let me offer one example: I recently introduced
the Common Sense Employee Notification of Special Enrollment Act or Common SENSE Act. This bill would require employers to inform
people leaving a job that they not only qualify for COBRA, but also qualify for a special
enrollment period to purchase insurance on the ACA marketplace or enroll in Medicare,
which is often less expensive than COBRA. Mr. Speaker, this bill will help Americans
save money and seniors avoid last minute enrollment penalties. I urge my colleagues to support the Common
SENSE Act and join me in finding common sense ways to improve our health care, not to dismantle
it. Thank you.

this morning Pat obviously everybody is trying to make heads and tails out of Tuesday night's massachusetts election what do you take from it well I think this is just the latest in a trend the theories of elections that have demonstrated that the American people recognize that there's a federal government that's run out of control it's just way too big it's trying to spend money that we don't have on a frightening scale its effort to take over health healthcare it just became the latest and most urgent an example of the excesses that are coming from the liberal wing of one party the Democratic Party in complete control of the government and people all across the country including the most liberal state in America are saying this is too much you know when you look at the whole situation and I think there are a lot of Republicans out there kind of beating their chests right now I wouldn't bleed too loudly Republicans had their chance before show they couldn't handle leadership terribly well and they're on the outside looking in so what admonition would you make the Republicans right now maybe even yourself well I would you know I had a lot of disagreements with my own Republican colleagues and I served in the house as part of the reason I ran to a Senate in 2004 against Arlen Specter I thought he was part of the problem then as he's part of the problem now and it really doesn't matter which party is in he's for growing governments and increasing our spending and debt and taxes now I think the important thing for Republicans is not to be thinking about partisanship so much as the underlying principles that bring people to the Republican Party the principles of limited government and fiscal responsibility and recognizing that it's a free enterprise system that creates sustainable jobs and wealth and opportunity not ever bigger government pada was just a few months ago that you and Gary and I were on the air here talking about the idea that the government was going to change one small election at a time little did we know that it was going to take place in Massachusetts with a guy that nobody ever heard of before outside of the state of Massachusetts as you look around the country right now with seats in jeopardy all around the country what do you see in terms of a changing political landscape now in America well I think there's a terrific opportunity for someone like me a guy who has experienced both in the private sector and in government a guy who is has long argued that we cannot afford the size government that we we currently have that that we need a return to some personal individual responsibility individual initiative it's what it's going to get us out of this mess and those who continue to promote the old ways mean the Arlen Specter and Joe suspects of the world to think that growing government is the answer to all of our problems I really think their days are numbered you know there's something I think the people of Massachusetts have tapped into and I think it's it's the tip of the iceberg for all the various tea party people would be the new activists who have come out this year who have never been out before there's an arrogance among or hired help that is it's just tasteful this arrogance says we could do anything we want to do in your name superficially with your money whenever we want to do it and it seems to me that the people Massachusetts it up said no you can no that's absolutely right and that's a big part of what's going on is the arrogance of this government you know think about what they've done in this course of this year the whole Tea Party movement arose as a reaction to the wild excesses of this government and they ignored it they tried to demean it they tried to push it aside so I doesn't mean anything and then of course we had hundreds and thousands of people coming to town hall meetings with members of Congress across the country expressing ordinary Americans expressing a genuine there and concern for the future of the country and they try to push that aside well over the Brooks Brothers suits or something you know and then of course neutured New Jersey elect a Republican governor a very very blue state virginia which abama had carried in 08 flips and elect a republican governor and they still want to ignore us you know at some point this is a serious peril when these politicians think that they don't have to pay attention to the will of the people they've got it completely backwards if they think that these are you know the people work for them that are entitled to these seats and they're going to learn the hard way one of the things that people have really notice I've noticed as about tea party but with this year I think it's one of the purest movements I've seen it a long time because it's a movement from the grassroots and I think one of the warnings out there is well be it to whatever party whatever group tries to co-op it for strategic purposes and somehow tinge the pureness of that party where they're only asking for good policy no matter where it comes from and principal policy no matter where it comes from well again I go back to the point i think what it's all about is the fundamental principles it is and you know someone like arlen specter is demonstrated that the only principle he cares about his own re-election joe Sestak i'll give him credit he is a principled man unfortunately the principles that he espouses are extremely far left liberal ideological ideas of them dramatically bigger and more powerful government I've got a set of principles of smothers believing I've got a public record that shows that I believe in limited government and personal freedom free enterprise system I believe in this great country and and the unique role that would play in the world and then I believe that the best years of America are ahead of us if we remember who we are and what made up this great country well paddle have a chance to hear them all today because all four of you are on today you're the leadoff guy out of the gate so thanks for getting on base and we'll look forward to talking to you again very soon thank you very much for having a guy Thank You Patrick running for the Republican nomination

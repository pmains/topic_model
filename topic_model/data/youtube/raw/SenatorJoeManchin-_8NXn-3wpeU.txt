As Americans defended the
United States, our allies and the values that we
hold dear throughout the last century, West
Virginia servicemembers never balked and bravely
led the way. I always say that West Virginia is one
of the most patriotic states in the nation. And
this Veterans Day, Gayle and I urge all West
Virginians to reflect on the men and women who
sacrifices prove that America is a nation worth
fighting for. As one of the states with the
highest veterans per capita, West Virginians
know what it takes to protect our great country.
These veterans are brothers, sisters, fathers
and mothers. They're our neighbors and our
coworkers. And while it is important for us to take
the time to honor them this Veterans Day, we
encourage our fellow Americans to recognize
their service each and every day. We are
incredibly grateful to every veteran and military
family, especially our Gold Star families, for
their remarkable patriotism, and the
sacrifices that they have made so that we can sleep
soundly. May God continue to bless our veterans, the
great State of West Virginia and the United
States of America.

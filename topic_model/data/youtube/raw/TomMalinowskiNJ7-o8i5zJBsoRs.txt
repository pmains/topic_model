thank you everyone for joining us tonight for our gender equality roundtable we thought it was particularly timely as today is national women's equality day it was a hundred years ago today that secretary of state brainbridge colby quietly and without fanfare signed the proclamation that gave women the right to vote of course we know that black and indigenous women did not enjoy the same rights until decades later and that even today many americans still cannot freely and easily exercise their right to vote which is why that while we celebrate this momentous and hard-fought victory we pause to reflect on the work that still lies ahead so when generation ratify reached out to us ask if they could have some time with congressman malinowski we decided we could do better we invited them to participate in tonight's roundtable generation ratify is a youth-led movement to ratify the equal rights amendment it was founded a little over a year ago their mission is to correct the historical exclusion of women and non-binary folks from our constitution by mobilizing youth across the country to take action to ratify the equal rights amendment and advance gender equality to this end gender ratify generation ratify has identified legislation in congress that will move us towards a more equitable and perfect union it's my pleasure to introduce our panelist lexi abrams lexi is a rising senior at melbourne high school after taking a woman studies class during her sophomore year she became more interested in the gender equality movement with that she joined generation ratify this january as the new jersey state co-lead in addition to generation ratify she's also the membership director for new jersey high school democrats and an intern for tom malinowski for congress penelope jennings penelope is a rising junior at newark academy since 2017 she's been part of many marches for causing for causes including women's rights and helps lead her school's women empowerment club because of this interest she joined generation ratify new jersey this april as the new jersey policy director along with generation ratify she is the finance director of new jersey high school democrats and she is involved in the new jersey chapter of period and of course we have our esteemed congressman tom malinowski i'd like to invite lexi and penelope to each say a few words lexi the floor is yours thank you so much lisa hi everyone thank you so much for joining us today so um just to say a little bit about me my name is lexi um and i'm the co-lead for generation radfi new jersey um and penelope and i are so excited to be participating in this roundtable discussion with congressman malanowski um and again i've had the pleasure of interning for him in 2018 and in 2020 um so i know firsthand that he is committed to fighting for gender equality um and generation ratify lisa already gave a little background on our organization um but basically we started about a year ago and then the new jersey chapter um started this january um and since then we've had phone banks letter writing parties we formed partnerships with like-minded organizations and most recently we participated in a national lobbying day with the rest of generation ratify and so for this lobby day um which was on the one year anniversary of generation ratifies founding um we worked with other members of generation ratify from across the country to um lobby um senators and representatives um and it was an amazing experience and i think everyone learned a lot about lobbying and kind of like the behind the scenes of how lobbying congress really works um and now i will pass it over to penelope so she can introduce herself and give a little bit about the history of the era yeah hi my name is penelope as lisa said i'm the policy director of the new jersey chapter of generation ratify and i think it's really fitting that we're continuing this fight for gender equality and for the equal rights amendment in new jersey because um alice paul who was one of the original authors of the era she was actually born in mount laurel and she lived in new jersey so some background on the era it was first introduced in december 1923 and it then gained a lot of traction in the 1960s with the women's rights movement and congress had originally set a ratification deadline of march 22nd 1979 1979 for state legislatures and in 1977 we had uh 35 of the required 38 ratifications and it seemed destined for ratification until phyllis schlafly you might know from the new uh show mrs america and her movement of conservative women um they actually got five states rescind their ratifications and the deadline was then extended to june 30th 1982 but there are not any more ratifications in that period and since then the era just kind of laid in this limbo of i mean people know about it has some support but it still has not um been passed into law and the amendment has been intrigued it's been introduced in every session of congress since 1982 and our current house has passed h.j res 79 to remove the ratification deadline and currently sj res 6 is in the senate and i'm really hoping they can pass that resolution before we have to start all over again this january all right great thank you both of you congressman um thank you so much uh lisa thanks for uh convening us and um for reminding us of the the history we're commemorating in addition to the history that we're still uh trying to make um that secretary of state had a pretty funny name i was i was giggling um but um but most of all i want to say thanks to to lexi and penelope for for being our leaders today and for starting uh your uh your leadership at such a young age it you know this is sort of sounds like a cliche that you hear from older people all the time but it gives us hope it really really does and you have picked a very very good cause and you're absolutely right to uh to convene us in a discussion of what should be done and how it should be done um i think you know the big the big topic here is the constitution of the united states and um you know the constitution it kind of serves two purposes in our society um on the one hand it is a legal document and the words written down there have legal force they can be used by all of us to ensure that our rights are respected that government functions the way it's supposed to that it treats us in accordance with certain rules we can take that to courts and um and argue and win cases and so that's you know probably the most important function of the constitution but there's also another really important role that the constitution plays it's a symbolic document it it is a summing up of what we believe it means to be an american the rights and responsibilities of citizenship the meaning of this country um and you know when the the the era was was being debated in the 1970s there were a lot of um there were a lot of legal arguments for why we really desperately needed to have equal protection um guaranteed explicitly for for women for people regardless of their gender identity and you could argue some of those legal issues have been resolved by the supreme court justice ginsburg when she was an advocate before the supreme court this was her life's work but certainly not all and we can talk today i'd love to talk to you on this call today about some of the ways in which the era is still going to be useful in making a difference in people's lives but beyond that the symbolic importance of this i think should not be underestimated like this is a you know it in in the fundamental document that defines who we are and what our rights and responsibilities are to not have a plain statement that we are all equal regardless of our gender is really galling especially especially given the progress we've made i mean it it like i get why you know a bunch of old white guys in 1789 weren't necessarily thinking about this as their top priority but there's no excuse for us given what we know and what we believe today this this just has to be part of that symbolic presentation of what uh it means to be an american and so you know one of my favorite votes in my first term as a member of congress was the vote to extend that deadline and there are all kinds of interesting debates right about what happens when congress sets a deadline and it passes can you go back in time and extend it what about those states that rescinded their ratification and people are debating all of those things my personal view is that it really is up to congress to resolve them that we have the power to do it um and that if we can get that um legislation through the senate as well that that should settle the question it may still go to the courts we may still have some arguments but my hope is that it settles the question and we will get this thing ratified of course i'd love to do it in this session i'm not super confident that mitch mcconnell shares our values but don't worry if it doesn't happen as long as we you know keep that house majority that we elected in 2018 redoing it in the house is really easy um we'll just redo it don't worry uh and hopefully we'll have a senate that is slightly different in january of 2021 a senate that is willing to listen to um young and wise voices like yours and and we will get it done so um i so look forward to being there when that happens and look forward to um this conversation about what that would actually mean to all of our lives thank you thank you congressman thank you everyone so that actually is a perfect lead-in for our panelists for lexi and penelope why have youth organizations rallied around the ratification of the equal rights amendment why after all these years um yeah so well as we mentioned before the equal rights amendment has been introduced in every session of congress since 1982 so it has always kind of been there but i think it has been just recently that we are reintroducing it and i think part of the reason is because living just like as kids and growing up right now is kind of scary because a lot of some rights that we consider to be pretty basic are being called into question and a lot of the rights we have today are they're upheld by court cases that have set precedent but they could be overturned they could be overruled and as congressman malinowski said uh the area it's a really basic document when you look at it and i think its simplicity is a good thing in this case and it directly states in section one that equality of rights under the law should not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex and the statement of sex discrimination has been interpreted to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and i just think that because of the fact that it can be interpreted in these ways i think it provides good protection um if like i mean i would never i don't think this will happen and i'm really terrified if this were to happen but if roe v wade were to be overturned i think that the era provides a nice yeah just protection and i think it is there um to keep us safe and personally i would feel a lot safer if i knew that this uh statement of equality was passed into law um yeah i'm kind of just saying what penelope said i think a big factor for people is safety um so when like president obama um was in office a lot of us were super young but we kind of like knew enough about the world to know that we were safe and that like our rights were somewhat um protected by um the president and that he had them in mind um but after donald trump was elected a lot of people stopped feeling safe um and a lot of people took to educating themselves and like looking for ways to make a difference which is true for me um and a lot of people that i've spoken to from across the country who are part of generation ratify um and so the national organization actually got started because rosie who is our executive director was going through bills in the virgin virginia assembly and she stumbled upon um the one to ratify the equal rights amendment um and she basically just like worked with a couple friends um to build up the movement to what it is today um but that basically just kind of shows that when we realize and when she realized and then when everyone else began to realize that these extremely basic rights weren't enshrined in the constitution we were all scared and nervous and we kind of knew that we had to do something about it and that kind of propelled us into working with generation ratify and just like being more aware of what's going on concerning gender equity in congress and just everywhere in the country thanks um penelope you mentioned that you were did work with period can you tell us a little bit more about the menstrual equity movement uh yes so yeah so the menstrual equity movement is largely immediately what sort of the work that period does largely focuses on targeting period poverty because those of us the members of our population who i mean if you can't afford food and you can't afford clothes if you're i mean imagine you're trying to feed your family and you have to pick between that and pads it's kind of i mean i think you would choose food and then you have to go without pads and um it's really difficult choice for people to make and it's hard to go to work a lot of people would have to stay home from work uh in order to do that and it gets in the way of life and when we've like talked to food pantries in the past and a lot of times if you ask food pantries what the item they need most is they're probably going to say menstrual products because i mean they're a necessity they're also like they're pretty expensive and i think people just don't really think of them as such and um yeah so currently we have generation ratify also as an organization um at our lobby day that lexi mentioned earlier one of the bills that we lobbied representatives for was hr 1882 which is the menstrual equity for all act and if this act were to be passed it would get um get menstrual products in prisons for detainees it would get it in homeless shelters and it would also require all public schools to provide their students with free menstrual products which is an issue that i mean i think that would help me and i know a lot of other people a lot because it's just another thing to think about and if you don't know your period is coming and you go to the bathroom and you need something it just it takes a lot of time out of your day that you have to leave class and when we have to keep doing that it kind of sends the message that oh if you have to go back and forth to get that stuff it kind of says that the education of menstruators isn't isn't as important as the education of our peers who do not menstruate lexi how does it affect young people particularly yeah so i penelope is able um she might i don't think she mentioned this but her school recently um added in period products into their bathrooms which she's mentioned to me has been such a amazing help for her um and then for me um being in a public school i don't have that access to menstrual products um and of course i'm lucky to be able to afford them at home and bring them into school um but it's kind of just like toilet paper and like soap their necessities and should be provided by all schools but they're not um and i just like one of the things that i think about is if schools made students bring their own toilet paper it's it's basically the same thing in terms of necessity um and everyone would of course would be up in arms if that happened but when it's happening um to people who menstruate um it's not such a big issue and i think one of the reasons that it's um so prevalent and why um the youth are really um invested in this is because we've seen um this double standard and growing up in this age we've kind of recognized that as the double standard that it is um and we know that this shouldn't like be the norm and that something should be done to fix it congressman i know when you were working in the state department you dealt with some of these issues do you want to share some of them with us sure um but first let me say um i i will support that bill um and and get on it because it just makes perfect sense to me and i'm not surprised that you know sometimes because it's a little bit of a you know it has been historically kind of a taboo subject to talk about it shouldn't be right but um but the fact is it has been and sometimes it takes younger people to break through um taboos because like you know you you're too young to to have the habit right that you shouldn't talk about that stuff so you know why not i mean this is silly and your analogy to toilet paper is exactly right um and when you put it that way it's like of course right why why are we even not talking about this stuff um it's basic so um and by the way it's probably one of the things that if we ratify dra that would would could be fixed by it right in other words if we had to litigate it we shouldn't have to litigate it but if we had to i i i do think that the language of the era could be very very useful in persuading those who are still somehow unable to comprehend the basic logic of your argument so at the state department as a diplomat you know i i was responsible for uh for carrying america's message of support for human rights and equality all around the world and we were we were working in in countries um that are still in many cases debating the most fundamental parts of of this issue you know countries where women and girls still do not enjoy no matter what the laws of those countries say do not enjoy the most basic fundamental freedoms and rights freedom of movement freedom to decide what jobs they're going to have or whether they can travel outside of their own country whether they can go to school saudi arabia is probably the most egregious and well-known example in in the world where um where you still have actually in the laws of that country a system of what they call male guardianship which is exactly what it sounds like it's every woman and girl no matter what age has to have a male guardian it could be your father it could be your husband it could be your younger brother it could be your son and everything every decision that you make you know if you want to work somewhere have a job go to school leave the country get a passport it has to be signed off by your so-called male guardian and you know some people say well it's part of the culture of that country and to which my answer has always been well you know shouldn't everybody in a country have a say in what the culture of that country is and somehow i don't think the women of saudi arabia were given much of a say in deciding that this was part of their culture and so we we advocated for a change in those laws and it wasn't easy because you know we have this relationship with saudi arabia that um is mostly kind of military to military and they've been considered an ally for some reason and most past presidents have hesitated to raise these kinds of controversial human rights issues with that country but my job was to try to break through that resistance and to do it another place where women's rights issues which i think of i almost hesitate to say that phrase women's rights because we're just talking about human rights and extending them to everybody but uh another place where we really um got into some pretty fundamental debates was afghanistan and it's relevant today because we're we're having to decide right now as a country whether we stay in afghanistan or not it's a very difficult decision to make with strong arguments on both sides but before i was even at the state department when i was just a human rights activist i took a trip there this was maybe 10 years ago or so and met with the president of that country and had a long argument with him this was president karzai a long argument with him about whether and how to make peace with the taliban right the the islamic fundamentalist really terrorist group that has been terrorizing the people and the women and girls of afghanistan for many many years um and they don't believe that girls should go to school they don't believe girls should be seen outside of their home outside of their family and you know so i said to karzai look i get it you want to make peace because you want to end this war people are dying but um but shouldn't one of the conditions of that piece be that the taliban if you bring them in if you let them be part of the government of this country that they should respect what's in your own constitution guaranteeing the rights of women and girls and that you should exclude those commanders of the taliban that we know have been burning down girls schools and his answer to me was what's more important to a woman the right to go to school or the right to live right he tried to make it as if that was the choice like i i need to end the war so that people aren't killed isn't that more important than girls being able to go to school i said man you know you gotta have both because actually you know when women are denied basic rights we could we could prove statistically that the chances of violence the chances of terrorism insecurity were higher in those parts of afghanistan where women were denied their fundamental rights and so we went back and forth you know incredibly interesting um and very relevant today because you know a lot of us think that if we just pull out out of afghanistan today which you know there are good arguments for doing it we've been there for a very long time but if we do that um it might allow the taliban to take over potentially the whole country and what that would mean for the women and girls in afghanistan well it would be i think quite catastrophic so um those are some of the ways in which i confronted these issues as a diplomat overseas thank you for that thank you lisa thanks i'm so glad these women are fighting for us here too um so i want to talk switch gears a little bit about title ix um back in may i believe betsy devos rules um were basically undermined the protection of subtitle nine do you all want to explain a little bit what's going on because i think it kind of got lost in um all of the other news that's happening constantly uh yeah so i think a lot of us know that title ix has been instrumental in preventing their discrimination on campuses and in education and getting justice for sexual assault survivors i think some people know it just for ensuring that female athletes have the same opportunities to play on high school and college sports teams but the aspect that betsy devos has been challenging is the sexual assault protections part she is her new regulations uh are to give more rights to those accused of sexual assault on college campuses because she believes that the accused were not given due process and to do that she has narrowed the definition of sexual misconduct and she will allow those accused of harassment or assault question evidence and to cross-examine their accusers which i mean to me if i am in the position where you've been sexually assaulted and then your and then your soldier gets to cross-examine you that sounds terrifying that sounds like you've just had the worst experience of your life probably and then to have to face that person again and where they get to like question you and your experiences it just sounds really terrible and this and if her regulations go into action which they are supposed to this month then i just think it'll really um it's gonna try it's probably gonna stop a lot of people from coming forward and it's gonna prevent a lot of people from getting the justice that they need and another so this is um another one of the bills that we advocate for at our lobby day um is to address this and it is hr 5388 and it has a really long title but it reads to provide the secretary of education may not issue or enforce certain rules that weaken the enforcement of the prohibition of sex discrimination applica applicable under title ix of the education amendments of 1972. so that's the full title it's long but it does get to the point the main idea is just to prevent the secretary of education right now betsy devos from doing anything to undermine title ix which has really done so much for us and i think um i think we've all i think most women and girls in this country have had an exp have had an experience has provided them by title ix whether they know it or not just like playing youth sports or yeah having an experience with sexual assault on a campus and yeah so i think this bill is really important to us because um something that i mentioned earlier like there's just a lot of our basic rights that we've had just like we've had them for decades we've had that are being called into question right now this is another thing that i think we would like if the era had been passed and it's another bill where i mean the era is just sort of our backfall and it could be interpreted to include this that undermining title ix i think would um violate the equal rights amendment so yeah so as i mentioned buzzy boss's regulations are set to go into action this month so i really hope that we could get this bill passed to protect that but we'll see what happens congressman sure um well i i totally agree i think title ix is one of the most successful pieces of law in american history um you know i mean you can just in terms of the impact that it's had on millions of of of lives over the last what is it now over 40 years um and um so we should always be suspicious of somebody who comes in to office and the only thing she really seems to want to do is to weaken it um you know i'm a civil libertarian so i believe in due process including for people who are accused of terrible things but but i believe that the intent here was to undermine a law that has existed and been effective for all of these years in um giving people opportunity a sense of equality and dignity and equal worth and respect and so um i again very strongly agree with you that this is not the right way to go absolutely lexi i know that you lobbied some senators on the issue of black maternal health can you tell us a little bit more about the issue and what can congressman malinowski do to help yeah so um our national lobby day with the rest of generation ratify which i mentioned before um i was in a small group of people and we lobbied um senator pat toomey of pennsylvania um so we focused on a bunch of different bills but my responsibility um was the black maternal health omnibus act of 2020 um and it's like kind of a hard title to read out um but it is currently in the senate and that was introduced by senator kamala harris um hopefully future vice president um and then sorry is that why it's called the bus because her name is mamala oh i now it was like a combination of mom and omnibus we're not really sure i don't know it's not a real word so um but and then in the house it was introduced by representative lauren underwood um so this bill basically serves to combat discrimination in maternal health um and just a little statistic um black native american and alaska native women are two to three more times um times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women so this bill would direct health and human services and other agencies that specialize in this type of area to address these discrepancies so that includes establishing task forces awarding grants for like different types of oversight committees um and then commissioning more in-depth reports um on this specific subject and then something that i noticed in this bill which i thought would be a really great help um is that this bill calls for racial bias training for medical professionals um which i think is super important and might go a long way in um getting um women of color to receive the same type of care um and then if the congressman really wanted to help he could co-sponsor this bill um or he can just vote yes on it in the house it's still in committee i'm pretty sure um so if he wants he can join the other 56 house members who have co-sponsored the bill okay um i haven't taken a look at this one yet so give me a chance to to do that but it it sounds good what did senator toomey say by the way um so it was sorry actually clarified it was um someone from his office um and she i think she just kind of said thank you for sharing thanks for watching that was about it sometimes we have to say that because there's just you know there's so much out there and um you know and and and i think it is important for for members to you know read everything very carefully before they they sign on then again sometimes they say that because they want to brush you off um but i i promise you i will uh take a very close look at this with my staff lauren underwood is great by the way she's one of my favorite colleagues in this in this freshman class that i was elected as part of um and you know her background is uh in healthcare so she knows what she's talking about and and so somebody who's you know whose opinion on this i would greatly respect see come here it's like lobby day so we're going to um open up the questions to the audience some folks had pre-submitted questions so we're going to call on them first but if anyone wants to ask a question just put it in the chat and we will try to get to as many folks as possible um so we're going to start with eliza locks she's actually a member of generation ratify and she has a question about the future eliza oh as i've just muted you can you um press the unmute button on your zoom sorry i thought i actually muted myself um so my question is what do you think um the future of women's rights issues looks like uh it looks like you actually and it's it's you know it is what you define it to be it's certainly not um it's not something that i'm going to decide it's something that the younger generation of women seeing the world that they are inheriting from us seeing its deficiencies seeing what still needs to be done is going to tell us we need to do um i mean if you would ask me this question 10 years ago i probably would not have said menstrual equity right um and that's okay because my job is to listen to you and um and what you say makes a lot of sense and and my job your job is to lead here and mine is to follow um you know that we were talking about the us constitution and probably the most important words in it the words that kind of sum up america um are you know are the words about building a more perfect union because that really is our story it that phrase um admits that we have never been perfect and that we are not perfect but that um maybe uh it's not too arrogant to think that we have a perfect ideal which includes true equality um equal treatment equal respect for all people and um so every generation is going to be figuring out new ways to make this union of ours more perfect um by coming closer to that ideal of uh of equality um so you're gonna you guys are gonna make your contribution um you will make your representatives follow you and then when you're a little bit older um your daughters and granddaughters are gonna tell you what you failed to do and and then you're gonna listen to them thanks um what do you guys think it's gonna look like in the future yeah i was really i should be asking you that um sorry sorry you start you start um yeah i think it's for me it's pretty hard to like kind of have a concrete idea um but just like thinking off the top of my head obviously closing the gender pay gap that's like a big thing for me um something that i've like looked into a lot and done um like read a lot of articles about and something that is gonna affect me um when i enter the workforce um and then also just like more female ceos i mean especially for like young people seeing women in that type of power is so inspiring um and i think that if as in the future if we see more women in those positions then it will be um something that causes um young women um and young girls to want to achieve that um and have like that type of role modeling um and then oh yeah penelope i can let you jump from here um yeah i also want to see just like more intersectionality in the movement because i think we know like we talk about women's rights there's always um so many other issues we come across and like lexi was saying like the black maternal um abyss act like there's just it's so intersectional we can't really talk about women's rights without talking about the rights of so many other different groups of people um i want to see paid maternity leave and then along with like laws and the legal aspect i just want to see more of a change in attitude i want to see like the de-stigmatization of periods and like i'm period products and things like that being able to like breastfeed in public without judgment or looks um sort of like a change in attitude i think uh yeah there's always gonna be things we're not thinking of but i'm just hoping to see also that we're just able to look back and see that we're proud of changes that have been made and that um yeah we've progressed and that we've made changes yeah i think both of those make a lot of sense and and lexi to your point uh it's you know it's it's of course important for young women to see women in positions of authority in every realm of uh professional life it's also important for for men to see that um it's important for men to have the experience of working for women um and for that to you know it is it is increasingly normal right it wouldn't have been 20 or 30 years ago as much but we're not quite where where we need to be um you know one of the i think great arguments for um integration of of women at all ranks in the military is that you know here's this institution that has been associated with masculinity right for most of human history and it's very hierarchical so when you're working for somebody in the military you're really like you have to obey unquestioningly right and so to see you know to see women um in command positions um as generals and admirals in in our military um and hopefully running the defense department in a biden administration um it's very powerful symbolism and something that i think affects both um young women's expectations but also men's attitudes in a very positive way thank you so much um i think we've got a question from samantha hamm that touches a little bit on i think what lexi was talking about with um the gender pay gap samantha samantha i'm trying to unmute you but um it doesn't seem to be working did you want to just read your question lisa sure um so what are the plans to reduce the gender weight paid gender wage gap uh so that's an another piece of legislation that we we did in the session of congress in the house and another one that of course is stuck in um in the united states senate because somehow this is not mr mcconnell's top priority um you know i think you can't solve the whole thing with legal changes right because um it is it is also just the product of attitudes and um behavior that has been ingrained in in men for much of human history and in some ways in women as well not to demand right not to ask for the things that men are sort of trained to ask for and demand as they as they rise up the ranks um but there's certainly some things that we can do through legislation one one of the things and this really bugs me because we thought we fixed it in the obama administration there was a regulation that was put in place that required larger companies in america just to publish um their uh their salaries for their executives right so that you know if you were a female rising executive in a corporation in america and people men basically with the same level of responsibility as you were being paid more you would know because it would be public and that information could be used to shame the leadership of that company to pay everybody based on what they're actually worth and what they actually do and this administration came in and they rescinded that so you know we've been trying to fix things like that and and i'm confident that we will be able to do that [Music] after this election knock on wood if things go uh just a little bit well um you know and and by the way just talking about the politics of it it's it's not just about electing people this november who who will then want to do the right thing um it's about showing the party that well the people who i hope are going to lose this election that there is a political price to be paid for not caring about gender equality because you can see this is you know this is a voting issue this is um this is one reason why um a lot of women in america and allies of women who might have conservative attitudes on some issues right economic issues are turning away from [Music] a political party that has not been associated with the cause of gender equity yes thank you um okay you guys have anything to add or should we go take another question um just a quick statistic that i like that is one of my favorite statistics in terms of like public perception of the era um 94 of americans have said that they support an amendment to the constitution that guarantees equal rights for both men and women um so like the congressman was saying it's like even if people have more like economically conservative views there's like and they're a woman there's a possibility that this could be like some sort of deal breaker for them um and apparently for 94 of people it is something that that's important to them that they won't pass um so hopefully if this obviously it's probably not going to happen in this term um but hopefully in january of 2021 we can show congress um that this like the majority of americans more than the majority of americans support this and want this i think there's very little that 94 of americans agree upon so i'd say let's go for this what's wrong with flips though i don't know what's wrong with that it's like the one who doesn't approve of crest i mean there's not much we could do with that one six percent believe like that you know aliens are gonna land today is actually monday right there's no reasoning with some people all right um marilyn wazowski has a question about inclusivity uh yes um i was going to ask uh specifically penelope and lexi as as you have uh developed the initiatives with era and of course that was that emotion back in the 60s and how involved has your group uh been with our brown and black sisters uh to see their perspective on it and make sure that uh what happened during um the the suffragette movement uh that doesn't occur uh with the era going forward uh yeah so i think that's an amazing point and i think one of the things we need to do is to acknowledge that a lot of the leaders of the suffrage movement were pretty racist i know i mean i know and i think part of the issue is that i think i mean i know like susan b anthony like i was taught in elementary school to think of her as this amazing person leading the suffrage movement then i got to my ap u.s history class this year and i learned she's actually really racist didn't want black men to get the right to vote before white women so i think acknowledging that is a great step and then also yes like having the talking about this bringing up inclusivity and intersectionality in discussions and making sure that this movement like white women should not be the center of this movement i think that i think that um women women of color should be helping lead i think we should be supporting them um i mean they don't have to do all the work but i do think that their perspective is valuable and yeah i think that is i think we all bring different perspectives from different life experience and also just um experience with um different identities and i think that's valuable and i think making sure that we make space and being reflective of ourselves and thinking if um thinking who's in who is in the room who's being kept out of the room and maybe who hasn't been invited and just making sure i think we make this as open as possible and we want to present ourselves as being trying to be as inclusive as possible and yeah just thinking about who's there who isn't who should be here yeah um penelope put that perfectly um but just to add on a little bit um i think especially now today the 100th anniversary of the signing and putting the 19th amendment into the constitution yes it's a celebration but it's also a great time to reflect on that movement and what it really meant and who it was truly for um so i think today is a great opportunity for people um to just reflect on that and do more research and like learn a little bit about the history of that movement and go deeper into what we were taught like penelope said in elementary school um and just go a little bit deeper and learn more about about the history of this obviously amazing amendment but the fact that a lot of women were kept out of um out of that movement yeah i think lisa i i was just gonna add that also to keep in mind uh so much of these laws that are passed are dependent on who's in the executive branch and who's running government many of the laws that already exist regarding equal pay discrimination suits can sit in the eeoc for years if that is not a priority of the administration that's in the white house so i think we've got to keep that in mind and especially what we've seen over the last four years with the breaking up and the diluting and ignoring of many of the bills that have been passed and are in effect um it's really important to have people in the executive branch that have the mindset to carry this forward because otherwise we're back to square one absolutely thank you thank you for your question appreciate it our next question is from jen volson she has a question about gender roles yes thank you so much lisa thank you to our amazing panelists and to the congressman my question takes the discussion of gender roles and brings it right into my living room and my kitchen but also onto the floor of congress which is to ask now that we've all been in these public health orders to try to stay home as much as possible and homeschool our children and parents have been teleworking at the same time i wondered what you observed in your own homes regarding any possible gender imbalances with that arrangement and where the responsibility falls and also if there's legislation that could support working mothers like you know as far as universal basic income to get us through this public health crisis that has me wearing three to four hats at the same time thank you penelope lexi do you wanna what does it look like at your house yeah um sorry i can see my mom on the screen right now um and do we need her to um to get off while you answer this question no it's okay um i mean i think in my house one of the nice things is because it's me and my little sister she's 13. so part of the nice part is i think we're at the age where we can manage some things on our own and i think that is helpful in terms of this i don't know um what other people's home makeups are but that has been helpful over this time um i definitely see what you're saying i think in my house i think it's been pretty good but um in terms of gender imbalances but i do i know in other homes it's been pretty different but i think i know at least in my house i feel like there's been a lot a lot of shared responsibility yeah same here my mom's also on this call and i can see her right now um but i think it's been i mean at least for me my parents have always shared the work equally um and i've never really noticed an imbalance but i was actually watching the news a couple months ago and there was a news story um about like a young couple with um really small children and it was talking about how um the parents both couldn't keep up with their work so and then the woman um the wife just said like so of course i like i stopped my job i like thought i got i quit and i like looking at that i was thinking why is it of course that the wife had to leave her job why couldn't the husband leave her job um and i guess just the way that they presented it it was so matter of of matter of fact that of course the wife is leaving to take care of the kids that's her role um so i think although that doesn't happen in my household it does um across the country and people still think that that's acceptable and that that's normal um and then women are suffering from it because i think i remember she was talking about how much she enjoyed her job and how much um she benefited from it but she had to give that up because her family um assumed that it was her role to take care of the kids yeah well this is you know there are questions of law but also just social attitudes right so you on the one hand you need like we need much more generous uh parental leave policies in our country it should be for fathers as well as mothers but also social attitudes that that that that that place the same expectation on fathers to to actually take leave and to take those responsibilities and so some of this can be done through legislation legislation can begin to change attitudes but it's not um it's it's certainly not uh enough and then in the current crisis uh i think huge huge um responsibility we have that we have not met in congress is supporting child care um i mean it's huge anyway right under normal circumstances but particularly particularly now when so many families even you know where everybody's trying to do you know to treat each other well and to share responsibilities equally it's just too much i mean we the you know child rearing for working families is something that you know as hillary clinton said it does take a village you can't um the mom and dad alone can't do everything and and we're seeing that with kids at home right now and families struggling to hold down jobs even if they're able to hold down the job from their home so that's something we've been fighting for in the house and and we very much want if there's going to be another coronavirus relief build that's an important part of it to me wonderful and i think we have time for one more question um cindy barter has a question about women's maternal mortality rates um so i'm a physician and i'm very concerned about the maternity maternal mortality rate in new jersey black women are five to six times more likely to die in childbirth where nationally it's like two to three times and i think some of the things that impact that are access to advocates like doulas and and centering support groups and so trying to figure out if there's anything going through congress looking at that and i other also think another huge point one well systemic racism that impacts health care but the social determinants of health women of color tend to live in communities where they don't have access to health care as easily in transportation and that's been because of racist you know redlining for a really long time so it's not an easy fix but i'm i'm just trying to figure out are there things moving forward in congress that is looking to change some of those that have existed there for a long time i know in healthcare i'm trying to look at how do i teach physicians to be aware of their bias so that way communication happens in a better way but it's going to take a whole lot of different angles to impact this in any way shape or form yeah i think someone did mention actually was it the lauren underwood bill that had a component uh for uh for bias training for for healthcare workers um so i think you've reminded us that's an important part um uh you know i i don't have in my head a comprehensive uh list of what's been proposed in congress um i think i come back to the most fundamental issue here which is access not just to health care because all americans have access to some kinds of health care right um go to any emergency room and we all have access to the emergency room but um access to quality primary care to preventive care is is still obviously lacking and all of our debates about the affordable care act and moving beyond the affordable care act um i think really do come down to that to giving everybody that sense of security that where wherever you work whether you have a job if you change your job whatever your circumstances in life you should have the security to be able to get basic preventive care for yourself and for your kids and obviously like well i don't have to be a medical doctor to to know that that is um that is a very important determinant of whether a mother gets through childbirth whether she's had the the care from from day one um and then they're you know of course nothing's ever that simple right it's also [Music] you know making sure everyone has equal access to to the other components of good health nutrition and mental health which should be treated with parody um to all other uh aspects of health and um and then all of the economic issues issues of economic equality that we debate all the time um but surely you know those are complicated surely given the fact that most other advanced democratic countries have pretty much settled this and we have not um we we ought to be able to provide everyone with that basic healthcare security all right well i can't let you all go until i ask penelope and lexi and the congressman what can young people do to get involved and change and move us towards a more perfect union uh well i feel like i i don't necessarily need to tell the young people on this call because they're doing it um you know the the the the quick answer politicians usually give is you should be sure to vote and you guys are are taking on leadership roles even before um you're necessarily old enough to vote so i know i don't need to tell you to vote like that's that's taken care of you're already so far beyond that um and i think what you know what what a lot of people um a lot of people don't understand the power that they have and that there's not real it's not there's no secret sauce to becoming a leader in your community beyond having the confidence which is sometimes hard for a lot of us the confidence to step forward and just do it to say this is an issue i care about i'm going to start by getting my friends together i'm going to start by figuring out who the experts are and the mentors and the teachers who can guide me but i'm going to step forward and i'm going to do something about it that's not a complicated concept to grasp right but it it can be hard to do psychologically because we're all a little bit shy we're all a little bit insecure we all worry if i step forward if i'm the first person in the room in the class in the crowd to step forward what are people going to think of me but every leader is basically somebody who just said i'm going to do it anyway just as you guys did and so just keep doing that on whatever issue you care about and you can do it as an activist you can do it as um as your profession you can do it as somebody who gets involved in political campaigns and eventually runs for office someday um you know first time i ran for office was in college actually for student government vice president so you can actually start pretty early and then i stopped doing it for like 100 years and then started again um [Music] so you know just have that you know it's always going to be scary and it's okay to be scared and insecure because that just makes you human but but but know that um you know the people who who do step forward and overcome that are no different from you they just made the choice to do it and so keep making the choice to do it great advice and albie and lexi what do you recommend to your peers um yeah so i can start um this is like a self-promo um but if you are not already a member of generation ratify um you can totally do that um and of course we are so interested in affecting change and moving towards gender equality um and especially on the national level we have like a whole slack communication thing if anyone knows what that is um and i'm not kidding when i say there are events and things to do every single day i get so many notifications about phone banking and zoom calls and like um movie nights all across the country and then there's also organizations in new jersey so now new jersey which we work with at generation ratify in period new jersey which penelope is at um and those those organizations also focus on gender equity um and then i think besides that and i know we're running out of time but the biggest thing is just like educating yourself um and lisa mentioned this in the very beginning but um the reason i got super involved in the gender equality movement is because i took a woman's studies class um my sophomore year um and i had always like knew that there was gender inequality but i hadn't really like pinpointed it or really thought about it um and it was kind of like an ignorance bliss type of situation um but in that class we had to look up a current event and like write a summary of an article every other week um and those assignments really made me go out there and like actively look for the problems in around the world when it comes to gender um inequality um and that really propelled me to want to get more involved and like make a change um so hopefully if other people really want to get more involved just besides joining organizations just like educating yourself um is like what got me super involved and i think that could really help other people too great thanks healthy uh yeah definitely and i agree with lexi wholeheartedly and um like the congressman said voting is a great thing to do but if you're like me i'm 15. i can't vote until 2022 but um i mean just well if you are 16 in new jersey you can work the polls and make sure everyone else knows what to do and helping other people vote you can um encourage family members siblings anyone you know who's old enough to vote make sure they are registered and they know what to do because this year we're all revoked by mail now and it's just great to make sure people you know are sending their ballots in as early as possible um and there's also ways to um there's groups that are sending postcards to people in uh other areas like i think i think i know people who are sending them to like florida just to make sure that people everywhere know to make sure that they are still registered to vote um and also i just think the mo i think the most important thing you can do is like leslie said education and having those difficult conversations that no one wants to have with your family members with friends with people who might just might not get it i think sitting down and talking about the things that are taboo that no one wants to talk about i think that's the hardest thing to do and i also think it's the most important thing to do great well thank you so much this has been so just a wonderful event and since we're doing some plugging i'm going to plug as well another way for young people to get involved is that the campaign is looking for fall interns um ask lexi how much fun this is and if you go into the chat there's actually a link there um to sign up to to submit an application to be an intern but we would welcome everyone who is interested to join us this is we've said it a million times it's not a cliche the most important election of our lifetime so thank you all thank you lexi and penelope as to echo the congressman you give me hope so thank you thank you thank you everyone thank you everybody

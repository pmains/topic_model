let me three of our witnesses focus on economic and trade issues and I'll ask but LS the whole panel raise your hand if you were actively working against NAFTA back in the 1990's I see no hands going up and raise your hand if you were actively opposing a permanent MFN for China back roughly around the year 2000 no hands go up if I lead an unworthy life and the almighty decides to send me somewhere where I would pay for my sins I will be sent to a place where I'm surrounded by Wall Street Democrats and Wall Street Republicans and told that I'm that both sides are represented I used my five minutes here not in defense of Donald Trump but in defense of the traditional democratic view Democrats voted no on NAFTA CAFTA and shafte Democrats by two-thirds voted no on MFN for China and yet we have a panel where we don't have anybody who took those positions so someone has to speak for the traditional democratic view and that is that trade deficits matter that every billion dollars of trade deficit is another 10,000 jobs lost and that while our unemployment rate is low if we don't add two or three more million jobs we will not create the labor shortage necessary to see the increase in wages that the working class of this country has been denied for the last two decades unless we can raise real wages by ten thirty percent we will not redeem what has what has been over two lost decades people say how can you oppose MCA it's obvious the country has some questions or they call it what it is if you support it be honest enough and to say it's NAFTA 2.0 and so the question is do we want NAFTA 2.0 well if the choice is between NAFTA 2.0 and NAFTA 1.0 we can lay the two agreements next to each other they are incredibly similar we'll notice a few changes and we can decide but if the choice is whether to pull out of NAFTA altogether or to go with NAFTA 2.0 that is a very complicated issue especially when over the objections of the Democratic Party in this house we've knitted together these three economies in a way that would be difficult to respond to I chair the Asia subcommittee Trump didn't start the trade war China started the trade war 20 years ago and the wreckage of America exceeds anything done to us at Pearl Harbor and yet for 20 years we did nothing for 20 years we were told tariffs are bad so we'll go through legal processes and trade dumping disputes how's that worked out for us we have the largest trade deficit in the history of mammalian life on this planet and we keep saying let's go back to giant trade deficits let's go back to just checking the boxes and not looking at the non-tariff barriers that China is able to put up let's just say well well if we can just get them to reduce their tariffs that is not a market economy that is an economy where any major corporation that imports any major project American product in contravention of the policies of the Communist Party of China will be sent to an educated reeducation camp they know that and that's why they don't buy American planes unless we move the plane factories that's why you can't make something in the United States and sell it in China until they strip until they force you to make it in China and then transfer the technology and we're told let's go back to the good old days those days were so bad they elected Donald Trump as a scream of pain from western Pennsylvania from Michigan and Wisconsin and that pain has not has not been forgotten if the Democratic Party abandons the Democratic Party we'll get in 2020 what we got in 2016 I yield back [Music] a gentleman is out of time

now we're going to turn to two key members of the Senate Budget Committee New Hampshire Republican Kelly Ayotte who is in Manchester and Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine who joins us from Richmond said hurricane like to start with you last Friday the White House said it hopes the senate meeting led by the Democratic leadership will this week begin debate and have votes on an alternative to these across-the-board spending cuts as a Democrat on the Budget Committee senator what is your message the Democratic leadership how soon do you want that debate to begin and why is it taking so long for it to begin in the first place well we light a plan on the table about ten days ago and we will be voting on it this week I major and I completely agree I think this needs to start in the Senate and if we can find a balanced package in the Senate that get some bipartisan support we can avoid these sequester cuts I just did a trip around Virginia to Armed Services installations over the last week in Virginia 90,000 DoD civilian employees getting furloughed including nurses at army hospitals ship repairs laying off 300 of their 450 employees and wounded warriors who are scheduled to transition back to civilian life who in many instances Bob's their reserve us and they would go back into working in national security positions at the federal level and they're facing hiring freezes and furloughs that make them wonder whether they can reenter civilian life there's no reason that this has to happen we just need to find a balanced approach and that's the approach that we will be voting on this week but senator came to my original question why is it taking it so long you know in the Commonwealth of Virginia that these cuts have been in the pipeline they've been through I've been warnings about it for a good long time many Americans look at the situation say why does it always have to wait until the last minute you know major they're right I'm new here I've been in the Senate for about six weeks there's no reason we should be playing this kind of brinksmanship and as you know we've got kind of brinksmanship around around sequester and then later brinksmanship around continuing resolution what we need to do and you mentioned center diet and I are on the Budget Committee we need to return to ordinary budgeting we're writing a budget in the Senate this year for the first time in normal course of business since 2009 the right way to make decisions about spending about revenues and even about deficit reduction is as part of a normal ordinary budget process let's get rid of the gimmicks sequester continuing resolution get back to ordinary budgeting just like what happens in every state capitol every year that's the we're moving back to that and and that's going to be the solution to these challenges and doing it in a balanced way Saturday I don't want to bring you into the conversation the Democratic alternative will call for a mix of spending cuts but also tax increases are you prepared to support any tax increases will Republicans develop an alternative it has any loophole closings or do you think this can and should be done strictly through other alternative spending cuts major let me just say I agree with what Tim just said I serve on the Budget Committee I've been outraged by the fact that we have in a budget for three years because the Senate Democrats haven't wanted to do it I'm glad to hear Tim say we should do it we wouldn't be in these positions if we these sequester type situations if we actually prioritize spending in terms of the Democrats plan it seems like the first thing they come is we're going to raise taxes after having increased revenue if you recall in january six hundred billion dollars over the next ten years without any spending cuts i think republicans should have an alternative in the Senate i'm working on one to introduce one that will show that we're looking at a little over q % in a three point five trillion dollar pot of federal spending in 2013 so that's what we need to do i'll come up with an alternative spending cuts proposal with other colleagues in the Senate and i want to add that I think also this notion of giving the president the discretion to make the spending cuts I think that's a cop-out so I will be urging my colleagues to have an alternative is for us to present one else in Riyadh you proposed legislation that would allow some of these cuts to be carried over or dealt with through attrition at the federal employee work level meaning if there's people who leave the federal workforce they're not replaced one would be replaced for every three vacancies are you going to press that before the Senate I have offered that proposal along with buck McKeon in the house it's taken from the president's own fiscal commission but I'm actually working on an alternative with other spending cuts to bring forward working with other senators that I believe we will bring forward and I think that's the right thing to do I mean stepping back for a minute think about you you had the Secretary of Education on previously if you look at between 2008 and 2010 if you add in the stimulus the education spending increased forty-one percent so what we're looking at is how can we come up with more sensible spending reductions I agree with Tim that we don't want to undermine our national security I in fact traveled around the country with Senator McCain and Graham and actually went to Virginia we've been talking about this for a year and asking the president for a year to come forward in the campaign he said this wasn't going to happen it's time for him to lead this effort as the commander-in-chief of this country senator Cain and said hey I don't want to ask you this sort of larger threshold question their fourth quarter GDP numbers showed a negative growth and there were indications that might some of that might have been caused or originated with concern in the defense sector both of you represent states would have large that have large defense either operations or contractors is this the wrong time to be cutting any spending in Washington do we have a do we risk any sort of contraction in the economy if we go through with these no matter how they're composed major I think I think it is a risk and that's why I really think we need a balanced approach you know the Senate and House working together have already reduced spending by about 1.4 trillion dollars and as Kelly indicated there was a 600 billion dollar increase in revenue the right way to fix it going forward is a balanced approach that doesn't cut too deeply just use a Virginia example yesterday Governor McDonnell my governor you're going to have him on in a minute worked on a legislature of Democrats and Republicans for a compromise transportation package that reduced spending in some line items and increased revenue it was a balanced approach he had to buck grover norquist's to do it it wasn't perfect because compromises aren't perfect but it's that kind of balanced approach that will preserved armed services preserve defense and enable our economy to start to grow instead of choking off what we're seeing as a you know strong stock market and some other indications that we can have real success if we approach this the right way so yesterday I quickly do we have a austerity risk here or do these cuts need to happen it just needs to be a debate over how they're composed nature I think that we can do in a more sensible way what we need is leadership from the commander-in-chief rather than you know he's been out campaigning even though this idea came from the White House apparently from Jack Lew his Treasury nominee he's been out trying to blame Republicans I think the American people are tired of the blame game to come up with responsible spending reductions we can do that without hurting our economy in fact letting also dealing with our tax code to make us more competitive instead of just the first answer being further increasing taxes we can do to help economic growth and to move forward senator Ayotte thank you very much senator Kaine we've got to go I appreciate it both very much and we'll see you on washing see on Capitol Hill very soon and we'll be back

I thank the gentleman for yielding and for holding the special order to address the impact of the fossil fuel industry on Latinos and how a green New Deal can address the needs in our communities from sea level rise to the location of power plants to fossil fuel extraction to the urban heat island effect the inequities from our energy system and who bears its consequences are everywhere people of color are on the front lines of this issue we are hit first and worst we need a climate bill that rises to the skill of both the climate crisis and the damage from environmental racism that impacts my district and the district's like it across the country the best way for us to understand these challenges and how to overcome them is to meet environmental justice communities where they are our local challenges can provide useful information for federal climate policy that can address environmental justice issues across the country America needs to lead on a just transition away from fossil fuels and climate solutions must account for what that means for communities like mine we deal with the pollution from oil refineries and ongoing urban oil drilling which has a direct impact on the quality of the air we breathe at the same time that the fossil fuel industry has a disproportionate footprint in minority communities these industries often provide jobs including Union jobs to my constituents as we work to unwind the fossil fuel economy we need our climate policy to ensure a just transition includes the needs of communities of color this means creating union jobs in the clean energy industry with great benefits and it means opportunities for minority owned businesses to play a leading role in the clean energy future of tomorrow we must also focus on air admissions from ports and the communities near them bearing the burden in my district I have the Port of Los Angeles one of the most ambitious ports in the country when it comes to reducing emissions at the same time the port is a significant source of air and climate pollution and communities in my district believe the best path forward is for the port to achieve zero admissions as quickly as possible these are challenges that face ports throughout our country our climate policy must invest in America's ports to keep them competitive on a pathway to zero admissions as Democrats are in the majority we are in a position to move swiftly and boldly on this issue and we must do so I look forward working with my colleagues this year to craft a bold climate solutions that leaves no community behind thank you and with that I yield back

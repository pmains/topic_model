my name's mike sills i'm live in bedford new hampshire and i'm a vietnam veteran i was in artillery and i was a rotc officer i was on active duty from 1969 to 1971 and then i didn't get out of reserve still 76. after the war vietnam war agent orange had affected a lot of soldiers in the jungles they got some very strange diseases and cancers the va set up an ancient orange program as time goes on it comes to light that navy veterans that served in aircraft carriers and like off the shore vietnam were getting the same diseases and cancers probably from stuff planes were bringing in and coated with anyway and the va refused to take care of them unless you put foot on the land we're not covering your agent orange claim so uh they passed the law and the va you know the current administration va uh appealed it and they lost in court now i don't know what the strategy was but you know i'm not a spring chicken and neither are the rest of the vietnam veterans but i think they were just waiting us out so i wrote gene and i told her the story in a kind of a detailed letter which she knew a lot about because it was an issue in congress somehow she marshaled some force in in washington probably other elected officials and had a heart to heart with the va who then said no we'll we'll cover them you made a point and so this january 2020 uh and a little before these these navy veterans that have agent orange diseases are being treated by the va as are their uh dependents and estates actually that's a very very specific project that gene only gene i think could deal with and deal the kind of forces it took to convince the va to cover the navy veterans when we get up against it in this state as veterans uh we then just turned immediately to jean and she's never let us now i think i'll vote for gene i'm not the least bit undecided you

Mr. Speaker,
We are 111 days into the current budget year and no closer to a budget than we were four
months ago. We face a long to-do list including:
• Funding our military • Funding the Children’s Health Insurance
Program and Community Health Centers • Protecting DREAMers
• Repealing the medical device tax • Supporting disaster relief
• And the list goes on… We simply can’t continue kicking the can
down the road with irresponsible temporary fixes like the one this House passed last
night. They hamper, rather than help, our military
and other government agencies by forcing them to function in uncertainty, unable to make
key strategic investments. This os no way to run our government. Three times in the past year I crossed the
aisle to vote for these short-term measures. But I’ve seen no willingness to work with
Democrats, no evidence of progress, and no reason to believe we won’t be in the same
position after yet another CR. Enough is enough, That’s why last night
I voted no. It’s not too late. I urge my Republican colleagues to reach across
the aisle and work with Democrats to find a long-term funding solution that addresses
our country’s needs. I am committed and ready to work with my colleagues
as long as it takes to achieve that responsible resolution.

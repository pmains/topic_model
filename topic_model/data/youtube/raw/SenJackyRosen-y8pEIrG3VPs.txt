department of commerce's recently published strategy to strengthen the global competitiveness of our nation's travel and tourism industry and to make it more sustainable and resilient the department developed the first national travel and tourism strategy in 2012 and updated it in 2019 before travel tourism and hospitality businesses and workers were just devastated by the impacts of the pandemic as the pandemic worsened i joined the chair and ranking member of the full commerce committee as well as ranking member scott and asking secretary raimondo to update the national strategy to address the impacts of the pandemic and help the travel and tourism industry flourish once again i continued to push for a new national strategy when ranking member wicker and i joined again by ranking member scott and several other members of this subcommittee introducing the omnibus travel and tourism act which passed the full committee in december our tour bus as we like to call it would among many

our call and for developing an ambitious strategy to enhance travel and tourism in the united states this new strategy specifically aims to one promote the united states as a premier travel destination including broadening marketing efforts to encourage visitation to underserved and underrepresented communities number two to facilitate and and safe and efficient travel to and within the

million international visitors every year who are estimated to spend about 279 billion dollars annually tourism and international travel will they grow a country's national output of services they increase our foreign foreign currency earning so they are a service export this new strategy recognizes international travel as a top us service export when travelers from global markets visit us destinations they buy our goods and services from staying in fabulous hotels on the las vegas strip eating at our amazing restaurants attending conventions and trade shows like ces they pay for tickets to see flies to see live entertainment they rent cars they ride tour buses they spend times in cities and towns near our fantastic outdoor recreation spots from lake tahoe to great basin national park to red rock canyon this foreign demand means export income for the us economy by spending their money in america international travelers improve the u.s trade balance just like overseas buyers of products shipped from a u.s manufacturer in 2019 before the covet 19 pandemic nearly 80 million international visitors came to the u.s each year and contributed about 239 billion dollars to the u.s economy making the u.s the global leader in revenue from international travel and tourism but of course the travel and tourism industry was one of the hardest hit sectors impacted by the pandemic from 2019 to 2020 travel exports decreased nearly 65 percent and the decline in travel and tourism contributed heavily to unemployment with leisure and hospitality jobs losing just over 8 million jobs between february and april of 2020 in fact according to the department of commerce's national travel and tourism office the decline in travel and tourism to and within the united states accounted for 56 percent of the decline in u.s gross domestic product thankfully travel and tourism well it's beginning to recover i'm happy to report that harry reid international airport in las

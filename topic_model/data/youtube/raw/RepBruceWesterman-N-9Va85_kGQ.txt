president biden's upcoming trip to saudi arabia to ask for help on rising oil prices here's the president and the energy secretary the president and the energy secretary listen here i'm not going to meet with mbs i'm going to an international meeting and these are going to be part of it i think he will meet with the saudi crown prince he has asked for all suppliers around the globe to increase production so they will have a one-on-one meeting uh that's my understanding okay so he's meeting the cranberries he's not meeting the crown prince it's difficult to understand exactly what messaging the white house is putting out there joining me now is arkansas congressman bruce westerman he's a member of the natural resources and transportation and infrastructure committees congressman a lot of people are outraged by president biden going over to saudi arabia to have these conversations because of its human rights abuses and you know problems within the kingdom uh post the the murder of jamal khashoggi um and also because of the problems that we're having in this country with our own energy situation a lot of people say the answer is not abroad the answer is here absolutely the president should be going to texas louisiana maybe pennsylvania there's a lot of places he could visit here in the u.s if he wants to take a long trip go out to alaska we've got a lot of resources out there as well but instead of asking saudi arabia or venezuela or god forbid iran to increase oil supplies to united states how about asking americans to increase it and helping the american economy and helping american workers in the process i mean i think it's a great point and so many are asking that question yet i was just completely floored when the president uh invoked the defense production act and you know people are suffering from five dollar gas at the pump on average higher in some places and he says we need to make more solar panels yeah it's they're totally out of touch it's the administration the democrats in congress you know the old hank williams junior song the interest is up and the stock market's down and you're going to get mugged if you go downtown that's biden's america and it doesn't need to be that way especially when it comes to to energy which drives inflation uh in all kinds of sectors we're seeing not only higher energy costs but food costs are going up with nothing inside to bring those food costs down so this administration needs to focus on domestic policy and not going around the world to try to get uh bad actors to bail us out of the problems that they've created here you know they've got domestic problems they've got foreign problems and they got problems there at the interface which is our southern border which we had one and a half million people already cross the southern border illegally in this fiscal year in eight months that's more than the population of i think 11 states and by the end of the year if this keeps up it'll be two and a quarter million people uh who've come across the border uh illegally and and that seems to be a back story it's not even out in front with the inflation and all the other problems that are happening staggering statistics congressman what's happening at the southern border but you made a point about food and i want to talk about that because you're addressing a possible food crisis by trying to target some of biden's agriculture regulations and some people say you know these are supply side issues when it comes to oil and gas when it comes to food in this country that he can incentivize farmers he can help them build up our supplies here yet instead they're regulating exactly they're over regulating uh the very industry that we all have to have to survive and that's american agriculture the envy of the world and agriculture and the regulatory burdens coming from the federal government and from states like california are putting american agriculture in jeopardy there's gonna be five to six hundred thousand acres la fallo in california this summer because of bad water policy bad water policy from the federal government a bad water policy from the state of california i can't believe it the the drought the water shortages and i read the other day where a state senator from california wants to use budget surplus which we all know is the money that went to california from the federal government to buy water rights from farmers to take agland out of production you know the central valley in california is the bread bath of the country so the fruits nuts and vegetables are grown there and i'm worried it's going to get worse that we're going to see more shortages in food higher prices at the at the grocery store and that's just going to be on top of the energy prices and everything else the american consumer is experiencing at this time and it's analogous to not allowing oil producers to drill on federal land um congressman i want to switch gears for a moment because you signed on to a letter with over a hundred other republicans demanding that attorney general merrick garland investigate the attacks against pro-life centers as domestic terrorism tell us more about that well i i've got information that says that some of these groups i think antifa is one of them put information out saying to go out and attack these uh pro-life resource centers uh if the supreme court puts a ruling out that they don't like this cannot happen this is unacceptable and that kind of behavior is unacceptable so we have to have a rule of law in this country we wrote to the uh through the administration to tell them to investigate uh any of these claims that are happening you know it's almost like this big um events getting geared up and the trigger is going to be when the supreme court releases their their ruling yeah and uh it could be as soon as this week and we've been waiting for that um i know angela wants to jump in congresswoman i want to get your take on this administration's approach to what is and is not domestic terror because i'm sure you'll remember just a few short months ago attorney general garland was pretty eager to stick the fbi on concerned parents who showed up at school board meetings and got smeared as domestic terrorists by the national school boards association so now you have pro-life centers immediately and quite literally under attack and the federal government doesn't seem to be doing anything about it what does this surprise you at all what does this tell you about what the future holds well it tells me that unfortunately the justice department is is not promoting justice which means to make things right they're promoting agendas and they may be confused on what a terrorist is but i can absolutely tell them that the 15 people on the fbi watch list for terrorism that were apprehended at the southern border in may out of the 150 000 people that came across those are definitely people they should be targeting not american citizens and that are uh exercising their first amendment and obviously people who are operating uh pro-law centers who are pro-life those are not terrorists and and families going to address their school board those aren't terrorists these are great points congressman bruce westerman it's always good to see you we'll have you back soon yeah thank

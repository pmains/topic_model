the gentleman from Arizona is recognized for one minute mr. speaker I'm madam Speaker I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my friend and colleague mo Brooks Brooks manlet amendment is simple it keeps the immigration debate out of the national security debate that's it my colleague mr. gallego inserted language during the mark-up to require the Secretary of Defense to conduct a review under section 504 of title 10 u.s. state United States Code relating to whether or not those who have received amnesty under the President Obama's daca initiative should be able to enlist in the services but that Barry stack already provides the Secretary of Defense the authority he or she needs to make such a determination if readiness if there is a readiness crisis it's already there specifically paragraph b2 entitles him to I quote authorize the enlistment of a person if the secretary determines that such enlistment is vital to the national interest now while the Gallego language may appear to be simple a sense of Congress to some in function will be cited by the lawyers arguing on behalf of the president's executive overreach those lawyers will say you see even the House of Representatives has passed language that recognizes daca the Center for Immigration Studies agrees that guy a go language 30 seconds your additional 30 seconds gentleman is recognized for center the Center for Immigration Studies agrees the guy a go language is unnecessary and is simply meant to undercut the ongoing litigation about the legality and constitutional unconstitutionality of daca if the Brooks amendment is not accepted and this language is left on the NDA it potentially jeopardizes passage of a critical legislation my colleagues I have fought the President on his executive actions and will fight here again that is our purview and once again I said the house has moved three times to demonstrate a daca is illegitimate this should be the fourth time I urge my colleagues to vote for the Brooks amendment stripping the guy a go language and I yield back

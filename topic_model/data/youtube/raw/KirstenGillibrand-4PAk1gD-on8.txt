this is an area with across all demographics has been depressed because lost its industry an opioid crisis what do you have to say people this area about so-called bikers I understand families in this community are suffering deeply I fully hear from you and folks that I've talked to you just in a few minutes I've been here that it is devastating when you've lost your job you lost your ability to provide for your kids that when you've put twenty thirty years of no company that all of a sudden doesn't care about you won't call you back and gives you a data loop that is not acceptable and not okay so no one in that circumstance feels privileged on any level but that's not what that conversation is about in explain what that conversation about is when a community has been left behind for generations because of the color of their skin when you've been denied job after job after job because you're black or because you're brown so institutional racism is real it doesn't take away your pain or your suffering it's just a different issue your suffering is just as important as a black or brown person suffering but to fix the problems that are happening in a black community you need far more transformational efforts that are targeted for real racism that exists every day so with your son is 15 years old and smoke pot he smokes pot just as much as the black boy in his neighborhood and the Latino boy in his neighborhood but that black and brown boy is four times more likely to be arrested and when he's arrested that criminal justice system might require him to pay bail five bucks that kid does not a fiver bucks he might not be able to make it's been adult the child at home and he's a single parent if he's thrown at jail no one is with his child doesn't matter what he says I have to go home I have a child at home he's only 12 what am I gonna do it doesn't matter imagine as a parent how you would feel so helpless that's institutional racism your son will likely not have to deal with that because he is white so when someone says white privilege that's all they're talking about is that his whiteness will mean that a police officer might give him a second chance it might mean that he doesn't get incarcerated because he has just smoked a joint with his girlfriend it might mean that he won't have to post post bail it means he might be able to show up to work the next day and not lose his job and not be in the cycle of poverty that never ends all it is

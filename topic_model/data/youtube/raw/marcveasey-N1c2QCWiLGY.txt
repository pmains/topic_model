[Music] today the Homeland Security office of the Inspector General issued a new management alert flagging dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults at border patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Valley the Inspector General's Office released these images showing the overcrowded conditions and noted that quote senior managers at several facilities raised security concerns about their agents and detainees one called the situation a ticking time bomb the alert also mentioned that 31% of children held in custody in the region have been held longer than the 72 hours permitted by law it had no access to showers the chairman of the House Oversight Committee Elijah Cummings of Maryland has invited the acting secretaries of DHS and Customs our border patrol to testify about the separation and treatment of migrant children and allegations of overcrowding they were first invited last week but neither has confirmed plans to attend the hearings from where I'm joined by us conferred Marc Veasey who joined the delegation in Texas and Claire along Human Rights Watch deputy Washington director congressman thank you for joining us and you know what everybody watching would benefit from it's just a really good description of what you saw as an eye witness down there well what we saw was horrible particularly when we talked with some of the detainees that were in the holding cells at the first facility that we visited where we were told that they were if they asked for a drink of water that the guards told them to you know drink out of the toilet that they had gone days without taking showers and of course when you take those tours you have to get 48 hours notice as a member of Congress before you could take the tour and of course they try to do everything they can to clean the facility up so much much of the space at at the facilities that we visited were empty particularly like the outdoor sleeping areas and outdoor holding areas and the heat they were completely empty but I believe everything that those the migrants told us while we were there just based on the experience that we had with some of the personnel there with custom we told we told them that it was not a good idea for us for instance to go out and have a press conference with all of those hecklers nearby and they were just like no I wouldn't be fair if we if we moved them away and of course they were out there screaming and then yelling and what-have-you and they did absolutely nothing to help the situation whatsoever and you would think that after finding out that there was a Facebook page where people were making racist misogynistic comments that they would do everything possible to make it look like that they had the the safety of the American public and they absolutely in my opinion did not it's and and based on what I saw and read on those Facebook pages I was in the Pro Publica article i 100% think that those migrants were what telling us the complete truth about their treatment in these facilities because it goes hand in hand Clara let me ask you about the cases I think it may be one incident of this Border Patrol person saying go drink the water from the toilet no there's not literal I heard there was the same sort of tank of water that had both the SPRO to speak I posted at the top to drink from a fountain if you will and then the water used for the talk but I don't even understand this explain that that appliance if you will whereas do drink from right I mean I think the appliance is very much what you're saying it's a it's a pony wall with its you know it doesn't go up all the way to the ceiling so there's no privacy no real privacy to use the toilet and these cells would have dozens of people in them and then you know based on what I've seen and heard described countless times it's a toilet with you know a tap on top of it so the water actually comes up to the back of the toilet now the water doesn't necessarily have contact to be fair with the toilet water too much confused about because life is complicated yeah we heard the other day last night on the program reported that there was some Border Patrol people who are really so concerned about their welfare they of the people they were detained they had spent their own money the food feed them and now I hear these bad apples that say go drink out of the toilet it just seems what's going on here drinking out of the toilet asking people to drink out of that that tap that comes out of the toilet as a common practice across the entire board you know I was part of this team of attorneys and but a deadbeat didn't me go drinking out of the toilet bowl it's not drinking out of the toilet bowl I haven't you know haven't heard an account of drinking out the toilet bowl to get on the back of the toilet yeah it's telling Jerry Nadler of course chair of the House Judiciary Committee criticized the Trump administration today for allowing migrants to be held in these conditions here he is earlier today for all the people who are in those detention facilities our migrants they all claim asylum some of them are entitled under our law to asylum some are not all are entitled to humanity to decent treatment to decent judicial adjudication and not to be tortured or regarded as refuse all the people in the administration who have done this who have permitted it are guilty of child abuse which is a crime we are to prosecute let me go to congressman that such strong language about prosecution of public officials what do you make of it you know exactly what what Jerry is saying on prosecution I mean I do think that if people's rights have been violated and there have been criminal acts that have been committed of course they should be prosecuted but I think immediately that there should be an investigation and I don't know if you heard Chris Elijah Cummings who's the chair of the Oversight Committee he has announced that there will be hearings to look into these allegations on how migrants were treated on this Facebook page and again if people have crossed the line then they absolutely do need to be prosecuted there's no question about that let me go to Claire on a couple of points first of all Jim is the strength when you've gone through these camps what do you see you subscribe to a person who's never been there alright so they're you know concrete cells benches around the sort of outside of them and then as I said these Pony walls with the toilets behind the pony wall pony wall is like a short wall that doesn't go up all the way to the ceiling so just so say it goes up to your waist or something and in a lot of cases and you've seen those we've seen those pictures that the OIG released today you'll have so many people in there that not everybody can sit or is that what you see when you're going out these pictures these pictures were looking at right now that's what you see let me ask you about these groups of hecklers whose type linghu you know you've got a lot of people who I think want to make a political statement here okay on the right on the right and they don't like immigrants right I mean wouldn't you I mean the congressman just mentioned this Facebook group you have this you have 9,500 Border Patrol agents and a secret Facebook group that's about half of the agents the US has and where they say oh no and what they're saying on that Facebook group are anti-immigrant statements racist me joking about the deaths of children in border patrol stations I think this congressional oversight investigations are needed and overdue on top of that Congress needs to work to reinforce transparency and accountability in the agency itself which has too long but allowed to continue interview time strategic about something and you know about what did it feel like when you saw people heckling they were heckling in migrants they're also heckling you who are showing an interest in their welfare yeah well you know of course the first thing that you think of is your own safety you know we're in Texas and everybody has guns particularly people like in the crowd that were part of the hecklers that were there were in the mega hats and you worry about your safety particularly when the people that are entrusted to guard you or probably members of that page like it was just mentioned about half of the members of Customs and Border Patrol are members of this Facebook page and these are the same people that we were a counting on to protect us from these people that were screaming terrible things that were distorting people's names making them into slur words as we walk down the local congresswoman Veronica Escobar they kept distorting her first name to make it derogatory and and they were just saying terrible things about everybody there about about migrants screaming things about Planned Parenthood and it was it was a complete circus and I just don't think that the Border Patrol people did anything and when we asked them we said hey we know that these people are going to be heckling us we're not going to be able to hear we're not trying to do anything to stop on their First Amendment rights but why don't we just move them back just a little bit and they refused to do it one of the law enforcement officials even suggest that well why don't you just cancel the press conference like that that was their suggestion on dealing with this rowdy group it was definitely the worst I've seen of any press conference I've ever been to give me a deadline where exactly to all this hell break loose today where was the texas or Florida where was it yesterday in Florida on the border is that has the heckling that that we were subject to when we were there visiting the Clinton facility there okay thank you nice US congressman Marc Veasey of Texas and Clara lon thank you so much [Music]

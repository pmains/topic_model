I want to thank everybody who is on the phone and certainly want to thank our guests who all introduced in just a little while we meet at a very troubled time in our country's history I don't think any of us on this phone call or frankly in this country or perhaps worldwide has experienced the kind of challenge that we're experiencing both from a health standpoint and from our economy being essentially very substantially slowed down and in some cases shut down so let me begin by thanking all of the first responders and the health care personnel who are on the front lines of this fight every day what they do is incredible I want to thank the nurses and doctors police and fire those people who are working in the grocery stores whatever they do in the grocery stores truck drivers who are bringing us goods that are absolutely essential for our life on a daily basis to the all the people I've mentioned the nurses and doctors but all the people who work in all of our hospitals and health care providers I want to thank the teachers I know my granddaughter who has four children and lives in Calvert County it raves about the teachers of her children and her children are in four different schools and she is saying that the teachers are doing heroic work to make sure that our children are educated but the heroic work by those of you who come in contact with health challenges on a daily basis we owe you a particular thanks so let us keep thinking of them let us keep thanking them and when this is over let's make sure we thank them again let me also say that the corona virus continues as all of us know it oppose a significant threat and we continue to meet this challenge together and I want to thank everybody who's fun playing by the rules wearing face masks when they go to store staying home that's the way the experts tell us we're going to defeat this scourge we are resolved to defeat it and save lives and bring our economy back to a strong life Maryland remains under a strict stay at home where as you know to protect the most vulnerable in our communities and to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed which it's close to at this point in time this will continue until public health experts tell us that it's safe we don't do that if we give back too early the virus will regenerate its bill and be worse I know that many in our communities are worried because they are or their loved ones have lost their jobs or had closed their businesses and it's unclear how long that will last let me assure each and every one of you on the phone that no matter how long this crisis lasts and I hope which over sooner rather than later that your congressional delegation Republicans Democrats are working together with our governor who by the way we think has done a very good job in confronting this virus and with state and other local officials who are also working around the clock to make us safer the small business loans that we secured will help number of people including those of you who are self-employed that's a very important point or because you weren't eligible for small business assistance or on an owner while their doors are they normal and clear rated resumed normal operations these small businesses are being supported and I know that it's frustrating because it was so much to do for our small businesses we have four people from the state level and the federal level who are going to give you some information about what's the status so that you can get the kind of help you need the loss of life of course that we're seeing from this virus is heartbreaking and if there any of you have lost somebody to this virus my heart goes out to you and I give you my greatest sympathy now we are trying to make sure however that the loss of life is kept to as low a number as we possibly can but we've seen signs of hope we're strict social and physical distancing measures like the ones we put in place here have been imposed the rate of growth of new infections has slowed it's still growing but the curve has been flattened out which is what of course was our objective it's critical that we all continue to do our part by obeying the governor's order and staying at home except for going out to purchase or pick up food and by the way don't forget to wear your face mask that's very important for the workers in the store safety and for yours go to the pharmacy travel to an unapproved essential job or seek medical care where those masks wash your hands stay six feet apart I've been in close communication with speaker Pelosi leader Schumer mr. McCarthy demand the Republican leader and mr. McConnell the Republican leader in the Senate and as I said on a regular basis with Governor Hogan and our county executives and County Commissioners as Congress works its next package of legislation to address the coronal Rock virus it is clear that we must approach the public health challenge and the economic challenge together because we cannot reopen our economy until we have the public healthy infrastructure in place to keep outbreaks under control and protect those most at risk we need to test we need to test more and we need to test even more and the reason for that is the more we test if we just test the sick we won't know how many people are infected but if we test a large number of people which is what South Korea did we will identify be able to isolate and then to trace those that they've had in contact and that will help us greatly the first a bill that we passed provided eight point three billion dollars to support research into vaccine and into treatments ii guaranteed that americans will not have to pay out of pocket for koban nineteen testing there is no cost for testing and provided paid leave for those who are are sick or in quarantine the third law which we just recently passed the cares Act on March 27 focused on helping workers and businesses get through the crisis it was a bill that authorized and appropriated over 2.2 trillion dollars an extraordinary sum of money but our economy is huge and we now know about 20% of it is shut down that money may well not be necessary excuse me enough when the may not be enough and we may have to do more and we are working on doing so now that bill included the following some of you may have already gotten a payment but 1,200 per adult for those earning 75 thousand or less and a couple learning learning less than hundred and fifty thousand twenty four hundred dollars and five hundred dollars for each child in addition in that there's six hundred for a period of time number of months in addition to the unemployment insurance that is available in Maryland and as I said the self-employed the people who are working in the gig economy people who were not traditionally included in unemployment insurance are now included under this bill and we will the federal government will be paying six hundred dollars per week extra for in the next few months to supplement the unemployment insurance there's a hundred billion dollars for hospitals and frankly we're going to need more seventeen billion dollars for veterans care critically important we want to make sure our veterans are safe and funding to ensure that the corona virus pandemic does not disrupt elections in November deeply concerned as I know so many of you are by the racial disparities we are seeing in this pandemic african-americans and hispanics and other minorities are dying from coronavirus in a proportion way above their proportion in our population we need to be very concerned about that today and in the future we need to collect that up to fully understand the impact on african-americans and Latino communities which are being hit hardest by this virus and we need to make sure that states and communities have the tools they need to keep everyone healthy and safe regardless of their race or background a virus does not discriminate sadly though longest-standing and inequalities and inherent bias in our healthcare system have been laid bare by this pandemic in a wake-up call for us to do much much better in the future this is unacceptable and we have responsibility to address those disparities I'm also working hard to make sure that our elections are secure and that every American can vote say 20 either by mail or in-person in November governor we have a special election and the seventh Contribution congressional district of Maryland resulting from the death of Elijah Cummings such a beloved figure in our state that election is going to be held primarily almost exclusively by mail I've urged the governor to make sure that the June 2nd election can also have the ability of every voter to vote by mail if they so choose we also need to protect the postal service I don't know about you but I'm at my house and obviously I'm on the phone a lot working with other members to try to make sure that we're doing the right things to protect America and to make us well and to make our economy more vibrant the fact is though the I look forward to the US Postal Service delivering my mail now like you they deliver it probably too many bills but I get communications and I look forward to that postal service is a critical connector of all of us to others and we must make sure it does not go bankrupt as its business increases we must also make it clear that the District of Columbia should be treated like the States when it comes to receiving its fair share it is usually it wasn't in this last bill and it cost them seven hundred a million dollars I'm going to work very hard to make sure that we treat them as a state and they get the 1.2 billion that every state got even states much smaller than the District of Columbia if they're not healthy we're not going to be healthy you know we're not healthy they're not going to be healthy we're in this together shortchanging the district was was a mistake and we're going to try to fix it I will continue working with delegate Holmes Norton and the regional delegation toward that end I've also made clear that we need to do more to keep federal workers safe by investing in technology monetization that facilitates telework and by extending full paid family leave benefits to all federal employees as we did for others in previous legislation I will continue and we'll continue to keep the fifth District residents informed in these town halls and in many other ways of new developments I want to hear from you about the challenges you're facing and how we can help now hopefully all of you got a pencil and pen or quick finger on your typing apparatus to get in touch with me and get the latest information on what Congress is doing I encourage everyone to visit my website for EUR H my ER dot house.gov you can connect there you can give me messages there and that will keep in touch we want to know your problems and we want to know what we can do to help you and your family now as I said I'm pleased that we were joined tonight by guests who can answer questions about how we are fighting the corona virus and how recent legislation can help people in Maryland skip district and indeed in our state and throughout the country get by until our economy comes fully back first we have dr. Josh Sharfstein dr. Scharff stains is at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health an office of Health practice and training he's also a former deputy commissioner of health in Baltimore City and he was at the US Food and Drug Administration and also worked for a member of Congress a real expert we're glad to have him welcome we also have Michael Harrison whose policy director at the Maryland Department of Labor Licensing and Regulation he'll be able to answer a lot of questions about how you qualify how you apply and when you're going to get resources Andrew Andrew well Jenna T is also with us he is a policy officer at the Maryland Department of Labor Licensing and Regulation that Department handles a lot of the flow of money that we are trying to get to people in need and businesses in need also with his Antonio Doss he is the district director for the Small Business Administration's Washington Metropolitan Area district office he too can answer your questions about how you get your small business loan grant assistance and lastly but certainly not least Steve and Umberger who is the district director of the Small Business Administration's Baltimore district serving all of Maryland except for Montgomery and Prince George's counties gentlemen I want to thank you very much for being with us and with that let's go to questions Thank You congressman Hoyer again if you'd like to ask congressman Hoyer or experts a question please press star 3 now again if you'd like to ask a question please press star 3 now our first question is from Rodney in Greenbelt Rodney here live with congressman wire hello thanks for doing this I appreciate it I'm Zanna Marsh I just had a question about the stimulus checks my mom is on Medicaid she lives in a nursing home and so her income is limited to $2,500 and I'm concerned that when she does get this check if she gets it that it's going to take her income over the limit and threaten her Medicaid eligibility and I was wondering if there's been any conversation or information about that that's it thanks that's an excellent question to which I do not know the answer I will find that out if one of our guests does not have the answer on the tax question but the know I was just given the answer the rebuilt rebate will not impact for Medicaid or other public assistance programs in other words there will not be that will not put her over the income level and the reason for that is our intention is not to hurt people obviously our intention is to get money in people's hands so they and they'll go out and spend it and what that 70 percent of our economy is a consumer economy so it would be unwise of us to penalize this is your mother or your aunt mother your mother it would be unwise to try to penalize her and put her in a different category she was ineligible for other benefits she obviously needs because what we be doing is helping them on the one hand and undermining the economy on the other hers personally but the economy generally so the answer is no it will not be counted against her great our next question is from Adrienne and Clinton Adrian you're live with congressman Hoyer Adrian you with us yes I'm here you can't hear okay now I can argue yes okay so my question is the Danby is a tourist area like New York City LA and when the president opened parts of the country that is less impacted what happens when our numbers start to stabilize and go down and those people who are having trouble recognizing that there that there is a pandemic what protects us from them or becoming reinfected what protections will be put in place to protect the area's already you know battling battling the pandemic and has hit the plateau and is now coming down what happens to us know here in this Washington Metropolitan Area you mean yes area yes you raise a very good question and a significant concern now I'm going to let dr. sharp Steen speak to that but clearly areas like Las Vegas have been devastated because they are tourist areas now where we're we have significant tourism but that is not our only asset in the Washington Metropolitan Area obviously we have the federal government here which is a great stabilizing force for our economy which we're very fortunate to have but dr. Sharfstein I know one of the concerns is we come back to interface with one another too soon and reignite the transmission of the coronavirus which is why dr. pouchy and dr. Burks and others are concerned that we do not come back so fast and that we undermine rather than help either the economy or our health you want to make a comment for thank you and it's a great question I do think that if there are places where they don't take this seriously enough you're absolutely right we can expect to see more cases there and you're absolutely right that will pose a danger to the places that are nearby or if people get in the car or come to DC it'll pose a potential threat to the DC area which is in part why we won't be going back to normal I think in this area right away at all it'll be still with a lot of extra precautions and people will probably still be wearing masks there'll be a lot of distancing still you won't see concerts or jamp at museums or anything like that for a while I think so there'll be some protections here but I think we're gonna hope that people will see governors will see mayors will see that if they don't take this seriously the the real harm is going to be to their own people and lives will be at risk and hopefully they will go learn that they need to follow the best guidance in order to protect their population - and we'll get some peer pressure to at least shut down really bad decisions I think doctor the doctor is absolutely right on that and I think you're going to find every public health officials saying look let's go slowly and let's not abandon the safety precautions we've been making ie as dr. shark Steen just said wear a mask you know you're the governor Hogan has said if you're going drugstore if you go into a grocery store you're going into some other store wear a mask for your own safety and for the safety of the people that are in the store particularly those who are working in the store and seeing lots of people wash your hands and I think it's smart that you know still keep a distance we tend to be a very animated group of people we Americans we like to shake one another's hands we hug one another you know we're like to talk to one another we get to get just a couple of feet from one another talk to one another but we're going to have to be more care because we're we're not going to be out of the woods overnight it's going to take a long period of time and we're certainly in the middle of the woods in many respects in many areas of the country right now so we have to be very careful next question thank you again if you'd like to ask congressman Hoyer a question please press star 3 now again if you have a question please press star 3 our next question is from Laura in Bouie Laura you're on with Congressman where I thank you so much for doing this so I'm a licensed acupuncturist and I'm consider essential and yet I'm trying to see that these people as possible I'm probably seen from 30 clients a week to maybe two or three but I'm still confirmed but those people are trying to avoid going to the hospital basically I'm seeing the most serious people that are trying to avoid going to the hospital so my first concern is their well-being and my well-being even though we're wearing masks and we're being responsible the risks are still there that's my first question what do we do health care providers that are essential and we're barely making any money but we're continuing to be open and I have not received any benefits from any government any government agency yet I apply for several but you know I'm in a position that I'm not sure how to handle this situation because I need to make a living I want to help the people that are trying to avoid going to the hospital and yet I know that there is a risk in me working and at the same time I'm not getting any financial help yet so I'm in a position where I'm not sure where to go from here I don't want to turn away let's see if we let's see if we can give you a little advice I'm gonna ask obviously dr. sharp Steen to give you the advice he's a health worker himself I want to him to give you that advice but Laura are you in business for yourself are you self-employed I'm self-employed and when I yeah when I apply I'm not sure that I put the right and I'm not sure I didn't exactly understand what they were what we've got your people here and may be able to help you because your self and point you are eligible for unemployment insurance now not and you've gone from 30 people down to two people who are most critical I'm not sure I don't know the answer that but maybe one of our guests and those but doctor let's start with you and then we'll one or more of the other four of you can take the other part of the question doctor tell you about that I'm but you know clearly is a question of infection control if you're going to be teen patients you really should look up the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control for full protection you know which would be if it's you know for for what you're doing I would assume would be like a mask face shield gown and gloves for contact precautions and you can find that on the CDC website around health care worker protection but I would definitely make sure that you're adhering to those recommendations and if you do that you will reduce your exposure I would also certainly make sure to screen your patients for any hint of any symptoms and not see patients who are coughing for example or have fevers or have lost their sense of smell or anything that could be that corona virus that still doesn't doctor what if it's at zero mm-hmm doctor would be a good idea for her head she has these two patients which are she's treating and I don't want to go to hospital would it be good to have her make sure they take their temperature before she sees them it's not a bad idea I would say yep I would ask I know that's what the brain is doing you know he's before people see the president date everybody else ever temperature taken so right because it's not a one safety factor yeah it does not eliminate the risk because less than half the people have fevers you know so so but if you could do that but I would definitely it's really the protective equipment and all the screening that you possibly can do Laura let me thank you you know you heard me at the beginning thank those in the healthcare delivery service that are shown such extraordinary courage and love for their fellow men and women so thank you very much for for staying at it and helping people who obviously need help okay next question again if you'd like to ask a question of mr. Hoyer or any of our guests tonight please press star 3 now our next question is from Susan in Indianhead Susan you're on with Carson we're thank you my question is to do with the unemployment I have tried to go online and apply and I've tried it several times and it says that I am ineligible to apply online I have to do through the phone center well going through the phone center is worse than trying online just one day I did 218 times and it was busy just today I did 248 times twice the phone rang but then you'd have to go and put in these numbers to get to where you have to be only for them to tell you all lines are busy call back another time and then they hang up on you and I've got I wrote to you I wrote to Hogan I've written to everybody and they say the same thing call back at this time you know you'll get your money from when you first got laid off but that's not going to help my bills because my bills I can't say well you'll get your money when they I can get a phone call through so there's got to be something done because this is I've been trying since March 10th and I've been calling everything Susan you've heard me talk a little bit about modernization of our technology and the federal government but I will tell you there's not a person on this phone that doesn't empathize with you including I'm sure our guests when you call to order something or get a question answered you know you have a billion bill you have a question about and you get pushed it will push one push two and then push three or four it drives you crazy and I've had somebody call me and tell me that it's called 800 times you're the you're over 400 and you're 2 calls but let me turn to either Michael or Andrew or both to see how you can help this lady who wants to say thank Michael and review if a congressman this is a and repulsion ad and Thank You Susan for the question certainly like a congressman stated we empathize with you we understand this is unprecedented times we are facing a unprecedented volume of individuals in the state who are in that economic reality where they're looking either facing unemployment or a reduction in their wages and they're having to you know apply for these benefits so we're we're doing everything we can at the Department of Labor to try and handle that the sheer volume that we're receiving right now I can tell you that we are working very hard on several new fixes to hopefully address some of the concerns that you raised one of those being the increase in capacity at our call centers as you say there are currently some individuals based on their their circumstances that are required to file a claim the call center so we're increasing our staffing at call centers we've doubled we've doubled our call center staff since its pandemic we are hiring another 100 individuals getting them trained to take claims and we're also transferring another 150 internal staff from the Department of Labor to be able to handle the increase in calls we're receiving in our call centers I would also note that we are working with some outside vendors and the private sector to improve our online systems I believe we're going to have some big announcements coming out tomorrow about some changes to our online applications that will hopefully expand options for individuals and address some of the concerns raised but again we we we understand people are having a hard time Susan you're definitely not alone and we are working I can assure you around-the-clock to handle the sheer volume of claims and people that are in need and we will we will get to everyone and we will ensure that you get the benefits that you are eligible for now that that's the bad news is that they are overwhelmed and you can we have unprecedented numbers never have we had these numbers even during the Depression a number of applications every week in the millions we've been in that normal is between 180 and 220 thousand or somewhere in that per week we are now in the multi millions six seven million people 20 percent I think of our workers are unemployed so you can sympathize with them but here's Susan a few me yes Susan I think and and correct me if I'm wrong anybody on the phone any one of our guests I believe and then we needs to be explained what when you from when you first applied if it's three weeks later or four weeks later that you get the benefit the benefit will be retroactive I think to the time you applied but gentlemen can you speak to that Michael yeah ogress me I can Antonia I can speak that benefits are retroactive from the date of separation not from the date that you filed we have waived all deadlines and a lot of people are getting in mail that they have to respond by a certain date or they're going to lose benefits well we have waived those deadlines so everyone will receive benefits back to their date of separation and also we have announced that starting tomorrow all recipients of current benefits will start receiving the additional $600 bump up in their debit card payments starting to Morrow when you normally the daily normally steep receive your benefits you will begin with scene that's extra $600 in your payments starting tomorrow now so I'm not asking to be allowed relief a lot of people that's 600 per week and another one when you lost your job the date that you lost your job you will get then the Maryland uninsurance rate wait I don't I don't know what your salary was and I don't know exactly what the figure will be what's the average Michael what's the average in Maryland unemployment benefit well the maximum is 434 to 35 a week we haven't calculated average from virus related claims but it rains but it would probably be in them a couple hundred and fifty sixty bro couple hundred well in any event suit yet so you in in addition to the benefit we we are everybody who's getting an unemployment benefit for the next few months will be getting extra $600 per week that's to try to get people through this very troubled time and very frankly it'll give you some money to pay off those bills that you may have slipped because you're simply not getting an income so I think that's at least for the short term going to try to keep people as even as we can possibly keep them keep their head above water that's our intent and we're going to right we're going to stay after that all right next question the $600 go ahead go ahead as I was gonna say the $600 is retroactive until March 29th so I believe that's about three weeks and so if people have been filing their benefits they will receive the $1,800 $1,800 just from the federal benefit I'm starting out this week starting total so Susan that's the good news the bad news is I can so empathy makes me so angry when they put me from one number to another number to another number and then and then they hang up just drives you crazy okay next question Thank You congressman Hoyer again if you have a question please press star 3 now our next question is from jerod in Waldorf Jared you're on with Congressman where good evening all and thank you for taking my question I just wanted to know if there will be any type of resources allocated for college students since internships have been canceled and on-campus jobs have been cancelled and we don't qualify for a lot of the aid packages that have gone out so I just wanna know if there'll be any resources allocated for college students Thank You Pierre the answer is that is is yes and Jared are you going to school now or did were you in school I'm currently well let me tell you this okay Bowie State University is getting 6.5 million dollars University of Maryland College Park is getting 21 point four million dollars University of Maryland Global Campus 5.2 million st. Mary's College 3.1 million College of cells and marrow and 2.5 men Prince George's Community College which has a lot of students 6.4 million dollars number one number two 50% of that must go to students now I can't tell you the distribution or how much you would get or what's the what the formula but I can tell you that we provided significant money and we're going to do more significant money for higher education institutions who I know sent their young people home they had to give them a rebate on the room and board if they were living on campus as well as again I don't know the formula so I don't want to say a figure but 50 percent of that is for the students and 50 percent of the for the college which obviously is losing money at this point in time and many of them of course still are conducting classes but they're conducting classes online so that there is still the education available it's just not at the college but the answer your question is yes we put significant money in for higher education and for students and by the way for you're listening we put significant sums of money in K through 12 and we made sure that the school meals that were available to young people who qualified for those school mills and some schools give everybody a meal so nobody's identified but we made sure that that program continued as well and gave assistance to the schools to ensure that that happened okay next question again if you'd like to ask a question please press star 3 now our next question is from Terry and Grady art Perry you're on with Congressman where there are you there Harry probably I'm yep he's there Perry I think we might have lost the call I'm solo to our next caller our next caller is Charles um who has a question about drive-through testing in Calvert County Charles you're on with congressman Hoyer hello congressman Hoyer how are you sir I'm good thank you thank you for your leadership and thank you for hosting this call yes my question is about the drive-through testing is this something that we're likely to see and and and when do you think we might see it you know in Calvert County and some of the other areas thank you again we are seeing drive-through testing we have drive-through testing we're obviously trying to make sure that there isn't shortage and testing material and we're not doing enough tests that's for sure but there is Drive tooth testing Calvert County I don't I talked to Dean Teague yesterday as a matter of fact about how they were doing because I was concerned about their a personal protection equipment and they're doing pretty well they're not flush but they're doing pretty well I don't know and we'll find out for you Charles about drive-thru testing in Calvert County at at their hospital or some other site I don't know whether there is one there or not but we've got your number we'll get back in and give you the answer to that and by the way if anybody knows maybe you can send us a text too or you're done or you're done house.gov if we know they answered that question matter of fact we'll try to find the answer to that question before we end the call Thank You congressman Hoyer again if you have a question please press star 3 now our next question is from Nakia in st. Mary's County okay you're on with congressman Hoyer thank you so much for taking my call and addressing my personal concerns and thank you a lot also for having this teleconference and allowing us to address these things so I did have actually 30 questions but my first question was is there any sort of an inkling of a projected date or maybe school reconvening for the students um is there anything in regard to that there is obviously a lot of discussion about that that decision has not been made the governor would be the one that would be making that decision and he'll be doing that in conjunction with dr. Solomon who's the superintendent of schools and we'll be discussing it with health care and providers I want dr. Scharff Dean to speak to that but I before he but I recognize him let me say that the good news is children under 17 are doing pretty well they're not totally immune there are children who are getting sick but it seems to affect them less harshly but and this is the big but they can be and are carriers and so when they come in touch with you know their mom or their dad or their grandmother or grandfather or others they can transmit the disease so that is a concern when you aggregate all these children together in school but I'm going to turn to dr. Sharfstein doctor you go thought on that well we're going to have to take it one step at a time and I think in the document the White House is putting out tonight they don't see the schools opening in the first phase and I think that's probably right the first phase is going to be gradual and we're going to see whether you know we can do that without the number of keys is really jumping up and that'll take at least I think a couple months to work itself out to know for sure at least a couple months from now and then if we are able to do okay we're able to open to that first level a few more businesses open and everybody practicing social distancing and wearing masks and you know that goes okay then the next level up will looks like they may allow schools to open but that's only if you do okay in that first level and even then when schools open it might look different it might look like as for example certain high risk teachers might not be encouraged to go or maybe that the classes or certain assemblies would certainly be canceled so and the classes would have to be spaced out so the kids are not as close and you'd be cleaning the school more so I think it's not right around the corner but it's not out of our imagination that it would happen potentially within you know within a few months certainly in time for the fall it's possible but depending on what's going on and a lot can change it might look more or less like you know school did last year there may be some differences the key I want to repeat it's not the children are such risk but as dr. Scharff seen just pointed out they're dealing with teachers who may be at risk and one thing we know about children is they like to touch one other push one another pick get close to one another congregate with one another and then they are dispersed back into their homes and into their neighborhoods so it's a very complex problem and I think dr. Scharff Steen is right and I didn't White House sand that looks that's not going to be the first step back because adults are I go to the grocery store everybody in the grocery tour that I go to and every clerk every everybody is stocking shelves well maybe one or two exceptions which will now be eliminate are wearing a mask and most of them are wearing rubber gloves so we're careful but the kids you can't have them do that but it's not that they're going to get sick that doesn't mean they can't get sick they can and they have and we do have children or so but it does mean that they're not as careful or cognizant as adults and they then become carriers if somebody that they're interfacing with sneezes or coughs or and you know maybe they should wear a mask and sometimes they would do more mass but you know kids will lose their mouths pretty soon any event it's a very good question a lot of people want to know the answer that I don't have an answer but it's not going to be tomorrow okay next question Thank You congressman Hoyer I think we actually have an answer on the question about drive-through testing in Calvert County okay I think it was Jared that Charles Charles Charles you answer this question I hope you're still on the phone I'm sorry I didn't have that answer when you could call but I'm glad we got a Calvert help is offering drive-through testing 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Tuesdays one day week and you can call for 105 three five eight four three six for an appointment you just can't show up you've got to be on their list because they got to make a judgment as to whether or not you know testing equipment and test our deer and they're not as plentiful as we need to have them nor as fast as we need to have them you but you just can't show up so again let me that number it Calvert County Drive Thru testing for 105 three five eight four three six for an appointment okay Charles Thank You congressman Hoyer again if you have a question please press star three now our next question is from Willa in Port Washington Willa you're on with congressman wire hello congressman who are you ah there are you oh I'm doing good my question is president open up the whole economy why not let the governor's which know their own people which know who is sick and who is not sick why not let them determine that when they gonna open up their own City actually Willa contrary to what the president said a few days ago where he had there he said he had the authority to tell the governor's what to do he's changed his view on that what dr. sharp Steen referenced in terms of schools being in the next phase as I understand it and maybe one of my staff that's listening will correct me what the White House did today was put out guidelines but the president said it will be up to the governors in each state to determine whether or not to open and if they decide to open how to open but what the White House did and the task force did was to issue guidelines which they were recommending be followed if in fact governor's decided to open but the president no longer either claims the authority or at least he is not going to exercise now authority I personally don't believe he has it but but even if he did at it he has decided not to exercise it and to leave it up to the governor's next question thank you again if you have a question please press star 3 now our next question is from Sean in White Plains Sean you're on with congressman Hoyer who has done very much for professional call and my question regards to unemployment I am a working on the time frame that you know unemployment good question gentlemen which of you in the Michael or Andrew which one of you wants to answer that questions sure I can take a stab at that thank you for the question here we do get that a lot the extension of the federal benefits the cares Act extended unemployment insurance to independent contractors and the gig economy workers and sole proprietors this is a new federal program we are working in a minute we should have an announcement in the coming days for a system to start collecting your information and issuing those payments as soon as we can you've been to the website of people with Google Maryland labor unemployment our website will come up and there's information on their website about how to apply how to enter your well to receive a notification when the system is updated but I would expect an announcement within the next week or so on when you can start receiving those benefits and start applying for those benefits it should be soon I know we're working with the US Department of Labor to get a unified application that all the states will be using I have not heard about the union's barking I know allow them to think is canola shaded and done this yet but we are working as soon as we can and should be very soon the sooner the better we know but hopefully Sean I don't know what your income level is I don't want you to stay on the phone but as you know as I said if you file a 1099 I don't know whether you had a we're getting a refund and if you were getting a refund you gave them electronic pants for a number if you did you ought to be getting a $1,200 check or again depending upon your income between lower than 75 it'll be 25,000 and will reduce from seventy five thousand ninety nine thousand and if you're at a hundred you don't qualify for that particular program so there is a possibility you'll get a check before you're going to get your unemployment but again yeah correct me if I'm wrong but that will also be retroactive to the time you were unemployed am I correct on that Michael and Andrew that is correct States benefits will be retroactive as well as the federal efficient of dollars bump up back to March 29th or your date of separation if you can show a loss of income due to the virus that is correct okay thank you Sean it and everybody on the phone I'm sure that you're sympathetic with the fact that what we are facing is unprecedented and the numbers are like 50 times and even more what they have been and obviously the departments were not either technologically nor from a personnel staffing standpoint staffed to meet this challenge they're trying to staff up as you heard and they're trying to do this as quickly as possible and I know people are stressed greatly and hopefully they will get this money as soon as possible because we wanted to go out ASAP because we know that people need the money they need the underpinning okay next question Thank You congressman where our next question is from Chris to the small business owner Chris you're on with congressman Hoyer Thank You congressman Hoyer for taking my question my wife I own a business in Calvert County that today we employed three southern Marylanders and have for many years we applied for the PPP L on the morning of the 6th we have not received approval yet from our bank as of this morning and now hear from the SBA that the available funds are now gone tomorrow I have to make the most difficult decision we have about laying off our employees will you call on Congress to immediately approve additional ppl funding without tying it into non-code related items into the bill and if so when well well first of all the discussions that have occurred all have dealt with coronavirus related expenses what you're talking about I think is as Secretary of wait excuse me secretary the Treasury mr. minuchin asked for 250 billion dollars for the small business pp Protection Act I've a payroll Protection Act we were for that and I would hope that we would pass that hopefully within the next week if not sooner what we in additionally asked for Governor Hogan who's the chairman of the governor's conference and Governor Cuomo of New York have jointly asked for a five hundred billion dollar additional support for the states and local governments who are all spending a lot of money they didn't anticipate on coronavirus related efforts as you can imagine so we wanted to put in that bill not one hundred and fifty billion not the five hundred that they governor Hogan asked for but hundred fifty billion for state and local governments because they need the money very badly to deal with coronavirus issues in addition to that what we asked was to put 125 billion of the 254 very small businesses that are finding great difficulty if they don't have a bank because many of these go through the you know they go through the banks the small business loans it's a very good deal you said you had two or three employees we want to get that program funded quickly because what it provides as you will know I'm sure is you can keep your if you keep your employees on on the payroll even if they can't come to work you can take out a loan to cover those costs and that loan will be forgiven if at the end of the period of time we're not sure the date that loan will be forgiven so in effect it'll be a cost it'll be a grant it will be converted to a grant if you keep those employees on the payroll and I can assure you that that we will be funding that with in the very near future it needs to be funded we want we want to get money in your hands and in the hands of people just like you but we also understand that the hospitals have been drained heavily as well as small and disadvantaged businesses have been drained substantially so we're trying to help all of those folks and very frankly we're going to do it at some point time we're either going to do it within we can we're going to do it within two or three weeks because we need the money if we're going to keep people's head above water thank you Chris very much and I'm hopeful that we will get that funded ASAP I'm working on it Thank You congressman

well thank you mr. president this is a debate where it really doesn't matter who's speaking Republican or Democrat because we're speaking with one voice and that very seldom happens in American politics today unfortunately but there will be 50 minutes divided but really there is no division here Senate resolution 65 has 91 co-sponsors now that is very difficult to do and the president senator Coons was an original co-sponsor of the legislation and war two Senate resolution 65 all about it's about the following on March for 2012 President Obama stated whenever an effort is made to d legitimize the State of Israel my administration has opposed them so there should not be a shred of doubt by now when the chips are down I have Israel's back this resolution is in support of the president's statement when I heard that statement it was music to my ears because the Iranian nuclear program the efforts of the Iranians to develop a nuclear capability marches own as I speak today may 22nd there are two articles one in associative press 1 and roar ders talking about IAEA reports and diplomats saying that Iran is pressing forward with the construction of a research reactor that would add to their nuclear capability in terms of enriching uranium to make a bomb and that they've increased the number of centrifuges since April dramatically so we've been trying to sanction Iran very successfully I might add senator Menendez my co-sponsor here the original co-sponsor will be here around four and as to Bob Menendez there is no stronger supporter of the us-israel relationship than Bob who's chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee so we've worked on a resolution and the guts of this resolution basically as follows it declares that the United States has a vital national interest in an unbreakable unbreakable commitment to ensuring the existence survival in security the State of Israel it reaffirms the United States support for Israel's right to legitimate self-defense and in the last paragraph it's not an authorization used force but it says the following that if Israel is compelled to take military action in self-defense the United States will stand with Israel and provide diplomatic military and economic sport in its defense of his territory people in existence and the whole resolution is about Israel having to defend herself against a nuclear-capable or I'm so when our president said in 2012 that we have Israel's back that his administration has Israel's back this is a chance for the United States Senate to say we also have Israel's back and from my point of view you can't separate the threat that the nuclear program in Iran creates from the United States and Israel they're the same the same threat that Israel faces from nuclear-armed Iran nuclear capable run we face as a nation so people wonder what will happen if that day ever comes what would America do well this is a statement by every United States Senator of votes yes not an authorization news force but its statement that if that day comes and Israel has to justify ibly defend itself from a breakout by the Iranian regime to build a nuclear weapon which could be the end of the Jewish state we will have Israel's back economically militarily and diplomatically I cannot stress how important it is for that statement to be made by the United States Senate time is running out time is not on our side and as to the threat from Iran since 1984 they've been characterized it's the most active state sponsor of terrorism in the world as we have sanctioned them to stop their nuclear ambitions the amount of enriched uranium has grown as we talk they enrich so we're going to several senators come down voice their support for this resolution and with that Senator Hoeven I'd like to recognized for two minutes if any unwavering support of the USA a relationship

good morning everyone thank you for joining us for today's ag summit virtual ag summit i wish that we could be in person sharing face-to-face but that's not a viable option right now so i appreciate your participation via zoom as we live our lives by zoom it seems like these days i'm glad at least we we have this option like i said and today we're going to focus on rural broadband and so with us today we have two guests with some great insight and they will update us on their work in uh in the area of rural broadband its development and deployments and uh it's it's exciting to see how far we've come but also uh i think it will be informative to to see where we go from here we know that broadband is is a vital part of our infrastructure actually and i think there's common agreement that broadband is part of our nation's infrastructure now i wish that we could get a a bill done at the at the national level on infrastructure and um it's probably not in the cards right now but hopefully it will be uh early next year and so we can in the meantime though i think uh work very diligently to still formulate what needs to be in a bill like that joining us today is state senator kurt friesen and mr zac honeycutt a member of the nebraska rural broadband task force senator friesen represents the 34th district in the nebraska legislature that district includes nance merrick and hamilton counties and a portion of hall county including parts of grand island senator friesen sits on the revenue committee as well as serving as chairman of the transportation and telecommunications committee senator friesen resides near henderson nebraska where he farms with his family zach honeycutt is a farmer from giltner he raises corn soybeans popcorn seed corn and organic crops with his family he serves on the nebraska rural broadband task force as well as the fcc's rural broadband deployment working group of the precision agriculture task force actually the nebraska rural broadband task force was founded by a bill introduced by senator friesen 2018 and focuses on the availability adoption and affordability of broadband services across our state to kick things off senator friesen will lead us with an update on what you're working on in the legislature and and what that what has been happening i guess i know a lot has been and how how you work to promote a broadband expansion and development in nebraska so senator friesen you want to kick it off well thanks congressman smith um it's a good opportunity to talk about this what i feel is extremely important especially for rural nebraska and so we have we started um a couple years ago i mean working on how do we get um actual good high-speed broadband into into rural nebraska and we started with creating the broadband task force which uh zach hunnicutt is a part of but i mean they were kind of the lead in what we did this year and lb 992 is trying to work on all of the issues that were brought up by the broadband task force and so we've uh what we found over the time is that um we were under the assumption that all municipalities and cities out and basically in rural nebraska had fairly decent broadband and through the hearings we've had we found out that a lot of them did not have what we would consider 25 3 or higher and so we have some issues there too but getting broadband out in the rural and when i say rural i'm always talking about outside of the city or village limits was what the focus of the task force has been and so it's it's trying to leverage the nebraska universal service fund along with the federal universal service fund and any other infrastructure that come along and so we have um that's been our main goal just is working with the different companies and we've got some great rural companies uh telephone companies and common carriers that have done a fantastic job of putting broadband out into rural areas and then we have others that are struggling and it has to do with density and and the hookups and when we talk about uh rural ag we we stopped talking about how many people may live per mile we talk about hookups per mile and and now the demand for you know precision agriculture it might be whether a pivot is hooked up to that internet service or bin facilities or other things like that so it's the number of hookups maybe now that we need to be focused on and whether it's mobile access or fixed assets we still need i guess fiber out there to some extent to make that happen what we worked on this year was allowing probably easier leasing of dark fiber from power districts that may have fiber in place and it'll be those public private partnerships i think working with rural power districts that really maybe help facilitate getting broadband out into the extreme rural areas where it's difficult maybe to for one company or one entity to do it by themselves so with that that's kind of what we've been working on and we know that going forward there will be some other issues probably pop up so this isn't the end um this is probably what we'd call maybe the middle and we'll be continually working to fine tune it yet to make sure that we can get this done in a fiscally responsible way and yet something that works sure thank you i would remind everyone participating that if you would like to ask a question or make a comment just please type that into the chat box there and we will we will go over those questions here uh in a moment uh zach you want to give us an update on your perspective and uh what what your findings have been and anything else you'd want to share yeah um you know senator covered it uh pretty well we've been uh talking about on the broadband task force and um that slowed down a little bit uh over the last few months as far as this meeting in person um but on the fcc's working group um that i'm a part of it it's really similar challenges that we're seeing uh there um just meeting the challenges of how to get that you know not just the last mile but the the last acre uh one phrase we've been uh throwing around about how to get to get to everybody and get to every um every spot that needs needs connected um you know it's there there's there's a whole smorgasbord of options out there for ways to deliver uh internet um out that's where it needs to be you know everything from uh fiber access which is obviously ideal to uh so there's a test in indiana where they're going to be delivering it via a blimp um so i mean there's really kind of all sorts of options out there and so really it's figuring out how what's the best way to do it and then ultimately who's going to pay for it is what a lot of it comes down to because it's it's not necessarily going to be a a profitable thing to get to some of these areas but it's it's infrastructure that needs built out and so it's just a matter of figuring out the the best way to make that happen you said i didn't quite catch you said something about indiana can you say that again yeah i'm in indiana there's a i think it's about a 10 county area that they are going to be delivering internet um kind of wireless via a blimp um so that that's definitely thinking out outside the box um and we just just got a little update on that uh in a committee on the rural broadband task force uh yesterday so it's i don't know that that's necessarily going to work everywhere but it's just illustrative of the the kinds of different options people are pursuing to make this happen very good now uh we've got a scenario i think right now of course with kids back in a lot of the schools it probably isn't what it was say last april but you know having connectivity is one thing but if mom and dad are both working on the internet from home and three or four kids are going to school on the internet from home i mean that that that's going to test a lot of capacity there how how much of a has there been much discussion about you know someone might have some access but not enough yeah we we've seen actually quite a bit of that when you get out of the rural areas where especially if it's delivered probably through a fixed wireless where they don't have the capacity to handle that volume most of the urban areas like lincoln especially has fiber to the home everywhere they've not experienced that on the most part but when you get out into some of the other areas where you have systems that are you know still maybe a dsl where volume kicks up it slows down they've run into that quite often yeah we we did talk about that uh quite a bit um just that the educational access even before all of this happened um just the the disparities that there are um in rural communities and uh and even in urban communities just that you might not even even if the service is available uh we have kids it might not be in family situations where they can afford it and were so much at school before covet was happening online that was an issue and now that's just been uh amped up pretty significantly and so it's just it's really highlighted the challenge that's there that it's not just uh you know after school uh to before school time but now it's become a 24-hour challenge right um how what's the frequency of satellite access you know um i think they're they're back in them a few years ago there were a lot more companies offering satellite access and i still think there's it's out there but again you go back to um you know cloud cover or rainstorm events where you don't have access then yes and the latency is um not just the same as fiber it's a delay so it's it's accessible but i don't think the speeds are there that you can have with fiber or some of the other high-speed wireless options even yeah yeah all right eric do we have some questions sorry about that so far no questions just a few comments robert post from banner county saying that uh their provider has received several grants and the timeline is so tight that they fear they can't complete them all and i believe that they are cares grand so i guess a little bit of a question in that comment there and probably just as a reminder to all the participants on if you'd like to ask a question go ahead and click on the chat option and type in the question there well i think uh this is referring to probably to the the state of nebraska is the cares act money that governor ricketts has put towards rural broadband and uh he put 40 million dollars of money into that program and they have basically taken applications i have not seen the final list yet they had a deadline several weeks ago they opened it up again to other other groups again i don't know that they've i think they've probably uh the applications have ceased but it does have a december 31st uh deadline of being up and running um i don't know how strict they'll have to hold to that hopefully there's maybe some changes i'm not sure the reason for that other than there might have been some requirements from the federal level but um these dollars were um going to be putting broadband into smaller communities and so i i know of several uh applications that were successful but i wouldn't want to name them right now but there there was 40 million dollars put into this i think it's going to really help out some of the smaller communities out there that do not have good access okay uh eric so far no other questions there was a comment there about towers being involved um i know a question that we uh that we sometimes get at the office is just about the broadband task force and what it entails so i i think that one could be a fair one to ask that we get sometimes while we're out on the road uh just from the broadband task force i mean their their whole uh i think the their mission was um trying to you know find out again how we can leverage this and and make it happen with limited dollars that we have and i'll i'll let zach uh go into more detail but it was uh the focus of it you know was trying to figure out you know what role make power districts have in it um what are the different delivery methods does it have to be fiber to home um and i think in nebraska's case it's going to be maybe all of the above in some cases because when you get out into real sparse areas maybe it doesn't it doesn't work to put fiber to the home 15 miles out to one customer we're going to have to look at all options out there and and again just because there's fiber to the home doesn't mean that the person is going to be able to afford to to hook up so that's some of the challenges yeah yeah you know just you know broadly just the task force trying to bring bring all stakeholders together um to figure out the best way forward because i don't i don't think there's uh anybody in the state that denies the necessity of um bringing the entire states having modern broadband access but the the challenges that are there um aren't small i know even our our local provider is deploying fiber uh to the home all through its footprint but they've they've been working on this for you know it's been a at least a 20-year project um so it's not something that's just a a quick and easy thing to to ramp up in places that haven't necessarily been as prepared um so it's the like uh senator mentioned uh what role does public this public power play you know where we have all infrastructure out there already that can um be leveraged um how are we going to how are we going to pay for it how are we going to view um what what does broadband access look like and and then what does it look like going forward i think one of the concerns we had was not wanting to build something that meant you know that 2019 or 2020 standards and then be stuck and trying to figure it out again in 20 years because we were behind building something that was future-proofed also and so there's bringing everybody together in a room to to cover that was really the best way to to move forward on this and so um it's not it's not in there's no easy answers but we definitely are farther along now than than we would have been without this task force looks like we've got some questions here eric we do um the first question is could you give us some idea of the percentage of nebraskans that have no real usable internet and what percentage would consider what percentage consider their internet access to be inadequate well i think some of the numbers i've seen um there's about uh if we'll talk in rural there's about uh 63 percent of nebraskans i think have access to what we call 25 30 or higher um we you know and that may be a it probably could be a wireless fixed wireless but it wouldn't be what what zach was talking about being a future proof so to speak because again you have limited capacity with that option um we're uh you know compared to our neighboring states we're like number six out of seven so we have not done a great job of of getting this done but i think um with what we've accomplished so far with the task force i think it puts us on a path to play catch-up if we can okay next question all right the next question that came in uh is the broadband going to be 4g or 5g um yes so i was on the subcommittee that was looking at the different technologies um yes is the answer it it we're kind of looking at at all options um 5g presents some real challenges in rural areas because of its limited range it's it's really technology built more for an urban setting because you're talking about meeting uh needing towers little micro towers every several hundred feet so we're not going to see the sand hills probably blanketed in 5g towers there's probably some potential for 5g towers to be along highways and places that have again existing infrastructure that can maybe figure out a partnership to make that happen but 4g and 5g really just refer to that that's cellular data technology and so um that they're actually serviced by the the fiber lines and such that uh need to be laid all over the state so there will be 4g and 5g as part of the the puzzle but um they're just a couple of the technologies that'll need to be used to get access to everybody um one thing i wanted to just clarify a little bit when i said 63 percent have access that's according to the fcc's 477 forms which we all know are probably skewed a little bit to the high side so until we find a better mapping um i guess that number might be a little bit on the high side yeah mapping has been a a a real challenge i know several state farm bureaus over the last few years have been trying to have members uh map their what their speeds looked like and where they didn't didn't have connectivity um you know we rely a lot on what providers uh provide for maps which of course they're gonna um they're gonna take the most optimistic view possible on that coverage um i know there's a with the fcc i know there's another working group that that's i think working specifically on mapping so it's figuring out those those numbers and what exactly their challenge is it's not just unique to nebraska but it's a nationwide issue good eric another question that's come in can the power grid be used for delivery well i think that's been probably one of the main issues we've worked on in 992 is that right now the the power industry that's out there the small public power providers have easements that allow for power delivery but they don't have an easement that contains the ability to put communication services on those same polls so that was one thing that 992 did was clarify that they're able to do that there's a process now that they'll have to go through but there is technology where um that top ground wire on the power lines can incorporate fiber into it so the the possibility is there now whether or not you want to go above ground or below ground there's quite a discussion amongst providers yet as to what's the best option there but when you get out in the rural areas they've some of the data that they're looking at now shows that costs can be cut considerably by by putting it into that top wire and incorporating it into their power lines so i think that's an option that's there now and then we'll see once in the future here if the the public private partnership portion of that works and how they might make that um facilitate putting that fiber up on the poles and and if everything goes according to plans i think everything is in place now to allow them to do that yeah and i know the there were concerns about um liability and you know if you've got uh the power district trying to uh service poles and dealing with the um you know fiber line on there just or fiber lines broken who who's responsible for it i mean there's just some concerns out there that need to be answered for sure um our our subcommittee um dealing with the technologies on the rural broadband task force was having a meeting with uh an engineering firm that is working with facebook that's developed some new robotic technology to install fiber over the uh over the power lines um that it it it has to do with the speed of deployment instead of doing um maybe a kilometer a day they're talking several kilometers a day so um it's kind of technology that that's out there and ready to go and uh could really speed up deployment okay eric next question that's come in is there any hope that the national first net project will be able to provide broadband to those areas that are not now nor probably financially viable in the future able to have adequate broadband well i think uh the first nap project and that att won the bid in nebraska and so um i get regular emails of how many cell towers they're putting into service regularly and they are there's a lot of towers gone into place in the last year so i don't know how widespread they are in western nebraska yet in the more rural parts but they have definitely put up a lot of towers in this area so i think that might be in some areas where you get into that real sparse clears that might be a a viable option there i don't know that okay all right eric next question next question that's come in along with the infrastructure that definitely needs attention is there any thought about digital literacy just because we have the infrastructure doesn't mean we know how to utilize it to the fullest well yeah that's a that's a good question um again i seems like the younger people these days are very more educated on how to use digital devices but i mean even even old guys like me i'm really depend on it now already and feel very comfortable with it so um i think there's just you know there's probably uh community colleges offer courses too but maybe zach can talk more about that he's got kids maybe that young age that know a lot more than i do about it yeah um yeah that is one thing that that will be necessary just i think you know as we've seen you know the the older generations even figure you know figure out things like facebook and smartphones you know that it's not terribly hard to learn but we do need to to ensure that everyone is being given access to that education of how to how to use the internet well how to use their devices uh correctly you know i've got kids from uh 12 down to three that you know on the one hand they they seem to figure out pretty intuitively how to how to use the technology but um you know we have to be pretty intentional in in teaching them how to uh how to use it wisely um and you know they're they're doing we we home school we homeschooled even before covent um and uh yeah so they've had they've done a lot over the internet uh anyway and so now it's it's a matter of as they do more and more um just making sure they're they're knowing um how to do it i don't we don't have any formalized plan for uh for education but i think the opening is there for um you know in the in the you know in the schools uh for the younger younger kids or for community colleges to offer that kind of education and that's that's definitely something that should should be considered you know um i've been working a lot on on telehealth and so intel health means different things to to different people obviously we've got you know anywhere i'm working on a bill that would uh facilitate more interactions between nursing facilities and hospitals but telehealth let's face it it's about staying at home and being able to get on your phone and talk to a provider so i i think that you know we want to look for ways where you know the community can step in perhaps and help the elderly uh get onto the the phone i mean we we want to treat in place obviously um but there there's going to be some uh a learning curve here i guess where we want the elderly to have the access that they need but it will require some some uh you know training there and once they get comfortable with it i think it'll it'll uh lure them in even even more like you know a lot of the elderly there already has mentioned by zach that they're already interacting quite a bit on on facebook and in other platforms so uh looks like there's some more questions go ahead eric yeah we've got another couple questions here the next question is have there been any studies or surveys done on what the economic impact might be if there was more consistent and higher quality internet access in the rural parts of the state i don't have uh current data in front of me but i mean people have looked at that and when i when i look at rural nebraska if we're gonna if we're gonna attract our young kids back here and we did that when we had a good ag economy we did attract a lot of young people back but the thing is they they almost had to move to a town with high-speed broadband access because it's possible that their spouse continued their work where they were able to hook up to high-speed broadband and maintain their employment where they were previously employed so when i look at rural nebraska i mean we've been losing population for 100 years and if we don't get broadband out here i mean that slide is going to continue to happen so i look at it as it's the biggest economic development whether it's telehealth or any number of other issues every time when i go to any meetings or anything everybody they constantly whether it's health care or education or roads or anything else they all say well first we've got to get broadband out there that that is the number one issue as far as economic development and when you have businesses now that maybe want to move into more rural areas of the state they do have to have access to real broadband high-speed good reliable broadband not not but what's out there in some cases so i mean i think it's it's really important if we're going to have some economic development occur and we can diversify the economy out in rural nebraska yeah i think if had a few minutes go back and look through materials we've had from the task force i think we've seen some some studies putting it trying to put a dollar amount to it but i mean the reality is it's about it's about like considering what the economic impact is of putting electricity to an area i mean it's it's a necessary piece of infrastructure that you know eventually if you don't have it the you you won't have any economic activity going on good point i look at the growing pains of the front range of colorado you know whether it's transportation infrastructure whether it's uh availability of water uh various things that you know the i think the very best thing we can do to prepare to absorb some of those growing things over there and get folks to move here to western nebraska is broadband and i mean it's it seems rather basic and you know then it becomes more about how how can we make sure it's affordable uh for folks regardless of where they live uh exactly similar to electricity like you mentioned um we've done before let's uh let's do it again so next question next question did i understand correctly the broadband may not be affordable because of the cost to get it there in some places that's exactly right i mean you look at the cost of deployment of fiber into these um where you have a low number of hookups per mile and the cost to do that just you cannot recoup that in the fees that you can charge and so at some point there it's going to take a subsidy of some sort for companies to step out and do that and that's where we are hoping this the public private partnership maybe with the rural electrics where they have a need for broadband out to their substations and to control some of their switches and things like that that they can partner with them and help drive down that cost and again there is just no economic case sometimes when you get out of the real sparse areas where you can say that a company can actually afford to put this out there without some sort of subsidy or public private partnership yeah so just to clarify that the the just the the basic cost of it would not be affordable to the consumer so that's the basic question we're trying to address is how to what how do we make it uh so the consumer can actually afford it um that i mean that's ultimately the the base challenge of this whole thing um is to figure out how to make it affordable yeah how much you know i look at how our own household here in here has changed perhaps in in terms of what we subscribed to now uh before covid hit because my wife our little guy and i were back and forth to washington a lot and um not always here in gearing we decided uh what three years ago to just subscribe uh to internet no cable and that was more of a cost thing really and so covet hits we stay in gearing basically except when i go to washington to vote very briefly and for various reasons we haven't missed cable and no offense to our cable providers but we've we've just stuck with the internet um we get our news online uh so we don't even have to really watch some of the obnoxious cable news coverage and i have to assume that other other people are doing that too whether it's a cost driver or whatever else so how how how much should we care about that what do we need to be planning for any other kind of shifts toward or away from various provisions well you've you've seen exactly what's happened to shopping especially with kova driving it more and more people are shopping online it's changed how we the brick and mortar stores are going to operate cable companies currently do offer broadband over their cable and so it's not necessarily that they're just offering cable tv these days there's communities who is the broadband supplier is the cable company they may have fiber to the home in some areas and you can choose so many different services and and i know a lot of people now they do streaming of their of all their tv they don't subscribe to the dish or directv or some of those everything they do all their entertainment movies comes over high-speed broadband and so if we're going to have access to the same things that our urban counterparts have and if we're going to have we need to have those same options available here in real nebraska in our house as soon as our internet speed got to a point where we could uh you know watch netflix or hulu and also do anything else on any other device we we dropped uh dropped our cable and went to it um i uh half joked that the the best way to get nebraska unified behind a broadband plan would be for the big ten network to go 100 streaming if the internet was the only way you're going to see husker football you're going to you're going to figure out how to deploy it everywhere pretty quick well we'll see if the big 10 gets that creative so far well that's a good point though uh and you know it so much of it has to do with uh pricing structure and this part gets to be a little bit frustrating because uh you know they they've got introductory pricing and so forth because i mean our internet is through one of our cable companies here um and so you know there there are the options there but um it would be interesting to know uh of course cable companies are kind of the the middle man when i've heard what for example espn charges the cable companies i was kind of shocked i mean that that it was fairly significant and of course they have to pass that along um and they're somewhat captive there but um when you look at the cost of netflix and what that opens up in terms of options for the consumer gosh that sure seems a lot more affordable than what you know espn would offer in terms of uh fees that you have to pay you know then you have to get everything and any anyway i'm just kind of thinking out loud here of how can we encourage you know through public policy again not mandates but encourage through public policy as many options as possible for consumers i think one of the challenges we've been looking at a little bit is when you get into the municipalities at least the the taxes the franchise fees the occupation taxes um you have uh telecommunications providers you have cable companies and you have broadband suppliers and they all operate under different rules and different taxes and trying you know and all those companies are now doing all the above technology has changed so you got telecommunication providers offering broadband and cable and like i said all three of them are doing the same thing and that they're operating under different tax policies and so one of the things that we've found at least is that some cities out there were charging really high uh pull attachment fees for hanging cable on their poles and so those costs are passed on directly to the consumer it's just a it's a what i call a hidden tax um i would rather be more transparent so we've tried to address some of that in our what we call our small cell bill that we did a couple years ago and so i think we're finding that in other areas now too there's sometimes rules and regulations and taxes at the local level that probably add to that cost also are any municipalities aggressively structuring their policies so as to kind of recruit more more broadband offerings there are municipalities that that really do use that as a selling point but at the same time they also have high fees associated with those companies trying to put broadband in the in their communities so it's it's a i just keep it's a hidden tax that they can put on that nobody sees but yet it adds to that cost but municipalities definitely i mean if they have fiber to the home in their community it is a selling point when they're talking about trying to attract businesses or people out of the community well i i would think you know look at strive tv there in your neighborhood i would think they would be someone that any community would aggressively recruit not just in the short term but the long term when you look at the you know the innovation involved and how how uh there's something the sky is the limit on many of these approaches and um i would think that high fees and tax would be very stifling to to a lot of these these innovative uh companies well the smaller the smaller towns like henderson for instance um they don't really do that the smaller communities are working really hard just to attract people it's the larger communities usually that look at it as a revenue source but yeah strive tv would not be located in henderson if we did not have fiber to the business there i mean that is they are strictly dependent on high-speed broadband and great company they're growing fast and they attracted some young people back to the community which is exactly what we want and they're diversified from agriculture and and in some ways you know help uh support uh ag communities because they're just more options there and you know and as mentioned earlier uh precision precision agriculture is so a technology intense that i would hope we can see parallel development with with more infrastructure so and as as technology becomes more and more intense there for agriculture yeah if you look back at when we had high priced commodities the expansion of technology and ag was tremendous everybody was adapting on the latest technology and now with uh ag kind of in a slump that is i think slowed down a little bit but yeah i think you touched on a good point there that you know obviously we need we need broadband for uh precision ag technology but um having broadband won't just it won't just pump up our our number one economy which is which is agriculture but it'll it'll diversify our economy more and make it more robust so if we're at you know times where agriculture is a little slower it's not such a devastating thing to local communities to have a slow ag economy if we've also got some other other things going on that broadband helped make possible eric do we have any more questions i've got one more i guess that was submitted um the uh the question is how has covet 19 impacted any of the rural broadband task force timelines i don't know that it's had an impact other than maybe just point out some deficiencies we have uh when you have kids that wanted to go online for distance learning so i i it's i think our hold up right now is just access to capital and how fast can you put fiber into the ground and and with the cost involved that's that's the limiting factor right now i think everybody is kind of on board with doing this as fast as we can how do we leverage the dollars that are available out there to do the most we can yeah so the timing was oh sorry to say the timing actually was okay from our standpoint because about the time we had kind of had to shut down meeting and stuff was sort of the time we had handed the baton back to the legislature to um to deal with our our recommendations so um it didn't really slow down the the task force much at all so if we look at the federal level uh broadband being part of our infrastructure and so forth what and as senator friesen just mentioned the need for capital what could we do what should we do at the federal level to you know basically encourage investment you know make it easier and to access capital what what would you point to if you if there was one thing that you would focus on well i think i guess the first thing is is goes back to mapping but after that you know the the access to capital and that can be tax policy um sometimes it is how we view investments and how we tax those investments can be an easy way to drive development of something and you are so so to speak picking winners and losers but this is something that i think is so important to everyone it is very broad a benefit to the communities that it's easy to say if we make that investment and use tax policy to drive it that would probably be something that the federal government could do and then just helping investors make sure that they see the value in it and i think a lot of these discussions kind of get compared to the rural electrification um you know there's similar challenges and so but there's some differences you know with the um when you know the power poles came through here in the the 40s you know there weren't rural power providers you know the the challenge we have is there there are rural internet providers it's just that they're they're not able to to deploy the the best technologies in an affordable price and so um finding that way to to work with the providers that are there um not not just overrun them with uh larger national companies but figure out ways to work with the providers that are that are already there in the communities to find the best ways to deploy the technology how how much have you guys discussed the definition of affordability i think the task force definition is that rural access should be comparable to what our urban counterparts pay and so right now i'd say um we are quite a bit higher and we did have some numbers but i don't have them in front of me but uh rural uh pays more right now than urban but we don't we don't have competition we're gonna have one provider where in urban areas you may have two three or four choices on where you might get your broadband so there there is definitely competition there and our costs are also less yeah okay well and knowing that uh it is rather tedious and just a hassle to change providers even in uh inside city limits here uh i i'm not confident that uh there's as much straight up true competition as we would like there to be even though there are choices out there i mean it is such a hassle to change change uh providers that uh be a little frustrating that's probably true i don't have to make those choices there's just one we got here very good any other any other questions no other questions submitted all right um kurt and zach anything else you'd you'd like to add anything else on your minds well i think as as you know as we run into more issues as we get further along in this process i think the task force is set up to proceed ahead and keep looking at the issues that come up or if they run into roadblocks somewhere we're gonna the task force will probably come with some recommendations and then the legislature will continue to make modifications to that and if there's you know if we see things at the federal level i mean we always feel that we can contact you and and work with you because i think it's important you said it's important to you and so i i feel we have good partners right now and and we'll just see once how what the changes we've made how that impacts it and what kind of snags we might run into down the road but um right now it just from what i'm hearing i mean there's a lot of miles of fiber going home and it's just a matter now if as we get into these smaller communities uh will it will it get done how much capital do we need and what what is the need or you know we realize we can't hook up everyone at one time it's not going to happen so it's going to be a process and a priority of where we go with it so i i still think we keep working going forward and as we see things i hope we'll we'll contact you if it's a federal issue but really it is a very local issue there's communities that can get more involved with their provider we have uh they lb 840 money it's it's economic development um tax that a city can levy that can help with sometimes working with a private provider to get broadband in so there's a lot of options out there and we just have to use all of them that are available to us before we come and ask for federal help if we don't if we don't have to yeah i would add that you know even though um you know in rural areas we you know that we don't always uh see we don't necessarily think people in urban centers really know the struggle we're dealing with out here and while that might sometimes be true i think just know that there there's a broad coalition of people working together to try to meet this challenge and even if even if someone in lincoln or omaha or washington dc doesn't exactly understand what what the rural internet challenges are like there there are lots and lots of people working together to try to to solve this challenge eric looks like one more question came in we'll uh take this one and then i'll probably wrap it up yep that sounds good sir we've got one question left at the federal level how much collaboration is there around a national broadband effort we read where one congressman in south carolina has been working on it to see not traction we hear things in nebraska about others but is there a concerted effort we can expect uh short answer is yes um i i think that when we look at you know all the moving parts right now i sense that there is more agreement than ever before for example that broadband is part of our nation's infrastructure um i i think there is a healthy appetite to do a an infrastructure bill i worry that some people won't take yes for an answer and i i think the president has been eager to do an infrastructure bill he wants a deal one of his i think best qualities is the desire to do and the ability to make a deal and we we see what he's done on trade and tax reform i mean some some big issues but you take the usmca for example that that was uh a compromise that came together uh that um i think has been one of the biggest bipartisan victories in decades and a huge win for the president and despite the fact that a lot of folks didn't want the president to get a win but for example speaker pelosi basically was under so much pressure to deliver a vote on this bill and it was one of the most bipartisan votes on a trade bill probably in history and it contains some provisions that many of my democratic colleagues have been asking for for decades a couple of those provisions i will tell you it gave me a little bit of heartburn but they weren't deal breakers and so we ultimately got it done and i think sent a message to the world that we are serious about trade now when you look at infrastructure and broadband a lot i think very similarly the president is eager to make a deal the president raised a very good point a while back that when it comes to infrastructure need to make sure that we've got good solid competition among bidders and that we reduce the red tape and the regulations that create so much inefficiency in delivering these projects if we're not careful we will see you know if say that the fuel tax was just increased along the way with no other changes we could very easily see inflationary impacts where we we have to pay more money for fewer projects we want to avoid that we can avoid that and and so just throwing money at it to me is not the answer do we need in investments yes and i i want to keep an open mind in terms of how we get there but we need a multi-faceted approach to to where we can address some of these things so that we can get get more projects for our money and we there are federal policies literally there are federal policies on the books that are intended to reduce competition seriously we need to address that and that that's just one thing we need good good solid competition there to help help put pressure downward pressure on on costs and upward pressure on innovation so i appreciate that question so anyway thank you to everyone who has been on this morning thank you zach and senator friesen thank you senator friesen for your service in the legislature i know uh it it hasn't been easy and uh really appreciate the fact that you've served in the manner that you have and i think your constituents are fortunate to have you and just really really appreciate what you've done meanwhile please keep in touch as things pop up that need our attention please feel free to holler tomorrow morning an hour later than we've been gathering all week we will have ambassador greg dowd the chief ag negotiator at the office of the united states trade representative a great person to have to to give us an update on on trade in general obviously there's a lot to talk about on that front especially as it relates to agriculture and we're all consumers and trade impacts us as consumers and so i'm very grateful to have ambassador dowd on the on the schedule tomorrow uh but again please note the the difference in time frame tomorrow but we look forward to uh having you with us again so with that i'll just go ahead and and wrap up but uh feel free to holler with any questions uh along the way and hopefully we'll see you all tomorrow morning thanks have a good day

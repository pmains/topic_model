morgen president before he leaves the floor I just want to commend our colleague from Maryland and the presiding officer for the good work that they have done on this issue as a member of the Intelligence Committee I have seen firsthand what this has meant had a chance as my colleague the presiding officer knows to question mr. even inna who has been chosen by the president for a key job in the intelligence field asked him point blank if he considered ZTE an espionage threat to this day and the answer was yes so we are now going to spend the next hour colleagues talking about Medicare and Medicaid this is the 53rd anniversary but before they leave the floor I just wanted to commend my colleague from Maryland the presiding officer my colleague on the Intelligence Committee for their good work mr. president I ask unanimous consent that the following individuals be granted floor privileges for the remainder of the Congress Shane McCullough and Melissa Erickson as president this week marks the 53rd anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid our bedrock federal health care programs I'm pleased to be joined by my colleagues I see senator Cardin's in a White House here to participate know senator Coons is support for these programs and our colleagues will be talking today about why these programs are so vitally important to tens of millions of Americans literally generations of our people Medicare and Medicaid have stood the test of time because the American people have long understood the value of a health care guarantee particularly for seniors and the most vulnerable among us Medicare and my colleagues on the Finance Committee talked a fair amount about it in the piece of paper it in a voucher it's a guarantee and Americans have always understood that that was the case wasn't that long ago when there wasn't a guarantee getting older or falling on hard shipment health care was one of the first of life's necessities to grow out of reach it wasn't that long ago when there were really poor farms literally poor farms to try to meet the needs of older people people before these programs lost installed through the cracks and in the destitution their family wasn't their seniors ended up as I said in the streets or on those poor farms these health care promises now the pledges behind Medicare and Medicaid have lasted for more than half a century because Americans understand that when they get a paycheck part of that pay goes to supporting the health guarantee families around the country however are beginning to wonder given the events of the last year and a half whether that guarantee will be there when they need it they aren't wrong for worry every major piece of Republican legislation that has had a pulse in this Congress has increased the risk that Medicare and Medicaid won't be there when it counts most recently it was trumpstats law that stole billions of dollars in years of security from Medicare's future all to rain down tax benefits on the largest corporations and wealthy individuals in the country as a result of this reckless tax legislation shareholders are now swimming in a sea of stock buybacks and executives have pocketed huge windfall while Medicare faces a crisis years ahead of the earlier projections in addition to leaving a gaping hole on federal balance sheets after this pass law and I'm not sure many Americans know this the Trump administration released a budget that outlines in black and white just how they plan to make up the difference so you don't have to take it from me here are some examples out of the president's budget document on page 52 the president proposes reviving the Graham Cassidy proposal Americans rejected last year that would repeal the Affordable Care Act including it's ironclad pre-existing condition protections on page 53 the president seeks to slash Medicaid by more than a trillion dollars over the next 10 years by eliminating the Medicaid expansion and placing harsh caps on the rest of the program that squeeze out critical care on page 54 the president calls for close to 15 dollars in reduced Medicare spending without an explicit guarantee that seniors won't be worse off on pages 24 53 and 64 the president calls in his budget for burdensome paperwork requirements for the SNAP program a vital program to help hungry Americans affordable housing and health care that really creates more bureaucracy without making people better off so mr. president and colleagues as we begin this this isn't some sort of message or something those are the pages in the President's budget document specific numbers on a specific page and a specific report embraced by the president that harms Medicare and Medicaid I'm just gonna spend a minute now because I'm looking forward to my seat mates there in the funny Finance Committee coming up on Medicaid Medicaid has endured the single most concentrated attack on his future that I have seen since the days when I was co-director of the oregon gray Panthers in spite of Republican attempts to slash Medicaid people-power stopped that effort Republicans would have block granted Medicaid choking off funding so the program couldn't keep up with the needs of our people without Medicaid's guarantee two of three seniors who count on medic to help pay for their nursing costs would increasingly have nowhere to turn people with disabilities who've been able to live and thrive in their homes and communities rather than institutions might not have that same kind of opportunity and without medicaid's promise of affordable care of families with parents working two or three jobs would face yet another unnecessary obstacle to the well-being of their kids and families even without the partisan attacks on Medicare and Medicaid there are challenges that need to be addressed to keep these programs secure drug prices are out of control while the drug industry pockets billions every quarter with consumers and taxpayers footing the bill a recent study by the Department of Health and Human Services their Inspector General found that while the number of brand-name prescriptions and Medicare Part D decreased in the last five years spending on those drugs increased by 77 percent during that time the number of seniors paying more than 2000 dollars out of pocket for medicine nearly doubled that is unacceptable and Americans are up in arms at the fact that our seniors still get clobbered at the pharmacy window in the face of these challenges there are still opportunities to improve Medicare and Medicaid so that guarantee is strong for years to come earlier this year on a bipartisan basis Congress passed one of the most significant updates to the Medicare guarantee in a generation one that is going to begin the effort to keep up with the rising tide of seniors managing multiple chronic illnesses like heart disease diabetes or cancer chronic illness mr. president and colleagues is going to drive American health care and this bill begins the effort to improve Medicare so that no matter how a senior gets their care there will be more opportunities for them to thrive in later years finally when it comes to Medicaid the country is witnessing a groundswell of Americans who are fed up by partisan gridlock holding up state decisions to expand Medicaid to help more people walking on an economic tightrope one look makes it clear that this is a winning proposition for a state when states expand the program the uninsured rate goes down the number of opioid related hospitalizations is lower in expansion states medical debt is down people have more access to preventive care if legislators sit on their hands people are pushing ballot initiatives to force the issue in Maine where a Medicaid expansion initiative easily passed incredibly the conservative governor says who cares he's gonna stand in its way health care in America is too hard to access for too many the Affordable Care Act is a significant step forward there was ironclad protection and I'm very proud of the fact it really came from a bipartisan bill I was part of airtight loophole free protection for Americans from sea to shining sea and discrimination if they had a pre-existing condition it created a baseline for Medicaid so fewer Americans fell through the cracks of patchwork health systems but for too many premium increases at a far faster rate than their paychecks and the price of prescription medicine is still spiking we're going to talk more over the next hour mr. president about these crucial issues I'm really pleased that - very thoughtful members of the Finance Committee are here to start us off they have long been part of the efforts to stand as bulwarks and protecting Americans from debilitating sickness and financial ruin and supporting the Medicare and Medicaid guarantee

dead on arrival we proved to them yesterday that 45 republicans think it's unconstitutional to try a private citizen there's a great deal of evidence the chief justice didn't think it warranted him crossing the street to be over here because there is no provision for actually trying a private citizen so this is really it's a scandal and it's a double standard it's hypocrisy it's all the terrible things it's the bitterness of the election replayed over again and it's just a sad day for the country it is a sad day and uh and i don't i am certainly no fan of the chief justice but i have to credit him for refusing to participate in this uh this fraud uh and this attack that has been going on for four and a half years against uh now private citizen but former president donald trump your thoughts about his choice not to do as the constitution requires if there is to be an impeachment preside over the senate trial you know i think there's actually a very interesting question did chuck schumer talk to justice roberts i think he actually did because think about it wouldn't they want justice roberts over here to sort of substantiate and give gravity to this so-called impeachment my guess is and i can't prove this but my guess is chuck schumer called justice roberts and justice roberts said hell no i'm not going over there because this constitution says i preside when we impeach the president but there's no provision for impeaching someone who's not the president how do you remove somebody from office who's not the president but my guess is justice roberts actually had a private conversation with chuck schumer and said i'm not coming because how did they so seamlessly go to having patrick leahy a democrat who already voted for impeachment preside how did they go so seamlessly without asking so my guess is they privately ask and he said no way am i coming over to be part of that charade but they didn't want to admit it so somebody in the media ought to be asking chuck schumer did you call justice roberts i think it'd be an interesting question to ask i think it'd be a terrific question to ask and i think you've probably provided the correct answer to it but i also find it interesting and i'd be uh very interested to hear your thoughts on this as to why the national media has not asked in any reporting that i have seen why is it that judge roberts made that decision not to preside despite the strictures of the constitution or because of the strictures of the constitution don't you find it interesting that we're not seeing any reporting from any quarter on that very fundamental question well there are a lot of things they're ignoring they're ignoring the constitutionality of this but they've already left to this other conclusion that the president incited violence but the language they point to is that he said go fight for your country and the question that should be asked of every democrat should be have you ever in a speech figuratively said we should fight for our country i don't know of a politician who hasn't used those words but the interesting thing is there's actually defense that he said go peacefully and march up there and show that let them hear your voice but with the media if they were fair would say is what about democrats who have incited violence should we impeach them kamala harris has offered to bail out people who are burning our cities she offered to help fund and she suggested people should fund an organization in minnesota to get people out of jail who are committing violence in our cities should kamala harris be impeached for that well none of us have called for that because we think that's absurd but really if they're going to think they're going to say the same standards should apply should bernie sanders be impeached when the gunner the gunman came to the ball field that nearly killed steve scalise he was saying this is for health care this is what democrats were saying the republican plan is you get sick and then you die does that not sound inflammatory could that not have inflamed this gunman to come to the ball field i never heard an apology but we were better people than they were we never accused bernie sanders of it but now that all sense of decency has gone out the window maybe we should ask bernie sanders are you responsible for the gunman maybe we should ask cory booker who said get up in their face is he responsible for some of this violence against congressman you know it's just a terrible world that they're leading us to and the idea that they would impeach anybody you could be impeached we can beat lou dobbs rand paul we can impeach anybody it's not in office anymore that is a crazy world they're sending us towards or we could in point of fact examine the words of the government that president biden now leads in some of its officers we could examine the words of president obama and wonder whether we should prosecute or persecute in kind a former president with impeachment these these are outrageous amongst decent american citizens but there is no decency among the democrat leadership in the body that you uh you are in right this moment and if we're going to impeach former presidents woodrow wilson's right up there at the top of my list i i'm really thinking that we should file papers on woodrow wilson as well i mean this is insane what they're doing but we showed it to be a charade yesterday and uh woodrow wilson's there i'm waiting as soon as i get the votes i'm going to put the papers in for woodrow wilson well i wish i had a vote in that as well i would i'd be glad to follow your lead senator rand paul uh congratulations again and i hope that some of your colleagues were persuaded by your comments yesterday they were eloquent uh and absolutely righteous we thank you for being with us senator rand paul

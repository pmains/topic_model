the doctorate in education and uh also presidents of louisiana louisiana prison chapel foundation building more than 20 churches inside of prison walls so just uh really really appreciate you being with us and um and sharing with us your insights on on on these topics that are just front and center for americans these days which is race relations in america um police and community relations in america and frankly this this entire discussion of where we're at as a country um with respect to to race and it's it's a taboo topic generally but i think it's becoming less so i don't think we have a choice i think we just have to to talk about it and and and and find the truth in there and and look what what it all comes down to fundamentally is there there are communities and it's usually communities overwhelmingly communities of color that have just been left behind for for some reason now the left likes to blame that 100 on race and then systemic racism and my goal generally is to is to look past that a little bit and say look okay that's fine that but we're ghost hunting if we're if we're blaming systemic racism because you can't wrap your hands around that um what you can do is talk about development education healthcare business investment these are things we can wrap our arms around and it seems to me that's some of the things you focus on so um maybe we could start there as far as your general philosophy on on how we look to help these communities because i think we all do and what's the best way to do it and what have we done wrong in the past and how can we learn from that yeah i think the the first step is to to look at um look at the civil rights act of 1964. and if we look at the civil rights act of 1964 you know the the idea of critical race theory was not a a a weapon there or or the sword of the civil rights act of 1964 nor was it a sword of dr martin luther king or the sclc or the naacp or any any groups fighting for equality and it's because the critical race theory uh the father of critical race theory is critical legal theory and the grandfather of critical legal theory is marxism and so basically that has never been the aim of of the civil rights movement in america our our mantra was equal opportunity not equity equal opportunity and there's a difference and so when we talk about critical race theory we we need to combat that with the one race theory of the civil rights movement see the civil rights movement believed in one race theory a colorblind a truly colorblind society is only one race on the planet that's the human race see martin luther king said one cannot begin to live until he can rise above the narrow confinements of his own individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity martin had left that space of race and and and and as and using race to be a victim see martin had gotten into the space of dealing with you know the human race and when you realize that there is only one race of people then if you say well and then but in order to do that you know my pastor george foreman always likes to say hey man you have to sit on the moon you have to get up you know 239 thousand uh miles and then look down at the planet earth and say hey are you concerned with this group this group this group are you concerned with the whole human race and see once we get into being concerned about the whole human race this color stuff really doesn't work and i often tell people congressman that no horse wins a race looking back you know when you when you see those horses lined up to run a race there they have blinders on they don't even want to look side to side they want to look straight ahead so we have grown of course uh there are people who have not grown in america who still focus on race but there are folks america is not racist are there people in america who are so small and think so small that they're in their they're they're narrowed down into these little pin you know these little pinheads of of of the way they see the world and and the only way they see it is through race then they buy in the critical race theory i mean that's fundamentally what critical race theory is i mean to define it it's all problems are viewed through the lens of race and that every every every outcome has a has a cause and that causes race it seems to me no matter what and there's simply no escaping from that and it also means you can never solve it it's sort of a cop-out yeah you know my grandfather was a farmer in louisiana plus he fought in world war one and uh my dad fought in the korean war and so my grandfather used to always say son you have to have more than one two in your toolbox i said what do you mean by that he said well if you think if you only have a hammer in your toolbox then the solution to every problem to you is a nail yeah so if oh and i tell my friends over naacp about that all the time i said hey man you guys only have one have one tool in your toolbox that's racism so every every solution is to fight it through the lens of race but look man when i woke up this morning and i looked outside and i saw that it was doing a little raining out there i didn't say well you know they probably figured out how to make it rain just on on on the african-american community hey this racist had this is racist right it's a belief that nobody else possibly confronts these issues whatever that issue may be which is fundamentally false now again but the counter argument would be the black community faces it at disproportionate levels whether it's you know okay so i had a discussion recently uh with a friend and we were talking about there's a higher there's a higher um either i can't remember what it was either infant mortality or or a mother fate fatality rate post birth and uh there's a higher rate in you know in the third ward and um you know and i'm like well there's probably a lot of complicated reasons for that some of which might be behavioral prior to birth some of you know who knows there's it's something that needs to be looked at for sure um and uh but the answer was well it's clearly systemic racism and i'm like well what do you mean by that and and well education people don't you know well well the argument was behavioral choices are are 100 a caused by systemic racism and this sort of blew my mind i can't wrap my head around that but but that was that's the case being made because the argument goes behavioral choices are a result of poor education and poor education as a result of of intergenerational poverty which is a result of of redlining and and things like that so so how do you respond yeah i think they're overthinking you're from you're from this area so let me tell you let me tell you really where i was born in fifth ward you know which is all black community and i was born in uh all black hospital and i was born in the 60s i was born in 1961. you don't look that old and thank you my friend that's you're so kind yeah but uh i was uh and i attended i lived in all black community and i attended all black schools and i have three degrees from historically black colleges and let me tell you racism is not our number one problem in the black community the public enemy number one is is is ignorance education see that's public enemy number one but it didn't just start now i mean if you look at the prophet jose he said my people perish for what the lack of knowledge and so what we have to do now is be open to education and appropriate education carter g woodson in 1935 in his book the miseducation of the negro doctor dr carter g woodson said hey we're being miseducated education is a problem in our community in 1935. if you read his book today you it it'll sound like dr woodson is talking to you in this very moment yeah you know we have to be educated on the right things the reason why i got a doctorate degree in education because i saw that there was a correlation between a failing education system and a thriving criminal justice system yeah and so but that's not the onus does not lie on race let me let me be very clear it doesn't there's white people are not making us not be educated and but that's the argument right it's like the uh like the yeah the the system has created a situation where you can't get educated you might want to but you just can't and what do you say yeah but but that's that that is that is not the truth it because right now if you look at at hisd hisd the the chairman of the school board is an african-american female if you look at the the congress person for that area it's going to be an african-american female if you look at the county commission the african-american males you look at the the state reps they're all african if you look at the city council members they're all african-american so all all of in the mayor so if you have a whole city of leaders in every political subdivision that are african-american then why is appropriate education still a problem in the african-american community and by the way that's the same case for a lot of major cities sure sure a lot of sure well you just described but baltimore you know yeah chicago but here's my big here's my big argument this has been my big argument and folks up in austin will tell you this is my big argument crt has sucked all the air out of the room how many people know what cte is we know career and technical education that's right [Laughter] i know but yeah it's so important career technology so important right now 95 of the students who participate as what we call concentrators take two or more cte courses 95 of them graduate and of that 95 percent for those folks who think that they're just learning trades and not going to go to college of that 95 70 go on and get a post-secondary education wow as a stackable on the certification that they receive so when we have high dropout areas what we call what we call dropout factories or that create the school to prison pipeline why aren't we opening up the door and promoting and pushing career technology education that has been my fight for 20 years we have a pretty we do a pretty decent job of that in texas it could certainly be improved i mean i fully agree i mean i you know i encourage people all the time you know you you some a four-year degree in liberal arts might work for you okay it worked for me then again i was also planning on going in the military i was doing rotc so but you need a skill and and you know what maybe don't pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for it and or a lot of debt for four years you can get that skill in six months and then make 75k welding pipes let me tell you something we do an excellent job in texas we do a abysmal job in houston okay okay and in dallas and in fort worth and in san antonio so the major cities and in austin urban centers yeah we do suburban areas have really exceptional programs around houston exactly but so inner city but if you if you look over if you look over in in representative allen's district now she she has a doctor in education too and she she comes out of the education sphere space you know she's very close with the teachers union so that that means they don't want very much change but if you look at her district less than ten percent of the students in her district engage in cte nine percent one of the lowest in the state of texas but sunnyside is also in her district which has been named the sixth most dangerous neighborhood in america to live in where the crime rates are high dropout rates are high student success is low why aren't we changing the mindset out there saying look not every kid even wants to go to college and we're trying to survive in high school let alone think about college exactly and so why not open up the trades and say look what we'll do is have paid internships and paid apprenticeships for those students who are excelling in the trades and bring industry back in and connect it in those areas so that we can so that kids can graduate and if they want to go right into industry go right into industry if they want to go to college and university go there but don't go to prison i want to ask you two questions somewhat related but very different answers so what what causes again you know just going back to the source of a problem um you said you know we haven't figured out how to how to get better development in in these or get better education to change the culture of education in these communities why is that is it is it crime is it broken families you know what what is the source there then my the second question is what kind of legislation policy changes will we need to get to what you're talking about where where kids are actually it sounds like they have the option to do cte but they but they don't take it up so how do we change that i'm gonna ask the first answer is very short you know and the first answer is leadership that's the answer and uh because i asked that same question when i was working on my doctorate degree with the former u.s secretary of education i did my internship under dr rod page and i asked dr page the same question you just asked me and he looked at me and he said leadership he said number one you have to change leadership or you have to change the mindset of leadership because if you have all of your leaders saying that you should prepare your kids to go and get a college degree you know a bachelor's master's and doctorate degree otherwise your fair education is a failure so all of the all of the policies that come out of our leadership on every political jurisdiction is telling the kids become college-ready nothing is saying really nothing is saying become career-ready yeah you see because what happens if i don't go to college which which it has never been the case for education to send everybody to school and get a degree in liberal arts and sciences the the foundation of education is to do one thing and one thing only is to prepare america american students to provide a highly trained and highly skilled workforce for america period yeah in every field of human endeavor that includes plumbing that includes uh electrical engineering that that include that includes welding construction every field of human endeavor but we decided to leave off that that that portion and elevate liberal arts and sciences right and so what we end up having is a whole bunch of kids not dropping out of high school not becoming college ready and then the ones who get there still not college ready so they drop out of college on a big debt that they cannot pay yeah so that leadership is number one cultural change yes now policy side we have a bill right now house bill 1032 that will provide paid apprenticeships and paid internships for the students who are already taking uh cte classes oh great right i love that and so no additional money only thing it does it allows the districts to use some of their cte money to do paid apprenticeships and paid internships that bill right now just received a date on the calendar last night well you know what happens at the end of this week really time is running out yeah it's a center die week yeah but i watched i watched in the house on the house floor debate critical race theory which which hb 3979 is great deal which stops any of our teachers from teaching that one race is superior to another that's a beautiful bill they they debated on the house floor seven hours on the house floor seven hours on the senate floor wow right it shouldn't be that contentious yeah this is a classically liberal value but you know what it was bittersweet it was a bittersweet uh moment for me the sweet moment for me was to hear dr king's words being being mentioned on the house floor and on the senate floor over and over and over again his words when he said he he wanted one day for his four children to grow up in a world that where they were not judged based on the color of their skin but by the content of their character that was i think they said that about 900 times if you on both floors but here's the thing it was said by members of the republican party who were mostly white males and the bitter part was to see african-american and hispanic legislators and lawmakers fighting against it they don't believe it anymore you know and and so it and i guess look if i'm trying to to steel man their argument and to give them the benefit of the doubt here what they'll what they'll say unfortunately they've gone well beyond this argument right for them it truly is about race doesn't nothing else matters but you know the more reasonable side of their argument would would say the reason that you have a high dropout rate and is is you know you're coming from a fatherless home it's a high crime area this kid has no chance so the content of their character is is is lessened by that reality they have no chance at education so we have to do something now whatever that something is is it gets a little more unclear it's usually just spending more money on welfare or something but they are doing something they are doing something you know what they're doing they're keeping the school the prison pipeline open they're doing something i mean you know some of their arguments to me have been you know well dr johnson you have a a doctorate degree i said sure i do i said but here's the story dave my friend david and i grew up on the same block now his parents both were college educated people his dad was a principal in high school and his mom was a school teacher and they lived on the corner david loved drafting and he loved metal shop my parents neither of my parents finished high school so my parents were from the from the farm in louisiana they migrated to to houston so my my parents were both trades people you know my my dad drove a truck and my mom my mom did uh interior and custom interior designer custom drapes but they put us in the community around a lot of people who were highly educated people and so i thought hey i have to get an education right so i said well look i'm going to get a i'm going to get a athletic degree or an academic degree a scholarship i got to get a scholarship because my parents can't afford to send me to college but david loved drafting love metal shop so we graduated and hughes tools had a program at our school so david interned and he did apprenticeship with hughes tools and the whole nine yards so when we graduated david went to work for hughes twos and i got a basketball scholarship so i went to play basketball in college so when i came home my sophomore year i put my stuff up and i said hey i'm gonna go tell my mom i'm gonna go holla at davis so i went down the street i knock on the door miss ray baron comes the door and uh i said hey is david home i'm home for college she said yeah he's at home i say hey let him know i'm here she said no he is he's at his home i say david david has a home she said yeah davis bought his first home but i'll call him and tell him you're here and so david comes over this is probably before your time he comes over back in the 70s man custom vans was a thing you know he has this brand new custom van man and this i mean it's decked out in every kind of way and i looked i said wow i should have took drafting and metal shop that's a good argument for the tech but i guess what i'm trying to get at is is like the the communities that are that are really having problems right like you said you know the place with the fifth most dangerous place to live in america you know so what are the underlying causes there from a policy perspective you know whether we've hit education pretty well what else needs to be done right because kids can't concentrate in school if they've got a broken home life if they're they're worried about being recruited by gangs or gang shootings whatever it is what are the series of things we need to think about uh again the left just wants to blame it all on systemic racism and ghost hunt right we'll look into the past well you can't change the past so you do have to look to the future at some point and so and you know and in republican in republican circles we talk about opportunity zones school choice this is some of it we talk about community policing um you know when you look at the data overwhelmingly it's overwhelming that the primary cause of all problems whether it's the going to prison bad education it's fatherless homes so how and that's an overwhelming problem the black community so how do we how do you deal with it how do you do that well the first thing you know i was running for public office and uh running against one of your colleagues i was running against sheila jackson lee and so i was running for public office and i was out canvassing the community and i canvassed sunnyside and so a group of the gang members saw me and i passed out my stuff you know and uh and so they had some questions for at first they were surprised to say hey man we're so surprised to see you you're out here you don't you know how dangerous this community is i say yeah yeah i grew up in fifth ward though so it's just as dangerous so and uh and so they said well they got real comfortable with me i told them a lot about jobs and stuff like that so i said look and i knew that they were selling drugs i said well look let me ask you guys a question i said if i were able to give you something equal to or better than what you're doing to make a living would you put down what you're doing and pick up what i bring to you that's better and and legal and they looked at me and said dr johnson it doesn't have to be equal to a better i would stop if i could get something else you see these are young folks see when david and i were in school i came out of school in 1979 1979 the state of texas only had 17 state prisons by the year 2000 it had 137. so we built 120 prisons but what did we do we took vocational education out of our high schools okay and then we shifted it over to community colleges thinking everybody was going to go to community college but if you google right now the average age of a community college student is 28 years old and usually somebody coming back maybe yeah knock the heads got a felony going through and said well i better go learn to trade well we had that in high school interesting and and so we had and i when i got ready to graduate it was three things say hey are you going to go to college or are you going you're going to the military or you're going to work for somebody nobody said you're going to jail and so at that time you know we thought about family and my i grew up in all black neighborhood right here in houston guess what i didn't know anybody who didn't have a mom and dad at home yeah what changed in the last few decades so you mentioned one thing i mean career technical education high school has changed a lot a lot the pathway the pathway to honest employment changed see in 19 around 1982 they took that out of high schools and guess what happened in the 1980s crack cocaine all those things seeped into inner city communities and that became an employment for individuals you mentioned in my bio that i had a drug treatment program for inner city boys in fifth ward fifth ward on lowndes avenue for 13 years well i came back from the army and i saw that crack cocaine had taken over our communities so that became the war that i entered into yeah that's the reason for the for the master's degree in clinical psychology and the license in marriage and family therapy and licensing chemical dependency counseling was to treat my community and i and i had a 51 bed facility so they stayed there on the campus with me and it was it looked like a boot camp because i had come out an army and i brought that same military discipline to it but the the deal is i learned that 95 of my boys which i only took and i had an agreement with the courts here judge uh eric and dale at that time was the juvenile main juvenile judge here in town and he would say look if you can't survive a golden [ __ ] i'ma send you to jail and so i would tell him only send me the bad worst boys here in town and so with those young men i found out something none of them maybe maybe two percent but 98 were not addicted to ingesting drugs they were selling drugs you see when we took that employment and that skills training and all that stuff out of high schools and we le and we told everybody to go to college 50 of those guys went straight to the streets yeah and they started getting their cte on the streets and they started getting their paid internships and paid apprenticeships on the streets that's why house bill 1032 is so important that's up right now right this very second today if if they wanted to get that thing to the floor and vote it out they could do it but if a couple days go by you know that's over until two more years are you optimistic on i'm not following that you know what i'm very optimistic because at every stage of the bill people have told me well rich don't don't don't raise your hopes up too high it may not get to the house floor it made it to the house floor and then it made it off the house floor well rich don't make hold your hopes up too high but we keep pushing for that bill and that's a that's the thing that passed past the house in the senate yeah it passed the house in the senate passed out of the senate uh committee on education now it's you know a date on the calendar will it get heard i'm calling people and telling everybody to call uh lieutenant governor patrick and and make sure it gets a hearing on the floor if people get a chance to hear it i know that it'll get beyond the bipart bipartisanism that's going on because the polarization between the democrats and the republicans is there but this is a bipartisan bill we have democrats and republicans on it and uh and i'm hoping that it makes it through i hope so too i mean apprenticeships are they're just a proven way to to to get that skills training and to get people on the on the right track um you know i think that makes a lot of sense you mentioned you've been talking about how we expanded prisons and a lot more people in prisons you know what were your thoughts on generally did we did we overpopulate the prisons you know the room for criminal justice reform were we is that is that part of the long-standing problem that that is a part of the law well and re-entry you know re-entry is a big deal if you want to talk about the positive side if we could look at reducing recidivism rates and by using tools like re re-entry and but the the key to that is going to be industry the key to most of that's why you know that's why so many of us became so in love with with president trump was because president trump said hey i'm gonna give you guys a way to go to work and make a living and be decent you know make a decent honest living with integrity see when you're when you're going out trying to get welfare and you're begging you don't have integrity there's no dignity yeah yeah you see what i'm saying you know grumbling for something to eat you know those kinds of things but but when when president trump came in and everybody initially the first time i'm gonna be quite honest in 2016 i didn't vote for president trump you know because i was like man i didn't know much about president trump and i said this guy he's an outsider man he's not gonna be able to know how to work the system you know he's a you know he's bold he's strong like you know like we like him but you know but after that man after i watched him for a little bit and i started him to see him do the things that he said he was going to do i said wait a minute this guy is doing exactly what he said he's going to do yeah then i watched him a little bit longer i said this guy is really making it happen then i became a fan you know and i not only became a person who was going to vote for him i went out and told other people look this guy is really making it happen i don't a lot of those other guys talk the good game he is really doing exactly what he said he's going to do he said he's going to approach criminal justice reform we couldn't get criminal justice reform touched in eight years under under president obama but here come president here come president trump not an insider but an outsider and he gets the the first step act passed yeah that was huge and what do you it was huge and um you know as it is somewhat more especially in our libertarian side of conservatism i don't think you should you know we should lock people up that we're afraid of not people that we're mad at that's i think that's a good philosophy to stand by if you're not a danger to society it's unclear to me why we put you in jail and yeah and you're right but here's the thing 80 of the guys who are locked up in texas are there for non-violent offenses yeah well the what what some people tell me on that one is what often happens is they did commit something that was violent but they got it uh bartered down to a lesser charge you know in the negotiations so you know the the the data the data is mixed on it um and one of the problems i want to ask you about too is is in houston there's a lot of judges letting people out without bail and then we see that uh that person committed another crime and it's the thing is is those crimes are generally committed in um you know lower income neighborhoods like those are the people hurt by these criminals that really should be in jail i mean like they held somebody up at gunpoint that's a person we're afraid of not a person we're mad at right put them in jail yeah i don't know and in this kind of no bail again it's it feels like a very false sense of compassion this this bail reform movement that's happened across the country and crime has skyrocketed and it's not it's not in the white suburbs where crime is skyrocketing okay it's it's in inner city communities and they're the ones that were hurt the most by this but it's it's democrat politicians pushing for it and that's who represents these people so yeah and and one of the things that we we go over through it a lot of times and i've had this these discussions with my colleagues uh at tppf right on right on crime we we look at say an honest guy right on this guy had some traffic violations uh and we put this guy in jail and he loses a job and because he loses his job he loses his family he loses everything and he's still in jail uh for traffic violations okay maybe that's a guy we need to let out and try to work with but you have this other guy who everybody in the neighborhood knows kill so-and-so and kill this person and selling drugs and you put them in jail and because they can afford to pay the bail they're out in in two days so the community says look man the system is messed up you know here's here's dan over here dan is just an honest guy but you know he couldn't pay the ticket so and he couldn't take off work to go to the court because he take off work you're gonna lose his job so he didn't go to court so they got a warrant so now he gets picked up and he still loses his job yeah and so dan gets really messed over with the with this with the bail system but here's oh richard over here you know he he's he's selling drugs on every corner and everybody know in the community knows they're scared to say anything you know richard over here he didn't kill two or three people and everybody's scared to say anything the police pick him up and they see everybody see him back out in two days yeah you see so is there room for for reform absolutely we want to keep the the people like you said the people who are dangerous they need to stay in jail and the people who are not dangerous they need to be worked with on these little fines on how they how they're going to be able to make maybe 25 a month or something because a lot of these people just making ends meet right you know and a lot of that it's up to the judge's discretion um you know and how they interpret those those statutes and you know i guess the solution and a lot of this is at the state level this isn't something i necessarily would be dealing with right but um it's worth talking about because i have seen those that crime rate skyrocket every every police officer tells me the reason is is because of bail reform um in some communities it's because they've defunded police uh luckily that didn't happen here in houston although we don't have a lot of police compared to major cities so let me ask you a question though how many people and i think this would be interesting for us to look at how many people do you see that are out there committing these these tough crimes mm-hmm in the community how many are very small amount well i'm saying this how many of them do you see that that are actually construction workers oh yeah how many of them do you see that are welders who are out there have a job they're going to every single day right right you know see one of the things that that you and i i mean i had a friend of mine who who who developed this lock you know and got a patent on it and so he came to me and he said well hey man you know i want to i want to see if i can get the military to buy my lock you know uh yeah i said great let's go to fort hood and talk to some people over fort hood so we went to talk to people at fort hood and they said well look our biggest problem is not folk breaking in folk houses you see because everybody here got a job yeah you see yeah so when you're in a place where everybody has a job yeah crime goes down yeah and see when i came home from the military that was the only thing that i really did not like about civilian life because you could actually be living next door to somebody as a civilian who's unemployed in the military everybody you live next door to everybody you live around everybody you encounter have a job and so they're not thinking about how to go rob the px yeah but the commissary that's true you see you see what i mean and so only thing i'm saying to you is i know that we we look at health care we look at we look at education housing uh we look at uh being able to take care of families most of that is solved by having a job that's absolutely right i mean when you're looking at core solutions right where do we and then it's a pyramid up from there um you know what it's it's sort of the maslow's hierarchy of needs sure and those basic needs are met by simply having a job and that that's a mental need too and the sense of dignity like like you said and then you can morbidly afford these other things um whether it's healthcare education housing you know you don't worry about housing because i i mean i can go get a house i mean i work every day you know uh most most jobs that you'll have will have will provide some sort of health care on the job you know yeah see those things so when all these social injustices that people say are going on well black people are are affected disproportionately by housing affected disproportionately by health care effectively disproportionately by this or that well look let me get skilled up the way we did back in the 70s i call it back to the future you see what's so fascinating is racism was so much more prevalent in the 70s than it is now and yet we we have what it just seems like we have more problems with it now i think we had more racial segregation than than we than we than we had in terms of of racism you know because we were more segregated because when i when i first went to to high school i was one of the first groups that would bust over from wheatley instead of going to wheatley we went to fur high school so that was the first time they really enforced uh integration and uh and it was and and most people say well you know well those people didn't want you there this that another no the biggest problem is the folks in our community didn't want to go there yeah the folks in our community still wanted to go to wheatley and uh and so there was a lot of strife behind that but over time everybody settled in and became friends and started working together and before you know it everybody graduating together in the whole nine yards but but what we have right now is a small group of folks who have elevated a theory of ignorance to a level of national proportion critical race theory is a theory of ignorance yeah and it enforces segregation too it's stupid i mean there's there's it's a stupid thing to follow you know because that means that with all of my education all of my experience and all of my wisdom i narrow everything down to a skin color right which i know that to be crazy you know it i mean in the military we're there together i mean i met guys from all walks of life you know all nationalities working toward one goal and that is to protect and serve you the interests of the united states of america man and so basically for a guy like me to reduce my thinking down to everything that goes on in my life has something to do with the color of my skin is a stupid thing for me to think about yeah and and you've written about this the how appalling it is when you see this movement towards you know segregated uh dorms segregated graduations and you gotta ask yourself what is that what is the point of this isn't this isn't this a reversal of progress why did why did morton die why did martin luther king die not so he could be more segregated right you know what i mean you know why what was harriet tubman fighting for what was booker t washington fighting for you know what was frederick douglass fighting for what were all the folks whose shoulders upon which we stand who made great contributions to this american idea why did they live and die man if we're gonna go back and say you know you're white and i'm black and you stay over there and i stay over here and you know i think i'm better than you and you think you're better than me because of the color of our skin and not because of the content of our character and the way that we think operate and and and participate in this american idea so we're going back to education um school choice isn't something we talked about we i think we've we've uh beaten the hell out of the dead horse on technical education and and vocational training and why that's important and i love that i mean it's huge passion of mine as well um but uh school choice you know it's um i'm personally in favor of it uh but but it is a decision that happens not even at the state i mean it's a regional decision oftentimes and that's where all the mess starts happening because you know the school it's it's walk us through the politics of school choice it's got overwhelming support in the black community because it's a very easy concept to understand if i don't like how my kids doing here i can just move them to a different school how about that but but teachers teachers unions don't like it schools don't like it because the money does follow the student they feel like if they have a failing school then they lose money then their school is even worse and the parents who and the students who are stuck there have even worse outcomes so that's their argue their counter argument to it so we'll walk walk us through the politics of it yeah i you know i've coined the phrase parental freedom uh and and school choice is is parental freedom parents having the the right to choose the best possible educational options for their kids you know and and to take away my parental freedom i had this argument with a friend of mine he's a lawyer he used to be a dean of law school and i said look what's wrong with parents having the the freedom to make the best possible choices for their own kids education he looked at me and he said richard they don't know any better i said they don't know any better and i said now my two parents my two parents never finished eighth grade but my two parents worked hard and put me in a neighborhood around educated people and they sacrificed for me so what you're telling me is that you know better than they do and i became a doctor and a veteran went to the military did all that i said i can tell you this and i told them i said look man that's the biggest problem in the world right there is elites think that they know better than the parent knows i got four kids and i know you probably love kids to death but you're not gonna love my kids more than i do yeah that's true you ain't gonna lie that's a job you're not gonna do you're not gonna outlove me with my kids yeah you see i'm saying so i am going to figure out the best possible option for my kids and and i often tell this story my uh my wife wanted my two kids to go to uh private school uh when we when they were very young always she said i wanted to go to private school up to the sixth grade and and so she put him in saint mary's uh over in third ward and and i said well we're paying these high taxes man i'm paying big school taxes you know and she said i want my kids to go i want the kids to go there they're going to get a budget a better education there and i was like well look you know we're not even catholic she said but i want my kids to go to school so that happens and i had to get a second job to help pay because i had to pay my taxes my full school taxes where i was living plus my full tuition for my kids to go to a private school and i and i came up with this brilliant idea i was like why can't some of the money that i'm paying over here follow my kid that would take alleviate some of the burden from me a voucher of some sorts anything yeah you vouch your piece of paper anything um but it didn't happen so then i became a a a proponent for school choice at that time because i said i'm being denied an opportunity to send my kids somewhere because at that time i was working i wasn't dr johnson i was working on a doctorate and she didn't have an mba she was working on one yeah and so we were struggling but we had kids so we wanted to put them in a best possible position that we could but what if my dollar could have followed my kid yeah i mean my two kids that would that would have made things so much better for me and uh and so i became a an av an advocate for school choice and and and for the dollars following the kids because if if you if you if you're locked into a zip code and you can't afford to send your child somewhere else then you have to send your child to a dropout factory which most of the kids who most of the folks who go to tdc if you check their zip codes they're coming out of them same areas yeah and so those folks are locked in to a a system that is failing and for the school for the for the teachers unions to fight that battle and keep those folks locked in there that's criminal uh yeah it is and look i and i get their point that it it defunds those schools but good but there's a way to good because it causes competition right you know what's going to happen when they're when their budgets start going down people they're going to start figuring out what these other folks are doing and they're going to start innovating and they're going to start changing and they're going to start making sure that student success happens when you start if you start seeing money leave your bank account the first day you're going to say wait what's going on i need to make some changes so those things that's free market when when the mark when you let the free market happen like that and that those dollar store leaving there those schools those schools will change and they will become more competitive what are some of the driving reasons of a you know a so-called dropout factory i mean is it one thing i've noticed over time is a complete lack of discipline in schools i was terrified of teachers growing up terrified i was suspended for the stupidest of reasons okay like you talk about injustice my goodness i wrote about it in my book it's it's a ridiculous story i'm not gonna get into it but uh i was terrified i felt like there was a high amount of discipline i felt like like teachers had the had the right to and they and the freedom to say like enough is enough you're disrupting class i don't get the sense that that's true anymore and now actually it's it's been labeled as racist to do that um so there's a few students that can completely destroy the learning environment for for other students i don't know is that the big problem or like what what causes this two things two things one is discipline the because you can't teach the class if you're scared of the class and um you know when i was in school um i went to the principal's office assistant principal's office and uh mr chaney said i see you have some discipline challenges and i said well they say i have some discipline challenges he said well have you ever met the board of education i said well i've never known i've never seen them before so he came out from the behind his desk they raised his paddle he said this is the board of education you get thrown in jail now he said you're about to meet the board of education and so uh so discipline has changed uh and and the other side of that is academic programming you know we don't we don't have those those uh vocational education i keep going back to that because so many different well it's it's incred it's invaluable in those inner city communities because those folks are looking for a way to make a living school has to be a way to make life so so they see this well there's what they're learning and they're like this is pointless yeah yeah it's it's no good i mean i'm not gonna do this and so i'm gonna go out here and make some money right now i'm gonna drop out yeah and when they drop out of education they drop into criminal justice and i feel like you can do both i mean you take a variety of classes throughout the day you can teach the classics and you know the things that you know we think you need a because i you know like geez i still believe in some kind of foundation of history and and you know but but you're right some of that has to be uh functional yeah these kids these kids are like these kids are like um they're like adult learners adult learners you have to have something a reason for them to do it you know if they don't have a reason to do mathematics and it doesn't lead it's not leading to anything to them it's not leading a job they're not going to do it yeah you know but they they'll become a street chemist and be a you know they'll be a mathematician on the street yeah you see because why there's a reason to do it but if if you're going to be a plumber you have to learn you have to learn percentages you have to learn decimals you have to learn fractions all those things the physics of pressure and all these things yeah all those things uh so if we would just get back into understanding why we need to educate kids and the main thing like you said before you can't be afraid of them when i my first teaching job when i came back from the army was at wheatley high school and i was so glad to get that job at wheatley because barbara jordan had had gone to wheatley mickey leland had gone to wheatley and uh wheatley was famous man for african-american leaders you know our current chairman of of the uh of the public education committee harold dutton representative dutton had gone to wheatley but when i got there man you know i found out it wasn't the same wheatley that they had gone to i mean it was crazy one guy came in with me and by lunchtime he quit he said look they can't pay me enough to stay here but you know i just come out of the army man i'd i hadn't even been out of army two months and i was just blessed to get that job and i was like hey man i went in there and everything like you know every unit has the m60 gunner so i was the m60 guy for my unit and uh so i was a really tough guy when i went in there and so these guys came in and i said look put the music off and sit down and be quiet so the word got around to school that i was shell-shocked and say you know that new guy mr johnson's shell shocked so go in there in this room be very quiet do exactly what he said so i ended up staying there but you can't be afraid of those those students my point uh and discipline is a point right is a big issue right now in those inner city schools yeah let's basically again like one one student can ruin the whole learning experience for the whole class it's not like everybody's a bad student you know it's just it's but one guy usually a guy yeah um boys are rambunctious what can you say oh yeah so you know i mean and it's it's important that we just sort of have a like a list of policies that work and and i think republicans need to lean into this a lot more and look like what what makes a community better technical education the things we can control because i can't control i i don't know what policy would possibly i could put in place that would that would reduce fatherless homes it's a big problem i don't know how to solve that okay so what else can we do a technical education community policing a better a better criminal justice system that that that encourages a life after prison if you even deserve to go to prison in the first place like some really putting some thought into that you know and and opportunity zones investment jobs jobs actually have to be available in a place and they're not going to be available unless it's safe right because no business wants to open up in an unsafe place and yeah but i mean if you look at texas prior to the pandemic prior to the pandemic texas had a 14 mid skill job level jobs level gap that means we had 14 percent more jobs than we had people trained to fill them yeah and that gap is only wide and since huge since the pandemic well unemployment insurance is killing businesses yeah so the workforce development and skill building and skilling up is is the mantra for the day and it's also the only way you get growth in the economy exactly and the main thing is really that's the only way you really build families because most of the most of the young ladies in the african-american community are not they're having children but they're not marrying these guys these guys out on the street see back in my day these guys either had a job military or going to college so we were marriage material you see and we we're somebody that they could be proud to take home to their father to their mother and say hey i'm going to marry richard richards going to the military i'm gonna marry richard richard's going to college right well you know if i come up if someone one of my daughters bring up a young guy saying i'm going to marry soy so he's hanging out on the street she can't bring her that that person up to her dad i mean and it'll be tough for them i have two daughters i have two sons and two daughters yeah and so it'll be very tough for them to bring somebody up to me that doesn't meet up the standard because they know their dad yeah you see uh and so basically if we if we in our community we had no choice we were going to one of those three places we wouldn't nobody was talking about going to jail and so young ladies then they were like hey they were proud of us and so that's why i fight so hard for those bills but we do have another bill sb 1365 senate bill 1365 which will clear the way for the for the commissioner of education to take over hisd because when a system is not working the education system the ultimate blame goes on the state because the bulk stops with the state legislature right in terms of being responsible for educating students in the state and so when they when a district is not working then it needs to be taken over so that it could be fixed yeah that's going to be a contentious one well it's very it's been very contentious it's extremely contentious but you know uh and i applaud uh chairman dutton for his leadership in that because he comes from those he came from fifth ward and so those folks have become comfortable with the school-to-prison pipeline yeah and he has he had the courage to step up as a african-american democrat and and file the bill and then uh senator bettencourt filed a bill on the senate side really and uh a democrat and republican working together to try to fix education in the state of texas i think that's great what is the just generally where can we improve on school choice in texas what's the state of the school choice debate in texas we're moving to needle north with school choice in texas and that's a good thing uh because you know and what i found out is most of our rural areas are not so big on school choice and i didn't i didn't anticipate that you know i thought that you know that most conservatives would would be strong backers and supporters of school choice but some of our rule area is because the school in their in their town is the biggest employer in their town they're not very big on school choice and so i think you know as we continue to educate people in the urban centers how important it is for for parents to have the ability to make those choices and for their children and and back that i think school choice is going to continue to move uh move forward it's it is contentious um the other reason i'm told by parents is like look we pay high property taxes for this great school and we we don't want a flood of new students i mean that's that's the other sort of not in my backyard kind of uh kind of mentality now you know so so yeah that's why it's contentious i mean it's uh it's the charter schools i mean you know i mean charter schools do very very well um in in in some of the uh some of the areas where schools are failing if you look at you look at kip kip did a great job if you look at what uh what mike feinberg and and and mattress max are doing mattress maca doing over there at uh gallery furniture right they have a really big vocational training right um program yeah set up we went and toured it not too long well before the pandemic it was great matches mack is a local hero yeah only for people from houston have been watching i've been since i was growing up mattress save you money i got to you know when i finally got when i got into politics and i got to meet him i was like i know you you know since i was a little kid yeah you money yeah he's such an incredible philanthropist i mean he really does amazing things for the community he cares a lot about the houston community and uh so one thing you've written about too is environmental justice this is uh this is right in my bailiwick i'm on the subcommittee for environment and climate change and the energy and commerce committees i'm always debating the climate change debate and um and energy now i like to call it energy justice because what what the argument goes environmental justice is about um they they use race to to forward their uh their so their preferred solutions with respect to climate change and these claims out there that poor people are adversely affected by climate change by air pollution this is generally evidence-free right they say poor people are more likely live next to highways i don't see how that's true given the highway system in houston for instance i live right next to a highway i don't we don't have anyway yeah i think we all know the truth on that and the other question i always ask them is where is it you they're like i hear from my democrat friends a lot they're like and there's a refinery right next to a low-income community i want to say where do you think they work you know like where is it you think these jobs are coming from before you just just take a hammer to this refinery that you don't like because of some religious adherence to your climate change mantra think about where these people work you know and what's worse for them you know this i mean it's it's it's it's it's frustrating i mean give me your thoughts on that yeah again i think you know ignorance is public enemy number one and uh and buying into a slogan of climate change is and thinking that if i'm making a difference here in america is going to save the planet uh not knowing that that all of the emissions in the united states only represent only represents 15 of the emissions around the world so if we stop admitting anything yeah we just go straight down to zero emissions uh the world if we don't stop china if we don't stop russia and we don't stop those other other other nations from doing what they're doing which they do exactly what they want to do and and and don't want to comply uh it's not going to make a big difference at all the stat to remember on this one is if all the not just the united states all developed nations stopped emitting right now and forever we would potentially and this is only potentially decrease the temperature in 2100 by 0.8 degrees fahrenheit so in other words nothing in other words in other words nothing exactly nothing really changes so it's a cost benefit and that's exactly the right place to start the discussion like what do you get from this when you when you destroy this industry and destroy those jobs that's the point that's what's the point what's the benefit that's the point there you know when we when we take ourselves out of the game economically you know what are you getting for it you know if you think education is experience is expensive try ignorance when you don't know it'll cost you what trillions and trillions yeah you know based on and you and you hear folks are going out there look we're going to we got 12 years left you know this is a lie i know you got 12 years you know we're talking about listening to the science i mean i i only use un intergovernmental panel and climate change data i only use the the data from the consensus and the data is and they lie about the data they just lie like there's going to be costs associated with climate change here and there it's it's you know it's it's not nothing but it's it's pretty damn close actually to you know here's another stat that's good to remember and 2100 if you know trying to adapt to climate change on its current trajectory uh will cost us about globally about four percent of gdp between four and five percent of gdp but keep in mind that's not four percent less than now that's four percent less than it otherwise will be when we have two to three times more gdp than we have now exactly so it's it's not nothing not a denier in any way and as i tell my democrat friends like i want to reduce global emissions i just have much smarter ways to do it let's invest in nuclear and actually exporting more of our natural gas resources because it's cleaner energy this isn't rocket science no no no and but but the the argument from the other side is going to always come up race yeah but it's your yeah we're talking about environmentalism it's like you're a racist no no no no i got a hammer yeah yeah you got the hammer here here goes the nail right here's the racist thing you know because i don't have when you don't have any other tools in your toolbox that's the only only thing you're going to run to and and the biggest thing on climate change i mean we have become energy independent under the last administration and moving toward energy independence meaning you don't have to go out and purchase oil from people who hate you yeah you know and so yeah matter of fact we're selling we're selling i mean we're we're we're selling and distributing all around around the globe now isn't that a better position to be in than the one we're reducing ourselves back to now in this current administration it makes all the sense in the world right right and then another thing is how many of us are going to put our cars up and don't drive them anymore until we can go get an electric car which is not cheap by the way well here's what i'm wondering you know all the lawmakers up on capitol hill that are saying that we need to go wind and solar and we need to get away from fossil fuels i'd be interested to see how many of them are all driving electric cars and their families all driving electric cars and all their friends all driving electric cars i would wager that they're not they're definitely not there's a large amount of hypocrisy but it's it's also it just it gets back to the question of what's the benefit here it takes about 20 000 miles of driving for that electric car to surpass or or use it to see the carbon benefits of it right because there's a large amount of carbon carbon intensive production that goes into making the electric car more so than a normal car so after about 20 000 miles you're getting less but so in the aggregate it's just not that big of a change and and this is why i look for where's our real pollution where's our real global emissions coming from india china coal burning facilities we should our entire we should have a massive project in america to just export more natural gas there that that that is cheap enough that that's cheap enough that they would buy it and it would work and this is not an impossible feat we have like endless reserves of natural gas under the ground in west texas it's it's massive let me ask you another question though how where do they get the electricity for to power up the electric cars coal yeah usually coal i mean it's just it's you know it's ridiculous right because i mean i don't want to make this i i do a lot of podcasts on energy since i don't want to make this my audience is used to listening to it but it's it's it's very frustrating it's easy to have this debate with them it is they can win it every time but that's why they go to race that's why we talk about that i'm saying yeah that's what i'm saying race then you know race is just a a you know uh what what is that uh racial environmental injustice in terms of racism look man that's that's just a tool that folks throw out when they they don't have the data to win the debate that's why it's important to talk about energy justice don't you want people to because you wrote about this if tppf um did a study showed if we went to a green new deal you'd have just over three thousand dollars in additional uh electricity costs per year so what does that do to an inner city family uh what is it what does it do in your gas prices like like a lot you know for higher income you don't really notice gas prices as much but lower income certainly notices it and why is there higher gas prices because here's why look i mean the pandemic didn't help right a lot of production stopped and it's hard to restart it but it's hard to restart it because there's a if you're an investor and you're looking at okay do i want to invest in this in this new um this new well to get more gas out of the ground i don't know because the buying administration hates this industry and is going to permit it to hell that's why you know so you're seeing less and less investment you know we look at the why did the grid fail in texas it's not necessarily because of wind or or renewables but it is because they have sucked up a lot of the investments over time we're not building new plants that are not weather dependent like natural gas coal and nuclear you build a bunch of nuclear plants you don't have that problem and so the solution is not more wind but if you look at our energy mix over time right now projected it's more wind and it's like that's all that makes you feel nice and fuzzy inside i suppose but when you gotta freeze or it's really really happens when the wind is not blowing when the wind's not blowing yeah they forget just weather events it's just sometimes the wind doesn't blow they're like oh we'll build a bunch of batteries yeah just going to build a bunch of batteries no you need to look more into battery technology you know like they're building a big battery facility tesla is um here in houston and it's like oh wow that's really cool like it's the future but it's like okay this powers ten thousand homes for like four hours right and then it's done so but who knows that though dan who see the general public done they they they don't know that unless they were engaging in in a conversation with us or some folks who are in the know they have no clue about that only thing they do is they watch channel 13 they watch or they watch msnbc msndc was that democrat group yeah and then you know cnn clinton network news you know unless they watch those and then they get all of their feedback from those from those channels and and they don't think about it it's opinion dudes it's not real news and and so folks are drilling them day in and day out with their opinions so that's why i like what you're doing with your podcast because you're you're seeking to get real information out to real people that's why we do it that's why we do it man um what other topics uh would you want to broach you know before we before we end is um yeah i think it's i think it's very important for us to to understand our history but not be only to learn from our history and move forward and to look forward booker t washington what i really would like for your your audience to know about booker t washington he's a remarkable man he lived 59 years and in 59 years he was able to create a university that stands to this day tuskegee university that educates thousands and thousands of people americans not just black americans but americans and booker t washington always sought to lift the veil of ignorance off of our from our f from our eyes so that we could see the truth and i would also like for him to to know that booker t washington collaborated with with folks who were very powerful folks who had like minds and same ideas no one knew that he collaborated with with rosenthal julius rosenthal to build the rosenthal schools 5 000 schools across america making sure that we educate folks in america no matter what the skin color was no matter what the race was to elevate you know the the educational level of americans and so at the end of the day we're all one nation you know e plurals nunem you know out of many one and we're no schisms no no separations uh among ourselves there is no one better than the other we have wonderful ideas and we have an opportunity in a country as great as america to explore those wonderful ideas and not just make america great again but keep america great as it's always been well thank you great great way to end richard appreciate you being on thank you my friend pleasure being here absolutely

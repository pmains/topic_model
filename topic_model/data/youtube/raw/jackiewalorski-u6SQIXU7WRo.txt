I felt a sharp pain in my groin, and went
to the doctor at the VA clinic, and he told me it was a muscle spasm. We were just fighting for him to get tested
differently, to have something else done. They used every antibiotic they had, and
nothing worked. They said, ‘we don’t know what’s wrong
with you.’ I knew what they were doing wasn’t working. I knew I was getting worse. He looked awful. I was in pain the whole time. To see somebody who was so strong, and
physically fit, and healthy look the way that he did…It was hard. Jackie Walorski took on the Veterans Administration
and demanded better care for Marine Corps Veteran Erik Olson. Erik wouldn’t be here if Jackie Walorski
hadn’t done what she had done. Walorski got Erik transferred to a better
hospital, with live-saving treatment. I would like Jackie Walorski to know she saved my life. We couldn’t say ‘thank you’ enough. I’m Jackie Walorski, and I approve this
message.

sent to revise and extend my remarks in opposition to this bill that doesn't create jobs but strips women of appropriate reproductive healthcare service madam Speaker I'm very pleased the yield to the distinguished lady from California miss Chu one minute gentlewoman from California is recognized for one minute HR 358 would stop abortion coverage for millions of women it allows doctors and hospitals to refuse treatment even if women will die without their help this bill is so extreme it prohibits a pregnant women with cancer from getting an abortion so radiation can save her life for those women every day and every week of treatment could be the difference between life and death if this bill passes we will see thousands more women abandoned by their doctors women like Stephanie who was pregnant at 19 weeks she came to the hospital with a 106 degree fever the whites of her eyes were filled with blood she was dying before her doctors eyes but the hospital considered the life of the fetus more important than the life of the mother as treatment until the fetus died because they delayed Stephanie almost lost her life this bill should really be called but don't protect the life of the mother act

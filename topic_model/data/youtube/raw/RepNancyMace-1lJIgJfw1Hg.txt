it's abhorrent that the radical left wants to transform our traditional infrastructure into their socialist vision and waste money on green new deal type of spending when we have enormous infrastructure needs and there can be a balance between infrastructure and environment there should be but this is just crazy it's ridiculous and it's it's infuriating right that right there south carolina representative nancy mace speaking from her car as she often does this time about president joe biden's infrastructure plan which is expected to be a part of the president's speech tonight in a joint session of congress now the president also expected to talk about his accomplishment during his first 100 days in office and so will congresswoman mace who joins us now congresswoman welcome back to wake up america hey good morning and thank you for having me on thanks for joining us and let me ask you firstly what are you expecting from the president this evening well i'm expecting to hear a lot more spending tonight um i just read about another two trillion dollars that president biden is going to spend tonight and this is the aoc wing of the party taking over the presidency essentially there's been more damage done in the first hundred days of president biden's administration than i thought possible in four years and when i add up all the different plans that he's coming out with in proposing whether that's the covid relief infrastructure slash jobs plan slash now family plan we're talking about seven to ten trillion dollars of spending just this year alone now think about this last year when we were in the middle of the pandemic and trying to figure it out we spent about three to three and a half trillion dollars on covet relief but this is this is on top of additional covert relief and trillions of dollars in new spending and there's no way you can afford this without the largest tax hike in american history in congresswoman it wasn't just spending in the first hundred days it was also a lot of executive orders in those first few days in office what were your thoughts on that my thoughts were you know looking at the leadership that we have in the house of representatives and nancy pelosi that really this is her party this is aoc's party and president biden is just living in it um they have taken a sharp left turn and done so much damage and the border crisis created by the biden administration and endorsed by so many far-left members we've continued to see violence when we've heard talks about unity in this country we're a divided nation and there was a real opportunity to come together and work together i'm a republican who's willing to reach across the aisle i know that my conservative ideology is compassionate there are a few ways that we can work together but it's just not happening right now and we are hurting the american worker and we're hurting american families now not many freshmen members of congress helped pass legislation in their first term let alone in their first 100 days and you accomplished that in just 50 days so can you tell us a little bit about your bipartisan speaking of reaching across the aisle but your bipartisan criminal justice reform bill right i i am a conservative who loves my kids and my country one of the the ways that i have been successful in reaching across the aisle working with democrats as a state lawmaker now as a member of congress are on criminal justice reforms and we i'm a constitutional conservative and believe in the right to due process and i passed legislation out of the house of representatives on my 50th day in office that protected due process and constitutional rights for those in our prison system and so that's an issue where conservatives for republicans and democrats can work together i i promise that people when i got elected that i would that i would do that find those ways to work together and i did it in my 50th day in congress i'm going to continue to do it but what i will not do is i will not break our economy i will not um i will support the american worker i'll support those that want to go back to work um it's not it shouldn't be what can your government do for you but what can you do for your country and for your government and we've just gotten so lost over the last several decades and this year in particular i'm just stunned it's insane and so expectant of what the government can give us versus this year where we've seen some people on one end during the pandemic really working hard to try to make it through and help their families and others not doing quite so much now congresswoman you've been really busy yesterday i believe we have a look at the tweet you sent out about all your accomplishments over the past just to narrow a few 2 million return to taxpayers 1 000 cases close pushing for benefits for veterans supporting south carolina transportation needs voting against wasteful spending but also protecting our environment that's just to name a few what are your big plans for the next 100 days and beyond to work as hard as i possibly can former president trump galvanized millions of americans who felt like their voices were left behind they're hard-working americans and i promised that i would put my district first and despite the divisiveness of washington dc which i've never seen anything like it i have a front row ticket to seeing the dismantling of our freedoms and our constitution right now my focus has been what i can do is help the people in my district that have enormous needs and we returned almost two million dollars to taxpayers in the first hundred days through irs refunds the irs is as we've been reading has been holding up refunds for people we've been doing that um also helping with va benefits social security benefits all those things that help those who are struggling and those in need and i promise nobody's going to work harder than i will for the people of my of my district my state and my country congressman we have about 30 seconds left you talked about you having that front row seat as we approach tonight and many people anticipating what the president will say we know he's going to be discussing that infrastructure plan on one hand people are saying you know what our infrastructure could use a lot of work maybe not as much money as we're putting into it being that you do have that front row spot what is it that the american people need to know about what our focus should be right now our focus should be working on the issues that are important to the american people infrastructure is one of them but we can't have the largest tax hike in american history to afford to pay for all these things people want to earn their success they don't want to be taxed to death and that's what's going to happen in this country because somebody somebody's going to pay that bill and that's going to be on the backs of hard-working small businesses and americans who desperately want to be back and work and businesses want to be successful and if we if we tax them to death which is what we're going to do what they buy demonstration is going to do there'll be fewer jobs at lower wages and that's untenable for us getting out of the pandemic it's not going to be possible

let's bring in house minority whip steve scalise to talk more about this congressman good to see you let's first of all play a little bit of a new nrcc ad that targets these vulnerable democrats when it comes to defunding the police listen here defund the police abolish prisons nancy pelosi and democrats in congress have lost their minds and now they're calling for violence ordered it led to some big losses for the democrats in november of 2020 you expect this will be a winner again congressman hey john sandra it's good to be with you and look people don't want to see police defunded and in every community across america you see that the democrats for whatever reason have have just gone all in on this crazy idea but there's other things too i mean you've already seen what they're doing with opening our borders uh with just continuing a cow toe to china they won't confront china and then jobs in the economy continue to be a big issue and frankly when you go around the country every small business person you talk to says they're looking for workers and yet what you saw in that boondoggle the wasteful spending the corruption in that last spending bill that had very little over 90 percent had nothing to do with covet it's giving checks to felons in prison and all that kind of stuff green new deal that's killing energy jobs people are fed up with that kind of socialist agenda uh we're talking more about helping families get back on their feet round in the corner and covet getting kids back in the classroom where all the science says kids should be in the classroom but the liberals in washington want to just continue bending down to uh the these liberal unions that want to keep kids out of school so they're disconnected in washington from the reality and i think that's why speaker pelosi this socialist agenda she's pushing is out of touch with america congressman the violence that we're seeing across the america and some of these big cities like new york over the weekend a spike in the number of shootings that we saw it's it's it's horrific to pick up the paper and read the headlines as we come out of these weekend cities like chicago reeling from spikes and violence there as well so what is the plan what's the strategy for the gop heading into 2022 to use this defund the police movement against democrats well sandra we've always stood for safety and security you know both abroad and at home and i think that's being lost a lot of these mayors that are letting their cities get out of control with crime because they've actually gone down the road of defunding police with devastating consequences and when you see crime in a lot of these communities just getting more and more out of hand you're seeing people leaving droves look at new york i think new york state's lost over 300 000 people in the last year because they've had these radical shutdowns they've defunded police and people are fleeing and going to states that are are run with much more sane conservative leadership here in florida is where we're at having this conference things are open people are happy uh people are coming down and their you know their economies haven't suffered and their students aren't being denied the opportunity to go back to school so follow the science and also inject common sense and stop going after and attacking good police and trying to defund the police and undermine our national security congressman defunding the police is one issue funding everything else is another issue after spending 1.9 trillion dollars on covid relief and wanting to spend 2.2 trillion dollars on infrastructure the biden administration is going to be announcing before the speech to a joint session another 1.8 trillion dollars dedicated toward the american family's plan uh this spending spree i guess is the best way you can put it has drawn the attention of people like alexandria ocasio-cortez who said this at the biden white house the other day i do think that by demonstration and president biden has definitely exceeded expectations that progressives had uh you know i'll be fraying i think a lot of us expected a much more conservative administration yeah at the very beginning of this administration it looked like progressives weren't going to be too happy now they appear to be thrilled well that's because president biden is is governing like a drunken sailor when you talk about this spending i mean i got trillions and trillions of dollars and one bill was over 2 trillion this bill is going to be over 2 trillion who do you think is going to pay for this and this money is being barred from our kids and our grandkids from china and for what to pay people not to work to give money for all these green new deal kind of socialist ideas they're giving checks to felons in prison they're giving checks to people who come across the border illegally and hard-working people are sitting there going wait a minute they realize they're going to be paying more in taxes when bernie sanders is the budget chairman writing the bill on taxes does any american out there think it's not going to affect their pocketbook of course they do they know the price it's going to cost us jobs they're already running jobs off to foreign countries canceling the keystone pipeline was a gift to china to russia to saudi arabia what about american workers that's who we ought to be working and fighting for right now and those are the ones who are picking up the tab for all this reckless corrupt spending that we're seeing uh that that there's no one in sight right now from biden and pelosi but congressman you know you know the way that the the biden white house pushes back on that as they have said so many times before they tell the american people no one under making under four hundred thousand dollars a year will see their taxes go up you live in the great state of louisiana what do you tell residents there when you see these massive spending plans when you see all those zeros and you tell them their taxes will go up by how much right and that's the real question does anybody believe that their taxes aren't going to go up and oh by the way president biden's already broken his original pledge because he said it was going to be four hundred thousand dollars a family now it's going to be 400 000 a person and we know that's not even going to hold because they're spending uh just keeps getting more and more i mean they're doubling and tripling the amount of money that they're borrowing and spending and all on things that have nothing to do with infrastructure you look at the latest infrastructure plan more than 75 percent of that has nothing to do with roads and bridges and broadband and ports so again it begs the question what are they spending that money on and of course you look at the details it's the green new deal it's we will have a higher tax rate than communist china in america if biden and pelosi get their way and that means we have less jobs those entry-level workers the middle class that president trump was bringing back when we cut taxes those jobs will all start going away again i don't think that's what america bargained for when when joe biden ran and ultimately when you look at how they're governing in a very far-left socialist way america is still a center-right nation we don't want to see socialism come to our front door do one quick follow-up on that why does the stock market keep going up then with all those warnings and all that spending and the potential for taxes to go up how do you fathom that the u.s stock market just continues to go up down a bit at this very moment but at record highs yeah there's still a lot of money out there and i mean again when washington's printing trillions of dollars that gives you sugar high and i think we're seeing that sugar high but we all know i mean i've got young kids uh for anybody that has kids and they give them a lot of sugar on halloween night you all know what happens about an hour or two later it's not pretty uh and that day is coming all right fair enough steve scalise from the great state of louisiana appreciate it sir thank you thanks great being with you

well good afternoon everyone and welcome to our facebook live conversation on teaching during covet 19. for those of you who may have missed our virtual discussion last week we asked the top five questions my office had received from a parent's point of view about the upcoming school year but i've heard a lot from teachers over the past few weeks and specifically after our last discussion and that's why today we're going to take a different approach as we discuss the challenges our educators face as the school year starts during this public health crisis you know i'll be brief with this introduction since our two incredible panelists are experts on what teachers face in the classroom but i think we need to start by making it crystal clear teachers are absolutely essential not just during this pandemic but all year round and just like the millions of parents across our country who are weighing what's best for our families so are teachers no two teachers or nurses bus drivers custodians or paraprofessionals face the exact same circumstances in their home or a degree of risk of covet exposure and they deserve our respect whatever decisions they make just as much as we extend that same respect to our parents and their their context you know many educators are parents themselves uh some are even members of the sandwich generation caring not only for their children but for their elderly parents plus as many as one in four teachers have pre-existing health conditions that put them at a higher risk of serious illness if they contract covid19 so it's so important that we remain mindful of the very real dangers at play you know more than 180 000 people in our country have lost their lives and for many who have been infected they needed emergency care so this is a serious issue you know reopening plans that fail to address the risks of this super spreader virus will ultimately create anxiety and unsafe conditions for our teachers our students and parents alike in the same way that families have been encouraged to do what's best for them we should be encouraging teachers to do the same and we should be doing everything we can to accommodate their needs to teach students the safest way possible and that support needs to come from every level of government but frankly it starts at the top yet even as students prepare to return to or already back in school here in massachusetts and across our country we're still seeing the same reckless absence of leadership from this administration over the past two months alone we've seen the president and secretary devos threaten to withhold funding from schools unless they agree to reopen with full-time in-person instruction this fall while ignoring the fact that as many as 40 percent of america's school buildings do not meet the cdc's reopening guidelines because their ventilation systems need to be repaired or even replaced to make matters worse budget relief has been stalled in the senate despite the fact that without a federal response unprecedented state and local budget shortfalls will lead to teacher layoffs and deep cuts to education service some of which we're already seeing so this fundamental lack of leadership makes our response in congress and that of leaders in states like massachusetts all the more important to protect the incredible teachers who are tasked with educating our children this year and that's what we'll be diving into today and it's why i'm so thrilled to introduce our two guests who took the time to join us this afternoon the first is my friend and classmate in the u.s house of representatives my star colleague on the education and labor committee and the 2016 national teacher of the year congresswoman johanna hayes from connecticut johanna has been an absolute force in congress she's led on school safety ending student hunger erasing the student debt burden on our teachers even ensuring that our school buses are cleaner and safer so i want to welcome johanna and welcome you to say a few words well thank you congresswoman trahan and that was an amazing introduction i think you hit on every one of the points that i have been concerned about first as an educator and also as a mother i listen teaching is a profession that i loved that loved me back i have worked in the classroom for over a decade almost 15 years and i know that teachers do everything they can to keep their students safe so as they are going back into school it's very difficult to not be able to make that statement with fidelity you are safe here and that is just a a very dangerous place for teachers to be in and i am so happy that you are having this conversation at this critical time because i've seen my friends and colleagues go from the heroes that saved the nation to reshift reshifting their entire curriculum to virtual learning to making do with nothing to now selfish and not wanting to go back and that's just not fair that's just not fair and i've seen my colleagues go through this roller coaster time and time again but the fact that we could not close schools until we figured out how to feed kids and how to connect them to digital devices and we cannot open the economy until we figure out a solution for schools should remind teachers to remind people of how critically important teachers are and we really have to look at our work in it on our committee of education and labor as how do we make an investment into the future of education how do we make sure that teachers and students and parents and communities are supported with what they need and that they shouldn't have to fight for it these should just be basic you know this should be a basic conversation and when you talk about leadership you already know how i feel about that because the secretary of education should be leading the charge on this and making sure that teachers don't have to fight for these things the secretary should be fighting for them so thanks for having me lori oh absolutely and it's such an important frame and look your uh your experience as a teacher is only one aspect of what you bring i mean there aren't many members of congress who have school-aged children and are making you know that uh the decision for our for our kids as well and so i'm i'm looking forward to uh getting your perspective on all of these questions you know we're also fortunate to call i well i'm fortunate to call uh my next guest a friend uh randy weingarten hardly needs an introduction you know as the president of the american federation of teachers representing more than 1.7 million members her input uh and that of the aft has been essential in our work to strengthen protections for teachers on the education labor committee and her leadership extends you know beyond teachers it's the health and safety of our families our students and our workers so i randy i'm so grateful uh that you took the time to be with us here today and would love for you know to hear from you before we jump into the questions so both look both um you i should be respectful both you congresswoman trahan and congresswoman hayes are dear friends and we are you know we have different positions where we have been advocating for very much the same thing and i you know i was as as congressman hayes was talking about how teachers went from you know heroes to questioning about what they're saying and things like that i kind of pulled back what now is a very dog-eared um study that we put out on april 29th in and and we're all from the northeast at the height of covet in the northeast how to reopen our schools this was a month before cdc put anything out it's now you know the secretary of education has still not put anything out was before any other education groups put something out and the reason and it's on our website and the updates is are on our website and it's free for anybody who wants it my point is we understood that you cannot pit learning versus life and we wanted to try to figure out how to reopen schools so we never went through what we went through in march as they closed in a way that people were like oh my god what are we going to do now what is this virus and what has happened is that unlike any other country in the world maybe with the exception of brazil and india we don't really know what's happening in russia but all the countries of europe austria australia i mean um new zealand they've all figured out how to tackle the virus first and foremost before really trying to move to um you know to to from outside to inside and what's happening now is this is the first big move in the united states inside from outside and there's no national standards there's no resources to do this everybody's really on their own you have the effects of all the austerity that you just talked about lori about 40 of schools not having decent ventilation and you have and i would say that this is probably the worst you have a president and a secretary of education that has so mishandled it that mass become a political statement not a public health imperative mass are not about saving you mass are about saving someone else so you so so we are in a situation where every parent and every teacher is in that same agonizing choice of trying to figure out what to do for his or her or their families at the same time as we don't have all the safeguards or the resources in place so we could look at people eyeball to eyeball and say it's safe and and that's why you're having all of this agita all throughout the country and i want to give the house of representatives a lot of credit because you saw this and you made sure that there was another stimulus that really was directed to regular people that was the heroes act and you know nothing is perfect but you had enough money in there to stand up state localities in schools so we could have upgraded ventilation systems we could have the cleaning supplies now the sanitizers the soap in bathrooms for when you are washing your hands we could have had the digital equipment for virtual hybrid or in school we could have had the ppe but without any of that stuff the tents so that you could have actually had outdoor instruction and so what's happened is that school people are trying to do what they normally try to do figure everything out by themselves but this time we're in the middle of a pandemic and so that is why we have basically taken the position if it's not safe we're going to say it obviously we want to be in school obviously we all know that remote is not a substitute but i don't care how many hate mails i get if it's not safe we're going to say it and we're going to make sure that people know that to the extent that communities listen to us we are not going back to school buildings if it's not safe because we are protecting communities we are protecting kids we are protecting families and we are protecting ourselves no it's so important i mean look the reason why we acted on heroes so early was to give ourselves the lead time to prepare i mean this doesn't happen in a week or two week time frame uh so we have a lot of questions and you like i want to want to get to as many as we can so in yeah don't forget we not only did we passed the heroes act we moved on the moving forward act which was another i think 105 billion dollars that included school infrastructure yeah was ventilation and air quality so on top of the the money that was allocated for education in the heroes act there is specific funding for infrastructure in the moving forward act that would address some of the schools and our most depressed communities and there isn't a single colleague of ours who doesn't have a sick building right for a school right that is you know uh presenting real challenges uh for students going back so you know in massachusetts the and it's different state to state but the decision regarding whether students and teachers will be remote in person or some hybrid has been pushed to each school district in some cases school districts have you know yet to make a decision because they've just surveyed you know parents and they're trying to figure out the logistics of all that so it's been incredibly difficult for teachers to plan for the year ahead on a personal level and a professional level so you know randy is president of the largest teachers union in the country and johanna is a former teacher what are the biggest concerns you have about these three different options and what are you hearing from teachers what are their what are their top concerns how long do you have and how many drinks can we have no i think that i can sum it up very quickly teachers number one concern that i hear about is safety their safety the safety of their children the safety of their families and their students families they recognize there are so many outliers that are so far out of their control and that sick kids don't this idea that school is just geography the building is just geography if kids are concerned that they're going to get their grandma sick or their parents don't have a job or you know they don't feel good and all of these other things that are happening they can't play with their friends they don't have they're not getting the hugs they were getting from their teachers before they left they're not going to learn in the same way we need to get the health care part of this under control i think that probably sums it up there's so many other things but just everybody is concerned about my district i have 41 towns this pandemic has revealed so many disparities in education the gaps are gaping there are some districts that where i know will not be able to uh have sound or any form of virtual or hybrid education because they really don't have the digital resources the teachers haven't been given the professional development which should have started taking place back in the spring to prepare people you know it it drives me crazy teaching is a profession people study and work their whole lives to get there my adult life was spent educating myself on how to teach children the fact that people think you just turn on a computer and teach is not how it works and and virtual learning requires a different skill set that needs to be practiced that needs to be learned that needs to be perfected so the fact that no investment was made in the people that have to now teach children means that children aren't getting what they need so all of those things have to come together and i just fear that there are some districts in my some communities and school districts uh in connecticut that no ma will not be able to do this without federal funding that lack the resources already the kids are already not connected it's going to be even more difficult and then the last thing i'll say and i'm trying to be really quick but again randy there's so much for all the people who are saying kids have to go back to school because they're they're they're depressed and they're sad and there's all of these things happening nobody's talking about and when they get there we are going to just make sure that we have trauma informed counselors and resources to meet them nobody's talking about that side so we have all these kids coming from the most traumatic event in their life they've been out of school for months they they've lost learning they have to reset and we're not even meeting them with the trauma informed support services for when they get on the ground because the expectation is the teachers will handle it so let me lift up i want to i want to kind of um build on what um congresswoman hayes just said but let me just first say that both of your states have done something that is quite innovative but you see in that a bunch of of all the problems number one the the sel training that um the governor and the unions and um uh several of the um that was announced a few weeks ago um funded by you know one of the great philanthropists in connecticut um over 10 000 teachers opted in connecticut opted for that trauma informed instruction and professional development as soon as it was offered as a way of kind of approaching and responding what to what representative hayes just said and one of the things that was actually done in massachusetts that new york city just followed and that i've actually lifted up a lot because i thought it was really wonderful was an acknowledgement as as as as johanna just said that teaching remotely is really different it is not nearly as good as teaching in person but it is really different and requires a different skill set and requires different practice because you're engaging kids differently and developmentally you're engaging kids differently you really need to have the pd it's not just buying k12 ink off the shelf it's not like k12 inc did a really good job or any of these other tech companies did a really good job beforehand you really have to have the the confidence to deal with it and to deal with remote instruction differently so i would actually say that there are so many issues starting with the arc of will we be safe and given that 40 percent of covid is spread asymptomatically will i be bringing covet home to my family that is the question i hear over and over and over again but the issue that i think has has been that i hear the the value i hear a lot confidence and trust the fact that there is inconsistent information the fact that there is lack of transparency the fact that we know that kids get covered we know that kids spread covid we know that older kids can spread covet as much as adults we know that younger kids kids can have more covet infection in them than adults we're seeing these charts so then when you see a devos or a trump keep with the tropes that say oh don't worry about kids this is part of what creates great anxiety for people because you know does lori have glasses on or not oh no she doesn't have glasses on she clearly has glasses on but you just have this level of anxiety because of the lie that makes this chao chaotic and confusing and i would say that that is from my perspective that has been the biggest problem and the last thing is there's been such a focus on logistics of course logistics are important of course we should be figuring out what's six feet how you have desperate um six feet apart from each other but teachers and principals are not really facilities managers we should have had facilities managers helping us do that and teachers and principals should have spent the time figuring out how to do the scheduling on remote and hybrid or you know let the facilities managers figure out how to get us tents or mon or or get the money so that we could hire double the number of teachers and have the tents so we could have everybody in a place like connecticut new jersey massachusetts and new york where you're below five percent have everybody doing in school but so i think we have spent so much time on the logistics we haven't spent enough time on on how to stand up education so we're in the same exact situation as johanna just said like in march where we're making it up as we go along again yeah and and there's no question that we pack a lot into that job description we we really do and you know uh it's you both you you both just gave like great i think randy said it right there where she said teachers are not facilities managers and i think part of the problem with the profession is that teachers just do what needs to be done you know the teaching is not a profession where you stop and say i need for this to be done can we contract someone out to do it you just figure it out so i think through just a period of just always figuring it out people are like oh well there's no problems they're all set they they all you got to do is move the desks apart but like you said that is that's a skill set that's you know there's we should have had someone doing that right and it's an opportunity cost because when we do i'm sorry every community doesn't have a philanthropist who's going to come in we need a national strategy to deal with these issues yeah and you and just to put more punctuation and it's an opportunity cost when you have teachers doing that uh it takes them away from you know preparing for what is going to be very different teaching environments uh and all that pd that you know they are woefully signing up for right because they they want to do well you know it's funny during the spring um i watched my own daughter caroline who was you know kindergarten uh but i watched her classroom go remote right which you know i got a lot of chuckles over you know the mute and unmute and the fact that sometimes her swivel chair was you know facing in exactly the wrong direction but her her teacher was i mean just doing unbelievable work not only was she giving it her all to all these young inexperienced you know students but she was also juggling responsibilities of taking care of her own kids uh who were at home and i i you know i think can sometimes get lost on you know many of us parents how challenging it is to be a teacher in this kind of environment when you have teacher when you have children of your own and so uh again a question for both of you uh you're both adept at answering any question i throw at you but like just if you could walk us through what a school day looks like from the perspective of a teacher you know what what do you think it is most important for people to know about what it's like to be an educator during this pandemic you want during the pandemic is a very different i mean teachers do everything i mean i was a history teacher but i was a lunch lady and bus duty and a counselor and before school after school all of these other things i think some of the things that i've kind of seen firsthand during this pandemic because my son also was at home and him and i are working side by side and you don't know how many times i had to go on to into his classroom and tell the teacher oh no if you go into the screen and do this so literally i'm helping her to navigate through a program that she's never used and no one thought about um the that you had teachers who have never had to turn their homes into their work spaces so kids are saying can i scan it and send it to you they didn't have a scanner at their houses they didn't have you know a lot of people said i i had some of my educator friends saying my laptop i couldn't download all these programs on my laptop the school district in most places don't um issue devices for every teacher to take home so while we were thinking about making sure the kids are connected we had a lot of educators who had to run out and buy a computer to make sure that they were connected so when you're trying to teach in in this circumstances it really is a very different skill set because i thought about myself as a teacher i never sat at a desk i never sat in one place i was always walking and i knew the questions to ask or i could feed off of kids body language to gauge their level of understanding you could get in closer to kind of talk them off the ledge you kind of lose that in this environment but it doesn't mean that learning cannot take place but there definitely had there needs to be some training so and then working with the parents so that parents can understand this is where all the assignments are going to be like let me help you help me you know and there was really no opportunity for any of that i mean and you don't know how many times and i think for me funny thing i was on my laptop my son was on my computer but then i had to take an unofficial meeting i'm like i need my personal computer back like so we were sharing a computer you know the internet was slowing down all of these other things and there really was not really a place for educators to debrief because the other thing i saw and that i continued to see is that his teacher was on during the class and then the teacher was available after the class because parents are calling and it just never ended and that that's the thing i worry about with all of these various models my daughter's a teacher right now and they have a hybrid model where there's some kids in class and some kids online but i mean she has to be available all the time you kind of lose that line of demarcation where the school day ends at three and i'm going to stay after for an hour and then i'm going home it's like unlimited access to teachers where parents and kids are now i can't find the assignment can you help me locate it on on the the blackboard whatever i mean on the program blackboard or whatever but all of those things are what teachers are dealing with now so we know we know that um so look we're people are going to know more about what is going on right now in about three months from now but instinctively think about it we know that hybrid is the worst of all worlds but we're doing it in many places because we know how important in-school instruction is for kids and how important making people or keeping people safe is so that's part of the reason why we kind of walked into hybrid even though it is not no one would say that a hybrid model if they were erecting a school system from swatch they would never opt for a hybrid model you know not for you know child care purposes not for education purposes not for reopening the economy purposes but what's going to happen in terms of hybrid unless there is a really an ability for people to team teach then it's it's you you can't really teach in your classroom the 12 people that you have in 12 kids you have in your classroom who you are looking at and the 12 kids who are on a screen it's ridiculous it is not going to work that's going to end up getting changed you're going to have to we're going to have to try to figure out how to do a a model where you've got the remote teachers who are doing remote you have the in-school teachers who are doing in school and that there's really going to have to be team teaching i would say in three months from now remember what i just said and more things are going to look more like that but you know what do i know i'm just a teacher so you know so but but what's happening right now is that and and you know a high school teacher not an elementary school teacher who really elementary school teachers will tell you immediately what will work and what will work the second thing is as johanna just said teaching this way is actually much much much harder because it requires a whole different skill set that most of us have not been practiced that teachers how many times do people say teachers have eyes in the back of their head i always saw my mother had eyes in the back of her head she was a an elementary school teacher but what it is is that we are trained to read body language to listen to get any kind of you know signals because that's you know that's part of how we understand what's happening in our classrooms you don't really have that in terms of online so you have to do it in different ways and a lot of that requires how we have small groups how we really are working with parents and a lot of this is going to be one-to-one so it is completely exhausting because you really have you really have to figure out right now with a whole new set of children all those new relationships at least last year in march you had the relationships for eight or nine months already so in the normal in a normal situation a teacher is an actor um uh uh a coach um uh a scholar you can't be one page ahead of your kids you have to know your work deeply you're constantly um grading papers or creating that so you've got to find time where time does not exist and and so you're doing all of these things i used to say we were a combination of king ghandi einstein and the sopranos and and and mother teresa all rolled up into one and now we're doing it in a new age with remote and so it is exhausting and it's particularly exhausting because it's a whole new field even for people who know how to use computers figuring out developmentally what will work with their class and whether what what kind of teaching what to do in the 20 minutes that a kid may be focused and on you know on the screen what to do in group work all of this is brand new so it's going to be completely and totally exhausting the last thing i'll say is teachers always want to get it right and so they are devastated when something doesn't work and so we got to be risk-taking a lot and then talking to each other about what is working and what isn't yeah oh those are those are such great points and you know it's it's why mandates in this regard are so hard right i mean because i just say one other thing lori which we haven't said yet which is on top of everything uncovered this reckoning with racism is hitting everyone in a really different way and so could you imagine i'm not even looking at johanna right now when i say this could you imagine if york you were teaching a high school class and your class just watched the entire republican convention where they kept saying that anybody who supported black lives matter what they said what trump and others said about that could you imagine what you have to do walking into school right now not just dealing with coven not just dealing with an economic recession but with all of the thoughts and and and and anxieties and frustration that have happened when the uh trump a president of the united states america can't even say the name of jacob blake or george willoyd or brianna taylor who were all who who all having all experienced tremendous brutality and and that we're not going to be able to figure out how who is really suffering and who is not when we're just on a screen it's it there's so much happening right now in the world i mean i i don't even know where to start right with all of that because it's just hard enough to figure out you know how we're going to protect the mental health of our of our children of our families of our communities uh and certainly our teachers right i mean they they do get uh you know all of this um energy and questions and uncertainty and they get it all um and there's going to be big big gaps because you know a lot of a lot of them to johanna's point they're not going to be proximate to their students who they they love and they you know they want to care for and i just i just i was thinking about what randy just said and i can't imagine it because i was just having a conversation with my daughter and some other teachers who teach civics and government and in an election year this is you know teachers who teach civics are firing on all cylinders because you sh i would have had my kids watch the closing statements from both conventions you know come back and let's discuss let's make a list of the issues let's pull newspaper articles but there are some some painful conversations that kids are are having and they're doing that without the proximity of a teacher because let me the one thing i can tell you for sure is that the kids to i was the teacher to every kid in my class i don't care if they looked like they could have came from my family or your family whether they were black white spoke english not i was their teacher so when they had a problem i was their first line of defense so all of these kids who are dealing with these very painful things with just trying to make sense have very difficult questions to ask both black and white kids because i've had kids who are saying help me understand why this is happening and they're looking to their teacher for those answers and you know that part is missing and i i worry about that that we have so many young people adolescents kids who will go out into the world not having had the ability to unpack some of these things with someone who they see in just as a rock or a constant for them and it really is something that is one of those unintended consequences of all of this stuff that's going on yeah no it's uh it's such an unbelievable point because i think we were all shaped by uh the great teachers that we had uh and we went to them with things that we couldn't even talk to our our parents about our friends about even our most trusted you know family members and uh and that is uh missing at a time in our country when you know that stability is uh i'm sure what so many youth are craving you know i know we don't have that much time but i have to you know ask another question because context matters you know every family has their own context every teacher has their own context and they all uh they all come to school each day uh with the unique set of circumstances uh whether it's you know their family situation whether it's their own health whether it's their child care situation um and so you know to johanna and randy you know what can we be doing as parents and you know maybe as legislators too to better support our teachers mental health as they go through this tumultuous time uh not just from uh you know doing uh the great job that every teacher aims and wants to do in the classroom but also you know by uh their family um to protect their mental health their safety and their their unique family context i think sometimes it gets lost in the conversation i could sum up in 30 seconds and then randy you can take us out um as a legislator i will continue to fight to make sure that we are investing in education that we are making sure that teachers don't have to make these decisions on their own that you know my goal in coming to the congress and you know i have a very short list of things that i want to see brought full circle to completion and one of those things is fully funding idea to make sure that our students with disabilities and special needs have the resources that they need and teachers and school districts can support them because that takes a whole chunk off of the play of local districts who are trying to really stretch really thin budgets as far as they can so investing in public education investing in teachers investing in our communities as opposed to reacting and just playing catch-up you know kids don't have that kind of time and i think for parents i think it would be i would give the same advice that randy gave at the top of the call if um if it's not safe say it if parents have concern they should be elevating them immediately they should not sit quietly i don't care a parent who feels like you know i don't really know how to engage i don't have the agency or the capacity that is your child that is your child and if there is any level of concern about the education that they are receiving about the resources about their needs being met you need to make your voice heard you need to keep over and over no matter how many times you have to to make sure that people hear you you know school dish i came from a district that had 19 000 kids and i used to have to remind my superintendent yeah you're responsible for 19 000 kids but that mother sitting across the table crying is only responsible for one and in her world that is the most important thing to her so i think parents if it doesn't feel safe if you have any concerns do not wait it out immediately make your voice heard so thank you for that because i think it's really important advice for every parent every teacher having agency our voice you know we often say this about our elections our our vote is our voice but we need to actually have and find the power that we really have not contract out that power to um others who are very willing to use it for themselves but maybe not for community but i would say we often um both we have a very schizophrenic relationship with teachers we expect them to be miracle workers and then we're really really really disappointed when they can't we are human beings as imperfect or perfect as everyone else and all of the anxieties that everybody else has during this period of time we have but we have an obligation not to show it to kids when we're on the screen or when we're in schools and so we hold it all in in so many different ways and we have another anxiety which is are we going to get it right for our kids so teachers are under a lot of pressure right now and just any kind of conversation that you have with your kids teachers or you have with each other we gotta give each other grace i heard that a lot look my my wife is a preacher so you know i hear stuff a lot about you know religion and but grace we have to give each other grace we have to actually have compassion and have empathy for each other and hold each other virtually tightly right now and that includes our teachers and to the extent that we can do it and and try to create that kind of community out of this crazy chaos we will be in better stead and so just be patient with each other be patient i don't know a single one of my teacher friends who hasn't cried in the last couple weeks who was you know on on social media they're posting you know the pain of this journey so just be patient with our teachers you know because that they have our kids future in their hands that's right that's right well those are probably the best parting words in terms of uh you know stressing patience and empathy and that is all the time we have today i could talk to you both uh for so much longer uh but i have to take a moment to just say thank you again to both of you uh not just for being a part of today's conversation but you know for sharing your perspective um with with our listening community right now because i really think it was it was helpful for so many you know as we continue to navigate this difficult time it's important that everyone who keeps our schools running knows that we're on your side you know i was blessed to have some extraordinary teachers in my life people who inspired me to dig deep and reach

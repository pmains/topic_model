hello everyone I'm Congressman Anthony Gonzales and welcome to another of our quarterly updates yesterday we asked you to leave your questions on Facebook and Twitter I have those questions here some great questions thank you for submitting but before I answer them let me start by giving you a brief rundown of everything that the office has been up to since our last update also if you didn't get a chance to ask a question yesterday you can send me an email any time by visiting my website at Anthony Gonzales house gov Gonzalez has Tuesdays and a lot of people put an S on it a little surprised it doesn't have it but in any event so first on the constituent side constituents first is a motto in our office my not my media predecessor but Ralph regula who held this seat for nearly 40 years he did have the constituents first mantra and one that I think is really important so we adopt that in our office everybody in the office is committed to it and over the past year our office held nearly 1,400 constituents through cases with the federal government including securing more than 83,000 dollars in Social Security disability back payments and presenting military service medals to over 150 veterans who served our nation with honor and pride and these are really important and they're they're exciting ceremonies for a whole host of reasons one if you have veterans in your family you know that our veteran community is amazing but they're also very humble people and typically don't you know brag about their service for the medals that they received and so oftentimes what happens is somebody will call into our office either a sibling or a son or daughter or somebody will call into the office and say hey you know my aunt or uncle or my dad served and I want to see if he here in any medals and most most of the time it turns out that that our folks have received medals and they either were misplaced they never received them and so what we do is we can go track down these medals we can get them bring them back put them in a nice plaque and then present them back to the family if the veterans still alive obviously we do that but but in some instances and with World War two veterans especially oftentimes we're presenting to the family and these are really powerful ceremonies we do them as often as we can we're going to do another set of ceremonies here next week but but really really great ceremony so if you have a veteran in your family or you yourself are veteran and you're curious about your medals please contact our office we would love to give them to you how you earned them so additionally we also secured over 24 million dollars in federal grant funding for for the 16th district and that's going to go towards our infrastructure in particular route 30 and support community initiatives from combating domestic violence to serving disabled veterans really excited about that we have somebody in our office who works entirely on bringing dollars back to the district and so to have success in that front I was really impactful additionally we held two different town halls throughout the district we'll do more in the coming year conducted countless roundtables on different issues from healthcare to financial services to trade launched our veterans resource tour and visited numerous schools and businesses all across the the 16th district one quick thing on the veterans resource tours before I ever get so this is another service that we like to provide to our veterans community and we have a ton of services throughout the district that that's served the veterans community but they're kind of all over the place some of them are in Cuyahoga County some of are in Wayne County some are in stark etc they're there literally all over all six counties have different services and and what the veterans Resource Tours are is a way for us to bring all the services into one location for one particular day and then we promote them through the website and that's just a way to make sure that our veterans have kind of a one-stop shop to the extent possible when accessing the various services so we'll continue to do those and keep up with us on the web site on Facebook and Twitter and we'll continue announcing those in terms of the legislative side the the top goal that we set for our office when we met for the first time as a full staff back in February was the passing of USMC a USMC a to me is the number one thing that we can do for our economy it's projected to add over 175,000 jobs raise GDP by over a quarter of a percent and it's in particular going to help manufacturing and agriculture those are the two industries that were singled out by the independent u.s. ITC international trade commission that advises Congress on trade deals I'm specifically called out manufacturing and agriculture as the two biggest beneficiaries of us MCA well those are two of the most important industries I would argue they are the two most important industries in our district instead of in terms of core industries and so to see that past which we pass out of the house right before the holiday I was passed by the Senate today and it'll be signed into law here shortly by the president is an enormous win for Northeast Ohio another thing that I love about it it was largely bipartisan there were some folks who voted against it on the other side of the aisle but but by and large it was a bipartisan effort and that's always exciting I mean in the Senate it past roughly 8020 so when you get that kind of support for something I like to say it gives you a chance it makes you feel like sometimes we can actually put our partisanship aside to get some things done for the American people so really excited about that I think it can be great for our district and was thrilled to have a strong voice in helping move it forward additionally my battlefield cross bill was signed into law not long ago it passed the house before the the new year but was signed into law just just a couple of days ago but but what this would do is it would require our battlefield crosses to remain at our national cemeteries due to an unfortunate misinterpretation by a VA employee battlefield crosses were starting to be removed from our cemeteries Alton Boyer from Worcester noticed this objected to it as did many other veterans brought it to my predecessor Jim Rene sees attention congressman AC put forward the bill last cycle I just ran out of time just couldn't get it passed but but it was the first bill I introduced once I sign Din - I swore myself into office and was thrilled to see that signed by the President and this was unanimous which is good so it was unanimously passed out of the House unanimously passed out of the Senate and signed into law just like just a couple weeks ago so really excited they're an important sort of initiative for our veterans community to show them that we appreciate them especially those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice and might I think my favorite part of this bill frankly is that it came directly out of the community this was directly from feedback that we heard all the way from two years ago when I first started getting into politics from different veterans everywhere I traveled they talked to me about the battlefield cross bill in the situation at our National Cemetery and making sure that that we got this fixed and so was really excited about that secondly we passed out of House the I yogin act and what the I organ act is is it helps identify deep fakes deep fake content what a deep fake is heard me talk about this before if you follow our updates I think Forrest Gump so if you remember when Forrest movie Forrest Gump came out I think it's a great movie it put Tom Hanks character in different situations so it looked like he was talking to JFK it looked like he was in Vietnam look they had all these different segments where he said well it looks very realistic if you didn't know that was Tom Hanks you would think it was a real thing and so now at the time when that technology existed it was super expensive Hollywood movie studios could do it but nobody else just it was too expensive now anybody with a macbook can pretty much do it if you know how to alter video and audio content so the point that it's indecipherable and so it has a lot of implications a lot of people think of it in terms of Elections I actually think of in terms of things like finance so today the technology is at such a point where somebody could download your voice from a recording or whatever download your voice and then put it into a computer and basically make you say whatever they want so then they could call somebody else as you and convince them that you know they're talking to you and then get you to do something like give them a password or access to a bank or something like that so I think it's a huge issue especially going forward it'll become even more of an issue and so what the IO Gun Act would do is it would empower our agencies to start studying this so that we can identify it and then combat it so first we need to be able to identify it then we can fight back against it so that passed the house hoping to get that through the Senate and to the President's desk as well I think it's a really important initiative when you talk about fraud in my head I think this is one of the first things that we'll be thinking about over the next sort of 2 5 10 years if you will and then lastly and this was signed into law was a bill sass stuff and what's acid as Aman the Science Space and Technology Committee and what sassa does is it protects our research centers and federally funded research from China stealing it so one of the things China has done to develop their economy is they place Chinese nationals inside of our research centers and inside of our universities we as American taxpayers fund the research and then the Chinese government comes brings those people back to China and steal the technology alongside of it so literally that's what they do they'll come to the US pay them all kinds of money and say hey we're going to bring you back as part of what's called the thousand talents program think of that as like their big talent recruitment program they'll learn these folks back to China with all kinds of money and promises and things like that and alongside of that their job is to take the federally funded research that they were doing in the United States steal it and transfer it to China we work very hard on our research and technology were the most innovative country in the world I wanted to remain that way and I certainly want to make sure that every single dollar we're spending stays in the United States and is not stolen by China or Iran or anybody else who means us harm and so that was also signed into law as part of the NDAA and and I was excited about that so too bill signed into law the u.s. MCA and then the IEEE ogen Act which has passed the house and now we got to get it over to the Senate additionally we'll be introducing more bills but but in terms of review that's where we're at and then now before I get to your questions I just want to let everyone know that if you're interested in more updates like this or if you like these updates you can subscribe to my weekly email newsletter the weekly huddle that goes out every Sunday I'll include a link along with this video but you can also subscribe again by visiting the website anthony gonzalez house gov that's gon z al easy so with that thank you and we'll get to your questions so a lot of good questions some the first ones I'm going to start with they're Great Lakes focus because that was on a lot of people's mind which is which is great so this first one is from Ray know us we've got okay name concrete actions legislations proposed budget line item secured etc designed to protect Lake Erie and our access to clean water so first off great question really appreciate that so this is an example of and I say this when people ask you know what's what's your biggest surprise and when I talk about positive surprises I usually talk about how collaborative the Ohio delegation is on regional issues like the Great Lakes so we have in the Ohio delegation three members on the Appropriations Committee which controls the dollars that get spent tim ryan marcy kaptur and dave joyce all northeast their northern ohio members and so what we were able to do is through the Great Lakes restoration initiative we're able to plus up the funding and additional twenty million dollars so it was three hundred million dollars we got three hundred and twenty million dollars this year and that goes towards funding Great Lakes projects to keep the water clean to make sure that all the funding is secured to do all the great work that we do and making sure that the Great Lakes continue to be Lake Erie and all the Great Lakes continue to be such a strong asset for our region so that that's number one secondly the Great Lakes restoration initiative Restoration Act which would ask for additional funding up to four hundred and seventy five million dollars by 2026 so we're at 320 this year we want to move it even further up and make sure that that money continues to come and so all of us are on that bill the folks I just mentioned and most the Ohio delegation I believe and then I'm also a co-sponsor of HR 3297 the harmful algal bloom essential forecasting act and what this would do is is designate the people in the federal government who work specifically on algal blooms as essential employees which means that if we go through another one of those ridiculous government shutdowns that they will still be working and so this means that we'll always have people who are looking at the outer blooms and monitoring and making sure that obviously we're keeping them out as best we can so that's the first question thank you very much on that this one is from Johnny eight-ball mr. Gonzalez please work towards protecting the Great Lakes from invasive species and pollution so again I went through some of the the specific bills that that we've gone you know put forward and been a part of additionally we do work closely with the Army Corps of Engineers a lot of the great projects that they're doing and then also was part of a letter to remove Asian carp from the water another big issue and and we want to make sure that the federal government is aware of it and doing all they can on that front so we will continue to do that and and that's that's a top priority for myself for the office and like I said it really is a regional priority so you're gonna see the Ohio delegation folks in Michigan and across the Great Lakes region working together on this and we will make sure that our voice is heard on it and I'm confident on that so the last one on Great Lakes is from Paul our one is it true that budget monies for the Great Lakes restoration initiative were taken by the Trump administration for the wall if so or not what stage are we in for this effort and what is the budget amount so again the budget amount is three hundred and twenty million dollars with respect to that rumor about money being taken to build the wall that is not true so that's an easy answer next one is from Steven Ling I just want to know if you've read the Muller report yet so that's an easy one the answer is yes I read the Muller report I forget what day it came out but I read it that first weekend things about roughly 200 pages I read through it and and my response to it was you know these these things around an impeachment in the Moller report and Ukraine and all this stuff it it has broken on party lines which is not surprising but my initial reaction was okay let me read this thing and figure out what can we do in a bipartisan way based on what's in this report and that we would all agree on our changes to the law that we might want to make and on that front I have been a part of a task force that's been working on election security specifically and put a bill forward that we worked with secretary Lew roses office our Secretary of State Frank LaRose his office to make sure it made sense for them as well and that easily increase research funding and standards for protecting our elections those are things that I think we should absolutely be doing I think you probably know this but elections are run by the states and local governments which i think is right and appropriate and so we want to make sure that that we're providing the right kind of resources to them to make sure that they are confident in the systems and and the protocol that are being used so so the short answer is yes I did read it and then what I did as a result the next one is from Margaret as the facts on quid pro quo come to light what are your thoughts on the impeachment of Donald J Trump so I answered this pretty extensively during the impeachment vote I was against the impeachment for a whole host of reasons we wrote a letter I'm detailing my my full logic on that it's about a two-page letter I'd steal it steer you in that direction I'm at a basic level to kind of summarize it as against it for two reasons one there was no crime even alleged so if you look at the standard of high crimes and misdemeanors there's no reference to any laws that were broken there's no reference to any crimes that were committed there's an abuse of power reference which is very very vague and and in my opinion will be used for every future president going forward we'll all be subject to this quote abuse of power abuse of power is simply whatever the majority in Congress decides I think that's sending a very dangerous precedent personally it's the first time also in American history where we have impeached a president without even alleging that the president broke a law I think that said no that's a horrible precedent and then the sexiest second obstruction of Congress again is not a crime but it's also happens to be true that the way that this works typically Congress request documents requests witnesses requests things of the executive branch every single president has pushed back on that claimed executive privilege over different things not related to impeachment but it related to a whole host of things so Congress requests things presidents push back claim executive privilege we have a way of settling those disputes it's in the court that's where you settle those disputes that's one of the purposes of the court system in this case the Democrats chose not to even pursue that path they literally did not pursue that path and so as a result instead of pursuing that path they said well situation Emmett so we're just going to do obstruction of Congress the second article and there you go and so I was opposed on both fronts and again I think we have unfortunate we have lowered the bar to such a degree that we're going to see all future presidents subjected to this and I think that's a very very bad outcome for the country and so I was against if you want more of the thoughts again I'd point you in the direction of the letter but that's basically what it says what I just outlined so this one is from Melissa based on the current evidence for impeachment how do you feel about the Senate not calling witnesses if the president is innocent why not let the Dems ask questions of the key players again I leave the Senate up to them how they want to conduct their business frankly I don't know half the things that they do over there but but what I will say is I think the house should have made their case if there was more information that they needed they very well could have done it they could have subpoenaed Bolton for example and demanded his testimony they chose not to do that so the Senate can do whatever the Senate feels is appropriate in my estimation but but again I think if there were other key witnesses out there that they should have been brought forward by the house and I'm if you're going to impeach somebody you should probably call all the key witnesses as opposed to some of them but that's that's just my opinion now this one is primarily voter fraud and election related so three questions one what are you doing what are you going to do to combat voter fraud to why aren't our elections being protected three should ID be required to vote in elections should illegal aliens be able to obtain a driver's license take these in reverse order should IDs be required to vote in elections I think so I don't if you I don't know how you know who's voting if you're not checking ID so you have to have some form of identification to know that the person who says they're voting is who they say they are so I think you should should illegal aliens be able to obtain a driver's license no I don't think so next one why aren't our elections being protected so this is a common misconception in my estimation at least in Ohio I can't speak for all the other states because like I said we have 50 different systems 50 different secretaries of state but with respect to Ohio I'd point you in the direction of Frank LaRose and he's a great follow on Twitter because he he talks a lot about what they're doing I mean I think he's educating the public in a very positive way and and the conclusion that he's drawn that I support is that voter fraud and and you know protection of Elections seems very very rare actually it happens I'm not saying it doesn't happen but it doesn't happen anywhere close to as often as the media would suggest it does now that doesn't mean we should ignore it we absolutely need to make sure that not only is it continue to be rare but it becomes even more rare but but as a general premise the question of why our elections being secured I would argue that they are being secured they're quite secure and and frankly some of the comments that I see that suggest otherwise contrary to all FAC I find disappointing because they undermine the faith they undermine the faith that that you have in your vote you should be very confident that your vote is being accurately counted monitored and that our elections are secure and they're accurate and they're selecting the right people if I if if that weren't the case we'd have a huge problem on our hands but it simply is not true that there's widespread voter fraud throughout the United States just not true and then the final question what are you going to do to combat voter fraud again I submitted a bill after the model report came out working with bipartisan Republicans and Democrats to help codify suggestions and best practices and standards for our elections officials I want the Franklin roses of the world to have all the tools they need to be successful to secure our elections and make sure that that your vote counts and so that's what I've done as other bills come up I'm always looking for bipartisan ones because I want him to pass and so as other bills come up we'll evaluate them on the merits we'll work directly with the Secretary of State's office to see whether he thinks that this is moving us in the right direction and then we'll go from there next question this one's for Tom do you believe in climate change this is a good question so do I believe in climate change so the answer is yes I mean you can just measure that and the measurements are pretty clear the climate changing climates always changed I think the question is there's a handful of questions that come off of that one what do you do about it and two what what kind of proposals are out there do they make any sense the top proposal coming out from some of my colleagues is the green new deal I think the green new deal is the worst idea I've ever seen in my life again I'm not even exaggerating I think if you if your goal was to destroy the economy just completely destroy it you would do the green New Deal that's the number one thing you would do because it would raise energy costs to such an absurd degree that we would have people all over the district all over the country we're gonna make real trade-offs between putting gas in their car heating their homes food on the table I mean it would impoverish our entire country in my estimation additionally it's it's illiterate it's completely illiterate so the goal of moving to a hundred percent renewable and when they say renewable what they really mean is just wind and solar wind solar battery that combination scientifically cannot produce a hundred percent of the energy it cannot it's impossible and so when you talk about climate change again I think the climate is absolutely changing but you better be very careful as to what proposals you think might make sense to me what makes sense is an all-of-the-above strategy where we're looking at all different energy sources and we're weighing the cost-benefit analysis between costs effectiveness and reliability I think those are and cleanliness and I think those are that's kind of the the set of things that you're looking at and so that's why I'm for funding basic research into new energy sources and new technology trends so storage for example is one that that is a big problem storing energy so I've put bills forward that would increase research and development into storage capacity that's one thing I think we need to be developing small-scale nuclear and so nuclear is the only clean energy source that doesn't suffer from the intermittent issues so intermittency meaning the Sun doesn't always shine the wind doesn't always blow and the batteries can't store the energy well enough to to power the grid in its entirety a nuclear could actually do that now it's too costly and there's some issues with it I'm sorry I do think there stuff you could do there I think there are things you can do on carbon capture so that means you know as as emissions go you have technology on the back end that is capturing the carbon and storing it so carbon capture is another way that you could decarbonize but at a basic level the answer to your question is yes I agree or yes I believe in climate change as I said that's that's just a measurement you can just measure it I think another measurement came out last week that said I think this is the warmest decade on record and and so that's happening but the question is what do you do as a result and if you're moving in the direction of the green new deal I just think that's crazy um but if you want a realistic solution one that is based in science and reality I think you need to start looking at other technologies besides just wind solar and battery again which is the green new deals about wind solar and battery more than anything else so and a giant takeover of most sectors of our economy which of course I'm against let's see two more three more questions next one is from the Greater Cleveland Young Republicans do you get more questions about football or Washington um this time of year football so with the Buckeyes I'm still depressed about that outcome by the way but with the Buckeyes and we would have gave a way better game to LSU so let's just say that I think we go to beat them but it would have been a much better game than what Clemson put out and and with what's going on with the Browns I get more football questions than Washington which is good so next one Johnny 8-ball name one thing you've a good question name one thing you've done to make this country better so I talked about some of the laws that we've passed I'll give you another one that we're working on right now an issue that we've started to really do a deep dive on which is Child Exploitation so if you heard the story out of Strongsville where a priest was caught trafficking and child pornography was arrested the entity that ultimately found him is is underfunded and so the way that it works is there's all these images coming in from usually Facebook but other platforms these images are coming in to the law enforcement agency but the law enforcement agency is understaffed and doesn't have the resources to look at all of them and to investigate all of them and so a bunch of images are just falling by the wayside and never getting looked at and so we've done two things one we've put a bill forward that would lengthen the amount of time that the images could be held by the companies themselves right now they're they're only allowed to be held for a certain period of time and then they have to delete them that means that a lot of images never get investigated um so we're gonna put we have put legislation forward that would basically double that length of time so that would give law enforcement more time to look through all the images and do the investigations and then the second thing we've done is lead a letter that ultimately worked the to demand more funding for those organizations so that we have more law enforcement officers who can go do this so we can catch more bad people who are I think amongst the most disgusting people on earth the child pornographers and so the more resources and the smarter we can be about tracking them down and subjecting them to the fullest form of justice we can I want to do that and so I think we're we're making a lot of progress frankly there's not a lot of people working on this in Congress I don't know why I have but it creates a nice lane for me where I can go and really go deep on the issue and try to craft the solutions and and so far I think I think we're in the right headed in the right direction so that's number one last question this is from Carlos do you think the biggest threats to America are outside or within our borders I don't really think of it that way I'll tell you what I think of internal threats and external threats so internally I think the biggest threats are debt and deficit health care that's too expensive the nobody can afford and not enough people are covered bad trade deals which are starting to correct themselves that's specific to our our district not every part of the country is affected as directly by trade as we are and then illegal immigration so those are kind of my my four in terms of internal you can debate whether illegal immigration is an internal or external struggle but I think having an immigration system that's sensible and that works for our country and is fair to everybody that prioritizes our country I think that is a big priority and it it has been largely ignored for a while which is unfortunate and then externally I think the biggest threats are so I think great power competition so China Iran Russia those three and then obviously Islamic terrorism that's been with us it'll continue to be with us for a very long time but but those are as I think of the biggest challenges externally and internally I had those are kind of what I what I think through so that was the last question and and I just really appreciate everybody submitting your questions and of course for allowing me to be a representative it's the hunt of a lifetime people ask are you having fun the answer is I love every single second of every single day that I get to work on your back means the world to me such an honor it's frustrating at times as you can imagine but but I do love it and I am deeply appreciative to everybody for allowing me to be your representative so with that I hope everybody has a great weekend thank you as always and god bless

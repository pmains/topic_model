what do you hear from your voters in Alabama about that issue of Education yeah that is what people are talking about people are talking about inflation they're talking about crime and they're talking about education interestingly as a mother myself you know all of my friends are talking about what our children are being taught in the classroom it's a real thing we want to make sure our children are educated and not indoctrinated we've seen the past two years when children were locked out of the classroom we've seen in the nape scores over the country where we're down you know seven points in math and Five Points in Reading we know that matters you know if a child's not reading on grade level by third grade their chance of graduating high school goes down four times your kids are how old my kids are seventh and eighth okay I mean so this is close to home it is and you know we want them to talk the fundamentals we want them to be taught to love this nation to stand for the flag be taught history be taught math be taught reading not to be indoctrinated with woke ideology and so do you think that there's something that can be done that the Republicans have so momentum here because for a long time people thought oh if you ask that poll question yeah Democrats were usually up now it's basically tied the Republicans have this place if we saw the race in Virginia with Glenn Younkin so there's education you also have a concern about mental health in and Fentanyl absolutely and crime I mean all these things that are happening across the country are happening in Alabama as well and it's it's real I'll tell you there is no probate judge no hospital administrator no law enforcement officer or no teacher that doesn't tell me mental health is one of the top issues they deal with every single day we are looking at the effects of fentanyl as we know under Joe Biden every state has become a border state when you look at the drugs pouring over our border that have made it not only into our communities but into our classrooms we have had 15 uses of Narcan on classroom in in the classroom this year to save students this year this year and it's October this year this year wow and so folks it's real we're watching there's nowhere that I go that I don't talk about Fentanyl and opioid use I don't have someone walk over and say thank you for bringing attention to this I wouldn't look to a lot of your previous statements with regard to China with regard to election protecting democracy and on on the border however you say I am horrified and disgusted by what's happening right now or Southern border absolutely a lot of Republicans don't talk that way oh no we have to we have to it is open season right now under Joe Biden for human traffickers for drug cartels and for terrorists you know make no mistake what is happening is affecting our communities it's affecting our way of life you're seeing moms and dads get off the sidelines across this nation from school boards to U.S Senate races because we see the country we know and love dissolving under Joe Biden's leadership and we have to stand up and it is disgusting and if the trafficking I mean the drugs all of it it's real and we can't turn a blind eye we have to speak up for our children and the main issue of inflation how does what how does will Boyd your opponent you know talk about the real costs of what's going on right now with people you know prices and food prices to as typical you see Democrats deflect and try to change the narrative to something else and the truth is inflation is real I mean when I am traveling the state Dana you know I had you know not it's not not only moms and dads and Working Families it's retirees I had a gentleman stop me at a gas station and he said are you Katie Britt and he said I am 77 years old I've done everything they told me to and I am now I'm trying to retire and I was going to spend time with my grandkids but I'm picking up the night shift here because I cannot make it well it's a similar yes and we need to be energy not only energy independent but energy dominant

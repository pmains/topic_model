I want to thank Dr Fox for introducing the resolution that we have before us today that directs President Biden to hand over the documents related to coordination of the executive branch and the American Federation of teachers also a member of Judiciary we had a similar request yesterday that um documents be turned over a different type of coordination but I think it's similar in that it's it's somewhat troubling that these aren't just offered up um on September 1st the national assessment education progress reported on nine-year-olds reading and math achievement certainly I think when you talk to teachers and ask them it's pretty simple concept that um they have to somewhat water down the curriculum or simplify the curriculum right now as the kids come back into a full year of school and the reason for that is I think what most of us have experienced over the years both as kids as students and certainly as parents of kids in school and that is when you have a significant break uh in the educational process and you know the one that we're used to is two and a half months off every summer uh that a lot of kids come back and they've done a complete uh dump of everything that they had learned the year before so teachers understand that and it's kind of um it's kind of a process to get them to once again go back not every kid I wouldn't say most kids though get them back into a mode where they're learning again well you don't have to be a member of Congress to know that what was going on during the pandemic was this Shuffle of both parents trying to figure out what to do with their kids all day and everybody had a different situation but um and I know often two time too many times in Congress were anecdotal with our stories but I too am married to uh a person that both was a long time teacher and now a counselor uh and what happened was a lot of these kids were for the most part unsupervised throughout the day so there were simply you know certain ways of entertaining them and unfortunately I think for a lot of kids it ended up being um playing video games all day so I'd like to get to the bottom of kind of what the information is that we're lacking and what was that discussion and maybe it wasn't maybe we're being suspicious that that the teachers the Federation of teachers um in good conscience we're actually worried about members or was there some kind of power play so I'm not sure why it's so difficult to produce these documents now or why it's why we can't get our hands on these just to see kind of what the underlying reasons are that uh this data is not available because it could be helpful I mean I think that's what many schools are looking for certainly that's what many teachers in the classroom are looking for is uh just kind of what happened how did this come about and if we could get beyond that maybe we could come up with some good significant not only data like I said but you know some real answers that'll help administrators that will help parents and certainly help teachers and kids in in the classroom to figure out how we can make sure that this never happens again uh it's got to be the most um depressing an unnerving part of what happened during the pandemic is what we put our kids through um it's it's almost somewhat embarrassing that that we couldn't look Beyond this and see the damage that was going to be done so Mr chairman I I mean I would support this resolution and would urge that the committee report the bill favorably uh let's not be afraid of what we might actually end up with uh because it may be the the map it may be the way that we navigate our way back to making sure that once again this this never ever happens again to our kids and to our schools in general and I yield back

thank you thank you Mr chairman Senator Cassidy um hello Mr secretary Senator Mr secretary I'll also Echo some disappointments when we first met I expressed to you how in previous administrations not of presidents but of secretaries it had been very difficult to have transparency with the VA and you assured me that was not going to be the case under your watch and as a physician I have you know a little at least a little bit of an ability to look at productivity numbers to get a sense of what those productivity numbers are I just know what a well-run clinic how it goes so my staff requested information regarding veterans Health Care in the community care center and we were told to submit a Freedom of Information Act this is Congress this is the VA committee which is supposed to be providing oversight and we were told to submit a foia it kind of took things to a new level because I once told you of an episode where we requested something we got it six months later it was off point we requested it and came back six months later it was off point and it was just a rope-a-dope in terms of getting this information that actually looks good relative to being asked to give a foia I I I don't know how to say that as such disrespect for the institution of Congress I'll take it and I'll I'll dig into it it just blows my mind and I'm sorry to be so frustrated but I am representing people and when those people feel as if the VA is doing nothing but hiding is not me it's the people I represent the veterans I represent who are really being offended um so just to say that and and um and if we could have a point person that we could contact and that is accountable to you and I can call you up and say Dennis we had a great meeting man what's going on and you could ride hurt over this person because I suspect you didn't know about this but it's being made by somebody who doesn't want to give us information so if we could have that and your staff could relate to Christian raise your hand man uh uh then I would appreciate that sort of work around on something which is wrong fair enough okay secondly kind of related to the same on April the 12th our office sent a letter to you regarding the ineffectiveness of the va's opioid safety initiative and ask what barriers Congress should remove in order to better public-private Partnerships to increase veterans access to testing and treatment there was an August 21 report in Washington Post which kind of motivated this which showed a that after the introduction of the opioid safety initiative suicides among veterans in the rural areas increased by 75 percent and increased in the urban area by 30 percent we have not heard back from a letter that we sent on April the 12th about a program which The Washington Post is reporting was at least Associated temporally we don't know causally with a 75 percent increase in veteran suicide in rural areas I don't know any comment no I'll get i'll get to the bottom of it okay um and again I'm sorry to seem as agitated as Senator Sullivan but you can imagine when I come to my staff and I say hey man I'm all excited about this uh we we put something together work really hard on it we send it off and we want to have a foia request um the next issue um is and again I've always enjoyed our interactions so I'm sorry for the unpleasantness of this there is a um again I'm a physician and I know there's certain productivity measures that they're just a way of well-functioning uh outfit should work it's my concern that in some places that there's a lot of folks employed but not as many patients being seen frankly I think there's some facilities the VA would choose to close because of lack of adequate patient volume I actually see that as important you'll have my support um depending on where it is but the point but but the point being but the point being is that we should expect a certain amount of patients seen per provider in order to you know just have a well-functioning clinic even to keep up clinical skills there was this is uh what the GAO report I'm sure you're familiar with it reported in 2017 the VA did not maintain an accurate count of Physicians providing care in the VA hindering the ability to ensure the appropriate number of the clinical Workforce I'd say the appropriate number of people being seen per physician and also lack data on the number of contract Physicians providing care in the VA because it's Personnel databases and workforce planning tools did not include contractors now I don't know how many contractors you are but contractors are pretty important part have you all corrected that do we have this because one thing I want to know is patient volume per provider and so has that been updated and what's going on it sounds like a I I heard you say 2017 report is that right so I assume it's been updated but let me take and find that out but we do we track average daily census in our facilities which obviously helps us uh make sure that we're tracking most importantly patient safety uh which is obviously derivative of whether our docs or nurses our Specialists are getting uh adequate rounds adequate Time On Target and so uh I'd be happy to work through uh that with you but I I'm assuming from a 2017 uh GAO report we've we've done that but let me let me take and dig that well I'll finish by saying this the reason I asked is one thing we have asked for is data sets so that we can actually look at this data ourselves um and of course we've not heard back um but on the other hand if what we're receiving doesn't take into account contractors it would unfairly portray uh and and I'm doing this not to I'm absolutely not doing this to go after the VA I'm doing this after to gain understanding yeah uh and but but but but if I have to have be aware of the limitations of the data which we would hope to receive uh before we do that so okay if if they could have that kind of cell or that addendum to that I'd appreciate it got it thank you

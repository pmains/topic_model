I would like to thank my colleague from the state of Missouri for your leadership gentle woman and it's a privilege to stand before you on this important issue Mr Speaker I rise to discuss the pressing issue of border security across our southern border we have thousands of miles of unprotected terrain where weapons human trafficking victims and drugs are easily smuggled into this country every single day believe it or not the drugs that are crossing our southern border even make their way to the most northern communities in my great state of Minnesota just last year more than two dozen people were arrested for their involvement in a large heroin trafficking network that brought drugs to st. Louis County where my family friends and constituents live this is unacceptable during my 23 years as a law enforcement officer I worked tirelessly to keep illegal drugs off the streets and out of the hands of our young children I have given too many death notifications to unsuspecting parents the pain and anguish of each family will never be forgotten Mr Speaker it is high time we recognize that our porous borders are intrinsically tied to the drug crisis the rise in human trafficking and illegal immigration in this country I urge the Democratic leadership to put partisan politics aside so we can finally work together and secure our borders the health and safety of the American people depending on it and doing nothing is no longer an option Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back

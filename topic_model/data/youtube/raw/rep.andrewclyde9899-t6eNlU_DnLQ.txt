thanks for being with us I want to start off here I'm really really optimistic about what is happening right now in November I tell my audience every day on the show I get up every day I look at all the polling numbers I look at the crosstabs it's like Christmas opening up presents you just can't believe what's in there um what do you see you guys have the rollout in Pittsburgh a couple weeks ago what are you are you seeing the same things I'm saying well John good morning it's good to be with you um yes what I believe is that you're going to see a red wave in November and uh um I'm glad you mentioned Pittsburgh because the rollout of the commitment to America I think is very very important um you know it's it's four pillars that uh that will get our country back on track a nation that's secure an economy that's strong a future based on freedom and you know what I think is probably the most important is a government that is accountable if we don't have a government that is accountable to the people then you know then our entire form of government has been a failure uh and so that's why it's so important that last pillar a government that is accountable and I'm I'm so excited about that plan I'm excited about November I think we are going to take back the house I firmly believe uh um you know it will be a good victory a solid Victory but we cannot stop working we never never stop until the very end which is why the people that are listening to your show right now have to be engaged and get out and vote in November what did you think about another CR continuing resolution no debate you just vote on it I mean Byron Donald's in Florida said you guys are the Democrats are running a clown show in there he says he gets 15 minutes you know to vote on like big trillions of dollars uh to keep the government funded there's no options is it the primary responsibility Congress is to get a budget by July uh that is correct the primary responsibility of Congress is to responsibly uh fund the government they have not done that this CR is going uh into um early December which means that the Democrats are going to have another opportunities to pass another CR um you know that's unacceptable this particular CR was loaded with garbage was loaded with pork uh it's not the kind of thing that any Republican should have voted for and I probably voted against it I look forward to taking back the house in January when we actually will have a good we will create a solid budget a budget that will forward the priorities of the American people and not the priorities of the Democrats and their Green New Deal uh you know they want big government socialism that's not what we want we have a free market economy and that is what has made our country so exceptional and anything else is just going to tear us down and the and that's the you know the Democrats have no plan other than to tear our country down so get the big government socialism can take over you know tell me about the spending that's going on that it's unabated now we're hearing reports uh inside DC uh I've heard this from a number of people that expect you guys to win it's a matter of do you win 30 seats or 50 basically I think they understand they're going to get shellac but a lot of them are saying hey we're going to be lame duck uh we're going to take every single spending bill that we want to pass we're going to jam it down your throat as we uh as we give the give the gavels up how do you guys stop that well I think you're right that that's exactly what they're going to try and do uh you know but the Senate is still 50 50. it still requires cloture in the senate in order to move bills forward so that's going to have to be our firewall um you know when the Democrats know that they have lost you're correct that they're going to try and do everything they possibly can to cram their spending bills through the house but we've got to be able to stop them in the Senate uh they're going to lose we know they're going to lose and we just have to hold the line once we know we're going to win when are we going to stop this uh constant funnel of money unrestricted money to Ukraine and not just that but how about um money that has very little accountability that goes with it uh that's a just a the wrong way to do things you know I feel for Ukraine I think Ukraine is a country that should have its Sovereign borders um as every country should and we're seeing some gains in Ukraine which is great I don't think that would have happened without the support of the United States but uh John we have open borders here we don't have a secure border here why in the world are we continuing to funnel billions upon billions of dollars into Ukraine when our Southern border is wide open when we're seeing Millions upon millions of in of illegal aliens crossing our Southern border uh and then the fentanyl that comes in with it that is killing our our the people of this nation it's the number one cause of death for those from 18 to 45 years of age and that is drug overdoses last year there were 107 000 Americans that died from drug overdoses and and the vast majority of those like 70 000 were from synthetic opioids like fentanyl fentanyl made in China coming over through the cartels in Mexico flooding our Southern border uh going north into the in into the interior of the country and killing our people you know we have lost more people or we lost more people last year to fentanyl than the entire Vietnam War I mean if you think about that but yet the news media doesn't seem to really care about it I care about it the Republicans care about it we have to have a secure Southern border without a secure border we won't have a secure country we won't have National Security and not just that we've seen you know 78 people on the on the terrorist watch list come across the southern border that and that's and that's just in this last year you know um that's five times the last four years combined so this is a serious problem in the Biden Administration is not dealing with it whatsoever and they must be held accountable for it the American people must hold this Administration accountable for the crisis after crisis after crisis that they're creating on this country and the time to hold them accountable is November the 8th tell us about the uh the Democratic situation right now you guys aren't they're they're not allowing you guys to do anything basically you have no say in anything is that gonna is are are you gonna treat the Democrats the same way they're treating us I mean there's a question a lot of people are asking me because normally the Republicans get back in they they want to be nice they talk about bipartisanship but you guys have been cut out of every conversation you're meaningless to them they don't care what you say there's no bipartisanship are you going to return the favor well I'll tell you what um uh I think the Democrats have a lot coming to them that they're that they're not expecting right now and um and I'm happy to help deliver it to be honest with you but uh but we have got to get this country back on track our Focus has got to be passing good legislation that puts our nation back to an economy that's strong a nation that's secure uh you know retribution against the Democrats uh you know that's really not something that that we should be focused on but you know what they might get it they might get it because um uh that's just the way things work sometimes but um but we've got to be focused on the plan to put America back on track to fight inflation the number one issue you know in Georgia's Ninth District and then I think across the country as well is inflation we have got to get inflation under control and stop this federal or the federal spending that is the cause of this 8.3 percent inflation and Rising I got a half a minute polls are showing now as we look at the crosstabs crime now the number two issue but in Congress what what can you guys really do about about crime and I've only got 30 seconds uh what we can do about crime is tie Federal funding to the fact that um that you've got local DA's that are not Prosecuting crime you know I mean if if the cities want Federal funding we can make sure that those people that those cities that want Federal funding uh are you know that that Prosecuting crime is tied to Federal funding you know inflation the increasing crime those are two huge issues with the American people and um and they need to keep that at the Forefront of their thoughts when they're voting in November

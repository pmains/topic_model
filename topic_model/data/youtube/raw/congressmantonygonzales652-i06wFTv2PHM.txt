uh good morning everyone nancy pelosi is a lame duck speaker lame duck nancy wants us as republicans to be distracted she wants us to talk about this ridiculous masked mandate she wants to divide us but we're not going to be divided we're going to be focused on one thing securing our southern border and helping the american people my district is over 40 percent of our southern border this is what i'm seeing every single day yesterday uh yesterday my mayors my judges my sheriffs my border patrol agents reached out things are as bad as they've ever been and they're only getting worse and what do we have in el paso at fort bliss you have the secretary you have secretary mayorkus hiding the fact that covid is spreading in these detention centers upward of 20 of migrants have covet these children have coveted i have six children it is terrible to see the conditions that these young children are having to go through meanwhile over 1.1 million illegal immigrants have come through our southern border unvaccinated without mask and yet you're demanding that folks have a mask mandate it is absolutely ludicrous also on the ground the you're seeing catch and release numbers you're seeing over 50 000 migrants being released into small communities small communities that can't handle the influx of migrants from haiti from venezuela from from africa from asia from across the world they cannot handle it this is this does not need to fall on the border patrol i want to be very clear house republicans stand firm for law and order we stand firm with border patrol agents they are doing god's work securing our border they're doing god's work saving migrant lives in the big bend sector they just put up uh rescue beacons i mean this is the desert this is the chihuahuan desert imagine being a migrant traveling three or four days in the hot desert sun and you come across a rescue beacon that saves your lives border patrol agents and share ups and local law enforcement are saving lives every day this is the crisis that the biden administration coupled with nancy pelosi have created and it's pure and utter chaos so republicans will not be distracted we will ensure we will constantly fight to secure our southern border and with that i want to turn it over to brad wenstrup thank you

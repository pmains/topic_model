good afternoon I'm congresswoman laurie Trahan i want to thank you for joining today's telephone town hall our sixth since this pandemic began I'm so glad to be joined today by two outstanding yes professor Monica ghalichi and dr. Parviz sabeti who will spend the next hour helping me answer your questions about covin 19 our economy and what our path forward might look like before we get to your questions I'd like to give you a brief overview of where we are in the fight against this virus and give an update on the additional release coming from Washington so nationwide more than 1.3 million people have tested positive for kovat 19 and tragically over 81 thousand men and women have died our state currently has the fourth highest number of cases in the nation with more than 78,000 people testing positive and the third highest number of deaths with more than 5,000 people succumbing to the virus nearly 60% of them residents in long-term care senior facilities the economic harm to our workers and entrepreneurs continues to worsen earlier today we received updated unemployment numbers in this past week nearly three million more people filed for unemployment bringing the total number of applicants nationwide to 36 and a half million since mid-march here in Massachusetts more than 44,000 people filed last week putting us just over a million workers who have filed for unemployment benefits since this outbreak began these numbers are staggering and the threat of the corona virus remains so serious for all of us but we have begun to flatten the curve in recent weeks and that's thanks to each of you your commitment to staying informed staying positive and most importantly staying home has gone a long way toward slowing the spread of Kovan 19 and I'm so grateful to each of you for doing your part the reality is that our collective action did prevent a surge on our community hospitals and we owe that to our hospitals preparedness but also to all of you for staying home we're not out of the woods yet as the number of new cases declines it's important that we acknowledge that our heroes are still fighting around the clock to save lives and to keep us safe and they're relying on us to continue acting responsibly even as we turn part of our attention toward the governor's new newly released plan to reopen our state I know we'll be talking more about the governor's plan later however it's important that as we think about the best way to reopen Massachusetts and to jumpstart our economy we do so in a way that protects workers and their families while also preventing the surge in coronavirus cases I think dr. Fauci said it best when he testified before the Senate on Tuesday cautioning that if states or cities reopen too soon there is a substantial risk of another outbreak that may be hard for us to control so it's incumbent upon us to be cautious agile and vigilant as we waive these new waters and as we continue to meet the milestones pivotal to ensuring a safe reopening it's also critical that we understand that the road to recovery may be a long one which is why I'll be working in Washington to make sure you have the resources you need to get through this so far Congress has passed 2.7 trillion dollars in emergency relief funding to help families and small businesses and to keep our health care heroes first responders and emergency workers safe but what's clear now more than ever is that we are going to need to do a lot more to ensure that we don't leave anyone behind that's why I'll be returning to Washington tonight to vote on the heroes Act a three trillion dollar relief package that delivers on many of the needs of our heroes working on the frontlines or working families who are doing everything they can to make ends meet as well as vital aid to our state's our cities and towns and hospitals specifically the heroes Act provides 75 billion dollars for the testing tracing and treatment we need in order to have a science-based path to safely reopen our country giving every American access to free coronavirus treatment one trillion dollars for state and local governments that desperately need funds to pay for health care workers police fire transportation EMTs teachers and other vital workers who keep us safe and are in danger of losing their jobs it will also establish a two hundred billion dollar hero's fund to ensure that essential workers received hazard pay for families struggling to pay their bills this legislation provides a much-needed second round of direct cash payments of up to $1,200 per person and six thousand per family it allocates another 175 billion dollars to help cover rent mortgage and utility payments and expands federal subsidies for Cobra premiums so that families don't go without health insurance as a result of Kovan 19 it also includes a hundred million dollars to provide direct services such as home delivered and prepackaged meals and supportive services for our seniors and disabled individuals and their caregivers through CMS states will get 150 million dollars to establish and implement nursing strike team that would deploy to senior living homes or skilled nursing facilities like the life care centers within 72 hours of three residents or employees being diagnosed with or even suspected of having kovat 19:00 it builds incentives for long-term care facilities to create Cova 19 specific facilities and include safety and quality protections for patients furthermore the US Department of Health and Human Services would be required to provide additional assistance to facilities struggling with infection control and collect data on Cova 19 and nursing home which would be publicly reported the heroes Act also provides additional funding for our food security programs and like snap and WIC food banks and child nutrition programs and for our students who have been doing such an incredible job learning from home over these last two months this legislation provides ninety billion dollars for state and local governments to ramp up online learning and close the digital divide that exists in too many urban and rural communities it improves and extends the Paycheck protection program to ensure funds are getting to true small businesses and nonprofits to keep them afloat as they take steps to responsibly open passing this bill will be an important step and the Senate should move without delay to pass it as well now before I introduce our star guests I'd like to take this moment to thank you all again for your commitment to staying informed into keeping our community safe you know each day that we continue doing our part gets us that much closer to the stay at home order being lifted so please continue doing what you're doing so that our emergency workers can continue to do their jobs stay at home as much as you can keep washing your hands and disinfecting those frequently touched surfaces if you have to go out in public be sure to wear a mask and maintain social distancing and most importantly check in on the check in on your loved ones virtually or by phone so that we all stay connected these past two months have been a marathon and we're all feeling stressed exhausted and isolated but there is a light at the end of the tunnel and it's so important right now that we remain committed to staying the course so that we all get through this together okay now I'd like to take a moment to introduce our expert panelists who will be answering your questions for the next for the next hour that we have our first our first star is dr. Monica ghalichi professor of economics and chair of the economics department at UMass Lowell she was born and raised in pia chenza Italy and came to the United States in 1987 to further pursue her studies she holds an Italian doctorate of research and economic policy and a PhD in economics from Boston University prior to joining the University of Massachusetts at Lowell she worked at the workers compensation Research Institute and at the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2007 she won the X beam prize awarded by an int Li by the Eastern Economic Association to the author of the most outstanding article in the eastern economic journal in 2008 she received the teaching Innovation Program certificate of achievement awarded by the American Economic Association committee on economic education and in 2012 she was nominated become a new member of the National Academy of Social Insurance a UMass Lowell professor khaleesi teaches classes and the principles of micro and macroeconomics labor economics and health economics additionally she's a member of the leadership team of the Center for Women in work and serves on several committees at the department college and university levels professor galaxy we are so pleased you could join us today you're welcome I'm happy to be here and contribute any way I can I am a liberal economist which means I study how employers and workers interact and how his interaction affect the profitability of businesses as well as we will being of workers and families and I've been studying for a long time how when a big shark happens in the life of workers such as a health event or an injury how fees affects the long term economic well-being of this person and the household so I'm coming to the analysis of his crisis with his background and as you said I'm also from Italy and so I've been observing what that country and what Europe has started doing to handle this crisis a few weeks before we face it and so this is what I'm bringing to the table well thank you we know I know that we're going to benefit greatly from your expertise and your insight our next star is dr. Pardus sabeti a distinguished computational biologist medical and evolutionary geneticist dr. savetti is currently a professor at the center for systems biology and Department of organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard University and the department of immunology and infectious disease at the Harvard School of Public Health she is also an institute member of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT and a Howard Hughes investigator dr. savetti is a World Economic Forum young global leader and a National Geographic emerging Explorer finally she was named a Time magazine Person of the Year as one of the Ebola fighters dr. savetti thank you for taking the time to be with us today thank you so much congressman johannem so pleased to be here and grateful for this opportunity to connect with the community and looking forward to the conversation terrific we're thrilled to have both of you here today and I'll just say I was enormous ly proud to describe this particular expert panel to my 6 and 10 year old daughters and show them examples of women reading and science economics and academia so without further delay let's dive into your questions dr. savetti the first question is for you and it comes from Susan k in Lowell she asks was testing becoming available should I go even if I have no symptoms and get tested to the virus and tested for the antibodies um okay well that yeah Thank You Susan for the question it's a very good question and it's one that we're all trying to figure out ourselves so you know let me turn down paksa that the kind of different questions you have so it's the idea that if you don't have any symptoms at all should you get tested I mean there are I mean in that case you reasons to be the reasons to get tested is if you you know either have symptoms in are words that you're ill or you've been in contact with someone that has been ill and you want to you know be sure that you're not an asymptomatic carrier as we know with Wachovia there are a lot of asymptomatic carriers and that will have the spread go further if that's the case there are you know there are times in which we are doing testing of individuals who are healthy even without a potential risk exposure another reason to be suspect kovat and that is in cases where is something that's being contemplated on a broader basis for return to work for you know doing screening and so those are some of the things that may roll out is screaming of healthy people just to test to see if it's available that will hopefully get a lot more pleasant if as the technologies are a lot of technical out to say and a great one out of Yale but others out of China as well that shows that saliva and that the virus is in your saliva and in fact it's even more sensitive that there's higher amounts of virus in the saliva and that it may be around even for a longer period of time in your saliva and that all just makes testing a very different proposition the imagine if you every time you to get tested you had to take a nasal pharyngeal swab and essentially tickle your brain to do it people wouldn't want to do that so that is those are the things that hopefully will have breakthroughs so that testing can become more available and more accessible to a lot of people and I know right now that's the big issues you know getting access but you know it is something where there's a lot of discussion about testing people who are healthy I think you'll you'll continue to hear about that and we'll see where we're at it at each each point but I do think that I'm somebody spent a lot of my career doing diagnostics and and surveillance work and so believe very much that detection is is a you know and necessary not sufficient but the necessary kind of step to the foundations and so hopefully will make that something that's possible but ultimately it's something you do for specific reasons and the other question you had a bit about the tested for antibodies in that case you know yes a lot of people are doing testing for antibodies and it's a in a very interesting area and you're potentially exciting area to see whether or not we can start to identify you know people who have been exposed and and may get a sense of what is our herd immunity who is people that might be protected there's a lot of open questions still about that there's some sensitivity and specificity issues of the tests themselves that means how accurate are they and and and you know how much do they tell you and then there's the questions of what does it mean if you've had exposure and does that really you know we still are a lot of that is still coming into focus terrific so thank you for that dr. savetti I mean that is a common question that we get is it safe to say that we don't know if you've had the virus it doesn't necessarily mean that you're immune yeah great question and I think that for for that one it is also so yeah this is one of these very interesting situations in which we learn about the virus in December and and you know here we are just few months later trying to learn as we go build a plane as we fly understand it and you know we have had some experience to a virus like this ours you know this is a very large like virus and MERS and others so we have some understanding of the immunity and work and those researchers all over the world looking at this right now but we still haven't looked at enough individuals who we don't have enough cohorts and studies of individual to have been infected and then you had and then to see whether or not they've been reinfected we'd actually have to do a number of things to do that well we want to have those antibody tests available to start saying what does the immune response look like are they mount an immune response do we see one here we'd actually want to be testing regularly to see if any point if they have gotten the virus again and we'd also want to sequence any cases that we see that means reading out the entire genome sequence of the virus itself and what that does is it tell it's a way of really identifying that not just that you have Cove is that you have a particular instance of Co bit of you know really taking a close look at the virus and that means if we ever saw anybody test you know positive and then again test positive sometime later we would be able to say hey is this this person very infected or are they or are they just carrying that same virus that's sort of showing up again somehow so I think those are the things that we still don't know um but you know there is there's a sense you know we see obviously a lot of immunology and in medicine that once you've been exposed to a virus you either don't get it again or you're at lower risk but those are the things we still need to figure out and as we really contemplate these serology tests a question we have is you know what does it mean it doesn't mean you can't get it again does it and does it also that's one important question is our use at yourself safe and then the other important question is does it mean you can't carry it and give it to somebody else so it protects you from getting disease but you still could carry the virus you are you truly you know immune and protected so anyway those are I don't have specific answers yet I can just kind of guide you through what are the things we're doing to be able to answer them so we don't know yet so even if we start doing the serology or start thinking about that we don't yet know what that means what we're figuring it out that you know yeah no absolutely and it's so helpful and it's a good reminder of how early we are in in understanding you know this this virus so thank you for that professor Galicia Danielle be from Chelmsford wants to know our consideration is being given to the need to have child care in order to reopen the economy working parents without child care are being woefully left behind and unsupported could you speak to that yes I think Danielle is unfortunately hitting on one of the key elements which may will make possible for us to go back to whatever is going to be the new normal and so have we thought about the issue associated with child care in a way we have because we the first response we had with the families first coronavirus response Act which was passed in March and made possible for your employer to pay you up to 2/3 of your regular rate rate of compensation for up to 12 weeks if your child was in a school which was closed or if your childcare center closed unfortunately the reality for most families right now is that these 12 weeks periods is coming to an end and unless we are coming with a new proposal we're putting your proposal on the table on how we specifically address the needs for families with children we're really creating a situation which is unsustainable for working families I understand that the president of the Senate in Massachusetts Karen's palaka is pushing for Neff were to use some of the funds to support houses with child care but they threw the matter is that schools are closed child care most acres and are closed up to the end of June and summer camps and the opening of summer programs is completely still up in the air I do think this is an area where maybe people who are in con the control and design policies may want to look a little bit of what is done in other countries and what has happened in other countries were intervention I have arranged from providing providing public child care to working parents in essential services to give direct financial support to workers with children in my country in Italy we're talking about a babysitter check so families below a certain income level receive a set amount of money per child to support them through fees times other countries are giving financial subsidies to employers who provide workers with paid leave or maybe push for more flexible work arrangement for example in some public jobs in public sector I also would like to take this opportunity to add bring focus to something which I don't think is discussed we are talking about childcare but I am afraid that something we are ignoring is way too early what is going to be the need for elderly care I read more and more that family legitimately so are revising their idea of potentially sending them elderly parents and so on on in assisted living facilities in nursing homes because of the fear of the virus and so I think household will be potentially until we find a vaccine will be potentially dealing with additional let's call it burden of elderly care so I think pieces also please will have to be recognized I think by any kind of policy which tries to address an issue I think it would be interesting to move a little bit quickly now especially for the summer I think we have unfortunate unfortunately an army of young people who are graduating looking for jobs and finding job and potentially cooled at least over the summer provide support to families but I think it would be nice to have his effort regulated this is what I think we are where we are in college I know No thank you so much there is no question that kovat 19 has put a spotlight on so many of our gaps in our in our system in terms of you know we have over 30 million people who didn't have access to paid sick leave we don't have paid family medical leave standard in our country even child care it's you know we've got one in three essential workers one in three in three essential workers are women they wake up each day and they go to work to deliver life-saving services and they need child care right so this is a this is a big issue I'm hoping that because I took office with a record number of women that we can get at this because it was a it was an issue before covin 19 it certainly has been exacerbated and it will continue to be as you just described care is going to take on a whole new meaning as we go forward and frankly our you know our nation's long-term well-being and our economic recovery will depend on a care infrastructure that's equitable when you know one that works for every family I think this next question is for me and it comes from Pat B in Concord and she asks while everyone is being affected by this virus people of color and people with lesser mean seem to be impacted in higher numbers what is our state doing to mitigate this Pat it's it's indisputable that the Cova 19 crisis has a disproportionate impact on communities of color on and that's on all fronts from per capita hospitalization and death to economic hardship and I do think that kovin 19 has woke many people up to the disturbing reality that this pandemic exacerbates existing barriers that people of color people look Lessing from those living in under-resourced areas and and people with disabilities face and have faced well before covet 19 and it's unacceptable you know I do think that in order to change these disparities we need data and we frankly need courage I joined my friend and my colleague congresswoman Ayanna Presley and introducing legislation that would require the federal government to collect and report racial and ethnic data related to Kovan 19 the CDC excuse me the Center for Disease Control has released very limited racial and ethnic breakdowns on the impact of the corona virus and still with that limited lens the trends are disturbing we need a complete picture so that we can direct resources and policies to get at this problem in its totality the lack of information is concerning particularly because data on race and ethnicity is crucial to understanding of testing and information is accessible across communities of color especially in immigrant communities like Lowell and Lawrence so our bill is designed to ensure that we have the data necessary to optimize relief efforts for minority communities but let's be super clear the data is just the first step and I suspect that the data is only going to confirm our instincts so we need to be ready to make dramatic changes on how we educate all of our children how we create career pathways that haven't traditionally been accessible to kids in gateway cities like Lowell Lawrence Haverhill we need to extend healthcare and child care to everyone in this country and extend opportunities that have been systematically barricaded from communities of color so Pat thank you thank you for your thoughtful question we certainly have a lot of work ahead of us okay so dr. savetti we're going to turn back to you for this next question it's from Susan D and you spoke a lot about testing and in the virus and how much you know where it's evolving and how much we're learning she wants to know specific about contact tracing how that's progressing and maybe just you know what it what it is for folks who don't understand you know what what it means will it be used as a metric on how governor Baker will reopen the state for business yeah sure so you know contact tracing is fundamentally based on a on is the ability to track down any individual who's been in contact with somebody who has tested positive for coded and it's our ability to see how far a particular the case of of COBIT has been able to go and to move and spread and in the ability to do that makes it so that we can you stop these new outbreaks these new infections and stop for the individual spread of the virus it's fundamentally based on the fact that you know viruses are communicable they're spread from person to person they that that's an important piece of information we that we have in general are in our medical care system that helps us write it with so many things we don't know like why people get certain diseases the nice thing about infectious disease is it's very simple calculus if you you see the virus you'll be you know that is the exposure that will will cause a risk so it's good that we we know that and we can use that information and it's undeniable the importance of contact tracing in in in stopping these outbreaks it's and and also the undeniable the need to be able to use the best technology that we have to do so to be able to get that kind of information in real time even prior to the kovat outbreak we were might here at Harvard and across the higher ed consortium of the in Boston in the Boston area where we have 110 institutions of higher learning we really got the deep down into the the value of contact tracing because we saw this month outbreak spread from the sports teams at Harvard to the residential colleges to the dining halls and we were trying to get a much real-time information as possible to see where this virus was popping up in different places and as it was then showing up on different campuses and even at that point we started developing apps and thinking about the different kinds of ways that technologies can be used like Bluetooth and GS coordinates to help us really track it down as well as possible and to inform people when they may have been exposed and so that is there's a lot of efforts here in in Massachusetts and around the country to enhance those kinds of technologies enhance that ability so far they have not the contact tracing that's happening has still been relatively traditional you know using phone contacts and calling there are some different actually a dizzying number of apps that people have developed but but still not that much adoption of them in order to to be used and ultimately kind of you know Susan to answer your question it's one of these things that it's so powerful but has to be used really really well and I think it's an important metric for governor Baker to reopen it is how well are we tracking down these cases and something that everyone's on top of to try to make happen but also has to be done very very well right so one of the big things that we're seeing in places like Chelsea you're pointing to this important issue of populations that are more vulnerable is that people don't want to come to attention and they don't want to be engaged because they don't trust the system is going to take care of them you know they're they're afraid that they'll be reported for immigration or they'll be something else that happens and so we're seeing a crisis right now where the contact system is really needed to stop an outbreak from spreading but but was also leading to discrimination against LGBT individuals because of the nature of the the individuals evening so that is a it is one of these very very important very very fraught issues and to kind of go back to so that's a lot of what we're at to cope go back to you know your question I think it will become new contact tracing so is progress there's a lot of activity towards it we're not there yet we're not in this country we're not we're not doing it the same way as some of these other countries where they Institute it and they require you to do it we're out you know we're trying to get adoption and we're trying to be thoughtful about how it's done so it's done carefully and doesn't lead to misuse or exploitation but our ability to identify cases is going to be very critical to our ability to come back into society and to to engage that we need to know that one event one super spreader event doesn't put us right back you know you know back to square one so we have to be moving that as fast as we can and that's sort of why the communities is working as hard as they are to develop something that can be used right I certainly thank you for your leadership in that on that I mean we're fortunate that the Commonwealth has been a leader in this space and you know fruit for those of you that aren't familiar in April the Massachusetts Department of Public Health contracted with Partners in Health to create the contact tracing collaborative which manages this statewide operation and I do want to flag for everyone who's listening now that some people assume that these calls from contact tracers or case investigators are spam or they're it's a hoax and and they're not answering their phone when reached and so I my messages help us help you all catch all contact tracing calls start with the prefix 833 or 857 so please pick up the phone if you get that number on your caller ID because the participation is vital to tracing isolating and stopping Cova 19 and it's in its tracks okay this next question is it's actually from me annex to Professor believe see you have researched in depth the employment outcomes of injured workers over a time period when the country introduced policy reforms that that increased labor market flexibility with reduced job security and in many ways it's kind of what we're seeing happen in America's market right now what advice do you have for those who are looking to the job market of the future okay so and I think there are some similarities and some big differences between what happened to an individual who has a major and negative shock such an is an injury and what happens to his or her working life compared to what happens to people who are losing their job now so they in a way the problem whenever there is a job interruption is that people end up losing income because any time of work somehow leads to a deterioration of your skills you lose knowledge of what is happening your company your your business and Sophie's makes you less marketable less appealing when you're trying to find another job and fees is clearly something which happens to a worker will get injured and to a worker who now loses a job because of the virus now the difference is that usually previous individual events such as a job injury or you know you were fired or whatever come with a stigma come with make very very single you out now we are all on this together clearly people have been hittin very differently as you pointed out before depending on the jobs industries and they were dealing with but nobody can be considered at fault for what is happening to him or to her the economy was put on a stop because we needed to stop this virus so if you lost your job is not because you were not performing well it's not because you did something which was not working out it was not good a good match between your employer you just couldn't go back to work because they told you you couldn't do any longer because it was no longer safer so in a way and workers will face this wave of layoffs will not have if you want the burden are that is open car carried by people who are the only one losing their jobs in a community or in their network so these are the good news but is no sleep I don't think it is going to be a stigma which is going to affect your likelihood of being appealing to an employer down the line the bad news here is a weather that anytime this kind of crisis happen we don't go back to where we were before things change and things change and often the burden of a change is put on worker to give you an example pre virus of a big discussion among labor economist was okay now that we have his wave of [Music] artificial intelligence and your technology what will happen to jobs and one of the answers which will sometimes given was well some of the jobs which will be safe despite fees artificial intelligence and so on wave are going to be the jobs which require a lot of human interaction a lot of customer relations those are the jobs which are always going to be needed with well you will never be able to replace the human with the robot and now we see in this situation that we are exactly at a crisis with those type of jobs so this is saying that workers now more than even before in a way when they enter the labor market or when we try to go back to find to the jobs really have to be aware that probably the idea of a job which is the traditionally job long you know good long lasting job and so on is which may be available server patterns having is not going to be was not Filip feasible already any longer is going to be even more difficult to get down the line and when I'm saying the burden is going to be put on workers is because workers are going to be put in a situation where they will have to revise and update their skills continuously I think fees actually you know we over the last month most of us were forced to become very familiar with working online functioning online maybe now is a time for pushing even more opportunities and enforcing the structure which can provide that type of education to workers who need to update their skills so I'm thinking about I understand well but is no money we're starting for money but institutions such as community colleges or let me you know say state university of state institution and which provides somehow a more affordable education are really be places that need to get support because workers need to be able to go back to places where I will develop the skills for the jobs that are going to be available to them at this point so the message to potential workers now is going to be yes you are on the front line even if you are not an essential employees in the sense that you really will have to do a lot of work to invent yourself for an economy which is not clear they say misshape it will be and and yes we're effort is going to be put on you in terms of getting ready and gaining the skills that are going to be needed now but I think the government needs to make it easier for them by supporting their institutions which can provide them with this type of education that's that is terrific and there's no question that workplaces jobs are going to change in some cases dramatically which will absolutely impact our you know our workforce training how we educate our young people and are all people so I said on the education labor committee and what that sounded like is I need to invite you down Washington actually where we're meeting on zoom' these days so but you must testify in front of in front of our committee on what we need to be prepared for in terms of you know reverse engineering our education system to deal with these adjustments that our workers ultimately will have to make so thank you for that okay all I'm going to take this next question it's from Rebecca in Foxborough she she wants to know what is the status of post office funding and what is being done to protect it and fully fund it that's a great question and I've actually heard from a lot of constituents about the post the posts or postal service during this ongoing public health crisis our frontline postal workers and our post offices they require immediate support to maintain maintain you know our on-time consistent deliveries that frankly we've relied on for centuries this service is especially important right now especially for vulnerable populations like our seniors and those with disabilities people who rely on mail deliveries for medicine for food and other essential supplies so as we inch closer to the upcoming presidential election and ramp up our efforts to vote by mail for example our Postal Service will play a key role in sustaining our democracy ensuring that everyone can access the ballot box in November earlier this year the Postmaster General of the US Postal Service projected that they would lose thirteen billion dollars in revenue this fiscal year and run out of funds by September without substantial federal relief and it was it's for that reason that I support the protect our post offices Act it would provide emergency funding to the Postal Service these fees phone would replenish lost revenue purchase PPE for postal workers and it would maintain our postal offices I'm pleased to share that this bill it was incorporated into the package that I'll be voting on in Congress tomorrow in fact the heroes Act included twenty five billion dollars to keep the postal service open and help protect the mail men and women we've all come to know so well so as we craft and negotiate additional funding packages to mitigate the impacts of kovat 919 I will certainly continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Postal Service has the resources necessary to protect postal workers so that they're given the help that's critically needed to safely continue providing those services we've come to rely on so thank you for that question dr. savetti been from Drake it asks given your experience with the Ebola outbreak what other challenges do you think we are facing or will face because of these stay at home and isolation measures that we had to put in place should we be preparing for mental health issues post Kovac 19 in both children and adults dr. savetti we lose you or you on mute I am on mute hello Harry kosis sorry about that I was trying to reduce the noise autism offer that I was saying banned that I appreciate that that's a question that's near and dear to my heart I yeah the the it's a that's a we are fundamentally going to see some you know some really a a lot of collateral damage a lot of serious impacts from social distancing and you know I I don't think any scientist is for social distancing you know at its base note no one wants social distancing to happen the frustration that most scientists feel and and most people in the field like I feel is that you know there should have been a lot more funding and support well in advance to make sure that we had this near the ability to detect and survey everywhere so that we wouldn't be in this kind of position because social distancing is fundamentally a blunt instrument that is hat you Molly Campbell my slab sort of kind of always infuses this in me that's important you know how how challenging how terrible it is and you know and and the fact of the matter is that what wakes me up in the morning every day and gets me motivated to keep going seven days a week twenty hours a day is knowing every single person who is trapped in the home trapped in a home that is dangerous via that is unsettling or alone by themselves they're in their own mind and in this confusion and so fundamentally we have to get out of this as soon as possible because we know the impacts are going to be great and of course yes we're going to have we are seeing it right now we're seeing hot you know Rises and suicides and overdose rates we're seeing Rises and sexual and domestic abuse and so there's a lot that we're going to be unpacking from that but there's also a lot that we could do better around social distancing itself I'm a scientist and I and thinking through like how this is done i I'm not I don't know why every single person has to be by themselves or or why we lost people in certain situations what we need to do is identify and there's a you know working folks as a Media Lab and others to be thinking through you know what is the number that need in a commune right you don't need every person to be by themselves you just need a salaita unit and ideally like a mess of an isolated unit where their safety around children and others or everyone's in a safe spot I think that we could be doing a lot more to think about about that and as we start to return to work I hope a lot of the attention is to to that to try to create you know safe units of groups of individuals same thing with this you know question that is also near to our heart watching all of my staff trying to work while managing childcare issues is why do we have so many nannies out of work why do we have so many people of not having childcare could that couldn't each nanny pair up with one or two or three or a few families and could couldn't we work those things out let's be creative not just in the science that we're doing but in how we manage all of this that that we have a lot of these individuals who are out of work that provide services for homes how can we do it where we just think about how to create these group communities small groups sustained groups that can be themselves monitoring and paying attention and keeping infections out of that group but anyway so so I I mean that that's the kind of thing that is I think so important to also be thinking about is how do we get out of this right now and then how do we think about how to do this in the future in a way that doesn't we don't have to expect that every time a virus gets out we're going to tank the economy have serious unemployment and rising suicide mental health issues I just think that that can't be our new normal that just it just can't be we as a country and as a species and you know as a humanity is better than that we can be more creative than that I couldn't agree more and safe units of work that is that is a great phrase because you're absolutely right I mean it's it's taking a toll and I think it's important to acknowledge that isolation and social distancing is a blunt instrument and it's one that's hard you know to overcome because it's just not what we're used to so it's one of the reasons why we are investing in you know testing and scaling those testing those tests so quickly and also bringing you know the manufacturing back to the United States having more of a domestic supply chain so that we can quickly ramp whether its treatment therapies vaccines testing kits all of that so that you know we don't have to go back to a blunt instrument like the one where we're living through right now so thank you for that okay I'm mindful of the time so professor gali see we're turning it back to you for this next question it's from Margaret and then Muldrow and she would like to hear about plans for reopening the economy in Massachusetts what you what steps will be taken to ensure our safety how do we think about the the phases as they've been described so far so I am afraid the details about the four phases which were presented by government by Governor Baker about how we go back to work are very very very vague and so I think everybody is waiting for next week to figure out which actually kind of jobs and businesses will be given the permission to start running again I think the criteria which is clearly defined is that the first jobs which will open up are the one where we have a low risk of carbon 19 transmission which means jobs wherever is going to be little customers interaction or where social distancing is more likely implemented we don't have many more details and souls and so I think for each single person to understand whether you will be able to go back to work it will largely depend not only on the type of industry you are working in but specifically in your facility will it be easy to implement some of the overall safety standards that now Massachusetts is talking about and for safety standards go from again implementing social distancing with a famous infamous 6/5 distance a use of masks to the implementation of his a gene protocols so we need to have hand-washing capabilities throughout where workplace we have to need to have very clean and a clear schedule and system for a cleaning and disinfecting the workplace training about social distancing and fees I gene may measures a clear system where workers will have symptoms do not report to work and at the same time a clear path for his workers to go back to work whenever possible so again it would depend on the nature of a job but also on to which extent your facilities is able to address these standards which seem pretty minimal to me but again I'm not the expert here and there are also some other approaches which are discussed for example one is the idea of phasing workers back in based on age group with an idea that we are going to send first back to work the youngest between 20 and 45 and then one between 45 and 65 and then they even were older because because of the clear evidence that older people are more at risk now cc's are very sounds a very reasonable plan at the same time we have to think at almost 1/4 of the employed people in the United States are more than 55 years old so a policy or an approach which will bring first back to work younger is going to leave behind quite a larger number of people and also the fact that many people do not live isolated so to extend that you have somebody who is slightly older who lives with younger people were back at work we had then the problem of potentially bringing the infection back into the house when the younger person comes back home but I also would like to say some other approaches that I think we should look a little bit closer by looking at what has worked so far in other countries for example Germany has made his policy of not leaving so much people at work but having people back at work at reduced time and the state compensate for the difference and also when they go back and bring them back more in shifts so having teams of workers which work longer shifts but they're all together and the purpose for doing this that when you bring things back into a work on different shifts if one person gets sick is more easily is more easy to isolate entire team but you don't need to keep an entire group of people on payroll home you will have just the group of people with whom people have been working closely with and so I think there are some other ways we can try to look at how we can potentially facilitate his return to work and but as of now my understanding is that at least the messages that we are all waiting for next Monday to understand a little bit more clear direction about what is meant by these are with jobs that where people can go back on phase one because there is a certain a large amount of vagueness is definition thank you so much for that there is so much to consider and so much more as I listened to you speak so as we get those details which I think are going to be coming out very soon we'll have to get you back on so that you can break it down break it down for us I think we have one I think we have time for one more question and then I'll wrap up this one is from Claire s and Acton and she wants to know what's being done to ensure safe and secure elections through 2020 so I'll take this one because I've said this before in previous Town Hall's and I'll I'll say it again Americans should never have to choose between their well-being and participation our democracy vote-by-mail in addition to expanded absentee and early voting and safe in-person voting for those who need it must be readily available as we navigate ourselves out of this pandemic and toward a national election there are so many lessons to be learned from other states like Wisconsin where they roll the dice on public health and safety by holding a traditional election in the middle of this pandemic I'm proud that the cares Act which is the one we passed last month it included 400 million dollars in funding to help states and local governments prepare for this year's election and it's great that Massachusetts is expected to receive about 8.2 million dollars from this allocation you know here in Massachusetts we have an opportunity to lead the nation as we often do we should immediately move to expand access to absentee ballots early voting and implement full vote-by-mail efforts through the general election that's November and and in Washington Congress has to provide additional financial assistance to States and implement voting safety standards to ensure the elections are being conducted carefully and without burdensome restrictions there's a whole suite of reforms I believe we can put into practice which I voted on back in January when I first when I was first sworn in as your representative and that it includes increased access to online voter registration and extended registration deadlines a requirement that states halt mass purges of their voting rules an investment in securing our elections from foreign interference certainly robust and immediate investments in the US Postal Service who will have to handle a massive surge and mail-in ballots and expanded in-person early voting and mandatory paper ballots I am pleased that the heroes Act that we're debating and hopefully passing tomorrow will include an additional 3.6 billion dollars in federal funding to help States plan and prepare for holding elections amid the corona virus pandemic this November the legislation also requires at least 15 days of consecutive early voting and ensures that every voter has access to no excuse absentee vote by mail and this this is a huge step in the right direction and we we need leader McConnell to address there and secure elections once and for all in the Senate chamber as well nothing should stand between the ballot box and a person exercising his or her constitutional right to vote so this it's common sense and I thank you for asking this critical question Claire sadly that is all the time we have today these events always go by so quickly I want to thank professor's ghalichi and savetti one more time for sharing their

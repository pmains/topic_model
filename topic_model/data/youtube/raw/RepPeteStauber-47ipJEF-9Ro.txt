hello everyone congressman pete sauber here i am sorry that i am unable to join you at this fantastic event this afternoon but I do appreciate the chance to address you via this video for those of you who did not know me let me give you a little bit of background on myself before becoming congressman for Minnesota's 8th congressional district I wore many hats including a because becoming a st. Louis County Commissioner city councilor and Herman tone and a law enforcement officer for the city of Duluth and I am also a small business owner 27 years ago my brothers and I fulfilled our dream of opening a small business that encompassed one of our passions the game of hockey running the Duluth hockey company was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life but it also opened my eyes to the many roadblocks that have prevented other small businesses from succeeding my background as a small business owner is a big part of what inspired me to run for Congress since much of what is decided here in our nation's capital affects small business owners ability to create local jobs and have opportunities that's why I feel fortunate to have been assigned a spot on the house Small Business Committee just a few weeks after taking the oath of office my time on the Small Business Committee has taught me a lot like how in the United States more than 1 million firms are owned by women and women-owned small business employ over nine million people that said I think there's more that we can do to help women achieve entrepreneurial success in fact I heard directly from some folks from the women Business Alliance just last month they told me about the struggle many women face when trying to become entrepreneurs and how women business centers help provide these women with their resources and capital they need to execute successful business plans that is why I have supported legislation like HR 4 zero five five the women business centers Improvement Act of 2019 which would strengthen women business centers by increasing the amount of funding as well as raising the caps on grants to the individual centers this bill passed out of committee animus Li and it is my hope we see it on the House floor soon additionally as the ranking member of the Small Business Subcommittee on contracting and infrastructure I held a hearing about the women-owned small business program which as you all well know helps women-owned small businesses land government contracts I had the opportunity to question the Small Business Association about some of the fraudulent behavior and if in efficiencies that had plagued the program these last few years when the Small Business Association does not ensure that their programs are properly managed it is our women small business owners who miss out our our women business owners deserve more and during my time in Congress I intend to hold a small business association to a high standard rest assured I remain committed to helping women lead ventures succeed because they are critical to our local communities and economy but I need your help if there's ever anything that you think I can do to further help women-owned small businesses grow create jobs and serve their communities please do not hesitate to reach out to me or a member of my staff we are here to serve you thank you very much

I feel like I've always
been called to serve. I want to serve a purpose
greater than myself. And I want to really own
a leadership position at an early age. And the service academies are a great way
to earn that opportunity. And I use "earn" very deliberately
because you really do earn the privilege to lead sailors
and Marines on a daily basis.

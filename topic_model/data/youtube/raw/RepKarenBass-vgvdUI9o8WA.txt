congresswoman let me start with you you're on the House Judiciary Committee so you have already voted in favor of for the articles of impeachment what do you think when you hear of the president's argument they're just about the precedent that is being said or perhaps it was already set 21 years ago well I think that he didn't understand it from the beginning you remember he said he'd welcome it but you know for us we felt such an incredible sense of urgency because of his attempt to interfere in the twenty twenty election and so the abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress if he thinks it's trivial remember he wouldn't give us one document he tried to ban everybody from coming to speak to us so I think that maybe the seriousness of impeachment is finally beginning to hit him

WARNING FROM BEIJING AGAINST THE VISIT. I WANT THE BRING IN SENATOR  SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA, ALEX  PADILLA. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR BEING  BACK ON THE SHOW. APPRECIATE IT. >> GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. >> SO LET ME START WITH WHAT WE  JUST TEED UP HER WITH HOUSE  SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI. YOU SIT ON THE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE. DO YOU BELIEVE THE BENEFITS OF  THE SPEAKER'S TRIP OUTWEIGH  TENTIALLY NEW THREATS FROM  CHINA? >> I BELIEVE THIS. IT IS NOT UP TO CHINA TO DICTATE WHEREHE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE  OF REPRESENTATIVES CAN TRAVEL. THAT GOES FOR ANYWHERE IN THE  WORLD. AND WHETHER IT IS IN TAIWAN OR  ANYWHERE ELSE. STANDING UP FOR DEMOCRACY IS  ALWAYS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. >> HAVE YOU TOLD THE SPEAKER  THAT YOU SUPPORT HER IN THAT  MOVE? >> SHE DOESN'T NEED TO ASK ME. I DON'T NEED TO TELL HER. SHE KNOWS. >> OF COURSE. CALIFORNIANS, LET ME ASK BUT A  DIFFERENT INTERACTION. THAT'S ONE WITH SENATOR KYRSTEN  SINEMA WHO AS YOU KNOW IS THE  CRITICAL LINCHPIN HERE TO  GETTING DONE WHAT YOU WANT TO  SEE G DONE, ON CLIME AND  HEALTH CARE AND TAX  RECONCILIATION, ET CETERA. WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE  CONVERSATIONS WITH HER. IS SHE ASKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE  THAT TAX PROVISION THAT SHE HAS  INDICATED SHE'S PREVIOUSLY  OPPOSED? >> THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD UNTIL  THE PROPOSAL THAT WILL GET DONE  OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME ABO  SENATOR SINEMA. IF I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW HER AT  ALL, I KNOW THIS MUCH. SHE READS LANGUAGE OF THE  BILL AND WILL CRUNCH THE  NUMBERS. SO SHE HASN'T ASKED ME ABOUT  SPECIFIC TAX ELEMENTS OR SEEKING AMENDMENTS OR WHAT NOT. I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD IN  THIS THAT AFFECTS NOT JUST THE  COST OF HEALTH CARE FOR THE  FAMILIES OF CALIFORNIA AND  ACROSS THE COUNTRY, REDUCING THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CLIMATE  PROVISIONS, WE SEE THE McKINNEY  FIRE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE LARGEST ALREADY THIS YEAR. AND WILDFIRE SEASON IS JUST  GETTING STARTED. ARIZONA IS IN A SIMILAR  SITUATION. EXTREME HEAT, SHORTAGE OF WATER, THOSE THINGS. SO A LOT FOR ME TO LIKE ABOUT  THE BILL, A LOTTER TO SENATOR  SINEMA TOIKE ABOUT IT. >> GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF GOOD THAT IS IN THIS BILL, WOULD YOU BE  OKAY, THEN, IF FOR EXAMPLE THING SHE HAS PREVIOUSLY OPPOSED END  UP COMING OUT OF THE BILL? THEY'RE NOT MAKE OR BREAK. SPECIFICALLY THE TAX PROVISION. WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH GETTING  ON BOARD WITH SOMETHING THAT A  LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN IT LOOKS  RIGHT NOW? >> WE'LL SEE. I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH  HYPOTHETICALS. IF WE JUST LOOK AT THE BIG  CATEGORIES HERE. CAN WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT ACTION  TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE? NOT JUST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT  THE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE  INCLUDING THE SUBSIDIES, THAT  WOULD BE A HUGE WIN. NOT JUST FOR US BUT FOR WORKING  FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN THE PROCESS, MAKING AN  HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN  ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. IT IS NOT JUST WILDFIRES IN  CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE IN THE  WEST. WE LOOK AT THE FLOODING  HAPPENING IN KENTUCKY. THIS IS LESS THAN A YEAR FROM  WHEN THEY HAD THE DEVASTATING  TORNADOES IN KENTUCKY, OUTSIDE  OF, QUOTE, UNQUOTE, TORNADO  SEASON. EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS ARE  HAPPENING. IF WEATHER PATTERNS ARE  CHANGING, IT IS BECAUSE OUR  CLIMATE IS CHANGING AND WE HAVE  TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. >> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT A LOT OF THE WHEEL IN MOTION AS I  RELATES TO ACCESS TO ABORTION. YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT'S  EXECUTIVE ORDER. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT  DOCTORS. YOU HAVE SENATOR TIM KAINE THAT  WOULD CODIFY UNDER ROE. BUT YOUR COLLEAGUE, SENATOR  RICHARD BLUMENTHAL. WE CAUGH UP WITH HIM. HE SAID HE WON'T SUPPORT THAT  BILL. LISTEN. >>> I THINK GIVING THAT POWER TO POLITICIANS IN ROBES IS AS BAD  AS GIVING TO IT STATE  LEGISLATURES BECAUSE THEY'VE  INDICATED THEY WILL CUT BACK AND ELIMINATE THOSE RIGHTS. >> ARE YOU A ALL CONCERNED THAT THE WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR  COLLEAGUES AND THE PRESIDENT ARE DOING IS MOOT AS LONG AS THERE  IS A SUPREME COURT AND  LEGISLATURES THAT WANT TO DO  AWAY WITH IT? >> DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING  SINCE BEFORE THE DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT TO PROTECT A  WOMAN'S RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. IF THAT'S THEIR CHOICE, AND THE  RIGHTS ABORTION, IT SHOULDN'T BE A STATE BY STATE RIGHT. IT SHOULD BE CODIFIED INTO  FEDERAL LAW. WE TRIED THAT. REPUBLICANS BLOCK  IT. WE TRIED THE MAKE IT CLEAR THAT  WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE IT  ACROSS STATE LINES TO GET THE  CARE THEY NEED. REPUBLICANS HAVE BLOCKED THAT. WE'VE TRIED TO CODIFY THE RIGHT  TO CONTRACEPTION. REPUBLICANS HAVE BLOCKED THAT. REPUBLICANS HAVE CONTINUED TO  OBSTRU FOR HEALTH CARE  PROVERS IN STATES WHERE  ABORTION IS LEGAL. AND SO WE'RE CONTINUING THE  FIGHT HERE IN CONGRESS. BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY ENCOURAGED  BY THE VOTERS OF KANSAS WHO  TURNED OUT IN RECORD NUMBERS  YESTERDAY TO UPHOLD THE RIGHT IN THE STATE OF KANSAS. I THINK IT IS A STRONG MESSAGE  THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD LEAD AS WE APPROACH THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. >> BEFORE I LET YOU GO, IN THE  LIMITED TIME WE HAVE LEFT. A QUICK LIGHTNING ROUND. ONE AS IT RELATES TO THE PARTY  AT LARGE. THE OTHER IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO YOU IN CALIFORNIA. TWO TOP HOUSE DEMOCRATS, JERRY  NADLER AND CAROL MALONEY HAVE  BEEN FORCED INTO A FACE-OFF  BECAUSE OF THE REDISTRICTING. THERE WERE SOME INTERESTING  RESPONSES LAST NIGHT WHEN IT  CAME TO PRESIDENT BIDEN AND  2024. I WANT THE PLAY A PIECE OF IT. >> SHOULD PRESIDENT BIDEN RUN  AGAIN IN 2024? >> TOO EARLY TO SAFETY IT  DOESN'T SERVE THE PURPOSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO DEAL WITH  THEM UNTIL AFTER THE MID-TERMS. >> MISS MALONEY? >> I DON'T BELIEVE HE'S RUNNING  FOR RE-ELECTION. >> MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE A CLEAR  ANSWER HERE. SHOULD THE PARTY BE ON THE  TICKET IN 2024? >> LIKE I'VE HEARD PRESIDENT  BIDEN SAY, IT IS HIS INTENTION  TO RUN. IF HE RUNS, I WILL SUPPORT HIM  ABSOLUTELY. I ALSO BELIEVE 2024 IS 2024. WE HAVE MID-TERM ELECTIONS. . SO AT STAKE. ABORTION CARE. WE HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED AND BE  READY. >> I CAN'T LET SOMEBODY FROM  CALIFORNIA GO WITHOUT ASKING FOR YOUR REFLECTIONS ON THE LOSS OF  A LEGEND, VIN SKULLY, WHO DIED  OVERNIGHT, WE LEARNED. SOMEBODY SUPER IMPORTANT TO  PEOPLE IN THAT STATE. NOT JUST DODGER FANS BUT PEOPLE  WHO LOVE BASEBALL. >> THANK YOU FOR ASKING. YOU KNOW I'M A BASEBALL FAN. I GREW ALL THAT DODGER FAN. AS A KID GROWING UP IN LOS  ANGELES IN THE 80s, DODGER FAN,  LISTENING TO VIN SKULLY, HIS  SMOOTH VOICE, HIS STORY TELLING. HE WAS A LEGEND. AND WILL BE ABSOLUTELY MISSED. NOT JUST FOR DODGER FANS,  BASEBALL

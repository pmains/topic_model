hey where were you a thousand days ago can't remember i know three years was a long time ago for me i measure it by looking at photos of my five kids to see how much they've changed yet that's how long it's been since senate democrats have passed a budget can you imagine if your family or a local business didn't budget for one month much less 36 months if you're feeling outraged or surprised you should be it's outrageous unfortunately it's no surprise that since the senate hasn't passed a budget which would help rein in government spending the national debt has grown by four trillion dollars when republicans took over the house last year passing a budget was one of the first things that we did and we cut nearly 100 billion dollars in spending to boot the senate like it has for the last three years has refused to take it up and pass it on to the president house republicans are trying to solve problems cut the crazy spending and stop the reckless borrowing because in the real world there are limits to how much families and businesses can spend the only proven way to do that is to budget we are working hard to make sure that the government lives by these same rules for reality to get the latest updates as the clock ticks away and america waits on the senate to pass our budget follow me on facebook at facebook.com backslash rep heisinga

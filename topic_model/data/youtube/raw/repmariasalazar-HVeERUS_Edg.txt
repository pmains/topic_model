Salazar of Florida wonderful to have you what can you tell us about that meeting well I can tell you and thank you for having me I can tell you that it went well but in reality that secretary Mallorca needs to do more and more means to fix the problem when he's saying that the the number of Cubans arriving in Miami or in Key West has dwindled it's true but it's because they just put a little Band-Aid of giving 30 000 visas a month I'm not sure if that's constitutional I'm not sure if that's going to stand in courts that's why we need and I'm happy to say it again we need to fix the problem for good that is to secure the Border but secure it tight uh fix the legal immigration so we can give the hands to the business owners that need employees and then give dignity to those people who are here who've been here for for decades illegally and that's the plan that's why I say that's the plan I've presented a law called the dignity act which I think will be able to fix the problem it's just that the political Elite these people that are here in Washington we the politicians we need to once and for all fix the problem and that's a problem that I do not see the political willingness to do that in Congress or in the administration okay so Congressman Jimenez has asked mayorkas to allow these four individual border officials to testify we can put them up here on the screen what do you think are the chances of them testifying and what do you think you would learn if you heard from them of course and Carlos Jimenez who serves District number 26 I'm in District number 27. we were together in that meeting and I think it's a fantastic idea let's hear from the people who are there in the trenches and what are they going to tell you we are tired we cannot sustain the situation we need help we need resources so we need to bring the technology that is out there listen I want the American people to know that this is a very fixable problem and it's very simple just put the money that we need in order to buy the technology I'm talking about levies and drones and all type of Technology we don't need to be experts then after that we need to fix the legal immigration and allow those people that the economy the American economy needs and then after that then let's take care of the people who live here illegally simple I go back it's just political willingness and unfortunately the Biden Administration has not shown the leadership the desire whatever you want to call it in order to to fix this problem and I represent the city of Miami Heart of the Cuban Exile Community Cubans nicaraguans and Venezuelans who wouldn't want to come to the United States everyone including my parents but you got to do it in a legal way not in this disarray that we have how embarrassing how embarrassing for the rest of the world that we the number one economy military might in the world number one country in the world look look what how disarray in our own home so I feel very bad but you know that's why I presented the dignity act okay I have one last quick question we run out of time a little bit we started off the show today we were talking about the migrant crisis as it affects New York City and mayor Eric Adams saying that he needs more help from the federal government as well but in particular there are a lot of strains on this city can you tell us in a nutshell what is it like in Miami what kind of pressure is that city under the same 10 000 new school students in the public school system no one can sustain that so those are the kids what about the hospitals what about the roads everything gets more congested but those are not taxpayers because those people that have been allowed to come in by the Biden Administration are not receiving a work permit they receive government help so could you imagine how distorted this is they let you in we don't know who you are but we're going to give you food stamps so we're not going to give you the ability to make a living unbelief believable so we the political class Congress needs to step up to the plate and say okay let's fix this mess and that's why I introduced my dignity act well I'm going to take a look at that which is not amnesty let me just tell you about amnesty don't let them fool you okay it's not amnesty amnest is what they have now because now they don't pay for roads for school or for uh hospitals so yes advise you next time and I will explain to you my dignity yeah congresswoman thank you for being on our show we'll stay in touch

thank you ibuenodios we're here uh for two reasons one is to celebrate 10 years since president obama established a deferred action for childhood arrivals program it was a victory of tireless advocacy from people like all of you immigrant youth from around the country and many in congress who push the obama administration to do the right thing it's been 10 years since hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants were given the opportunity to go to school and work in the only country they have ever called home i say about dreamers all the time the only flag they pledge allegiance to is that of the united states the only national anthem they know is the star-spangled banner the only country they have ever called or felt is home is the united states of america and so to we want to say unequivocally and unapologetically that the progress and gains and the triumphs of the past 10 years are here to stay today we say with one voice no vamos para tras we are not going back we are only going asia we are going forward as we look to build on the success that began as daca the 10-year anniversary of daca is a reminder that movements matter that the work all of you are doing today still matters your work and your advocacy has not only changed thousands of lives across the country is changed the very way the congress views undocumented family members i remember in 2012 when i was sitting at the white house in front of president obama with our former colleague congressman gutierrez and other members of the congressional hispanic caucus at the time we said to president obama you have the power to issue executive authorities that in fact can protect these people he said no i don't believe i have that power we went back and forth to make a long story short we are here celebrating because of the work that was all done and how we convinced president obama then to use these executive powers ten years later we are calling on the biden administration to use its executive authority to protect as many undocumented immigrants as possible we're asking them to expand daca eligibility and not be afraid to defend that position in court and we are asking them to use their parole authority to shield daca recipients from deportation in the event that the courts rule the wrong way and that they lose their status this summer the administration had executive authorities to protect ukrainians which it should we expect the same commitment to protecting as many undocumented immigrants as possible and while we are pushing the bite administration act we're not giving up here in congress that's why regardless of what the fifth circuit does i want to see votes taken on common sense propositions that the house has passed and i don't want to divide one group against another i don't want to protect just some dreamers i want to protect all dreamers and i want to protect their families and god willing with your help that's exactly what we're going to do thank you very much thank you thank you so much senator menendez as a high school graduate of millburn high school um i want to thank you for your leadership and thank you for uh protecting my mother who from new jersey so

[Music] and welcome back we're pleased to be joined today by two of Minnesota's eight members of Congress representative pete sauber republican from the eighth district and representative Dean Phillips representing the third District here in Minnesota thank you both for being here we've got at and a Republican and that's on purpose it's because they are two members I think there's 48 of you all together in a problem solvers caucus in Congress in the Minnesota House or in the US House explain what the problem solvers caucus is well good morning Tom you know the problem solvers caucus is the 48 members of the Congress 24 Republicans and 24 Democrats and indeed and I happen to share a couple hours a week on the problem solvers caucus and what we want to do is is really reach across and do what's right for the country and put the party labels aside and and I think we've been very effective very effective it is one of the reasons the two of you wanted to get involved is because you're both new to Congress you're not necessarily wedded to everything that has gone on before which has been very polarizing and you maybe bring a fresh perspective I think that's fair to say Tom that's why I wanted to join and I know Pete and I joined at the same time because Congress does not afford mechanisms for us to get to know each other which is a big problem with the social design of Congress you have to be very intentional to dedicate yourself to getting to know one another and building trustful relationships both within your caucus and certainly across the island the problem-solvers caucus is doing the work that the whole Congress should be so I'm proud to join with Pete and and he's been an inspiration to me in a lot of ways including inspiring media go to the southern border now twice and it's kind of it's the work that we should be doing not just as Minnesotans but as a country I think it's it's it's really the as Dean talked about it's about understanding where each other come from our lives how we've lived it and that shapes our experiences and we can bring them to the problem solvers caucus and and those couple hours a week talk about what matters to America how we can work together on removing the divisiveness in our country in the problem solvers caucus it is recognized in Washington DC it's recognized throughout the states as a caucus that gets things done for the American people now there are a couple of areas where you've been able to find agreement but frankly it's fairly easy to find agreement on some things like government should be more efficient if there's no budget there should be no pay some of those things are easy to find agreement on health care is a whole nother animal although this caucus has come up with a compromise of sorts on that but still not easy to get the rest of Congress to go along with it it's not easy but at least when you have 24 Democrats and 24 Republicans working together first getting to know each other because you have to build trust for relationships but then also investigating things with their own eyes you know rather than just listening to innuendo or watching television we actually go investigate the issues the southern border both didn't I've been down south to investigate with their own eyes I'll be joining a Pete up north shortly to talk about mining and actually do some touring so we're committed to not just taking partisan positions but sharing ideas no matter what side of the aisle they come from and creating some you know some templates if you will that we can work from immigration fiscal responsibility there are a lot a lot of good work we can do together it's going to take time but we're going to do it but whether it be immigration or building a border wall whatever that form that's going to take or healthcare getting Republicans to go along many of whom voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act trying to find compromise on those issues seems almost impossible in the climate were in no I don't I disagree at that time I think it is possible I think when we sit down and look at ideas and ways to make sure that healthcare is not only affordable but it's personable it can it extends to the families and we need to make sure indeed agrees with this we need to make sure that rural health care is is a still a priority across the nation we're hearing it in Washington DC I'm hearing it in the district we need to make sure that the rural healthcare is a priority and so when I talk about when or when we talk about the the bipartisan ship that were and the conversations were having I think it's important to recognize that our commonalities far outweigh our differences and 85% of the legislation we know that we can work together on and do well not only for the state of Minnesota but this nation so this is the problem solvers caucus it's it's one of the best uh caucuses in in Washington DC right now everything might just say - if it's going to get done at all it's going to get done probably because of our caucus and without Democrats and Republicans sitting down in a thoughtful manner listening to one another celebrating differences sometimes nothing will get done so we're building that framework and already co-sponsoring one another's bills and working together in a way that I wish more Americans were aware of because I think they would have just a little bit more faith and possibility no congressman Phillips our Democrats were skeptical of this saying many of the Republicans might be using this as cover for you know being able to say yes look at how bipartisan we are even though they voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act or what what have you is that a fair criticism that that some Republicans and even Democrats could be using this as cover to make it look like they're being bipartisan well no Tom I believe that most of us are in it for the right reasons I surely know that feed and I are I know that some take actually a really significant political risk by joining of the problem-solvers caucus because they're not rewarded back at home which is one of the problems in our country right now is such polarization that some in the far left and some of the far right don't want their member of Congress working with the other side so I would say it's actually just the opposite most if not all of us are there for the right reasons even with the political consequence and that's something we need more of you get pushback from Republican leadership about you know don't get in bed with these no not at all not at all as Dean talked about you have the right ditch in the left ditch that's not where the problem solvers caucus is where we legislate in between the lanes in between the guardrails and we can get a lot a lot of stuff done and I think that as the more the more that the problem solvers caucus gets out there and pushes legislation people are realizing is where America is and like I say Dean and I every week for a couple hours we have the opportunity Tom to put legislation forward that really matters to the American people and of the state of Minnesota and we also had some successes I think it's worth sharing too in the very beginning of this Congress we issued a package called break the gridlock package that actually for the first time in a long time changed the rules in Congress to allow for bipartisan bills that have 290 co-sponsors to have to reach the House floor which in the past wasn't that wasn't necessarily the truth we had a we made an impact on ending the shutdown the last shutdown last January and in 2019 it was a tremendous impact the problem-solvers carcass was responsible to get the government back open and it was because of the efforts and the bipartisanship and the work we put together in our committees to to make it happen and the final thing in the less than a minute we have you're trying to do this work now against the backdrop of an impeachment inquiry that is likely to result in a vote on impeachment on the House floor how much more difficult does that make your job to try to be bipartisan when the other side is trying to impeach the president of your party well we look at we have so many opportunities in this country town to get things done we in room a Minnesota we need the deployment of a real broadband we may we have to make sure that our borders are secured we have to make sure that we provide an infrastructure package for this nation that's needed so badly there's so much other work to be done but can you do that with this impeachment inquiry going on yes you agree everything that congressman establishes said we need in rural America I totally agree with and that's a perfect example of where we can come together I'm disappointed that we're we're facing an impeachment inquiry there's no question neither of us ran for Congress to be engaged in this kind of work and we might even see it a little bit differently but I respect congressman Stauber and I know because we are we're working together on initiatives we just got our staffs together for a wonderful project sponsored by better angels where we're the first two members of Congress in the country Democrat and Republican that got our staffs together for a full-day workshop to get to know each other respect one another we are doing the work that I hope Americans will actually treasure and start doing more of themselves well best of luck to both of you it may be a Herculean task to make something happen out of this but it's good to know that somebody is trying to do it and including a couple of Minnesotans so congressman Stauber congressman Phillips thank you for being here thank you that issue will continue after a break we'll be back with political analysis in two minutes

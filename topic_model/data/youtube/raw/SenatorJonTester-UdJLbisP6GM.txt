I heard a strong message from the president tonight that spoke to Montana's hard-working families I look forward to working with the President on the issues around infrastructure particularly as it applies to rural America I look forward to working with the President on making sure our borders are secure and making sure that we can stop the drug flow into this country and that we can stop the illegal commerce and keep the the legal commerce that is so important particularly between the United States and Canada and between Montana and Canada and I look forward to working with the President on veterans issues I think we've got a long way to go to make sure that our veterans get what they've earned by their service to this country I was concerned on the other hand that he never mentioned anything about agriculture particularly production agriculture and the trade agreements that revolve around those and I was also concerned that he didn't bring up public lands which helps propel our outdoor economy were 7.1 billion dollars in our great state and some 74,000 jobs

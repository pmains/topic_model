the most significant recommendation that relates indirectly to defense but is is overall is the national cyber director uh the the reality is that right now we have enormously capable people throughout the federal government but there's no central point of oversight there's no central point of coordination there's no central point of defining strategy and i really think that that's uh that's a that's one of the critical recommendations it's one that's already in your committee bill which i think is is is really important i think secondly and uh patrick murphy mentioned this the force structure assessment we haven't really looked at the force structure uh in the in the defense department on cyber since 2013 and i think we all know that there have been dramatic changes since then there have been dramatic changes in the risk in the complexity in the in the adversaries in the target space uh so i think that's probably i would put that next uh next in line and then the development of the cyber workforce because we can have we can talk about force structure but if we don't have the people to fill those positions uh with the skills then uh we're just not going to make it for example a a cyber workforce there's a we have a scholarship program now uh that's very effective but uh it's graduated i think 2 000 people in the last four or five years we need to grab or 3 600 i guess we need to graduate 2 000 a year i mean we have a tremendous need for these skilled people so i would say national cyber director assess the cyber force and develop workforce would be my first three priorities in the in that in the military area yeah great

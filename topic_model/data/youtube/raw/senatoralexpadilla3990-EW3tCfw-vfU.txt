thank you uh chair shots and ranking member murkowski for allowing me to join you today to introduce russell atterbury chairman of the krug tribe in california it's an honor to introduce chairman atterbury who's here virtually to testify on a bill that i'm leading with senator feinstein in this house and congressman huffman on the house side that will transfer 1 000 acres of sacred lands from the forest service to the interior department to place those lands into trust for the tribe the lands covered by this bill are considered to be the center of the kuruk world and sit at the heart of the tribe's culture religion and identity chairman atterbury is currently serving in his third consecutive term as chairman and has been a key leader in championing this effort during his 11 years as chairman he's also served on the department of interior's tribal interior budget council the executive council of the california tribal chairman's association and was recently selected as one of the seven primary tribal representatives to the department of interior's progress act negotiated rule-making committee chairman attleberry was also appointed by governor jerry brown to the california native american heritage commission before serving as chairman ms stratterberry work for the reading and siskiyou school districts and he holds a lifetime clear teaching credential from humboldt state university now the kuruk tribe have lived and conducted ceremonies on the sacred lands known as cudderman for centuries these sacred lands which are used for the tribe's world renewal ceremony represent the center of the kuruk world and serve as an integral part of tribal culture religion and identity currently 95 percent of the aboriginal territory is managed by the federal government and the tribe has a special use permit from the forest service to access the land for prayers and ancestral ceremonies however in recent years the tribe has struggled to access the site and conduct their sacred ceremonies privately without interruption so it's a moral imperative to restore these lands to tribal ownership placing these lands and trust would allow the kuru to further their mission to enhance and restore the natural world and allow them to preserve their traditional practices i thank senator feinstein for introducing this legislation with me in the senate and congressman huffman for championing this effort in the house i also want to thank chairman ederberry for his testimony today and for his leadership in working to advance the long overdue effort his approach to the federal tribal relationship has been one that says collaboration is always the best first step in building partnerships and his testimony today is a testament to that look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this bill as quickly as possible and return these sacred lands to their original stewards thank you again mr chairman

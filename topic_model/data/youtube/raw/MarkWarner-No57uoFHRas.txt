welcome back to State of the Union I'm Jake Tapper one year into special counsel Robert Muller's rush investigation there is new reporting suggesting that another country may have tried to influence the u.s. presidential election the New York Times is reporting that three months before the election Donald Trump jr. met with an emissary for two Gulf nations offering to help his father's campaign it included a proposal for a social media manipulation campaign and just a few minutes ago President Trump seemed to respond to that story on Twitter writing in part quote the world's most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on Russia and me so now they are looking at the rest of the world I'm back with Senator Mark Warner of Virginia the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee a senator I want to get your reaction to this report were you aware of this other meeting Donald Trump jr. had with some representatives of Gulf state nations and is there any evidence that any of them actually followed through and did anything to help the Trump campaign I'm not going to comment about where we stand in terms of certain witnesses and our investigation but if the Times story is true we now have at least a second and maybe a third nation that was trying to lean in to this campaign and I don't understand what the president doesn't get about the law that says if you have a foreign nation interfere in an American election that's illegal but did it take place I think the time story will see what follows after that what we do know took place though is that Russia a foreign adversarial nation massively intervened interfere in our elections both in terms of leaking information on a selective basis scanning 21 of our state's electoral systems using social media in ways that were basically unprecedented and they were doing it to not only so disarray but to help Trump and hurt Clinton but and that and that point was reconfirmed this week on a bipartisan basis on your committee Intelligence Committee so but the big question is did they do so with the assistance of participation of any American especially in including people who are in the Trump campaigns orbit and do you have an answer to that question because now that is what that is the endpoint question that we're gonna have to deal with this have you seen any evidence of it but what we do know and we have seen evidence matter of fact the leaking leaking of the transcripts from Donald Trump jr. putting out by the Judiciary Committee shows clearly that the Trump campaign welcomed dirt shirt on Hillary Clinton now did the president know about that meeting or not I don't know I'd like to get the answer to that I would also like to find out if there is this other pattern if the time story is accurate and there's this pattern that other countries were offering and clearly the Trump campaign was receptive to these kind of offers how that is not the beginnings of evidence of stuff that needs to be investigated and remember where we're at at this point more a year in 14 indictments including the indictment of the president came at campaign manager five guilty pleas and as we've seen on reports a lot of questions that still need to be many questions but just to put a point on this and then I want to move on to another question about the same subject still as far as the public knows no evidence of anybody in the Trump team accepting the offers of help no evidence of actual conspiracy that we know of yet that we in the public know of yet and you're not willing to comment on whether or not you've seen evidence of that compared to in our investigation collusion will be the last issue we've dealt with election security we've reconfirmed the findings of the intelligence community assessment we're going to deal with the social media issues and yes we have to get to the conclusion as well as obviously the mauler investigation has to be able to continue and this is the point Jake that just amazes me the president and his allies constantly trying to undermine these investigations what the president's got nothing to hide let these investigations finish well I want to talk about that because one of the points that you've been trying to make is they're trying to undermine it by revealing the identity of somebody who was a confidential informant for the FBI reports and the time suggests that this FBI informant met with two Trump aides during the campaign the president tweeted quote reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president it took place fairly early on and long before the phony Russia hoax became a hot new fake news story if true all time biggest political scandal do you was this individual this informant was he or she implanted into the Trump campaign I do not I've not seen any evidence of that kind of truth of the claim the president's made matter of fact his attorney mr. Giuliani I understand backed off some of that but let's let's go to the heart of what the president and his allies some of his allies in the house are starting to do Devin Nunez and his allies are trying to do the first thing you learn when you get involved with the intelligence community is you have to protect sources and methods people's lives depend upon it matter of fact mr. Trump's own FBI director this week Christopher Rea said when officials or elected officials go out and start exposing classified information exposing informants that work with our government America is less safe that is illegal if you reveal this kind of information if Devin Nunez reveals the name of this informant he will be breaking the law I think that if any individual elected official or otherwise knowingly reveals a classified piece of information about an FBI source you are breaking the law and should be fully prosecuted have you seen any evidence that this individual was implanted into because that's this is what the conservatives are saying that the Trump supporters are saying including people like Devin Nunez the idea is that the FBI put somebody in there to trump up this whole investigation I would find that extraordinarily hard to believe and you see no evidence I would find that extraordinarily hard to believe what we do know is there was constant outreach from the Russians not just to Trump jr. Papadopoulos potentially others and there was a lot of willingness now was there was there this willingness to actually connect the dots that's where the investigation malo investigation our investigation will continue to look at what role but why is launching the investigation was the informant well what we've been told is that Papadopoulos is meeting with the Australian diplomat in which he said that somebody with ties to the Kremlin told him it told him about the the Hillary emails that that was the lynchpin for the investigation but I don't know what the timeline is in terms of this informant and I don't know what role he played in the launch of operation crossfire hurricane I believe there was a whole series of information that our government received or at least law-enforcement received that made them start this investigation and including the informant I'm not gonna get into this particulars that's not appropriate that it would be doing exactly what I said is interoperate to do but what we do know is that the conclusion that was reached by both the Obama up intelligence officials and the Trump intelligence officials that said you know they are the Russians were trying to influence to help Trump and hurt Clinton that has all been reconfirmed so lastly I know you've been very concerned about President Trump talking about wanting to help China with this telecom giant ZTE get access to the United States what exactly is your concern well first of all the president claims he's out for American jobs and one area I thought I might agree with him on is taking a stronger stand against China and particularly calling out a company like CTE that his intelligence officials have said poses a national security threat once he took an action positively then he immediately backs off and says he's suddenly concerned about Chinese jobs instead to me that's outrageous and we owe a responsibility not just with ZTE but with other Chinese companies that are penetrating our systems for the intelligence community to be more forthcoming to the American public to make sure that we that we in effect inform the public and inform businesses and the fact that the president stepped away from that claim and is just using this as a bargaining chip that is not in the best interest for national security are you gonna try to stop it legislatively I think that we need to take every tool we can to make sure that whether it's CTE or other firms that are in effect stealing our intellectual property penetrating our systems that we take appropriate action Senator Mark Warner democratic Virginia thank you so much sir good to see you as always

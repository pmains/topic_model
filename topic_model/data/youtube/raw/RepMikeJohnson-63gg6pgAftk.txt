thank you mr chairman ranking member apologize for being late i was stuck on the on the floor i would rather be here because readiness is so important um general martin thanks for your time speaking with me yesterday in advance of this hearing um i expressed our concern i think it's uh not a concern just that i have but a number of my colleagues about the recruiting crisis um and the challenge that that places to readiness to to fight and win wars so the army's only met as we understand it 40 of its recruiting goal for this fiscal year and yesterday as we discussed i think just 23 percent of young americans are eligible to serve without a waiver right now so of course barring the over 40 percent of men between the ages of 18 24 who remain unvaccinated against covid it makes that percentage even lower so at least 75 000 soldiers by our count currently face discharge for refusing to take the copen vaccine the question is can the army afford to discharge these soldiers in light of all those recruiting difficulties or how are you going to grapple with this congressman uh first i failed congressman waltz when i did not give him a number when he told me 64. you said 75. i tell you it's it's it's it's less than 20 000. that's still a significant number and that's why i'm looking forward to improvements uh and that number for the national guard is a little over 11 000 congressmen um sure yeah general i think it's important to be clear here so what's the total guard is 11 and reserve is 20 no oh total total force okay total force is approximately 20 at this point thank you well that's a different number than we've been told so that might be part of the problem well that's that's why i did after our phone call i said i've got to double check some numbers here because that was a big number that you would put up sure well if the army fails to meet its recruiting goal code vaccine or not will it make cuts to force structure and and how would those cuts affect our readiness overall we don't need to do that immediately but if we don't arrest the decline that we're seeing right now in end strength that could be a possibility in the future but we don't see the need in the near term uh in the near term the way we're going to manage any shortfalls that we have is the ways we've done it in the past where we prioritize formations that have missions or preparation for missions and those missions will be prioritized to be manned but that's that's what we've done in the past that's what we did back during uh during the surge when we were building structure in the army and we had to continue to deploy it over to iraq and afghanistan but that's how we'll manage that thank you i'm running out of time quickly i wanted to switch topics the ukraine conflict it's a stark reminder of the importance of course of maintaining our military readiness and how quickly munitions are depleted vehicles destroyed in a large-scale conflict i had a question for each of you maybe i'll just go down the line until i run out of time admiral kreitz the ukrainian armed forces have estimated that russia's fired well over 2000 precision guided missiles into ukraine if we expended 2 000 t lambs over a three month period how quickly could we replace them and what levers does the navy have to expedite production thanks congressman for the question i think i don't have the specific numbers off the top of my head of what the production capab capacity is i know that we're at capacity today either building new tea lambs or converting older tea lambs i want to say it's around 450 per year over thank you let me go to a general uh alvin if the air force needed to make up combat losses of that magnitude it seems the russians have lost aircraft somewhere the rate of 25 to 35 combat aircraft at an annual rate that's 100 a year how long would it take us to manufacture 100 fighter or attack aircraft beyond current levels of production and what would the lag time be so that would also depend on the type of aircraft but obviously as opposed to munitions the an aircraft especially if it's a 5th gen is a much longer proposition so there are many things that go into that how hot is the production line is it out to max capacity do you have to do a second production line so um the nature of of which production line we're talking about would vary that but i think your underlying question is the key one the fact that what ukraine i think has really done is opened up our eyes to make sure that we have to have as much of a flexible and robust and adaptive industrial base to be able to to adapt to this whether it be munitions on the platforms i think that's right i'm almost out of time but i'll just say russia has these reconstitution and production issues today but of course they could be ours tomorrow that's the reality and and we're just really hopeful the department has taken a hard look at how we can expand the capacity of our defense industrial base if the need arises it's a dangerous time and with my 15 seconds i just want to say we're so grateful to all of you for your leadership in very difficult times and we want to be here to support you so thank you for your time today yield back

50 years ago we pioneer the path to the moon trail we blazed cut through the fictions of science and showed us all what was possible today our calling to explore is even greater to go farther we must be able to sustain missions of greater distance and duration we must use the resources we find at our destinations we must overcome radiation isolation gravity and extreme environments like never before these are the challenges we face to push the bounds of humanity we're going to the moon to stay by 2024 and this is how this all starts with the ability to get larger heavier payloads off planet and beyond Earth's gravity for this we design an entirely new rocket a Space Launch System SLS will be the most powerful rocket ever developed and with components and production and more in testing this system is capable of being the catalyst for deep-space missions we need a capsule that can support humans from the launch through deep space and return safely back to earth for this we've built a Ryan this is NASA's next-generation human space capsule using data from lunar orbiters that continue to reveal the moon's hazards and resources we're currently developing an entirely new approach to landing and operating on the moon using our commercial partners to deliver science instruments and robotics to the surface we're paving the way for human missions in 2024 our charge is to cook quickly and stay to press our collective it's forward with a fervor that will see us return to the moon in a manner that is wholly different than 50 years ago we want lunar landers that are reusable that can land anywhere on the lunar surface the simplest way to do so is to give them a platform in orbit around the moon from which to transition an orbiting platform to host deep-space experiments and be a waypoint for human capsules we call this lunar outpost gateway the beauty of the gateway is that it can be moved between orbits it will balance between the Earth and moon's gravity in a position that is ideal for launching even deeper space missions in 2009 we learned that the moon contains millions of tons of water ice this ice can be extracted and purify for water he was separate an oxygen for breathing or hydrogen for rocket fuel the moon is quite uniquely suited to prepare us and propel us to Mars and beyond this is what we are building this is what we're training for this we can replicate throughout the solar system this is the next chapter of human space exploration humans are the most fragile element of this entire endeavor and yet we go for Humanity we go to the moon and on to Mars to seek knowledge and understanding and to share it with all we go knowing our efforts will create opportunities that cannot be foreseen we go because we are destined to explore exceed with our own eyes we turn towards the moon now not as a conclusion but as preparation as a check point toward all that lies beyond our greatest adventures remain ahead of us we are going we're going we are going we are going we're going [Music]

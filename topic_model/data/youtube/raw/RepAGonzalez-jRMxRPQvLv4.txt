members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about the first piece of legislation I introduced as a member of Congress HR 1424 the Fallen warrior battlefield cross memorial act battlefield cross memorials commemorate the service of fallen soldiers who have given their lives and service to our country and if Strongsville VFW Post Commander Tim's of on check puts it it's imperative that this custom continues to be displayed for as long as the sons and daughters of this nation are willing to give their lives in its defense I am proud to carry on the work of my predecessor Congressman Jim Renee C who introduced a version of this bill last Congress has combat veteran Michael from Massillon explained to me the battlefield cross encapsulates so many the most important things to a combat vet his rifle his boots his tags and most of all his fallen comrade it's extremely important for us to have those things wrapped up in one memorial for us to kneel to grieve with and talk to our brothers in arms that have died the ultimate death the presence of a battlefield cross memorial in a National Cemetery has been a non controversial time-honored tradition since at least the Civil War however in the fall of 2017 battlefield cross memorials in Ohio Illinois and Michigan were abruptly removed a VA employee mistakenly said it was because they violated administration administration policy by depicting a replica of a rifle this is significant mischaracterization of the policy's intent after pressure from veterans and widespread local support the VA returned to these memorials to their sites but the future the battlefield cross memorials remains uncertain the bill codifies protections for battlefield cross memorials securing their placement in national cemeteries across the country one of the greatest champions for this cause was Elton Boyer president of the 555th honors detachment in my district he passed away this weekend but it was Elton's mission to erect a battlefield cross at the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery in Seville Ohio using the spent brass for military funerals my bill protects his work clarifying that no administrative policy change can allow the removal of this memorial thank you to the subcommittee for holding a hearing on HR 1424 irons passage of this legislation by the committee at the earliest possible opportunity thank you

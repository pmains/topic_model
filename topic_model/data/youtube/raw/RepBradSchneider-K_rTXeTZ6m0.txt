and I want to go out front now Democratic congressman Brad Schneider he recently returned from a congressional delegation trip to Israel and and you know a lot about what is happening here right now sir look I just want to start with with this at the heart of this you know for people who who may not follow the the specific details of a boycott movement you have been critical of some comments these Congress women have made about Israel right the support that they have for the BDS movement which is essentially boycotting Israel you have call bat movement anti-semitic you've introduced a resolution opposing it right so I'm just making it clear you don't agree with them you don't agree with any of their point of view on this but you think they should be still let into Israel right absolutely i I've been critical of their attacks on the US as a relationship their support for the boycott divestment and sanctions movement I have called that movement anti-semitic for two basic reasons first is it's absolute denial of the Jewish aspiration for a for a state in Israel and its refusal to support a two-state solution that will ultimately bring peace for Israelis and Palestinians the BDS movement is anathema to that peace process and that's why just last month you saw 398 members of Congress 206 Democrat 209 Democrats and 189 Republicans vote in support of condemning BDS and our support for Israel Israel's always been bipartisan but that doesn't change the fact that two members of Congress going to Israel a month ago we heard from the ambassador of Israel to the United States a promise that they would be allowed to visit Israel and today the government reversed and went back on that promise and said they can't come I think this was an unforced error unnecessary and will do more damage than any chance of protecting Israel's reputation all right yeah I mean I guess from a very basic point of view if you don't go to a place to learn anything about it you're not going to you're not going to change your mind but but can I just ask you about this Trump's role in this right even the White House today tried to say he didn't have anything to do with it but then he said that he did obviously he made his point of view very clear and then he said he did so call some people and talk to some people over there right you and ambassador Dermer of course the one who you know he knows everything he knows everyone he's incredibly close to Prime Minister Netanyahu as well as the people here have you spoken to him today about this I spoke to ambassador Dermer yesterday I expressed my concern about the pending decision I told him that I thought it was the wrong decision that it would do more harm than good for sure and that I felt that we the Israeli government should live up to the promise made last month at these two representatives would be allowed to visit Israel I think I'm not just embolden him I think he pressured the government he pressured Prime Minister Netanyahu Trump put himself interjected himself into this process nothing's changed as you said in the lead in the positions of these two representatives was clear long before our ambassador Dermer made the promise last month I don't think they were going to go to try to have their mind changed I don't think they were going to make an effort to see the multi facets of of Israel and Palestinian conflict so as we did last week by the way I just came home as you mentioned from a a trip with more than 70 members of Congress where we not only visited Israel but we went to Ramallah we met the Democrats had a meeting with prime minister Abbas I was disappointed that Abbas refused to meet with Republicans this week but we had a chance to see the different aspects the multiple perspectives the challenges Israel faces in a very difficult region so but also the importance of the us-israel relationship unfortunate that so you're saying the people who have you know who support a movement that you see as anti-semitic should still be allowed to go even though as you point out they had put the location of where they were going as Palestine I mean look they have a very clear political point of view on this right but but but just to be clear when the president says in his tweet they hate Jews okay that's what he said I'm just looking for the exact wording here so I could read is that do you think they hate Israel and all Jewish people do you think that's true well here I've had conversations with sleep and what I said to her is she and I are going to always have a different narrative I'm not going to change her mind but I am confident that the work we did I mean I spent several months working with my colleagues trying to build support for House Resolution two four six we had 398 members vote in support of a strong us-israel relationship in support of Israel's security and that the ultimate outcome down the road will be a negotiated agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians and 398 members of Congress bipartisan condemning BDS as antagonistic and unhelpful to moving that process forward so we represent Leoben Omar have a different perspective I'm not going to change their mind but it doesn't change the fact that the overwhelming majority of the House of Representatives of the US Congress both sides I support Israel and I hear you I'm just trying to you know get a direct answer of what you know regardless of the appropriateness of the president saying what he's saying okay it's inappropriate but is discerning merit and what he's saying I mean you know her she knows you is it is what he's saying total BS or not I think what are you saying is BS what are you saying I'm not gonna get into name-calling I'm not gonna try to put myself in the heart or minds of my colleagues but what I do know is that the United States Congress supports digital security has for the entire 71 years of Israel's existence yeah has invested in that security that we benefit mutual beneficial outcomes of the relationship between the United States and Israel and we will continue to pursue that and the actions of this president what he did today what he's been doing for a while by creating a wedge between Democrats and Republicans that doesn't help Israel security it actually diminishes it and we need to make sure we preserve that bipartisan support in the Congress all right well I appreciate your time very much I want our viewers to know Republicans did speak out also against this decision including influential Senator Marco Rubio foreign relations and and others thank you very much congressman appreciate your time thank you are

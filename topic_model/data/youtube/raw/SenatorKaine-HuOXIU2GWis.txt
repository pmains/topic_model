hey everybody tim kaine here from my senate office in the Russell building in Washington I just wanted to reach out and thank you for your tremendous support this year and tell you a little bit about the work of our office you might be surprised to know that we get 10,000 right around 10,000 emails and letters from you every week talking to us about issues and that's in addition to seeing folks on the road and phone conversations and constituent casework this is just people reaching out to us to talk to us about issues we're up to four hundred and seventy six thousand already this year with still some days to go in 2018 but that interaction with Virginians and folks from all over the country is what really makes the job so very special and I have a wonderful staff who thrives on that interaction it's been a challenging and a busy year I was on the ballot and so I had to combine both doing my job with campaigning but in the Senate office we were able to get some pretty amazing things done recently got a big Alzheimer's bill passed and I worked on together with Susan Collins and others to build up a public health infrastructure to deal with Alzheimer's which affects my family and I'm sure it affects virtually all of yours as well we worked on some significant legislation to deal with opioid especially the development of non-opioid based pain management strategies and treatment and prevention to deal with America's Virginia's serious addiction problem and then finally a really wonderful project that I give great credit to Virginia's military spouses they brought it to my attention after years of working to bring down the veterans unemployment rate that hey hold on a second military spouses also have an unemployment rate three to five times the national average when they explain the problem to me of course I've got a child in the military and a military spouse as a daughter-in-law and the challenge is once they explained them seemed pretty obvious but they helped me write legislation that we were able to get passed and signed by the president in August to start bringing down the unemployment rate for these wonderful Americans who really sacrifice so much to support their servicemembers as they serve the country so we were able to work on a lot of items that are important every day the motto in this office is the same advance everywhere we can and defend everything we must because some of what we also have to do is stand up against policies policies sometimes of the president or actions or policies of other countries the Saudi Arabian murder of Virginia resident journalist journalist Jamal khashoggi we stand up against things where we need to as Americans express our concern going into 2019 I'm sure it's going to be busy again I'll take the oath of office on January 3rd to support and defend the Constitution of the United States that's the oath that we take and then we'll immediately be busy once again on the Armed Services Committee Foreign Relations health education labor pension and budget working on priorities like expanding health care access and bringing down the price of prescription drugs keeping America safe trying to deal with gun violence the whole series of priorities that you share with me when I'm with you out all across Virginia I look forward to being on the trail around the state an awful lot in 2019 and hopefully seeing many of you in person either in your home communities or when you visit DC but thank you for your communication with this office your encouragement your support we have a beautiful Commonwealth wonderful country hope you have a great holiday thanks very much

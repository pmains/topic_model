Mr Speaker I rise today to celebrate the passage of legislation this week called the Amiga Act it's a bill that will spur Portuguese investment in our economy and help create jobs here in America as a proud Portuguese an American and a co-chair of the Congressional Portuguese caucus and a member of the Hispanic Caucus I join with Congress members Cicilline Nunes and others in being the original co-sponsor of the amygz Act and I want to thank my colleagues this week for their support in the passage on a bipartisan basis our friendship with Portugal and the contributions of hard-working Portuguese Americans immigrants are an important part of our country's history and our heritage as well as our economy the United States is Portugal's largest trading power trading partner outside the European Union in 2018 alone trading between our two countries reached in excess of five billion dollars this will only increase that economic activity this bill because this bill will make it easier for Portuguese investors business people to increase their operations in the United States growing both our economies drawing our nations even closer together and guess what creating more and more jobs more than 100 Portuguese companies today already have operations in the United States what do those operations do they create jobs they create opportunities and they build additional prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic we've done our part now it's time we hope that the United States Senate will do their part so that we can send this bill to the president that has again strong bipartisan support it will obviously be good to get this measure past hopefully before the end of the year senators White House and senators to me again bipartisan have already introduced their version of the legislation the amygz act in the United States Senate we thank them for their strong efforts and their partnership sharing prosperity in this instance can only benefit both countries both the United States and Portugal and it's this kind of common-sense trade policy I think that we need to be advocating along with continuing to build on our partnerships both within the European Union as well as within South America and with Asia and of course the all importance between our our closest neighbors both Canada and Mexico trade obviously done properly can create good-paying jobs in America and benefit our relationships and our economic activity with those countries who we value the most I yield back the balance of my time

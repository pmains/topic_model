senator from Virginia mr. president I also rise in support of the every child achieves Act and the good work that is being done in a bipartisan way to move elementary and secondary education for it in this country I applaud senators Alexander and Murray and all help committee members and their staffs for the good work that's been done on this bill this is huge and important to our nation's children but even more importantly to our economy and our global competitiveness and the fact that we're approaching it in a bipartisan manner creates a lot of hope and optimism I speak with a number of roles I was a well educated in public private and parochial schools myself my three children have gone through the rich and public school system an urban public school system in Virginia during the era of No Child Left Behind and so federal education policy was coming home and their backpack crumpled up at the end of every day and my wife and I have kind of lived through that with them my wife is the current Secretary of Education in Virginia with the responsibility of carrying out state and federal education policy and then in my own role as an elected official as mayor education was our biggest expenditure and I visited a school in our city every Tuesday morning as lieutenant governor the state budget education was our biggest priority and I visited schools in all 134 cities and counties in Virginia and then as governor I had the opportunity the great opportunity to work with our state our teachers our ptos and other education stakeholders and the Virginia education system which 50 years ago was one of the weakest in the united states i'm proud to say is now one of the best in the united states but I learned a lot as governor as No Child Left Behind was being implemented in the schools of my my state and I saw the good and the bad of No Child Left Behind and I certainly saw the reason that we need to improve it and that's what the every child achieves act does first good the good things of No Child Left Behind I see two notable goods that frankly are critically important that we maintain No Child Left Behind made us disaggregate stew data so that we couldn't hide behind averages averages can be deceiving Virginia average test scores are great but that doesn't mean they're great everywhere in Virginia and so we have to dig in and look at whether minority students are performing well or whether rural students are performing well or urban students and No Child Left Behind helped us do that not hide behind averages but really make sure truly that groups of students were not falling behind either statewide or in in the individual cities and counties the second thing No Child Left Behind did is pretty amazing before No Child Left Behind there was not a standardized definition of graduation or dropout rates in this country so if you wanted to know how your own city was doing or your own County was doing or your own state was doing and if you wanted to compare that against anywhere else you couldn't because everybody was using their own measure and usually folks would try to fuzz up the data because they were afraid of being held accountable around graduation rates and dropout rates No Child Left Behind together with some pioneering work from the National Governors Association ended up standardizing a definition of graduation aeration and dropout rates which enabled us to compare and compete with each other and not surprisingly as President Obama discussed in the state of the union in the early part of 2015 our graduation rates are better than they've ever been because now we can focus on them we know who's doing well and who's not in that sense of focus and competition is enabling us to move ahead but No Child Left Behind also had some unintended negative consequences the intense focus on high-stakes testing which is supposed to help you diagnose and then lead to educational strategies down the road sometimes testing has become an end in itself rather than a means to an end better student performance and that creates all kinds of stresses on students and teachers and parents and similarly the focus on disaggregating student data which demonstrates that there are achievement gaps in certain communities whether it be minority communities or rural or urban areas has often perverse consequence when coupled with high stakes testing have encouraged some of our best and brightest teachers not to want to go into the schools where they're most needed if they feel like they'll be punished because the test scores are not as high with poor kids for example then they'll often choose not to go to those schools that's clearly not what we meant to do with No Child Left Behind but that's been one of its perverse consequences when I was governor I had a very funny now it's funny it wasn't funny at the time argument with the Federal Department of Education they absolutely insisted that jurisdictions in Northern Virginia were administering certain tests wrong to students who don't speak English as their first language at home and indeed some of my cities and counties had a strategy of phasing students and if they were coming from juror from a background where they didn't speak English at home they would be tested in special ways for the first couple of years they were in the school system and then mainstreamed even in the way they were tested the Department of Education said you can't do that you can't do these tests differently what I would say the Department of Education hey let me show you the s80 scores of my Latino students let me show you how they're doing when they graduate that there's some of the highest performing students in the country clearly if you measure it by the outcomes we're doing it the right way but the Department of Education said outcomes doesn't matter to us we worry about the processes and the inputs and the way you provide the test well outcomes should be important result should be important and too often No Child Left Behind was administered in a way where results didn't matter and that's not what should happen I applaud senators Alexander and Murray for this bill because i believe the every child achieves act gives schools district schools district and states the incentive to work for all student success but also the flexibility they need to close achievement gaps the bill maintains critical annual testing requirements to allow us to track progress of students while letting state set their own goals for improvement the bill invests in early childhood education which is critical to give States the authority to determine teacher qualifications in those areas and I am very very glad that this bill recognizes that there are factors other than test scores that determine whether our students are being successful so I applaud this act and I can't wait to vote for it I want to comment just on two amendments that I have worked with my team and my staff member karishma merchant who is superb to put into this bill some that are already in and some that i think are forthcoming or in process on the floor the first is a the very important challenge of young people aged 16 to 24 who are in the most vulnerable time in their life to being the victims of sexual assaults a kid aged 16 to 24 that is the most likely period in your life where you will be vulnerable to any kind of sexual assault or sexual misconduct and that's whether you're in school whether you're at college whether you're in the military whether you're in the workforce or whether you're somewhere else and we're spending a lot of time working on this issue but this Ville contains an amendment that I proposed called the teach safe relationships act to help tackle this issue basically under the amendment that Senator McCaskill and I introduced in February schools that are receiving title for funds must report on how they are teaching safe relationship behaviors to students communication understanding what coercion is understanding what consent is understanding how to avoid pressure understanding where to go for help these are matters that we will teach to our students at a younger age so that they can keep themselves safe and i will i need to give praise on this one the idea from this came from students at the university of virginia i went and visited with them about sexual assault on campus in december and they told me we wish we came to campus better prepared to deal with these issues and i asked them well don't you take sex education classes in high school they said yes but the classes are about reproductive biology and there needs to be a little more about safe behavior and relationship strategies i thought what a great idea that led to the amendment the amendment has now been incorporated i praise the students at uva who put this on my radar screen and I thank senators Alexander and Murray who have worked with me to incorporate this in the base bill if we teach young kids the right strategies whether it's the military or on college campuses or in the workforce or anywhere else our young students 16 to 24 will be safer and second I have an amendment that I'm still working on hope to get in and on the floor with it is bipartisan by introduction senator Ayotte and I have this it is a it's to create a middle middle school career and technical exploration program called middle step kids in the middle school years if they get a broader exposure to the careers that are available to them then they will be better equipped to start picking curricular paths when they go to high school I am so passionate about the need for Career and Technical Education because I lived it growing up in my dad's business and teaching kids in Honduras the value of Career and Technical fields and everywhere I go in this country I have employers you tell me that they need workers who are skilled whether it's in allied health professionals like EMTs or culinary training or welding and iron working training or computer coding these career and technical fields that don't that that require some post-secondary education but not necessarily a four-year college degree our paths to great livelihoods we don't often emphasize them enough this bill will help us do that I'll just go I'll just close and say this it's been 13 years since congress reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act it's time to update No Child Left Behind and this is good work to do it President Kennedy said in a message to Congress in 1961 and these words still ring true our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education our requirements for world leadership our hopes for economic growth and the demands of citizenship itself in an era such as this all require the maximum development of every young Americans capacity that is almost a great 20th century paraphrase of what a Virginian Thomas Jefferson said in the 1780s progress in government and all else depends upon the broadest possible diffusion of knowledge among the general population those words were true then senator Kennedy's words are true education is still the path to success for an individual or for a community and nation and we will advance educause of education and the cause of success if we passed the every child achieves act and with that mr. president I yield the floor

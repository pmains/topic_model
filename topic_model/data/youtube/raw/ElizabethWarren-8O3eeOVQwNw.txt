we all saw what just happened in Wisconsin where people literally were putting their lives on the line to be able to get out and vote people trying to stand six feet apart people waiting in long lines people who were working the polls who are also potentially putting their lives on the line so this is a serious problem and I've got congressman Andy Lowe here today to talk about how - Andy you're in Michigan what are you seeing and how do you think about this my constituents are saying I I can't believe what happened in Wisconsin we must be able to exercise our right to vote this has go so far beyond party it's nothing to do with partisanship every American deserves to exercise their franchise and so we our folks are saying everybody has to be able to vote by mail if they want to and for those who vote in person it's got to be safe that's what I'm hearing for my constituents about okay so number one is vote by mail now how would we make that work do what is it what's it gonna take to make that work well you know here in Michigan in 2018 we passed Proposition three which made a lot of improvements so everybody has the right to vote by mail if they want to but we don't have a provision to send every voter an absentee ballot we haven't given the financial resources I feel like we as the Congress need to step up and give these secretaries of state the capacity to send every voter a ballot so that they can vote at home if they want to what do you think about requiring every state to send in a ballot for vote by mail along with a prepaid postage envelope to every single registered voter I think that's only common-sense I think that's the only way to guarantee that every American can vote I mean think about I got two kids with pre-existing conditions you know two kids with Crohn's disease they're in their 20s are we gonna send them out an immunocompromised folks what about all the seniors right so we've got to give every voter the right to vote from home that way I think that your plan is right I think we have to do it and Congress has to fund it and then we have to take care of the postal service right which we haven't done yet so that they can carry this out because they'll have a big job to do there boy if that's the truth and this is a reminder of just how critical the postal service is we're going to need them for our democracy so vote by mail for everybody and let's make that vote count let's make sure that people can register online and that we have extended registration periods and continue to have voting places in person because there are some people who need to vote in person that's their only chance is to vote in person but listen let's make sure there's a guaranteed period for early voting and I think between the option of voting by mail and having early voting for everybody we would avoid that public health crisis we saw unfold in Wisconsin and just say that we're not gonna make people choose between their health and and their democratic rights that we're gonna protect both and that's our job I feel as the Congress voting is the beating heart of our democracy we need for people to stay engaged in their democracy and make sure their elected officials are carrying out the plans and the procedures and the policies that represent their desires their wishes well they want to see this country go forward a big part of that is they got to know those elected officials that they're going to be held accountable come November thanks for your leadership on this senator it's so important well and thanks for your partnership on this Andy you know we get in there and fight for it that's how we're gonna get it done that's how it's supposed to work in a democracy thanks for being in your Andy thanks thanks senator it's great to be with you

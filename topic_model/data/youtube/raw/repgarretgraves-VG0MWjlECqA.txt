mr mckees i want to ask you a question how will raising royalty rates and increasing the cost of domestic energy production benefit quote environmental justice communities that's not what that's not what this bill does what this bill does is put environmental justice communities on the same parts other communities in your area so if you know so that they're not the target of cheap labor so they're not the target of country property values thank you thank you mr mckeecham mr chairman does this bill raise royalty rates yeah let the record reflect that the chairman's response just contradicted that of mr mckeachen mr makita not urge you to read legislation um that comes up before this committee because the consequences of this legislation are profound mr carl's exactly right and what his amendment does is it simply says that this that this bill will not be enacted it will not have an adverse impact on communities look i want to remind you people all across america are paying over twice gasoline prices that they were when this administration came in and and look let me give you a translation of what senator schumer what senator menendez what senator can't well and what senator markey said about higher gasoline prices they said that it's effectively a tax that that's how they described it they they said that uh the current run-up in world oil prices is effectively a tax on every every american family's discretionary budget except that the money goes to the opec cartel rather than the u.s treasury secondly let's look at secretary yellen secretary of treasury under the biden administration where she said effectively they were wrong they made a mistake mr chairman mr mckitchen all that mr carl's trying to do is prevent you all from making more mistakes y'all's policies are the the singular reason that we've got record energy prices right now that that's why i said it earlier you can't take credit for a 18 cent reduction 20 cent reduction in gasoline prices but then your your policies aren't the cause of the doubling and tripling sorry you can't pick and choose you own it all mr carl is trying to save this country he's trying to save the economy and i got to remind you the people that are most fragile the people that are most delicate the the folks that are most affected by skyrocketing electric skyrocketing electricity and gasoline prices are the people that y'all are describing as environmental justice communities so so if you want people to pay higher gasoline prices opposes amendment if you want people to pay higher electricity prices if you're going to confirm or affirm that your policies and this bill are going to make it worse then vote against his amendment but just know that you're going to own it you're going to continue to own it y'all's policies are the ones that are causing all these problems america is experiencing today you know you can say whatever you want under the previous administration you actually saw lower unemployment you you in in minority groups you saw greater economic opportunity you saw greater wage growth and right now just as senator schumer described it all you're doing is is you're causing a greater tax you're causing a an elimination of income on the people that can least afford it so if that's your goal you did it in fact you know what good news i think i got it you did it poster too look i do look at that you did it highest energy prices highest electricity prices highest gasoline prices like just just own it just acknowledge it and and if i'm wrong if mr carl's wrong then then all you have to do is vote for his amendment and and the bill it doesn't affect anything right it doesn't affect electricity prices gasoline prices so just vote for his amendment because you all have all said that it's not going to cause adverse consequences just like secretary ellen said it at least she has the nerve to come back admit she was wrong i respect her for that you all keep doubling and tripling down on the very things that are pushing people into poverty and undermining the competitiveness competitiveness of the us economy i commend mr crawford's amendment to urge adoption to yield back let me recognize myself if i made mr graves to yield for a question in in in the litany of of blame uh biden the policies of the last year plus this committee me personally inflation has gone up gas prices got up and that's where the blame uh is concentrated having not actually dealing with the substance of of the amendment that i support that mr mckeichin that that uh that i oppose that mr carl has uh has brought forward i'm just saying um where does uh oil and gas uh the major corporations that made a 35 million dollar billionaire profit in the first three months of this year and which is 300 more than than last year um and where do they fall in uh on the issue of rising gas prices and inflation are they part of the blame or are they uh are they innocent that's that's a that's a good question uh you're yielding to me right yeah yeah thank you that's a good question for a quick answer because i got like four more questions yeah yeah yeah i can't wait i'm excited i appreciate the opportunity to dialogue in that so so so mr chairman what i would do is is if i were you i would i would actually call brian dees who's the president's economic adviser i would call the president of the united states himself that both celebrators that both said to the federal trade commission asking him to investigate price gouging that both came back with goose eggs i'm asking you i'm asking your opinion it's big oil big gas the 35 billion dollar profit in three months that has nothing to do with rising gas prices and nothing to do with including so mr chairman whenever they lost billions of dollars over the past couple of years where were you so it's a i mean you have years where you lose you have years where you gain so so i but to answer your question the federal trade commission is the federal agency with expertise and authority in this case according to the investigation that they were asked to do nine months ago they came up with nothing and that reminds me the secretary granholm confirmed it so i i don't i can't answer for you but i i highly sus i'm beginning to believe that you think that industry is innocent yes please speak for me i'm just gonna i'm just asking i mean yes i can't make it yes or no mr mr chairman i i tend to prefer to operate with evidence and an investigation that apparently has been underway by nine for nine months or even ten months now uh by the federal trade commission so far has resulted in no evidence indicating that there was price catching i remind you that this this these prices are actually going on around the world and president biden we're actually paying lower rights than the global community it was a a futile effort mr graves on my part to engage on what potentially could be some common ground but if we don't include your perspective on who's to blame and our strong suspicion and perspective that big oil and big gas have played a big role in gouging and inflating the price and causing uh not all but part of the inflation then you know that's the trouble with the middle ground if you don't have one you but anyway yeah i think where we where we disagree is that i prefer to act on evidence mr chairman with that mr chair path to nowhere anyway

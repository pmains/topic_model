mr. president there's a scripture in the Bible in the book of ezekiel chapter 33 somewhere around verse 6 and that scripture talks about a watchman on a wall and his job is to simply say there's danger coming very important job the watchman's job is to simply say there is danger coming I had that conversation as senator Perdue spoke about five years ago I didn't find anyone on the other side willing to engage in that conversation then and here we are five years later there is danger coming I want us to hear this clearly because as we look out the streets of America and we see more unrest and we see more challenging situations realize that there is danger coming the watchman's responsibility is to call out the danger and if and when as the bloodshed happens the blood according to Ezekiel will not be on the hands of the Watchmen but if he does not shout out if he does not articulate that there is danger coming then the blood is on his hands mr. president there is danger coming we are in dangerous times the source of this danger is not the failure of this bill on this floor at this time nope this is merely a symptom of the danger that I believe is right in front of us this is only a symptom of a much deeper issue a systemic problem let me explain I'm a kid who grew up in poverty abject poverty in many ways there is much worse poverty in America and certainly around the world that I grew up in I'm talking about the poverty where when you come home and you hit the Lights which there's no light I'm talking about the kind of poverty that when you had a phone attached to the wall and you picked it up there's no sound there are people who lived in worse poverty than I but that is poverty from my perspective and I lived in that poverty and one of the challenging situations of poverty that manifests is hopelessness and I was that hopeless kid in America mired in poverty in a single-parent household under the impression that the only way I can escape poverty is through athletics or entertainment I was hopeless and from seven years old to 14 years old I drifted and all drifting leads in the wrong direction I failed out of high school embarrassed my mom who was working 16 hours a day because I felt like there was no hope in this country for a little black boy like me 14 years old filled Spanish English world geography and cities civics as we all know is as close as it gets the failing politics I will say that this body as a whole today is failing cities we're failing of politics but as the Lord would have it I had an amazing mother who believed that it was her responsibility to pray me out of the hard situations I found myself and then I had the good fortune of meeting and mentor after I got through summer school they do redirected me I pulled myself together with the help of a powerful family a praying grandmother and a whole lot of faith and I caught up with my class I graduated on time earned a small football scholarship went to college earned a degree in political science along the way as a youngster I joined the n-double-a-cp join the urban league join many organizations in the community because I knew that a part of my responsibility was to be socially engaged in making a difference no matter how small that difference could be the one organization I didn't even think about joining was the Republican Party why would I ever think about joining the Republican Party because growing up every African American every black person I knew of was Wed to the Democrat Party because it's better to have a seat in the room and be outside that was the heritage I grew up in let me fast-forward to where we are today and I'll return to that today we lost I lost a vote on a piece of legislation that would have led to systemic change in the relationship between the communities of color and the law enforcement community we would have broken this concept in this nation that somehow someway you have to either be for law enforcement or for communities of color that is a false binary choice it's just not true this legislation spoke to the important issues that have brought us here today we wouldn't be here for we're not as senator Perdue alluded to the death of yet another african-american man George Floyd's his murder is why the country has given us the opportunity to lead to lead and my friends on the other side just said no not no to the legislation they just said no and why am I saying that they didn't just say no to the legislation it's because along the way i sat down with many of them and so what do you need in senator schumer sent a letter telling I believe it was Senator McConnell there are five things in the legislation that needed to be improved I said let's give them the five amendments I sat down with more senators and they said wait wait wait it's not just five there's twenty I said how about twenty amendments and they walked out you see this process is not broken because of the legislation this is a broken process beyond that one piece of legislation it's one of the reasons why communities of color young Americans of all colors are losing faith in the institutions of authority and power in this nation because we're playing small ball or playing for those in the insulated chambers we're playing for presidential politics that small ball playing the big boys game is playing for the kids who can't represent themselves and if you don't like what you see change it we offer them opportunities at least on the I offer to change it and their answer to me was you can't offer us 28 minutes I said why not they said well because Mitch McConnell won't give you 20 amendments I spoke to Mitch McConnell he says you can have 20 amendments I told them that we went to a press conference yesterday and we said an open process they didn't want an open process they want one thing and I'm going to get to that so I asked myself my friends is that what what is it what is it you don't like about where we're going and they said well the data collection area this is a problem the data collection area is a problem tell me the problem well the problem is though we're not collecting data I'm like wait a second I could have sworn when I wrote the legislation we were collecting data so I flipped through the pages and realized what were collecting data for serious bodily injury and death they said well we want to collect data on all uses of force I said put it in an amendment and I'll support it that was just one bone of contention I said well tell me another one they said our bone of contention is that we need you to ban no-knock warrants because of the Brianna Taylor situation I said your bill does not van no not warrants for the Brianna Taylor situation your bill bans it for federal agents there's not a Secret Service agent showing up at Brianna Taylor's door that was a local police department so the fact that they're saying that they want to ban no-knock warrants knowing they cannot ban no-knock warrants tells me that this is not about the underlying issue it's bigger than that I said well I'll give you an amendment though and we're gonna have that fight on the floor of the United States Senate as a matter of fact I said tell me any issue you have with the legislation well we went to de-escalation training the duty to intervene best practices I said in the legislation in the legislation in the legislation you know I don't have any here so I didn't pull it out but here's what I said that's it let's talk about tactics then they said well you you don't ban chokehold I could have sworn I choked holes in there somewhere and I read the bill they don't ban choke holes on the local level of the state level you know why there's this little thing called the Constitution they can't ban chokeholds Eric Garner's situation would not have been cured by their ban on Joe coals because their ban on chuckles were for federal agents our legislation instructed the Attorney General to banjo colds for federal agents and what else did we do what we said we would reduce funding by 20% they'd reduced funding by 10% so our penalty was twice the building of the other side and this is supposed to be an issue mr. president I'm not sure we have found the issue we have it sideshow Colts stopped the duty to intervene it's not data collection because I said on chokeholds he's a senator it's at their meeting with them it's a senator it's your definition of choke hopes that's the problem see I assumed that when you think of show coals ya think of a chokehold but there is a distinction of the carotid airflow vs. blood flow they said hours only covered one not the other I said okay you have an amendment elbow for will change it they said we're not here let's talk about that second if we're not here to debate the issue on the motion to proceed so that we can now fix 50% of the bill not 70% of the bill but literally slivers slight changes on parts of the bill that would move this entire process Horton you have the amendments to do so I even said something that I didn't think I was saying I said what about a manager's a minute let's just fix everything in one fell swoop thank you so I find that disingenuous that people say well why don't you just sit down with one member and work it out well if if a manager's unit won't do it if the five amendments that they wrote in letters saying that they need to have these things fixed won't do it if 20 amendments won't do it you have an impress on the floor of the United States Senate that require her sus requires 60 votes to get off of the bill then what pray tell is the problem well I finally realized what the problem is mr. president the actual problem is not what is being offered it is who is offering it it took me a long time to figure out the most obvious thing in the room it's not the what I've listened to the press conferences I've I've read the newspapers I'm not sure that anyone who's actually reporting on the bill has actually read the bill because the next time I see another press another and another story or editorial that says we don't do this their bill does that and you put the two together and it's not just off it's just dead wrong so I realize finally it's the who that's offering this now I have dealt with the problem of food before as a black man I get the who being the problem it's one of the reasons why I went to Senator McConnell and said I want to lead this conversation I am the person in our conference who has experienced firsthand racial discrimination or racial profiling by law enforcement and I'm still a fan because I believe that most law enforcement officers are good but I'm the guy I am your guy Mitch because this is my issue this is an issue for every poor kid growing up in every poor neighborhood in this nation who feels like when I leave my home for a jog I might not come back this is a serious issue this is an issue for every single kid who says is this my country we've heard no this is the issue that we should be solving not the legislative issue that's not the issue the issue is do we matter we had an opportunity to say you matter so much we'll stay on this floor for as long as it takes and as the meaning amendments as it takes for us to get to the issue that says yes you matter but we said no today 56 people said yes for shorts for short of saying yes yes to having enough information to direct training and resources in such a way that we can hold people accountable we have four votes short of saying yes to having a powerful tool of pulling resources to compel behavior on chokeholds because I believe we've gotten on the bill well if we would have passed this bill but that is the problem by the way that's the who I'm talking about she has a bike guy I know how it feels to walk into a store and have the little clerk follow me around even as United States Senator I get that I've experienced it I understand the traffic stops I understand that when I'm walking down the street and some young lady clutches on to her purse and my instinct is to get a little further away because I don't want any issues with anybody I understand that but what I missed in this issue is that the stereotyping of Republicans is just as toxic and poison to the outcomes of the most vulnerable communities in this nation that's the issue when speaker Pelosi says one of the most heinous things I can imagine that the Republicans are actually trying to cover up murder the murder of George Floyd with our legislation that's not politics that's not how I came to win that's you lose you will sooner or later lose but immediately every kid around the nation that heard that nonsense lost that moment you see let's become evident to me is that she knows something that we all know she knows that she can say that because the Democrats have a monopoly on the black vote and no matter the return on their loyalty and I am Telling You the most loyal part of the Democrat construct black communities and no matter the loyalty of the people the return they get will always continue to go down because in monopolies you start devaluing your customer you see today we could have given at the very minimum seventy percent of what they say would be important for the people we say we serve but instead of having a debate on that today and getting not five minutes for twenty minutes a manager's amendment and instead of instead of going forward and getting what you want now they've decided to punt this ball until the election you know why because they believe that the polls reflect a 15-point deficit on our side therefore they can get the bill they want in November all they have to do is win the election and then roll in January and they get a chance to write the police reform bill without our support at all well this is what they did in the house right nope no amendments in the house of Republicans on their bill we're saying amendments on our side Democrats are saying no amendments in house but you here in the United States Senate because we are the world the greatest deliberative body you can have a minutes not in the house not under Speaker Pelosi but under leader McConnell you get at least 20 amendments I thought a bag off our when the manager manager limited that it was not good enough because the irony of the story is not the Bell the irony of the story is that today and through the rest of the June and all of July what we're going to have here is instead of gaining seventy percent of what you wanted or more you're going to get zero how's that for return how's that for loyalty how does that work for the little kid at a home in North Charleston where Walter Scott got shot how does that work around the country when instead of getting seventy percent of what you wanted today and tomorrow and next week you get zero and you're gonna wait until the election to get more okay well why wouldn't you take the 80 percent now see if you can win the election and add on the other 20% it gotta be kidding me because the who matters they cannot allow this party to be seen as a party that reaches out to all communities in this nation and unfortunately without the kind of objectivity in the media that is necessary to share the message of what's actually happening no one will ever know because if you don't read it in the paper it must not have happened if you don't see it on TV on MSNBC or CNN it must not be true that's the problem let me just say this I think we are willing to compete for every vote everywhere all the time that might not be true in every corner of the nation but it's true in most corridors of the nation and this party has reinforced that truth not by the words coming out of my mouth but by the actual legislation signed into law senator Perdue started talking about the important work that we did on Opportunity Zones and I'm going to wrap it up at two minutes here this lunchtime 2017 we passed tax reform I included in the opportunity zones seventy-five billion dollars real money to the most distressed communities in this station how did that happen well me and President Trump had a serious disagreement on his comments after charlottesville he being a person that I was not looking forward to having a conversation with invited me to the Oval Office i sat down with Ben and I said what do you want to talk about the president said tell me about your perspective on racial history stunned because if you know President Trump like I know President Trump his love language is not words of encouragement it just ain't I know anything the word but it's not but he listened and at the end of our conversation he simply said tell me how to help those I've offended I didn't know what to say so I pulled out my back pocket and got Opportunity Zones I didn't go in there prepared for him to listen that's not so see funny but it is I mean I didn't expect the listen but it did he listened he leaned in and he said tell me how to help the folks I have offended let's work on Opportunity Zones together he said yes he said yes he was concerned enough about the communities he had literally just offended he was concerned enough to go to work on their behalf that that's why we have opportunities owns I was like well this might work again so I went back to the President and said you know there's there's a out of work that needs to be done around the HBCUs historically black colleges and universities he said yes he said yes we said yes and let me just say this when we started saying yes we control the White House we control the Senate and we controlled the house so it wasn't because some Democrat came over here said you got it in order to get our votes you got to do this that's not what happened he said yes because the Republican Party said yes we stood together with all three levers of government under our control we got opportunity zones done we started the process of reinvesting in historically black colleges and universities and the head of the United Negro College Fund said at my last fly-in that this is a record level of funding ever his words not mine I'm not sure whatever is maybe that's longer than I've been alive literally more money for HBCUs ever brought to you if I had the Republican Party I said well that's working let's do it again so we went to stem-cell research which stem cell research for sickle cell anemia which is a hundred percent basically speaking 99.95% African American disease he said yes Lamar Alexander the head of the chairman of our help committee we were fighting over funding for HBCUs we made permanent permanent funding for the HBCUs led by a Republican chairman of the Education Committee president Trump signs it we have delivered historic funding and permanent funding for HBCUs now I'm not gonna go to the pre because I'm running out of time I'm not gonna go to the pre-pandemic numbers and minority communities for unemployment unemployment not only at a record low but we had labor force participation rates increasing let me say that differently not only do we get more jobs for black folks and brown folks the number of folks in the community started having an increase in the number of folks working this is called basic conservative politics it works 7 million new jobs 2/3 with african-americans hispanics and women and a full economy all boats started rising don't believe me check your accounts that's what it looks like KO bid 19 hit us and what did we do we we not only approved 2.3 trillion dollars and then another of 500 or so billion dollars in three point three point four hundred fifty billion dollars that would be multiplied in the commercial facilities by probably seven or a another three to six trillion dollar relief package but what did we do inside that package we targeted small businesses to save small businesses and by the way we added a billion dollars for historically black colleges and universities let me tell you the biggest threat is the biggest threat is that this republican party keeps showing up and delivering i've got 12 more pages to go like being at church but they're closing literally i've got 12 more pages of accomplishments to talk about i'm not gonna talk about it don't look relieved I'm not gonna talk about it I'm just here to tell ya that if we're going to be serious about criminal justice reform and we passed it with the House the Senate in the White House in the hands of Republicans we passed criminal justice reform to make up for the Democrat bill the 1994 crime bill that locked up disproportionately african-american men the Republican Party past criminal justice reform with all three leavers in our heads I'm frustrated I'm frustrated because it's not a competition for the best ideas it's not a competition for how to prove the poorest performing schools in America and the public education system that is consistently in black and brown communities that your zip code determines the outcome of your life because you're not gonna have a good education because we will we won't touch teachers unions we won't touch education in the way that it needs to be touched it's governor Scott did before he was a senator one of the reasons I went down there campaign for him because he was serious about helping poor kids get up and move on let me just close with this I don't know what it's gonna take to wake up at our nation about the importance of a duopoly and not a monopoly because look at your results look at the results you're getting and by the way when this bill is gone and next week we're on the DoD or something else we'll forget about this we'll move on people will forget about it and you know what it's gonna happen something bad and we'll be right back here talking about what should have been done what could have been done why we must act now I'm telling I had this conversation five years ago I'm having this conversation right now if we could do something right now you know here's the truth in Detroit Atlanta Minneapolis Los Angeles Philadelphia all these cities could have banned chokeholds themselves they could have increased the police reporting themselves they could have more data information themselves they could have de-escalation training themselves they could have duty to intervene themselves Minneapolis as well all these communities have been run by Democrats for decades decades what is the ROI for the poorest people in this nation and I don't blame them I blame an elite political class with billions of dollars to do whatever they want to do and look at the results for the poorest most vulnerable people in our nation I'm willing to compete for their vote are you [Applause]

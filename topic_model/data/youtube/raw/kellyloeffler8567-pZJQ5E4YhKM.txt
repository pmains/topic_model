joining us now is Georgia senator Kelly Lafleur she has gotten a clearer look at the scene there in Atlanta I Center what can you tell us about what you saw last night again and what you're seeing there today as far as how the night may go that's right Sandra you know here on the ground last night it looked pretty different and first of all I want to say that my heart goes out to the family and the community of George Floyd it is heartbreaking what we saw in Minneapolis last Monday that video is disturbing what's happening across our country however these peaceful protests that turned violent that's not the nature of our country that's certainly not the nature of what happens here in Atlanta Georgia what we saw Friday night was violent protests erupting out of peaceful protests last night with the mayor enacting a 9 p.m. curfew we saw peaceful protesters outside the governor's mansion hundreds of them complying with that however the later it got past curfew you saw those elements that auntie feel like activities start to gear up and therefore over a hundred and fifty arrests were made last night okay I want to get to that in just a moment but first I want to hear from the mayor there in Atlanta and and what she is describing is almost a distraction from the root of the problem and going back to that unarmed black man who died on the streets in the hands of a policeman here she is making her point we need to get back to what the problem is and that's the killing of unarmed black people in America and there is a history lesson that we find right here in Atlanta from the civil rights movement on how you effectuate change and what I saw happening and what we've seen happening over the past few days in America is not the way that that things will change in this country so how have what we've seen happen in so many streets of this country in the past couple of nights gotten away from that senator well it has gotten away from those peaceful protests and look they have a right to protest they're upset I'm upset it's disturbing what's happening and we need to make sure that we address it in real time but this activity it's criminal in nature it distracts from what we need to do to honor the memory of George Floyd and to move forward with this dialogue about how to solve our issues in this country and so I commend the president for you know naming and Tifa a domestic terror organization because that's exactly what it appears to be happening and then AG bar moving to mobilize the 56 FBI counterterrorism task forces across the country to figure out who is organizing these what's at the bottom of this why is this happening and it's got to stop I want to hear more about what you are seeing and hearing on that front front going to the news that the president did tweet this out the United States of America will will be designation and Tifa as they will designate and Tifa as a terrorist organization so the president obviously making big news with that while the questions are asked what evidence is there that this is an Tifa because the president is certainly pointing fingers at that organization in the city of Chicago the mayor there Lori Lightfoot was asked about the violence whether it was organized her response was absolutely there's no question she said you halls are magically popping up in front of stores and loading up with looted goods from these from these stores in our city so what evidence have you seen of that on the ground there in your state well it's the violence Sandra it's it's it's troubling this is not what Atlanta Georgia is about it's not what George is about we've heard that there's protests forming up in Savannah I know the National Guard's been mobilized there this isn't how Atlanta has ever approached there our challenges and as we look at you know moving forward you see the the separation you see the violence which is not characteristic of our city and our state and you see you know the vandalism businesses 50% of the businesses in metro Atlanta are minority-owned and those businesses many of them were gutted you know at a time when businesses are struggling to get back on their feet this isn't what we do cetera I've gotta leave it there a few seconds left you just heard from senator Tim Scott he your colleague he is calling on the President to address the nation lead with compassion he says would you like to hear from the president does he need to stand up address the nation and contend this violence well look Sandra I think the president has always worked to bring us together you know when he spoke to us at the State of the Union it was about lifting all Americans up that was in February our country is in a very different place now his leadership is as important and ever as ever and you know I think what we are seeing right now is the need for Americans to come together and I trust that's a that's what he'll do got it all right senator we appreciate your time thank you thank you Sandra

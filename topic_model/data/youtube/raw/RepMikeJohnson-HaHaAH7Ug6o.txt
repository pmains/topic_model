thank you mr speaker you know the recent supreme court term has come to an end and the court's decisions have sent washington democrats into a tailspin members of this body have called to abolish the supreme court and by the way some of those very same members have also called to expand the supreme court so we're not really sure which one they're uh committed to uh just yesterday members of this body were pretending to be handcuffed over their support for taxpayer-funded abortion on demand until birth washington democrats are making excuses for the outright harassment of supreme court justices and even their families their children and even the assassination attempt on the life of justice kavanaugh washington democrats are silent on attacks against pro-life pregnancy care centers across this country some have even called for these centers to be shut down all around the nation shut down it's appalling it's unhinged why would anyone want to shut down pregnancy centers that are designed to help struggling mothers in their time of need but you know that's where we are why why all the hysterics though i mean my constituents really are curious about this why are they so animated right now why do they want to tear this institution to the ground well here's here's the simple reason because the supreme court has made some very thoughtful constitutionally based decisions in this term they correctly said for example that a football coach was exercising his first amendment rights when he privately prayed on the sidelines on the 50-yard line the supreme court correctly said that citizens don't have to ask the government for permission to exercise their fundamental rights to keep and bear arms the supreme court correct correctly said that congress you know if congress wants uh to address climate change then congress has to legislate on that issue instead of just outsourcing that work to unelected bureaucrats because the supreme court correctly said that elected representatives of the people may again be allowed to place restrictions on the killing of innocent unborn children that that's why they're motivated that's why they're so unhinged that's why they want to tear the institution to the ground i guess we shouldn't be surprised by all this we are after all only a couple of months removed from senator schumer's infamous dangerous unhinged rant on the steps of the supreme court itself where he said he called out justices gorsuch and kavanaugh by name and he said hey we're going to release the whirlwind on you well it happened it's and it's clear what is happening here democrats are doing anything and everything they can to try to use these obvious and straightforward supreme court decisions to stoke fear and change the subject before the november election but here we are today to say that this election will be about three things it's going to be primarily about syrian inflation uninhibited illegal immigration and the gender you know general staggering incompetence that they see by the democrats in charge of washington the three eyes i call it it's inflation immigration and incompetence i think it summarizes it pretty well there was a very interesting story on cnn this week caught my eye it was entitled vulnerable democrats sound the alarm over inflation crisis well welcome to the party it's a little late for that you know i mean i'd humbly suggest that those vulnerable democrats should have thought about that before they voted to pass 5.4 trillion with a t trillion dollars in new partisan spending last year we warned them this was so completely foreseeable government spending is what's causing the current inflation crisis plain and simple and now that the bill is coming to these vulnerable democrats are hoping the american people will just simply forget their vote we don't intend to let that happen because the stakes are too high and the issue is too important i thank my colleagues for joining us today to discuss the harm that the democrat agenda has caused our country and our alternative conservative vision for how to fix all this mr speaker i am delighted to yield first among my many colleagues will be joining me here in the hour to the gentleman from pennsylvania knows a whole lot about the economy mr muser you

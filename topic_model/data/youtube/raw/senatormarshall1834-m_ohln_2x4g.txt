joining us now kansas republican senator roger marshall from the small business committee senator thank you for joining us you're also a doctor do you think dr fauci has a blind spot he won't answer he's avoiding and not talking about the economic impact of millions of jobs and millions is millions of millions of businesses destroyed in the lockdowns he's avoiding that we look through the footage and the videos he won't talk about it you know elizabeth you're absolutely right i just did five town halls this weekend and kansans are tired of wearing the mask but there's not a good reason to wear a mask anymore you know and if you think about just even the mental health crisis going on across the country this control of us the government trying to control us is adding to the mental crisis and then to go to your point the economic crisis that it's creating as well that this is slowing us down if we don't get our kids back in school and it's starting to happen but we need dr fauci to let up on us you know if dr faucio were a highway patrolman he'd give you a ticket for going 50 and a 75. he likes to wear belts and suspenders i get that and you know just to stress the doctor point of this is look once you've had the vaccination the the morbidity and mortality from this virus is less than the seasonal flu let us go dr fauci it's time give us a goal post tell us what the bar is going to be [Music] well let's show the viewer the things that dr fauci has been flip-flopping on we're going to show it now senator uh you know government officials are supposed to save lives and save jobs you know it's critics are saying he botched it at the house hearing last week jim jordan's question was reasonable dr thatcher refused to answer the question what metrics what standards are you using to reopen remember 15 days to stop the spread but dr fauci is saying it's quote very frustrating when people question him about that he's saying this has nothing to do with liberty when all americans of all political stripes have sacrificed a lot during the year he says has nothing to do with liberty right i think that the kansans i talk to feel like demanding we wear a mask is taken away of our liberties and i think that this is adding to the vaccine hesitancy one of the reason people won't get the vaccine is what's the reward going to be so if he won't give us a goal post and and we've been doing lots of listening groups as well what is causing the vaccine hesitancy and dr fauci's vague comments is adding to the vaccine hesitancy that we feel like he's not being truthful honest with us americans can take the truth but they want you to be fully honest with them yeah they feel like it's a lot of people are saying he's being arbitrary capricious he's changes the standards unheard immunity based on public perception and the polls the new york times reporting that you know pandemics do not happen on anybody's timeline including dr fauci's you know in the aids crisis during the 1980s act up were very angry with dr fauci because the government then led by dr fauci's push here for in the aids crisis they felt he was botching it and the other you know senator let's listen to this south carolina democrat congressman james clyburn he's a majority whip i want you to hear this disturbing comment he made at that fight between jordan and fouchy in the house last week watch this what number do we get our liberties back tell me the number what are the numbers 90 the members of congress get vaccinated but you're not a doctor mr clyburn he is what is the number now we're seeing oregon oregon the state of oregon is moving to make permanent indefinite restrictions on businesses so clyburn said 90 percent of congress needs to be vaccinated that's when you get your liberties back is that the standard yeah that's just what everyone is telling me back home right now is is it's just a hypocrisy right everyone on capitol hill has had the chance to get the vaccine so so theoretically whereas most we're going to have but still we keep wearing mass so america looks at this and says what's up with that be honest with this is there ever an end game to this and this is why a lot of people won't go get the vaccination because i think even if they do they're going to still have to wear the mask and dr fauci needs to realize that mask is is like a like a sign of being drug around and we lose our independence when we have to wear the mask we want to be talked to honestly we want to know what the side potential side effects are from the vaccine and people don't don't believe dr fauci he's lost his credibility with the american public we hear you know a lot of people say you know masks do help but here's the thing when you see a congressman say nine out of ten members of congress need to be vaccinated first before people get their liberties back that's kind of weird you know you know absolutely we know the science is really weak behind the mask mandates i think if you look at anything pretty objectively the studies show there's no difference in states that mask and states that did not have mandates as well so i i think the whole they're really not following the science senator marshall thanks for joining us good to see you thank you

on the issue of the vice presidency itself this country was founded with the term you know all men are created equal but what that really meant was property owning white men at the beginning of this country right blacks were considered three-fifths of a person women weren't even allowed to vote what would it mean to you or the little girl version of karen bass the thought of having a black woman as vice president when you were a little kid could you even imagine that possibility absolutely not you know it would just be so meaningful and i think about all of the little girls who grow up and who will never think twice about the possibility because it will be normal and natural to them i will never forget the moment of where i was when the when obama was declared the president of president of the united states it was just a breathtaking moment and it'll be the same thing when the vice president when biden chooses who his candidate is to be his running mate whoever it is it will be an incredible moment because it'll be a woman we know that for sure and then it would be especially exciting if it was an african-american woman and especially exciting if it was you right there's of course pictures of you and the vice president some would say that looks good together all right now let's talk about the big issue there you are talking about the issue of health care with the former vice president coronavirus the biggest issue in the country right now the senate holding a hearing on reopening in workplaces today dr anthony fauci with a blunt warning for all u.s citizens take a listen we can't just focus on those areas that are having the surge it puts the entire country at risk we are now having 40 plus thousand new cases a day i would not be surprised if we go up to a hundred thousand a day if this does not turn around and so i am very concerned so the question is like what happened here because at the beginning of this process the us and europe were sort of on parallel tracks now europe it seems like has gotten control over a lot of the coronavirus the us now has more deaths more cases than anywhere else travel being banned europe here in california states on the east coast are banning californians from going there what went wrong and who's to blame for this and i know you're going to say a lot of this has to do with the trump administration but california is run entirely by democrats and we're having a huge spike but you know i mean it just shows you how serious this is because the leadership in california in our state our governor our state legislature and certainly our city and county did everything they were supposed to do but still the virus has taken an incredible toll now we would certainly be benefited if we got the appropriate help from the federal government which was never coming i remember at the beginning of the pandemic when governor newsom was having to hunt around the country for respirators and where one state was being pitted against another so i think we did what we were supposed to do but i think it just shows you how serious the virus is and we need the leadership the other thing is is that when the states all around us are not handling it appropriately you know people come and go this is a major transportation center and so i think all of that contributed to it do you think we did what we're supposed to do when it comes to nursing homes though i mean even the local officials here admit that that was a mistake and and we saw all the deaths in nursing homes in california right and i mean you know that was happening around the country but you know we also had a number of our counties and cities that wanted to open up people pressuring to open up you know i think that there were people and places in our state that contributed to it as well and we are such a big state and people move around a lot so i think it just goes to show you when you do have the leadership we still are in a very tough situation because this virus is so challenging and so it's one thing to have a disease and it's spreading but to have a disease that you really don't understand and you're trying to build the plane while flying it at the same time makes it extremely difficult and i'm worried too just think we did what we were supposed to do what about those states that didn't you know where pence was the other day and he was sitting with his mask on in front of a choir now you know those people in that choir are going to get sick so you just wait in a couple of weeks when we see those states get really really bad where they didn't do what they were supposed to do so we got different questions on this one of the questions that came in to us was dean chermay he works in food and beverage operations for the addition hotel in west hollywood and he sent us this question is there any data that suggests that people going to bars and restaurants is what's causing spikes and why should they continue to get punished when it's not illegal to go out and protest so why should it be illegal to run your small business so what's your response to dean well you don't want to sure there's a couple of differences number one i wouldn't doubt that some of the protests contributed to it as well but it is different when you're outside versus when you're inside so you're in a bar you're in a a building and so we definitely know that that is a big difference in terms of how the virus is spread and how it isn't spread and so i think i mean we all have to play our part now on the federal side we have to get the heroes act passed because pretty soon unemployment insurance is going to run out and people need another stimulus check so i'm you know the part that i'm responsible for we passed the bill out of the house but i'm here in washington and i'm responsible to do everything i can to push the senate to get this bill uh up to the president's desk yeah because one of the points that dean was making we didn't play this part of the question is what are you guys going to do to help all the people that are now out of work because of the government's decision so what is the status of that where are we actually at in terms of getting more legislation the president's suggesting maybe we should send another check to americans is that actually going to happen well yeah that check is in the heroes act it's sitting over there in the senate when we passed it out of the house it is sitting there ready to be passed all the senate needs to do is take it up and i'll tell you what i really think is going to happen you know the unemployment runs out at the end of the month and and i hate to say this i really do for all of the people that are suffering but what tends to happen in the legislative world is that we wait until the last minute and that's when the pressure builds so for all the people watching the show and for that young man that had uh his concern about the bars and the restaurants make a phone call to mitch mcconnell because they could take that bill up tomorrow they really could let's talk also about the health aspect of this some folks may not know that you used to be a physician's assistant before you were a member of congress we got a question from civil rights attorney arriva martin somebody you know well a frequent guest on our political show the issue is she sent us a question about racial disparities when it comes to covet here's her question yeah now that we're seeing the spike of cases all over the south and the southwest particularly here in california can we expect this white house to develop a strategy to address african americans latinos and other communities of color that have been hit hard by coronavirus can we well you know what i'm sorry to say the answer right now is no but i will tell you we've been trying and let me tell you specifically what we have done we when we passed the last bill the cares act we put in there an order for the center for disease control to give us the data it's really hard to address the problem if you don't exactly know where it is and how bad it is so the only information we have right now is pretty much anecdotal in terms of where the disproportionate rates are what i believe needs to happen is that we need to have a very specific intervention and it's not just racial data just think about the people at the meat packing plants who were forced to go to work you need to do massive testing massive contact tracing and massive early intervention and treatment you know there's some good news in the la area martin luther king hospital dr elaine batchelor who is the head physician there she's been having quite a lot of success with african american and latino patients there by treating them early and being very very aggressive what i'm worried about is happening in a lot of our hospitals around the country is that african-american and latino patients are going in and they're being sent home and they're told to quarantine in your home well if you live with a lot of people depending on what your circumstances are you're not necessarily able to get the care that you need

thank you mr chairman appreciate the hearing chairman powell appreciate the work that you do uh obviously some of the questions that that we have both republican and democrat members had are more in the policy realm which is not your purview you have tools as as the chairman of the federal reserve you have mandates as i know mr jordan and you were talking about but many of those tools are harsh tools tools that we we don't want to have to get to if we don't have to and and i think that's really where we as policy makers need to step up and do a better job so that it doesn't fall in your lap and and i think those points were made clear and if you look at just the two mandates of the federal reserve maximum employment and stable prices right now we don't have either and it's because of policy decisions policy decisions primarily by the biden administration paying people not to work is causing real damage to our economy you can't have nine million openings for jobs right now at the same time that we're paying people on average thirty five thousand dollars a year not to work and then wonder why we have nine million job openings it's pretty clear every small business in america will tell you why i hear the same thing across the board they can't get all their workers to come back and because of that they can't open their business fully restaurants who are struggling just just scrapping and clawing to hold everything together want to reopen fully and many states are able to reopen fully but they can't because they can't get all of their workers back and it's not like they've gone on other places they know exactly what's happening they're being paid more not to work than to work that policy has to end you even said it when the benefits run out it will help problem is democrats here in congress don't want those benefits to end and we're borrowing that money from our children and our grandchildren to keep people out of the workforce it makes absolutely no sense it undermines your very mandates and again it would push us to a place where you would have to use tools and we don't want to see high interest rates we don't want to see limits on monetary policy but that's where it would go if we leave it up to other entities like the federal reserve we need to confront this here in congress we can look at how states have done well and how states have done poorly we don't have to reinvent this wheel you can just look at a few of the states who've done it right georgia probably has the lowest unemployment 4.5 percent they were the first state to open they took a lot of criticism just like florida when they opened their economy early some said oh everybody's gonna die the only problem is when you look at the states that stayed mostly closed they were the states actually that had the higher cover death rates and right now to this day just looking at recent numbers on seven day average of covid georgia 14 per 100 000 cases a day new york 36 per hundred thousand almost triple georgia georgia's fully open new york is still mostly closed broadway's not even going to open until september there's absolutely no reason for that they should be open today they could be open today schools should have been open months ago all the scientists we've had people sit in the very chair you're sitting in including dr fauci say under oath schools should have been open months ago and actually you're doing long-term damage to the kids by not reopening schools this isn't something that the federal reserve chairs the chair has anything to do with its policy policy of local governments that are hurting their economies and their people and especially the children that are paying a big price this is what's got to end we need to focus on getting the economy fully reopened on getting kids back in the classroom and oh while we're doing that we surely ought to be addressing the origins of covet 19. not a month from now should have been months and months ago when we started calling for it because nobody should have to sit here and go why why did it happen why did this calamity deaths destruction of economies people's whole livelihoods going away suicide rates we didn't even talk about that today suicide rates drug overdoses all off the charts because of what we went through in the last year and yet not a single hearing in over a year on the origins of covet 19. so hopefully we can get back to focusing on the very policies that will help us get through this the right way so that it doesn't end up in your lap and things end up having to be abruptly changed to the point where it actually harms real families even worse than they've already been harmed because as we've seen so many things that are happening like all of this inflation across the board that shouldn't be happening right now we shouldn't be seeing all this inflation that are brought on by president biden's policies and his over-reaction to something where the science in fact one of the things we've seen is a whole lot of political science being practiced instead of medical science so hopefully we can get back to common sense and the science that shows us where we should be going when instead we're seeing a whole lot of actions that are devastating to people but when they shouldn't be going through some of this pain so let's focus on getting things open the right way following that science and doing it and again not reinvent the wheel go look at the states that have done it right many states have gotten it right many states have gotten it wrong and still to this day are doing it wrong let's not have the federal government continue to do it the wrong way by making things worse with that i would yield back mr chairman

thank you so very much mr. Chairman I really do appreciate this hearing today and I'd like to welcome our new attorney general mr. holder and at first I'd like to thank him for the strong leadership that he has already demonstrated in taking this most important position in our government I'm a particularly appreciate appreciative for the direction that he has signal already on the crack cocaine issue and getting rid of those disparities many of us have been working for many years to try and deal with this the families against mandatory minimums that you know works with me and we hold a workshop on it every year and one young lady that's in the audience missing key cheetah Heba who has spent countless hours so working on this issue and we are so pleased that you are there and that you're moving in the right direction I have a few other things that I just like to mention I'm sure that it has not come up today but what you did with Senator Stevens case really does define your commitment to justice doesn't matter Democrat Republican whomever have been denied justice and with the withholding of information by the prosecution you through that case out and I want you to know that that really is what justice is all about and I appreciate it very very much and I hope the people of this country understand that you took it took courage to do that but you did it so you here today and let me just ask you about a few other things I am very concerned about police misconduct the last time the FBI came there was eight hundred and fifty seven cases 34 of them in Los Angeles we really don't find out what the outcome is of these police misconduct cases and I'm just wondering if there's some way we could get updated I don't know if anybody else is interested but my staff certainly would like to have the opportunity to get with whomever you identify and help us to understand what happens to these cases as a difficult thing once an investigation is opened it becomes difficult to share information outside the department but to the extent that we can you know we'll try to do so I understand your frustration though where an investigation is open perhaps charges are brought or reforms are required but then there are other instances where the case simply seems to go away it gets closed and to the extent that we can come up with a mechanism to make you and the members of the public and certainly the members of the citizens of the locality where the police department is being investigated to the extent that we can share that kind of information I'll try to find ways in which we can we can do that while protecting you know privacy interests that might exist with regard to specific individuals I'll appreciate that and I'm particularly interested in the city of Inglewood where we have we've made countless attempts to have an investigation and thankfully since you've been there there is an investigation going on and we'd like to follow it as much as we can with whatever way that you can share information or whatever we'll be trying to do that let me just go into a mortgage fraud as you know some of us that have been working on the Financial Services Committee dealing with predatory lending mortgage fraud and the subprime meltdown have discovered there was a lot of fraud that was going on by the loan initiators often times and sometimes by the recipients they homeowners but we've seen cases where incomes were inflated and that information was placed on the applications without the homeowners knowledge and on and on and on and just falls through the cracks we see it when we're working on loan modifications with the services I understand that you're not going to do a task force but can you do something to work with the city attorneys who are trying who have very little resources to help us deal with this mortgage fraud yeah actually I'm what we are going to be rolling something out pretty soon with regard to how we're going to approach this whole question of financial fraud and a component of that will certainly be mortgage fraud and how we are going to be dealing with that we will be working with our state and local partners in that regard earlier I'd said I wasn't sure about the number of mortgage fraud cases that the FBI had under investigation wasn't troubles 1221 just for the record it's 2,100 cases that the FBI has under investigation now but in order for us to be effective it seems to me in those mortgage fraud cases we need something that is going to be pretty extensive and that also involves people at the state and local levels and our hope is our intention is to work with them thank you and finally on the crack cocaine I shall get back to it I would not like you to answer this but would you consider taking a look at the possibility of pardons for some people who have been sentenced under these crack cocaine laws particularly those who have never been involved in crime before this is the first time offense have good backgrounds come from you know environments where supportive parents are all of that don't answer now but just would you take a look at possibility of considering this for recommendation to the president of United States finally US Attorney's many jurisdictions are waiting desperately to see what is going to be done as we understand it the protocol has been that US Attorney's would hand in their resignations and would give the new administration and opportunity to make new appointments we don't see that happening quite fast enough and there are many of these jurisdictions where they're real complaints against US Attorney's such as in Louisiana Mississippi Alabama what are you doing about that and how fast are you going to move on that or have you changed how it is normally done no we are working as quickly as we can to put new US Attorney's in place I expect it will have an announcement in the next couple of weeks with regard to our first batch of US Attorney's I have met with some of the candidates whose names I expect we will be announcing pretty soon they come to Washington as part of the process and so we will have our people in place I think relatively soon one of the things that we didn't want to do it was to disrupt the continuity of the offices and pull people out of positions where we thought there might be a danger that that might have on the on the continuity of the effectiveness of the offices but it is our intention elections matter it is our intention to have the US Attorney's that are selected by President Obama in place as quickly as we can and as I said our first batch will be announced very well thank you very much in I just like to say there's a danger with some of them being left there so whatever you can do to move them we appreciate it thank you

mr mulliner 50 five minutes Thank You mr. chairman mr. McCarthy thanks for being here with us today I thank you I'm represented from Michigan and am neighboring Genesee County and would like to talk with you about the Flint water situation and and as if yesterday there were some concerns raised by a family in Flint and you may have heard these concerns but you know their point was Melissa maze as reporting the Detroit Free Press said that we saw more information on Google than we did from the EPA we asked them for help and got nothing and I guess what I'd like to do is you've been to Flint you were there i believe on februari second and really put the focus of blame on the state and you know this the governor has apologized people have lost their jobs in the state over this matter the EPA region five administrator Susan had been resigned was that over the Flint water situation her explanation to me was that it was because she knew that she was going to had already become a focus of attention and she thought the entire focus should be on what we do for the people of Flint it was a courageous act on her pot do you still maintain as you did when you came to Flint that the EPA did everything right I did not maintain that what I said was that a situation like flint should never have happened I explained what I thought were inadequacies of the state oversight in primacy they add the ones that have the authority under the law and they're the ones with the primary obligation but I in no way said that EPA had I had done some kind of thorough analysis of what else we could have or should have done well let's just analyze it for a minute here because my understanding is the EPA was aware as of februari of last year that corrosion controls that would have prevented lead from leaching from the pipes was not being implemented that there were serious concerns about you know raise levels of lead in fact above the enforcement action level of the EPA EPA was aware of that and did nothing we're almost a year later and EPA did nothing can you explain to me why that happened well I would say that it I believe that it in april of last year was when the state actually told us and corrected a misimpression they gave us that that corrosion control was not happening EPA vigorously from that point forward recommended to the state that they take action to get corrosion control up and running were there other things that we could have done or should have done that is the the focus of our attention at this point if I thought we did we did oversee this you recommend the appropriate steps for the state to take your saying that was in april i believe so i understanding is on februari 25th a resident from flint miss Walters who had four children who have lead poisoning right contacted Miguel de Toro a manager at your EPA Midwest Water Division informing him that Flint is not treating water with standard corrosion controls and that prevent lead pipes from leaching lead also Deltora your employee learn that the taps were being pre flushed for several minutes prior to sampling when they did water tests on us so that is februari 25th the EPA has been notified that the corrosion controls are not being implemented and that the testing process is flawed now my understanding is under the Safe Drinking Water Act you have the authority when there for action authorized when there's imminent and substantial endangerment to health and so my question is if you knew this in February why was there no action taken for almost a year when my understanding in February was that we did ask the state of Michigan whether or not corrosion control was happening they gave us an indication that it was we relied on that but at the same time we did work specifically to test miss Walters home and it is not unusual nor is it an indication of corrosion control happening or not to have a high lead level in a particular home that can occur for a variety of reasons including a disruption in the street so 11 house does not dictate whether corrosion control is happening and effective but in no way did Miguel ignore this pro out this these are individuals answer completely I'm also attacked I'm not saying Miguel did I'm saying the upper levels of the EPA did and that's where I'm because Miguel actually emailed people colleagues at the EPA relaying his concerns about this faulty testing mechanism and also in follow-up tests when they actually use the right testing mechanism there were LED levels of nearly 400 parts per billion 27 times the EPA's threshold that's March the earth again almost a year ago is what and still nothing happened now I want to go again to june twenty-fourth again when mr. del toro wrote to the head of the EPA's drinking water division calling the Flint's lack of corrosion controls a major concern again no action from the EPA finally i'm told that rather than taking action a legal opinion was requested on the authority of the epa to step in as i mean i got to believe that anyone who looks at the documentation of the law would be able to give the opinion that the EPA has authority in this matter didn't you agree with that well when you say no action was taken by EPA you know I think you minimize the communication that EPA had we normally have with states that are very clear that corrosion control should have been done from day one and it needed to continue he was the state of Michigan that was challenging and whether or not additional testing was necessary to make that determination people have lost their jobs over that now the question is if you knew that it wasn't happening why did you not take action i I can explain to you my interaction with that but it is a much longer conversation that we clearly did everything we could to get the state of Michigan to do what they were supposed to do when I became aware and engaged that is when you saw an enforcement action taken in my understanding is the communications between the EPA region five regarding this matter have been requested the governor has released all of his communications when can we expect to see the documentation on the communications from region 5 you have numerous for your requests that were in because it's really important it there's nothing actually more important right now than getting that that city clean water and you'll see a glad federal presence including EPA who is is responsible to get that done your journey will respond sir well I would like to know when you're going to have those public aid those documents public I guess it's a question okay I'll be happy to take that back we have a number of requests I don't know what the schedule is jela's time has expired a ministry

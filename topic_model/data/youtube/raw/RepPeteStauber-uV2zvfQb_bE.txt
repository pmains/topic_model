the chair now recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota mr. Stuber Thank You chairwoman Holland and ranking member Curtis for allowing me the opportunity to testify an HR 1475 a lot of react although the economy in Minnesota's eighth District is dominated by the reliant development of resources like mining and timber these industries exists in harmony with tourism one of the national forests in my district contains the Boundary Waters Canoe Area a wilderness known for multiple use and recreation let me begin with the little background let's say you and your family would like to come to northern Minnesota for a weekend of fishing walleye and moose or bass would Lake two of the prominent lakes within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness you would call an outfitter in the area registered with our local Forest Service as a cooperator to set you up with a permit to operate a small motorized boat on that Lake ahead of time the BWC a permitting process is unique and complex on recreation.gov you must choose for more than 30 entry points enter the size of your party whether you want to use a motorboat or a paddle only etc this is a difficult and complex system outdoor enthusiasts rely on their co-operators to navigate the system for them the cooperator enters all information prior to January 30th when 10:00 a.m. on January 30th hits the lottery system on record it was an imperfect system customers this year truly altered the system from a lottery system to a first-come first-serve system instead of allowing folks to sign up for their desired permits ahead of time co-operators and individuals now had to all simultaneously log on to recreation gov at 10 a.m. on January 30th this year my office was inundated with calls from outdoor enthusiasts and Forest Service co-operators upset about recreation.gov crashing within minutes into its quote go live time end quote only about 1,400 of the tens of thousands of available permits were allocated to compound the issue rural broadband access is difficult in my district with temperatures reaching near 71 below zero in Ely Minnesota this past year folks had to invest time and money to drive more than 200 miles south in record cold temperatures to the Twin Cities for reliable internet only to have this system crash within days I spoke with associate chief Lenise Lago and chief Vicky Christensen of the Forest Service both insisted the first-come first-serve system will work when recreation.gov goes live again about a month later co-operators and individuals seeking to use the BWC again drove down to the cities in brutally cold temperatures to access reliable broadband so they could attempt to get permits the system crashed again at this point Outfitters in my district were hemorrhaging money one of my constituents who is a cooperator estimated that they had already lost about fifteen thousand dollars in income for their small business for the summer ahead therefore I listened to my constituents and introduced the lottery act in late February as you can see it simply directs the Secretary of Agriculture to return to the lottery system that worked for the BWC a on recreation gov I introduced this bill after holding multiple roundtable and listening sessions in the area ensuring co-operators and outdoor enthusiasts were able to offer input thank you for the opportunity to testify today and I look forward to your questions so we can move this bill forward and provide a meaningful fix to this broken system thank you and I yield back thank you mr. Stover the chair recognizes ranking member Curtis I'm sure mr. Stuber just one quick question is there a Senate companion bill or for the my hope is that one of my two state senators senators Klobuchar or Smith will do just that thank you i you of my time madam chair

welcome one and all on tuesdays most tuesdays that we're in a session senate democrats and senate republicans uh eat lunch uh never together always eyes apart and talk about the challenges we face as a as a nation and we spent the uh the last hour hour and a half and the senate democratic caucus um talking about the the budgetary challenges that we face and uh what to uh to do about them and uh one of the people who's thought about this for a lot longer than this week or this month or this year is a father who's sitting to uh to my right dr coburn who's just uh just joined us he was a member of a of a commission created by executive order by the president over a year ago called the deficit commission co-chaired by erskine bowles and by uh alan simpson former senator alan simpson and 11 of the 18 members of that commission voted for a deficit reduction uh package it would basically reduce the deficits by about four trillion dollars over the next 10 years mostly on the spending side some on the revenue side and it was an approach in which almost everything was on the table defense spending domestic discretionary spending entitlement spending tax expenditures and uh weighted about two to one or three to one to to the spending side in terms of deficit reduction one of the one of the concerns uh primarily among democrats but also by republicans and and some independents is uh how do we reduce entitlement spending without significantly cutting benefits and inflicting real harm on on people thanks to the good work by folks on my staff and on senator coburn staff some good work has been done uh drilling down on on medicare and and on medicaid to find are are there ways for us to be able to reduce outlays from from those programs but to do so in a way that does not morally wound beneficiaries are frankly morally wounded providers as it turns out there's a lot that that we can do and there's a fair amount that that we're doing the healthcare legislation that we passed here a year or so ago actually provides a number of tools to cms to enable them to go out and save some money and to reduce the the flight of funds almost the thievery of funds the theft of funds from the medicare trust fund and uh senator coburn and i have been working our staffs and i've been work we've been working and to see if there are other things that we can do to to show up the medicare trust fund which is now scheduled to run out of money in 2024. as it turns out there's a fair amount that we can do and in our role to help some of you at this table especially dr padetti and his folks to uh to realize uh additional savings a lot of us would just say it's common sense i uh fellow just handed me my my talking points here is peter tyler peter's done great work here with our republican staff but one of the things that we learned most recently was that in 2007 if you look at the amount of uh of money that uh that was what was the expenditure peter what was it for 2007. about half of it uh was uh was uh uh wheelchairs that's that's what it was about his wheelchairs and uh i don't know if this came from the ig or from gao or who who to come from ig yeah the ig 2007 we spent i think about 190 million dollars for uh for wheelchairs that year and uh roughly half of that was frankly pretty hard to prove it should have been should have been spent we have dead doctors writing prescriptions for uh for controlled substances for folks who shouldn't be receiving those substances or going out and filling those prescriptions and using the the drugs to help feed the drug trade it's far too easy for bad people folks with criminal intent to get their hands on the provider ids and they're not only ordering controlled substances but all kinds of durable medical equipment there's just a lot going on you look at improper payments 125 billion i think jao tells us last year about 47 billion of that for medicare medicare not counting medicare prescription drug program i'm told there's about another 20 or so billion last year for medicaid and proper payments eric holder our attorney general tells us there's 60 billion dollars in in medicare fraud i don't know if he's combining pulling some of those numbers out of improper payments for or not but it's a lot of money and if we uh the president says we're going to cut improper payments in in medicare by half by the end of next year if we do that that's 25 billion a dear do for 10 years that's 250 billion dollars it's a quarter of a trillion if we take out half of the fraud in medicare that's another 30 billion a year times 10 years is 300 billion dollars and you add it together we're talking about real money and none of that has to uh to savage beneficiaries or or inconvenience uh providers we're interested in getting better results for less money and to uh we've been interested in that in healthcare we're interested in a lot of other ways and one of the ways to do that is to frankly drill down on some of the stuff we're going to talk about today and i'm just very grateful to each of the witnesses for coming for preparing for for today's hearing let me start if i could with dr and and uh i think at first i'd like to to address a uh an issue that's been raised by by gio uh first before i do that i just want to say dr bedetti that uh the office of program integrity under your leadership has made i think a lot of progress and there are a number of people are responsible for that but i just want to say to you uh thank you since you took your position last year been any number of positive efforts underway including the implementation of program integrity provisions within the affordable care act i think you deserve a lot of credit so does your team as does the program as do many of of your colleagues at the center for uh medicare and medicaid services however as as i uh say oftentimes in this room everything i do i know i can do better the same is true for all of us and the enormous waste and fraud challenges that we have we've heard about again here today we've heard about in the past and hopefully we'll hear about uh in smaller magnitudes in the future but uh those challenges call out for very large efforts and require that the congress ensures that the federal government takes uh many more strides to cut back on on waste and fraud abuse where we can now in the gao testimony and their audit report released today the fraud detection system that is the combined uh integrated data repository and one pi is presented as an important new tool to examine medicare and medicaid payments in order to detect fraud and it's depicted on this chart up uh to my left and to to the uh to your right in fact the centers for medicare and medicaid services own own estimates show that if if it's fully uh implemented the new fraud detection systems will save some 21 billion dollars 21 billion dollars over 10 years by detecting and avoiding improper payments the cost to date for the system is about 161 million dollars and to complete and operate the system for 10 years the additional cost is roughly 184 million dollars that is quite a return on investments if you think about it and curbing 21 billion dollars in waste and fraud would represent a lot of progress a lot more progress i think it makes sense that a timely implementation would help get these cost savings obtain these cost savings more rapidly it's what we want to do however the gao has clearly shown that the system is not fully deployed despite the center for medicare and medicaid services declaring the system up and running only as we've heard 42 people were trained in 2010 and despite the state of requirement for i think 639 people further the system has yet to include medicaid data also gao i reported that there are no clear plans nor projected dates with specific milestones to either train more people nor to include the medicaid data and despite being part of the original design there are no solid plans to give access to medicaid state offices i'm told obviously without the system being fully implemented as well as ensuring that federal staff oversight contractors and law enforcement have access and are fully engaged we won't realize that 21 billion dollars in savings and that would be a shame so dr bidetti i'll just ask what is your planned schedule to fully implement and deploy the new fraud detection system when will we have more people trained and when will state medicaid offices have access to this system thank you very much for your comments senator and i want to add that we always welcome uh the kind of arms length oversight that we received from the general accounting office the government accountability office dated myself there uh and and from our colleagues at the office of inspector general and as you know in this case uh we do in fact uh concur with their recommendations can you make it coming sir uh i say this a lot we're all in this together yes we're all in this together and the only way for us get out of this whole this fiscal hole that we're including some that we're talking about here is to get out together go ahead and and we very much appreciate the interest and support you've shown in this sir uh the uh integrated data repository and the one pi system are ones that were started uh some five years ago or so the agency did set rather ambitious goals for itself in terms of the the implementation of those and some of those goals have been met some of them haven't been met uh in the this illustrates a number of factors first of all it does implement it does illustrate to some degree the challenges of of implementing systems especially for example with respect to the medicaid data because states have different kinds of data systems and different formats and different responsibilities on the states in terms of their ability to supply the data the structure of the of the integrated data repository at first had to be as i understand it had to be redone somewhat so there were some problems along the line in terms of meeting certain deadlines others were met but in terms of your specific questions i'd like to make a couple of points sir one is that the integrated data repository is uh intended for many purposes other than just fighting for artists it it is a valuable resource uh and it still continues to be a valuable resource and it will be uh as we move forward with our new and advanced technological solutions that i mentioned earlier but the integrated data repository is not strictly for that purpose it also has a variety of other uses within cms and and that's an important aspect of this the other i think question that you asked about the training we have in fact now trained an additional 55 personnel so far this year we now have a schedule for training all of the private sector personnel who are going to be working with with the one pi and uh integrated data repository give us some idea what that schedule is that would be 42 plus about 50. they will all well all of the ones who uh who are in the i don't know the exact number but it's all the ones who are in our zone program integrity contractors the anti-fraud contractors uh who will be using the system the i'm told that they are all on schedule to be trained this year uh and so that's uh we we did have to after getting feedback from the people who were trained in the initial uh courses we did redesign the program we had some user feedback and realized that we weren't the agency wasn't adequately preparing them for using the system these are complicated systems and the the training program was restructured and revised and we believe it's now an extremely effective one and we have moved forward with an aggressive schedule we've trained 55 and we're going to finish the zpic uh staff training i'm told this year so that's a very important aspect of all of this the other thing i would tell you is that the integrated data repository will be one of the sources of data that will we will be using in the sandbox that i described so that the integrated data repository which holds all of the claims over a prolonged period of time is very different than the claims processing system that we're using with our new uh predictive analytics so so one is a repository and one whole the idr is a repository that will hold all the information the other is uh being implemented on top of the claims processing system so they will go they will go hand in glove we are moving forward we uh anticipate having we already have the the medicare uh claims data in as you described uh we anticipate finishing the different stages of the medicare data uh by by next year and we are moving very aggressively with a variety of systems to improve the medicaid data as well and doing that in a way that we believe will serve a variety of purposes both for the states and providing access to the states and also for for our purposes both fraud fighting and otherwise uh so okay i'm going to ask you to hold there i'm well over my time so i want to be friend of mine to my colleagues when we come back i'm going to ask our friend from gio just to to respond to what we just heard from him with dr daddy and you can tell us whether or not we should feel reassured don't do it now but i'm going to ask you to tell us if we should feel reassured by what he has just presented all right

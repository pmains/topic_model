hey it's congressman garrett grades i flew back to washington last night from louisiana because we have a bill that's been put up on the house floor that is in excess of 700 pages with hundreds of other pages of associated text it's gonna raise taxes to the tune of about 700 billion dollars and spend hundreds of billions of dollars of your hard-earned money what this legislation purports to reduce drug and healthcare costs for seniors something we all support it purports to reduce energy costs for all americans obviously something we support and it's suggested that this bill is going to reduce inflation which is something else that all americans support regardless of political party the problem is that the people that are pushing this legislation are the very people that have caused the crisis that we're experiencing today before the biden administration came in and speaker pelosi began ruling this congress i was paying a dollar eighty we were paying a dollar eighty a gallon for gasoline within recent weeks i paid four dollars and twenty cents a gallon we've seen spikes in electricity rates and even going to the grocery stores unaffordable to the point to where a quarter of all americans today have had to try and make the false choice between buying groceries or paying their electricity the very people that have caused the crisis that we're experiencing today are the ones that are asking us to trust them that this bill is actually going to solve problems i gave them a chance to put their money where their mouth was i filed an amendment that said that anybody any family that's making 80 000 a year or less that this bill could not oppose additional energy costs or additional costs for those families and we were blocked by democrats from offering that amendment we offered an amendment to to say hey you want to reduce some missions i have an idea let's build a new bridge and get people moving across the mississippi river as opposed to parking on the mississippi river bridge that amendment was blocked we said hey let's dedicate some of these dollars to coastal restoration in louisiana they blocked those and we even filed amendments that said this should not take effect of gasoline prices cost 10 that was blocked we offered amendments saying this bill cannot result in additional dependence on foreign energy or energy sources from china and they blocked us on that one as well this is not in america's interest but i'm going to say it one more time there are a lot of things in here we agree things in reducing drug costs the outrageous drug costs reducing or making energy costs more affordable reducing inflation but these people have caused it they're ones that are pushing this legislation they're asking us to trust them this time i simply can't this is mortgaging our children's future it's awful legislation and we're fighting to oppose it and stand up from louisiana to where we can produce energy at home not going to saudi arabia and other countries and asking them had in hand to help supply america's opinions thanks and god bless

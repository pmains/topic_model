as an army ranger and as a paratrooper i served both in iraq and afghanistan in both places i worked very closely with local iraqis and afghani interpreters contractors and others without whom i may not be here today and without whom we could not have accomplished our mission and done our work i'm going to tell the story very briefly about a man named mohammed who spent the last 12 years helping u.s forces in afghanistan muhammad had applied for a special immigrant visa in 2010 he was denied repeatedly delays stopped the visa from being processed in january 27th of this year muhammad was driving to work with his 10 year old son when a taliban vehicle stopped in front of him assassins jumped out and gunned him down in front of his son all the while those assassins yelled out quote where are the american forces to save you where are their helicopters where are their airplanes you helped them for a decade where are they now end quote muhammad is dead a couple of weeks later his oldest son received this death threat from the taliban he and many others like him will soon die unless we act general mackenzie recently said that if directed to do so the department of defense could successfully conduct an evacuation of at-risk populations out of the country mr helvey do you agree with this assessment if directed to do so we could who is the interagency lead for this issue mr helvey we are working uh with the with the interagents through the interagency process uh to to look at the different options there are different authorities as you know uh to address this is there an interagency lead mr healthy i would believe state department would be the lead uh do you believe or do you know i believe i believe that state department would be the lead you don't know for sure i do not know for sure depends on what we're talking about mr helvey we're several weeks into this drawdown we have no time left there are lives of afghanistan's our partners people that we have an obligation to not just a moral obligation but a national security obligation and you don't know who the interagency lead is for the special immigrant visa program the state department's the lead although as you know a lot of times the quotas are addressed through the national defense authorization act the mechanisms by which those afghans could depart could depend on the on the different circumstances but state department is the lead for the siv would the establish establishment of an interagency task force help expedite this process i believe it would and we are working with the national security council to work through these issues having you know interagency meetings multiple times a week to address this specific question and what does dod need from congress to help those over 18 000 afghans who have applied for special immigrant frieza who are waiting on us right now one of the things we would like to work in and i do support the chairman's uh suggestion of increasing resources for the special immigrant visa program uh if i i know that this is a very a time intensive effort but certainly increasing the quotas would be a tremendous help and thank you for helping out the course thank you mr helper i would like to yield the rest of my time to ms lock

i'm proud to stand in support of hr 826 the divided families reunification act and i want to thank congresswoman mang for introducing this bill and for the house foreign affairs committee for ensuring a speedy passage of this timely legislation i'm also proud to co-lead another bill under consideration today that addresses this issue house resolution 294 from congresswoman karen bass since implementing family reunions in 1985 the south and north korean governments have facilitated 21 in-person reunions and seven video reunions however the nearly 100 thousand korean americans with family members in north korea have been left out of this process entirely as a long-time advocate for human rights and humanitarian aid in north korea i have consistently spoken on the need to prioritize these issues especially by appointing a special envoy on north korean human rights issues which has remained vacant since 2017 and remains unfilled under president biden time is running out for separated family members as many are in their 80s and 90s and their numbers continue to dwindle congress and the biden administration must come together to make korean-american participation and reunifications a reality before it's too late my mother-in-law was one of the many koreans who made the brave journey across the 38th parallel line to bring her family to south korea she crossed five times to go back and forth and bring family members across to south korea as an immigrant from south korea whose family divide family lived through the korean war and now as one of the first korean-american woman to serve in congress i am proud to use my voice in support of this issue that is deeply personal to me and our korean-american community i want to again thank representatives karen bass and grace mann for introducing these measures and for working to garner strong bipartisan support i urge my colleagues to support house passage of these bills today and for the senate to prioritize consideration of this issue on behalf of the tens and thousands of korean americans alive today waiting to reunite with their long-lost family members thank you and i yield back

all right mix it up this morning a little Spanish music I love it honestly I know if this is we promise we'll try to be fun so thank you so much for being here I think J Street is a pretty cool story about what kind of organization progressives can build in a short period of time so it's awesome the year that you showed up the first question for you first question for you mayor Pete just talked a bit about his belief that we need to condition aid to Israel in the event of some sort of annexation of the West Bank as promised by Bibi Netanyahu is that something that you would also support that would be my first move first of all I think that look what I believe what I hope is that as Israel forms a new government that we're gonna have a new opportunity to work with our ally to ensure that there is not unilateral annexation that we pursue a two-state solution which as you all know has been the approach that the United States has taken for a very long time and used to have strong support I think on both sides of the aisle and so my hope is that we can work like crazy so that we don't get to that point I would not take it off the table but I want to focus on what we can do hopefully with a new government and a new president in January of 2021 that is willing to work with our allies to avoid that um I just want to push you on this a little bit because I think you know Ben and I have been fairly clear about our beliefs on Prime Minister Netanyahu versus Bennigan's but I think you know there's a sense that on the peace process question they won't be as different as people might hope and you know historically you've seemed a be conditioned in many places including on the Palestinian Authority to pressure them into incentivizing behavior the American taxpayer doing I think 3.8 billion a year in security assistance to Israel because of our boss President Obama signed this ten-year MOU why isn't it appropriate to sort of normalize the way that Aid is is treated and to use it as you know a carrot and stick approach towards pushing for policies that we think are for in the security of Israel and in the US well I mean the fact is that in so many different ways we do have a carrot and stick approach whether we're dealing with money that's domestically granted or with foreign assistance in cute including Security Assistance and so I think that that framework already exists the the intensity of it or the specificity of it may be something different that's why I say I would not take that off the table I do think though that we need to use this opportunity that we have hopefully with the newest railey government and with a new administration I believe in 2021 to do everything that we can to get Israel to go back in the direction of pursuing a two-state solution so that we can avoid having to condition our aid on that you know I completely agree with you that I believe that Netanyahu has been counterproductive to say the least and has partisan eyes Israel for a lot of people here in the country which was a terrible mistake that was made a few years ago and that we need a an administration over there a government over there that I think I hope will be more productive and engage in getting back on us on a track of a two-state solution because it's very clear that Netanyahu you know not only has has rejected that but has actively campaigned for his own political benefit far away from that and and I disagree with his approach and I reject it and I hope even though as you point out and others have pointed out that Benny Ganz may not be very different you know I still hope that there's a way that we can avoid the path that Israel has been on under Netanyahu another another question is you know there's how do we engage the government of Israel wouldn't when the new president comes in another way of looking this also is how do we engage the Palestinians who you know have seen the United States MC moved to Jerusalem have seen their own diplomatic relationship with the u.s. essentially downgraded because the consulate they used to be the representation towards them is that now obviously been subsumed by the embassy seen efforts by the Trump administration to cut off assistance to them and frankly even to Palestinian citizens of Israel there's been a Prime Minister of Israel who's been fully embraced by the u.s. president who's used very derogatory language about Palestinian citizens of Israel what would you do coming into office to try to set a new tone with the the Palestinian people as well as the Israeli people number one the Trump administration has made a mistake on in putting its finger on the scale so much in line with Netanyahu and his administration and I am glad to see in this Democratic primary that the voices of folks who are concerned about the rights of Palestinians has emerged has risen stronger than before I think that's a good thing and and I hope that that also figures into our approach in the future under me it would so here are a couple things I would do and you mentioned one of them which is that we'd to reestablish a US consulate in East Jerusalem and make clear that under a two-state approach that would be the embassy under a Palestinian state in addition to that we need to ensure that they have the opportunity to restart their mission here in the United States I would also restore the UN funding UN rwa funding that was stripped by the Trump administration which was a mistake to provide aid that is desperately needed those are the kinds of things that I believe the next president could do immediately to regain some trust rebuild trust and confidence among Palestinians in addition to taking a different tone well you know I think those would all be important steps and then obviously the question of how do you approach the israeli-palestinian peace issue comes to the forefront I assume you wouldn't send Jared Kushner to a meeting in the Gulf without any Israelis or Palestinians representatives but obviously one of the things that we wrestled with in the Obama administration but you know what you obviously were part of but which is how to have specific to be about u.s. positions in terms of what should be the outcome of negotiations it's a long-standing position of the US government you know had usually been these final status issues of refugees security territory and Jerusalem are kind of left to the parties to negotiate but by the end of our administration we you know out of a mixture of frustration and diplomatic work were very specific about at least what us ideas would be for those would you would you think that it be constructive given how much settlement activity is begun to reach in the territory that most independent observers think would be part of a Palestinian state in the West Bank in particular do you think that the US should be specific in laying out here's what we think the outcome of this should be here's what the two states in our view should look like it as at least terms for a negotiation yeah well you know I remember and I'm sure you remember even better than I do when President Obama was about ten years ago right early in his administration said what others had been saying that we wanted to base this off the 1967 borders with land swaps and then you remember the furor that the right-wing went into maybe now who conveniently left out the land swaps in his that's right you know I mean I think that that has been the blueprint and I do agree that that we can add something of value to the negotiation of course the negotiation is between those two parties ultimately and so there's a limit to that but I do think giving some direction and I understand of course the frustration and the sense of urgency of the need for specificity I think we can build on that again hopefully with an administration that is more receptive to that official Washington Ben often calls them the blob I think he deserves to trademark that name has slowly come to the realization that the the Saudi government and Mohammed bin Salman in particular aren't the best people I think the horrific murder of Jamal khashoggi shocks the conscience of the world it's truly disappointing to see major businesses political leaders a year later attending you know investment conferences in Saudi Arabia I think it sends a message that you know finances are more important than values but you know and again I say this with considerable humility given that President Obama would Saudi Arabia multiple times he initially supported the the civil war in Yemen which was wrong and it's proven to be a humanitarian disaster so my my question for you is as president how would you rethink or would you the us-saudi relationship are they still an ally given all that we've learned in the last couple years I agree with those who say that I think we need to reassess that relationship I believe that we do need to reassess that relationship and that as we move forward in this 21st century that as you suggest that our values should be bigger drivers of those relationships obviously sometime there are very urgent imperative security interests sometimes economic interests but I believe that somewhere along the way we've come to rely too much on those interests or prioritize them instead of prioritizing the values that we have and what are those values I mean I think those values are the ones that have helped make this nation the nation that it is of freedom of individual liberty of democracy and you know whether it's what we've seen in Hong Kong and that we should be standing up for them in Hong Kong or the we Gers in China that we should be speaking up for we should be meeting with our values more and the next president has the opportunity to do that when it comes to Saudi Arabia I would do that thank you for mentioning the Leaguers it's really important I think that people constantly bring that up so sort of staying in Saudi Arabia I mean a month ago two months ago I think a lot of us were worried that we were on the cusp of either a Saudi Iran war or US military action in response to what was seen as either a you know Iranian proxy group or the Iranian military striking Saudi facilities how would you approach any effort to broker you know some sort of date on between the Saudis and the Iranians would that involve getting back into the Iran nuclear deal I mean what are the pieces of that puzzle in your mind I think that the immediate peace that the next president can work on I wish this administration would work on it is getting back into the deal that y'all negotiated in the Obama administration getting back into the jcpoa you know the first task may be pressuring Iran to make sure that they're compliant with the jcpoa but also getting the United States into it and then looking down the road and how that can be negotiated again updated renegotiated whatever term we want to use for that and one of the points that I've been making out there on the campaign trail is that this is this is much more important than although in and of itself this is an important deal to make to control or to manage their nuclear weapons capacity this speaks to again the element of trust of the United States in the world like why in the world if you're kim jong hoon would you ever sign an agreement with the United States right now to curtail your nuclear weapons program when Trump just came in and tore up an agreement that everybody acknowledged Iran was following to do the very thing that we're asking North Korea essentially to do curtail their program we've lost trust people have lost respect for the United States under this administration and I see getting back into the jcpoa not only as helpful with managing what we're talking about with the dynamics of the region and of course that nuclear weapons program and the security of Israel but also where we go on North Korea and another another and a number of other issues around the world the I did you say that very well and just to pivot off the foreign policy to the the politics that we can envision on this some of these set of issues particularly on Israel you know one of the things that has been so depressing about how this administration this president's approach this is this kind of cynical effort to demonize as anti-semitic you know anybody who is not fully on board with essentially his and Prime Minister Netanyahu's view of all these issues and well at the same time frankly you know using rhetoric that seems to be very attractive to to actual anti-semites here in the United States on other things but if you were the nominee how would you contend with the inevitable attacks that would come that any criticism of Israel proves it you're an anti-semite the kind of politics that says I'm a US president I'm going to ask the Prime Minister of Israel to not even let in to Muslim and members of Congress visited Israel there's this kind of toxicity that we see as you you know that is very bad for I think the the historical bipartisan support for this relationship how would you navigate that terrain as as a nominee and make clear that there's a way to support Israel while being critical some of its policies there's a way to advocate for our values that doesn't necessarily mean you have to fall into the trap of of what they're gonna be throwing at you well I mean that's why I'm here that's what J Street is here right and that's why there's so many folks in this audience that that are part of this work which is to say look there's a different way that we can do things and we recognize that Israel is an ally a friend and that will continue to be and we'll have a strong working relationship a friendship at the same time the road that Netanyahu was taking Israel on I don't believe is in the best interest of Israelis and the road that Donald Trump is taking this relationship on is not in the best interest of the United States of America it's not in the best interest of Palestinians whose rights were also concerned about but I think you know I want to commend Jeremy and J Street and the board members everybody who over the last 11 years as hell has been building up this organization because it is a strong part of that voice now we're just talking about the politics of this because you asked about the politics that will help navigate that because we do need those voices there for the longest time you know there was kind of one voice uh-huh and you know I think folks know what I'm talking about and we need more than that you know I'll to follow up on that yeah I think I know the voice you're alluding to that offered some some criticism of the Obama administration over the years but but I think actually that's kind of a part of a general sense you know if you were out on the campaign trail and you're meeting with young people in particular you meeting with college-age students here today and and and all they really consumed about this relationship in the u.s. in Israel is a lot of this pretty cynical back and forth and demonization and if you don't support this a hundred percent then you know you're you're gonna be called a name whether that's an D somatic or something else what would you tell them to get back to values and not politics why should they care about the us-israel relationship or why should they care about the pursuit of a two-state solution like what if we if in many ways Trump is disrupting things and wiping so many slates so clean and we're going to rebuild things what is the basis upon which you rebuild that sense of why young people need to care about this why they need to care about Israel why they need to care about the Palestinians why they need to care about peace you know I think yesterday was the anniversary of the tree of life massacre in Pittsburgh and it was also a very powerful reminder of why Israel exists in the first place as a place of refuge safety ability of expression of the Jewish people and also of how consistent those values are with the values that we hold dear as Americans and that we also want to see Palestinians be able to enjoy as human beings and so I would say that in many ways that if we can get this right that it it is of our highest calling to help bring that about because it's consistent with who we are and who we want to be and today you know you mentioned young people folks on college campuses I think they're hearing it both ways from the Trump administration what they're hearing is you know if you're not all the way over here then you know you're anti-semitic and so forth they're also hearing from BDS and there's a demonization of Israel in some quarters and you know I I don't agree with BDS I don't support BDS but I also don't support I don't support cracking down on political speech I think that people should be able to express themselves and what I what I have seen in our young people now that like all of the candidates have traveled all over the place and so have you all all the time is that more than anything else people want to know what you really believe and I think to connect with young people it's to connect them with what we really believe and why we support a two-state solution and the values that that represents and you know we can do that and I think part of that is the work that J Street and other organizations and and some pro-palestinian organizations are also doing as they get out there you know it's it's cliched to say that Israel isn't a tough neighborhood right but I do think that that fact is underscored by the the fact that the head of Isis mr. Baghdadi was was killed in Inlet province yesterday two days ago and you know the Special Forces who were part of that operation the intelligence community the Trump administration all deserve credit for taking him off the battlefield but that doesn't mean our Syria policy isn't completely incoherent right we pulled out we're back in we're ditching the Kurds we're now securing oil fields it's hard to keep track of um when you think about Israel's security I imagine that you know a secure Syria is a key piece of that puzzle how what do you make of trumps Syria policy today and you know knowing that projecting what troop levels would be you know a year from now is not really a realistic thought experiment how would you think about the presence of US troops in Syria in the region to try to you know deal with Isis and keep it stable yeah you know it's already been said a million times it doesn't need to be said anymore that that the president the president has been so erratic that it has been a disaster abandoning in our our abandoning our allies causing others to doubt our loyalty setting us back in Syria itself empowering the Russians you know that part has been a disaster in terms of how I view the presence of US troops you know I agree with those who say that we we should be drawing down from the Middle East in different places but I also believe two things number one that that has to be you have to be as thoughtful coming out as you are going in and what we saw in Iraq was a lack of thoughtfulness seriousness going in what we see in Syria was a lack of thoughtfulness coming out I believe that whether it's there or Afghanistan or other places there is a role for a small level of forces in a supportive capacity whether they're special operations forces diplomatic forces also to be able to support our efforts and to help to maintain stability and I believe that that may well be where we still end up getting to in Syria it's hard to tell because you know the President on one day will say one thing on another day we'll say another and then he'll tweet something out that's completely different from what he said twice but I hope that we can get to a point where we don't have in several places don't have thousands of troops there but we are able to contribute to maintaining a stability it's you know one last you know question the closer you know you you talked before about credibility generally and you know we've talked about a lot of issues in a tough neighborhood but stepping back you what would you do coming into office to try to restore and reset American credibility in the world that has suffered so much because of pulling out of international agreements because of what images people are seeing here from home because of the Twitter feed how would you go about the project from day one of saying here's how I'm presenting a new face of America to the world that is maybe the biggest challenge for us because I think what these leaders around the world are feeling in their head more thinking in their head is that they see the limits of our government and by that I mean the limit to how constant or stable our approach can be because you could have a new president every four years and because you have so much polarization in Congress all right so there there are some things that I do think that the next president can do number one to make very clear during this campaign where you stand on these issues as clearly as possible to lay that out once you are elected as early as possible to indicate through your appointments to ambassadorships and appointments within the administration you know people who have a track record of expertise and being clear you know what what this president has done to the State Department and decimating it the way that he has and so forth but but in your words and your actions coming into office you can send very strong signals about the direction that you're going to take I also think there are longer-term things that we need to do for our benefit that we'll also do for the benefit of relationships around the world for instance supporting that HR one that would take all states to non partisan or neutral redistricting right because if you want if you want to reduce the polarization in Congress and people to work together you're gonna need to give these congressional people incentive to reach across the aisle so I tie in you know in my mind I'm connecting all of these dots of how we need to change our system here make improvements not only to what they're gonna do to improve our governance at home but how they're gonna impact the trust and our ability to operate overseas and you know that's gonna take a while to make these reforms but in the long run I believe that that's gonna pay off and more than anything else I mean it's need to get off Twitter and stop being so erratic you know I mean people are not gonna trust right away that the next president is gonna be more stable but but they'll see that you know you need to you need to live up to that and we had a great example of that in President mama you know even though we disagreed with george w bush and some of the republican presidents they were a lot more consistent than this guy has been we need to get back to a consistency so you would make rudy giuliani your secretary of state this way just but dialing all around the nation secretary guy so thank you so much for all the work you did they go give it a cue very much [Applause] [Music]

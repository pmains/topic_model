hi I know many of you who are small business owners frantically trying to navigate through this crisis are frustrated by the fits and starts of the SBA loan programs both the emergency and jury disaster loans and the Paycheck protection program from difficulties completing online forms to getting through to the SBA and now news that the funds of ran out of money these programs are not yet delivering the promised relief I share your frustrations and I am working to address many of the challenges let me first discuss the PPP or paycheck protection program this program is part of the Cara's act covers passed at the end of March Congress's intent was to help employees by channeling money to small business employers these are the 30 million small businesses that employ 55 percent of our workforce the loans are forgivable covering eight weeks of payroll up to a total of 10 million dollars with simple qualifying rules intended to get money to you fast this aid was specifically targeted to small businesses with less than 500 employees the house initially wanted to invest more than 500 billion dollars in the fund but the administration and Senate insisted on a smaller amount to the compromise of three hundred and forty nine billion dollars sure not PPP ran out of money yesterday because the demand was so high SBA is saying more than 1.7 million businesses were approved for loans but I've heard from countless small businesses in our district that they have not been able to get the intended and intended assistance this is unacceptable furthermore we learned yesterday that Ruth's Chris Steakhouse received twenty million dollars this is a publicly traded company with 5000 employees getting two times the maximum loan amount eighty three times the average loan size and we don't know how many other large companies got loans or how many other companies double-dipped the problems we are seeing with this program are exactly why we need real oversight oversight to ensure that systems are in place to execute the program that loans are going to the right people that no one is allowed to double get so yes we need to get more money in this program but we also need the administration to deliver the program as intended by Congress to the small businesses that need this money so they can bring their employees back now for the Eid el program this was part of the very first Kovach bill passed by the house on March 4th these are intended to be working capital loans with initial program size of seven billion dollar and a maximum loan set at two million dollars there was a three week approval process but at $10,000 advancements to be provided within three days of applying there's been so much demand that the SBA took it on themselves to reduce the amount and now people are being told by the SBA that they need to reapply this too is unacceptable so what do we do now first we need to get more money into both programs I support the plan to add two hundred fifty billion dollars into PPP immediately let's get that done but we also need to add provisions to automatically extend loan funding if the stay at homeowner stay at home orders extend beyond eight weeks so we don't find ourselves in the exact same hole two months from now while businesses hang in the lurch and Pawlak parts and politics play out in DC and we need to create a separate loan facility for businesses to access capital necessary to navigate the uncertainty on the first phase of the pandemic and plan for another future uncertain future once we get back to work this will likely have to be as large as the PPP program but it will only focus on helping employers to put in place the strategies they need to return to work once again and start to grow our economy so to everyone watching please know that I hear you I appreciate your frustrations I will fight tooth and nail to get programs funded as soon as possible as well as desperately needed money to our hospitals and healthcare workers and our state local governments all with the necessary oversight to make sure the money goes to where it's supposed to thank you I wish you a good weekend and together we will get through this

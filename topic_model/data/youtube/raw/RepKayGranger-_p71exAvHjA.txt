I want to bring in Texas Republican Republican congresswoman Hagar Granger she actually introduced a measure to rebuke would happen that the state of being and representative thanks for joining us it's good to be with you look what was the I think probably knowing what the vote count would be ahead of time what was the main message you were trying to achieve today I was trying to say that the State of the Union address is a tradition where the president gets to speak to the nation and there's been a sense of respect regardless of partisanship or respect for the president and his words and I saw that shattered yesterday and I think it's a very sad thing but I thought that the Speaker of the House who ripped up her speech the speech the president was given after the president had honored some people that had been honored our country over years you know it was something of a disappointment I think to a lot of eight political types you know just folks who don't follow DC all the time but tune in for something as big as the State of the Union to see congressional leaders or Congress people sit on their hands when the Tuskegee Airmen 100 years old now a brigadier general stands up and you know we don't salute a service or we see a young girl who now know she can go to a school and maybe the idea of ever having to work for minimum wage won't be in her vocabulary or all the other wonderful beautiful things that we saw many say that when Speaker Pelosi ripped that speech she was actually ripping them and ripping their achievements as well as well that's exactly what I thought and that's why I brought a privileged resolution to the house the Congress for a vote to say that she missed misused her time and was disrespectful where do we go from here and the big talk right now of course is divisive this has gotten worse not that anyone thought it could interesting enough there was a Gallup poll out this week that shows the approval of the President had an all-time high but Democrats approval of a meths such a low that this is the widest Gulf in the history in this country of Democrats and Republican can that be repaired I hope it can be repaired because we all lose that way the president's polling is very very high because he's doing what he said he would do and he want to talk about that and that that welfare rolls are lower wages are higher it's a good time economically at a time we should also celebrate that and I think that's what was lost yesterday on Tuesday night during that ceremony well we want to celebrate it but we also have some issues in this country and why we elect folks to go to DC hash it out get over personal animosities and and get some things done and and at this part you know me we may squander this amazing opportunity while the economy is on fire to get some other things done and that would be a shame and I certainly hope that that's not what happens I hope we somehow get to work together as as many of us do work together but a situation like that was so public and the disrespect was so obvious that that that set us back some all of us want to get our work done and report back to our district districts what we've done and how we're using this good economy and that's what I'm trying to do congresswoman thank you very much for joining us we appreciate it thank you

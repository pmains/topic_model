wrong for leaders in Texas to point to our own border with Mexico as a potential threat to our own security this week kxan's still praising spoke with a the US House and homeland security committee chairman Michael McCaul about national security and a candid look at the race for president well I think the Europeans have to change their policies are certain in a pre 911 state if you will we have been working with them to change some of their laws for instance with respect to intelligence sharing data sharing at screening the mastermind of the terrorist attacker said that he came in with a 90 other foreign fighters so this is really a writer phenomenon what else can we do as a policy wise to fight this well my committee we just passed a several pieces of legislation i had a task force a report that came out after i traveled to Paris and Belgium and Turkey prior to the Paris attacks and so we had the benefit of studying this issue of screening foreign fighters of tightening up security standards at airports at last points of destination before they can travel into United States we em like this recently passed legislation will help the the president and the executive branch in terms of working with foreign governments to not only protect a Europe but also the homeland from these foreign fighters coming in the United States you have people who say Paris attacks like Brussels could happen anytime anyplace you have people that say you know but statistically you're more likely to get eaten by a shark are they both right yeah I think to some extent they are but but the threat level is the highest i've seen since nine eleven for many reasons one is because the total number of foreign fighters again 40,000 is a pretty large number from 120 different countries that are trained militants that can come into the United States and I think again this is not bin Laden ataques and courier communications these are now a new generation of terrorists that are very sophisticated on the internet is that why you know cyber security so important to use because these Brussels styles attack and cybersecurity they're linked at the same problem yeah I think cyber is the cutting edge of this and the terrorists narrow have learned to exploit them encryption to their benefit now and so that's why I proposed of Senator Mark Warner this National Commission 911 style Commission idea to get all the stakeholders together to form a national consensus to advise Congress on how to move forward and with this country in a heated president I asked the chairman if the fear generated on the campaign trail is justified well I said for quite some time that national security and foreign policy we're going to be probably most important issues going into the 2016 election I will say the candidates at least on my side don't seem to have a whole lot of background experience than that and I think it's going to be important that they have advisers who can help guide them in this very very important issue because I do think when it comes to voters yes come if they feel safe today I think majority they feel like they're not safe and they want their government to protect them from this terrorist threat that has not decreased but has increased

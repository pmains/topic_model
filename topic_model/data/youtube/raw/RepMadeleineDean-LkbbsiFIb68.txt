bug of today's gop is where we start congresswoman madeline dean of pennsylvania is here she served as a house manager during donald trump's second impeachment trial also joining us former republican congresswoman barbara comstock is here she yesterday accompanied officer brian sicknick's family on those meetings and visits to republican senators offices on capitol hill and olivia choi is here former top aide vice president mike pence now the director of the republican accountability project boy do we need that barbara comstock um thank you for being here i i want to first hear about how um officer signings family is doing and what the case was that they made and and how did those senators vote no after hearing it well it was it was a tough day for them but we did start out with uh senator romney who of course was supportive and you know that obviously was very helpful and we ended our day with uh senator murkowski who really talked to gladys sicknick you know kind of mother to mother and really apologized to her saying i'm sorry that you have to come to do this what should be done anyway and gladys sicknick said you know she's not the kind of person who would want to come forward she's usually in the background but she just felt she couldn't be quiet anymore but so she was very you know strong in those meetings it was tough um as as was brian sickness sicknic's partner sandra gomez and then two of the officers who were there that day on january 6 officer dunn who knew brian well and then officer michael fanon and they all made very strong cases about why this should not only be done for the officers and for everything the front lines that continues to be minimized but also for the country and for history as officer dunn said so i certainly agree with my friends tom ridge and michael chertoff and many of the other bipartisan efforts have said we need this commission and as susan collins said i she's going to keep working on this there actually were seven republican votes if if senator toomey had been able to be there so i think as more information comes out um it's going to become even more apparent the need for this and i also would expect that members of congress will start you know i don't know why they haven't started subpoenaing things right now i said on january 7th they should be subpoenaing donald trump's phone records that day and earlier the organizers of the rally all of the people who were involved you think about all of the texts and the messages that went back and forth to the white house on that day to do something we need to have a very distinct timeline and that can start today with existing committees with the effort to then turn it over to a commission down the road so barbara you seem to have just put your finger on what i think had as much to do with the rupture between kevin mccarthy and liz cheney when liz cheney started talking about the sorts of things you just talked about she included kevin mccarthy being subpoenaed to share what he knows and it was at that point that he seemed to pull the rug out not just from liz cheney in leadership but from congressman catco who he sent with the mission of negotiating a bill which was exactly what congressman catgo achieved the democrats yielded to everything and it seemed like the dog caught the car kevin mccarthy panicked and then had scalise whip votes against the legislation he told catco to negotiate what was going on behind the scenes is kevin mccarthy scared well listen i john katko was a great colleague of mine we came into the same class together he was a prosecutor i knew him you know my justice department days and he did negotiate a very good you know bipartisan agreement there that's why he got 35 republicans under those difficult circumstances but the the issue here is the truth is going to come out eventually it would be better for everyone to participate in the process you know there are going to be records that are there that whether the justice department starts doing it or other investigative bodies eventually it'll come out and i think for the sake of the country and for our safety and because of the threats we know that still exist that are out there um you know you have state officials now being threatened officer fanon and officer dunn are getting death threats just for speaking out and talking about what happened to them officer vernon some some of the members we talked to yesterday didn't realize that officer fanon's um assailant the one who tased him in the back of his neck 12 times had been already arrested and he was a well-known trump activist who had been active since 2016. his name was daniel rodriguez there were three others that were also arrested in the connection with the brutal brutal assault on officer fanon that almost killed him he had a heart attack also and still has so they were not familiar with that they didn't know that this was a trump activist from california and you know he was someone talked about the deep state he had been you know really in all of these you know dark you know a lot on the internet talking about all of these conspiracy theories had really you know strongly took hold with him and that's why he was here with other friends so that has to all be looked at and how that connects to this rally on january 6 and all the people who are communicating back and forth and those facts exist and those records exist and there's going to be nothing you can do about getting rid of them so we might as well know sooner because we know they're still out there attacking even republicans and actually i should point out michael fanon officer fanon and brian sicknick are republicans and that's something that brian sicknick's partner pointed out to the members yesterday she said she loved you he loved you guys he was a republican he voted for donald trump and yet we're leaving these guys on the field instead of getting to the truth as lisa murkowski said congresswoman dean can you do what barbara comstock is suggesting can you subpoena records from the white house the phone call records at least get the times at least start to put some of these pieces of evidence in place while we wait for some sort of commission to be formed either by speaker pelosi if the bipartisan efforts fall apart um or i guess there's some history of the watergate select committee was a select committee in the senate is there more investigative work that can be done in the interim yes we can and we will and of course we have an administration that will not do what the previous administration did which was block every subpoena every attempt at oversight but let me thank congress congresswoman comstock for her role uh for her escorting gladys sicknick around yesterday in the senate how is it that mrs sicknick's words draped in her grief fell on the deaf ears of senators we needed only ten we got six too bad senator toomey my own senator wasn't there to vote yes where were three more where were all the others where were they in search of the truth i'm furious with the senate for leaving this woman for requiring her to come to the senate and then not heeding her words as she struggles through her grief so yes here in the house we will do everything we possibly can we will subpoena those who need to be subpoenaed but the independent commission was the way to go we don't need this to fall into party lines and narratives that become so poisonous we need people who are not politically tied to take a look at what happened on january the 6th think about the i was there as you know uh but for those who were not there they're appalled i have staff members furious today they weren't there but they actually say we have to learn the truth i think a lot of martin luther king's words uh and from learn from the letter from birmingham jail which i used to teach in any writing course i ever taught over the course of 10 years and what he said is we have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of bad people but for the appalling silence of good people mitch mcconnell kevin mccarthy your appalling silence your appalling muslin of the truth is shameful and carson i mean the reporting suggests it's more than their silence i mean they didn't stay silent and say listen uh vote your conscience folks they aggressively whipped support to kill it i mean this was killed by kevin mccarthy and mitch mcconnell what what do you think they're hiding what exactly what are they afraid of what are they hiding are they complicit in some way will we uncover and and ultimately and barbara absolutely right we'll get to the truth the facts will be revealed the truth will be revealed they're afraid of the truth uh they're defending nonsense and we know that and so what i hope is that the american public rejects their alternative facts or their silence i was thinking back to you know the very first set of press conferences under the previous administration and you remember the person who came forward and said well maybe there are alternative facts sadly the previous kellyanne conway yeah exactly uh with um who was our state of the union i'm forgetting who it was your colleague who answered those questions yes it was literally about the crowd size remember how long ago that was and how nonsensical that seemed to argue alternative facts as to that which is discoverable and known uh it just was bizarre but sadly guess what four five years later uh we we see those seeds were sown and we sadly are reaping the seeds of falsehoods of alternative facts of people who cannot actually face the truth what's the most dangerous part of this is if we don't get to the bottom of this we suffer and risk this repeating itself and perhaps in even worse fashion this was the interruption of the what is precious to us the peaceful transfer of power imagine that those who were there who were hunted on that day who could have been killed but for the courageous acts of officer sicknick and every other capitol police officer don't want to get to the truth shame on them you know olivia the congresswoman makes a really interesting point i mean this was all previewed for us by sean spicer who um i'll never forget watching it live argued on that first day in an ill-fitting suit that the crowd size gathered for donald trump was actually larger than the crowd size gathered for former president obama and i think kellyanne conway was the one who went on chuck todd's show and talked about alternative facts the sad truth is that a lot of the republican base believes that those are the real facts that shows like this are not the real facts and what the republican party seems to have co-signed is they seem to have made official the break with reality what mitch mcconnell and kevin mccarthy did not just by staying silent silence would have been an egregious approach to an attack on them where the mission statement was hang mike pence but mike pence's own brother voted against the commission so i i wonder what you do to sort of break through again with reality right well the actions of the republicans in the senate today are not only shameful but they're dangerous because what they're doing is that they're not going to allow the truth to be told to americans and that's what is needed really at this moment where you're seeing the threat of domestic terrorism rise across our country and you're seeing these groups you saw these descend upon the us capital but these people are still out there they're still talking to each other they're so radicalizing and they're radicalizing not really with them themselves but they're radicalizing because the leaders of our country are feeding them these narratives repeatedly over and over and it is it is shameful and it's horrifying to see the actions of mccarthy and mcconnell where they stand by and they allow this to happen because what they're doing is that they're saying that they're they're saying that they're okay with it they're doing the seal of approval and they're saying that the disinformation that they spread that led to this event on january 6 they're going to continue to push and they will continue to push it for months to come and they'll try to sweep it under the rug and i think that that's what makes an investigation still critical it needs to happen we need to get to the facts we need to push out the truth about what led to this the months before what happened on that day whatever dereliction of duty happened which we saw in the oval office but also with others that were involved that's what is critical in whatever form and it's unfortunate that it couldn't be bipartisan because that would have been so much more effective in diffusing what we have right now which is a pandemic of disinformation across this country on lies about an election that are just not true and their lies are going to continue to go on that are going to embolden these terrorist groups across the country barbara construct i want to come back to kevin mccarthy's leadership i mean he couldn't get rid of liz cheney fast enough he had to sort of leak some hot mic tape to make clear that that was his mission before he got back to washington to actually do it but this guy is still a member in good standing matt gates last night i'm not going to play it on this air but i'll read what he said he said we have a second amendment in this country and i think we have an obligation to use it to which kris krebs who i believe you've worked with he was the homeland security official in charge of making sure that 2020 was the most secure election in our country's history he achieved that aim and was fired by donald trump for doing so also a lifelong republican he said this i avoid commenting on members of congress and their inane remarks but as a recent recipient of multiple death threats this clear call to violence by a member of congress is beyond the pale it's disqualifying and un-american if you associate with this you're part of the problem kevin mccarthy is associated with this because we know he knows how to cut someone loose he did it to liz cheney not two weeks ago why is matt gates and why are matt gates and marjorie taylor green members in good standing and liz cheney is not well i certainly don't think they should be and i think there may be people within the caucus who will start taking action on that i said back early on in january february and then certainly as these investigations into matt gates which were actually started by donald trump's justice department as they went on i said why on earth is he on the judiciary committee why is he even in the caucus i certainly think eventually marjorie green i think will get kicked out of the caucus but instead of doing it now they'll drag it out and make it miserable just like the investigation when things are going to inevitably happen anyway you should just turn the page get it done and move on and instead they are dragging out this painful ugly face of of of the party with with the gates green grift tour that's going on now that is really not just you know a clown car show but it's a dangerous thing that they are doing and and they're continuing to spread disinformation and we're ill-served to have them in the caucus and i think more and more members will want them out when you talk to people privately they tell you what an embarrassment they are marjorie green's already attacking kevin mccarthy and i believe she already started attacking elise stefanik the person that that replaced liz cheney so nobody is going to be odious enough for those two and so they are a cancer on the party just as donald trump has been and that is why we need the an independent outside investigation that looks at all of these things and gets it out of the political sphere but as i was mentioning earlier that doesn't mean since in prior life i was chief counsel on a house committee where we did do investigations and so when you get those documents those documents and records themselves aren't political it's going to be the interpretation and how they're tied together so if you get them now get that started i think that will accelerate the acceptance ultimately hopefully sooner rather than later of an independent commission congresswoman barbara comstock was very good at what she did and and that is a pathway that might be the thing that makes republicans say oh we don't want that i mean do you think there's a way to call their bl and i i part of me thinks that the democrats have done this yeah i wish i had done it back in january because remember in january everybody was saying let's have this independent commission so it is unfortunate we've lost you know that five months that we should have been jumping on it back then but you know still move forward get records congresswoman dean um do you think that that maybe democrats sort of win by by losing i if i will and i only mean that in the spirit that figure pelosi wanted this bipartisan commission um so so much that she conceded all of these um you know equal representation basically everything kevin mccarthy wanted should is it time to just do this do this with a democrat you know led obviously it's still bipartisan i mean i think we should start um correcting any republican who says that that's not bipartisan there were democrats on the benghazi committee they had 33 hearings i mean it would still be a bipartisan committee in the house is that something that may yield a faster and better result if we can't get a bipartisan commission off the ground i'm not certain it'll yield a better one because you know how poisoned it will be with toxic narratives right particularly coming from out of the aisle but uh failing an independent commission we have to do it we have an obligation to do it to protect our precious democracy if we turn a blind eye on this we actually risk losing our democracy and i won't do that so yes i'm certain that speaker pelosi will move forward but you're absolutely right i hope everyone notes the negotiations that took place between benny thompson and representative katco and got to a place of absolute bipartisanship and equal number of representatives and they would be independent not political not electeds and equal subpoena power which is a critically important measure uh i want to go back to the point of of mrs siknik vladisignig talked about her son and said she boasted of his work ethic that he was only there to serve our country republicans who denied this independent commission are the ones that speak very loudly that they're pro-police they worry about liberal democrats trying to defund the police no we're here to fund the police to find out what happened to find out exactly how these police officers this protectionary force that i know now much better than i did before the insurrection and before impeachment they are servants to us and to our country how is it that the republican party does not want to protect those who protect us does not want to find out the truth and the reason they don't want to find out the truth is what it might expose about them we are left with no other rational conclusion to draw congresswoman madeline dean thank you so much and former congresswoman barbara comstock it is really a privilege to get to talk to both of you thank you for starting us off today

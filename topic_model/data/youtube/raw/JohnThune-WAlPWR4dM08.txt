thank you madam chair and ranking member Bozeman for holding today's hearing on this very important or these very important titles in the farm bill and I also want to thank our USDA Witnesses for appearing before the committee it's nice to have fellow South dakotans here administrator bunker and administrator du Chanel with us today it's critically important that the next Farm Bill provides strong safety net and risk management tools that allow farmers and ranchers to continue working to Feed and Fuel our nation and the world crop insurance and commodity programs must be maintained and where possible improved in the next farm bill to help producers face challenges from high inflation and input costs to adverse weather events before I turn to my questions I want to raise concerns with usda's emergency relief program Erp phase two I appreciate usda's efforts through phase one Erp which generally worked well in supporting producers with crop losses in 20 and 21 but the phase two methodology of comparing schedule F or taxable income from Benchmark periods and disaster years often does not accurately I should say reflect crop losses that Congress meant to cover so I want to urge USDA to consider its phase two methodology and to use the phase one approach going forward for 2022 crop losses under secretary Bonnie as you know agriculture risk coverage and price loss coverage are important safety net tools for producers I secured a provision in the 2023 farm bill that allows producers to annually elect and enroll in Arc or PLC starting in 21 and again in 22 and 23 and I appreciate usd's efforts to coordinate this FSA deadline with rmas March 15th deadline to apply for crop insurance for crops as we work to build off successes of the 2018 Farm Bill like the annual election what else can be done to maximize producers options and access to decision-making tools and what ideas do you have to better streamline administration of programs across the agencies that you oversee so let me on the arc PLC front let me let me talk to turn to administrator du Chanel I just say more broadly there was a conversation while you were out of the room about ad hoc and the ad hoc disaster and crop insurance and we we are committed to crop insurance we know how important it is in your neck of the woods but it's important across the country and we think uh you know creating incentives producers to take advantage of crop insurance same thing on the nap side the more we can do to get them into those those regular safety net programs uh we think that's critically important and so we want to continue to encourage that let me turn to Zach on the on the arc PLC front uh thank you Senator it's good to see you good to be around South dakotans as well uh with regard to Arc PLC in the annual election we hear that producers like that one of the challenges that we hear producers Express all across the country as we get a chance to go out and visit in the countryside is reference prices as Senator Bozeman mentioned need to be adjusted in order to make that a better tool for them and we welcome conversations with our colleagues on the hill about how do we make thoughtful decisions about that to the point Senator bozen made as well about a better allocation of the pro funding that's going to ad hoc programs as well another conversation that comes up as we dive into our communities that maybe are more underserved and haven't had the benefit of these programs for decades and generations is the allocation of Base acres and the fact that in many of these communities where they're trying every bit as hard to farm base Acres don't exist we don't have a base acre Concept in grazing land for instance in Western South Dakota so those are some things that we've heard from our producers and we welcome conversations with you all about how can we make adjustments to make it fit better yeah thank you um let me just and direct this to all of you but uh Senator Lujan and I are working to introduce our proposal to improve the effectiveness and timeliness of disaster programs for livestock producers usda's technical assistance is vital as we work to refine and improve programs the next farm bill will you make it a priority for USDA to provide technical assistance in a timely manner absolutely thank you our proposal also seeks to improve the accuracy of the drought monitor which triggers certain disaster programs and I'd ask I guess any of you what ideas you have to strengthen disaster programs and the drought Monitor and the next farm bill um and uh you could comment on that be great thank you yeah willing absolutely willing to work with you on that and I want to I want to return to the disaster question here we're increasingly facing uh pretty intense disasters whether it's a hurricane in Florida Puerto Rico wildfire in New Mexico I know Senate lujan's been engaged with um and we're essentially having to build jump teams within FSA to be able to Surge staff to those areas same thing on the nrcs side because there's some emergency authorities there um and so we're we're building uh essentially the ability to almost put together Incident Management teams to be able to deal with those disasters I want to bring it to your attention because it's increasingly taking resources and of of USDA and it's an important issue we do a good job for example in Wildfire on Disaster Response but we're going to need to to standardize How We Do Disaster Recovery as well and we're spending more time on it and it's a increasingly a critical issue and I think one that that I want to make sure you all are thinking about as well thank you my time expired Madam chair I've got some additional questions and I'll submit them for the record

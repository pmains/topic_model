madam speaker i stand today to voice my support for h.r 18 the no taxpayer funding for abortion act which would protect the american people from a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars i co-spondered hr 18 during my first few days in congress because i along with the majority of american voters believe that no person should be required to pay for abortions or abortion services president biden himself pledged never to force taxpayers to pay for abortions and yet has broken that promise by failing to include the hyde amendment in his new budget proposal devaluing the life of unborn children has desensitized america we should never use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion services instead we should focus on life-saving resources that value the life of both the mother and the child madam speaker i asked unanimous consent that the committees on energy and commerce ways and means and the judiciary be discharged from further consideration of h.r 18 and asked for its immediate consideration in this house i yield back

speaker the Standing Rock Sioux and all tribes have the right to self-determination and a say in decisions that impact their health land and cultural preservation it's not just a matter of justice it's the law don't we all as Americans have that right isn't that the whole premise of our democracy being able to have a voice and decisions that affect our lives is the cornerstone of our American democracy it thrives when we stand up speak up and voice our concerns on matters vital to our existence as humans like our health clean drinking water and cultural survival that is why I stand with the Standing Rock Sioux and hundreds of tribes throughout our nation to demand that the Army Corps of Engineers comply with their legal trust responsibilities to protect tribal lands cancel the Dakota access pipeline permit conduct meaningful consultation with the tribes and do a complete environmental impact statement the Standing Rock Sioux and neighboring tribes are rightfully concerned that the pipeline will destroy sacred sites and that an oil spill would cause devastating and irreversible harm to their land health and drinking water the proposed pipeline is over 1,000 miles long transporting up to 16,000 gallons of crude oil a minute upstream from the tribes water source near the reservation and on tribal land a leak would be devastating it was already determined to be too risky to construct near the city of Bismarck's water sources the Army Corps is granted construction permits despite legal and non-compliance warnings by other federal agencies that on September 8th I called for a system-wide Gao investigative report on federal agencies compliance with meaningful tribal consultation policies on September 9th the department's of Interior justice and the army announced a pause in construction to review their compliance with federal policies I welcome this review tribes have rights under law the federal government has a moral and legally enforceable obligation to protect tribal treaties land and resources under the federal trust responsibility tribes have the right to regular and meaningful consultation under executive order 13 175 under the Historic Preservation Act federal agencies are required to be responsible stewards of nation's historic resources and consult with Indian tribes when their actions may impact sacred sites furthermore the Army Corps under the Clean Water Act must protect our nation's waters from contamination by conducting accurate environmental assessments to determine if construction permits should be granted unfortunately the Army Corps granted a permit based on flawed assessments incomplete information and a willful disregard for the serious concerns raised by the tribe and other federal agencies chairman David archambault from the Standing Rock Sioux reported that they were not meaningfully consulted and didn't even know about the course assessment until is made public he has serious concerns about the pipeline's harm to the tribes health water source and sacred sites letters from the Department of Interior it Environmental Protection Agency and advisory council on historic preservation to the Army Corps lists they're serious concerns they mentioned the potential of a devastating oil spill lack of emergency response plans desecration of sacred sites non compliance with federal policies and laws and even with the coors environmental assessment they recommended a full environmental impact study and expanded environmental justice analysis consideration of all sacred sites along the path of the pipeline and meaningful tribal consultation prior to any decisions moving forward all federal agencies must conduct meaningful tribal consultation and address concerns regarding risks to drinking water and desecration of sacred sites the core must cancel their faulty permit near tribal land and complete a full environmental impact statement only then can the president make an informed decision to permanently stop construction the pine flying on federal property near tribal land you have the authority and moral imperative to do what is right time after time tribes I've seen their treaties broken their lands taken and sacred sites desiccated I visited with the Standing Rock Sioux and witnessed Native Americans from hundreds of other tribes standing together in peace and prayer to protect their water and n say ancestral sacred sites I witnessed their dignity and their resolve they stand in solidarity for their full rights under federal law and for their voices to be heard they stand in unity and I stand with them

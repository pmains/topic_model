massachusetts lawmakers passing new legislation yesterday which will allow illegal migrants to obtain driver's license in the state despite the state's governor vetoing the bill last month massachusetts is now set to join 16 other states which already allow migrants to have a license u.s army veteran and texas congressional candidate wesley hunt joins us now wesley good morning to you it wasn't even close in massachusetts they overwhelmingly vetoed the governor and supporters of this say that it'll make streets safer because now illegal immigrants could take a driver's test before they get their driver's license and to that you say what you know this is the typical playbook from the democrat party when everything is failing and everything is going the worst that we've ever seen in this in this country in modern history instead of actually changing the politician what they actually do is they just want to change the voter and and by allowing illegal immigrants to have an id that's flat out un-american and what they're trying to do is they're trying to flood our market with all these illegal voters given what we've seen over the course of the past year with their inability to have free and fair elections and it's just going to be their response to it to allow millions of people to have an id and quite frankly to the tax paying american and the everyday american this is absolutely disgusting outrageous and quite frankly this is why we're gonna have a really good november because these tone-deaf policies are what the world are watching right now they aren't listening and quite frankly we're fed up with it and when it comes to elections texas republicans are gearing up for next week's special election in the state's 34th district with republican myra flores facing off against democrat challenger dan sanchez so basically the democrats they're not spending as much money when it comes to things like campaigning on tv so what does this signify to you that the gop is really pushing forward with this but the democrats seem to be just kind of playing it safe and not really doing anything when it comes to campaigning well miraflores is going to win because of the failed policies of the of the democrat party and just this last primary here in texas we've seen a 300 percent increase in a republican primary for hispanic voters at the border and you know why because every day americans have fled up fed up with it and i'm so proud to support myra and her efforts through my leadership pack help a hellfire pack we've also supported 56 other candidates just like her their diverse candidates they're military veterans they're people that want to step up and serve this country and reverse the path that we have seen over the course of the past 18 months some of those candidates include cassie garcia texas my west point classmate john james from michigan jeremy hunt from georgia and jennifer ruth green and these are the kinds of candidates that we need to take back the house and the left is petrified of this they know what's coming and they know that brave americans are stepping up to stop these failed policies mara will do very well this week yeah and this race is a big deal because uh that is a historically blue district so you're saying that she could flip for us she could flip it red there's also this might be one of the reasons why she could win because there's this new abc news ipsos poll it finds that 57 of republicans are very enthusiastic to vote in the midterms compared to only 44 percent of democrats and then you got to look at the president's approval rating now only 33 percent with 55 percent of americans disapproving of the president and we're hearing uh the president is really frustrated because he considers former president trump the worst president in history and now his approval rating is even worse than that and this administration the ponton administration it reminds me of the old movie the old movie blockbuster uh the titanic and i remember this one scene as the titanic was sinking to the bottom of the ocean the violinists were actually still playing on the deck of the titanic and right now the left is focused far more on the violinist in this concerto than worried about the fact that they are driving this country to the bottom of the ocean but we are not fooled we know this is the worst gas price that we've ever seen in my entire lifetime with a food crisis we have an energy crisis we have an attack on our oil and gas industry right here in this country and of course we see what's happening at the border we will not be fooled and that's why november for us is going to be historic

during debate over the drug pricing policies and how congress should address access and affordability it is important to remember why we are having this debate in the first place which is the patient unfortunately the patient and the importance of access to health and life-giving medication sometimes gets lost in the shuffle but that is exactly what the core of this debate needs to be about it's about the dad who can't afford the medication for his child and has to decide every month whether to cut corners on food for the family or medicine for his child it's about the mom who is working two jobs to help pay for her aging mother's medicine while also paying for health care for her kids it's about my patient who told me once that she collected cans to help pay for her insulin and told me that she figured out a way to afford her medicine by only taking half of the dosage to make it last longer which makes her medicine of course ineffective the average american often cannot afford their medication even if they have insurance even if they have medicare so seniors and families all across america are rationing their medications or going without them completely because they simply cost too much and i know i'm hearing about it from my constituents and i'm sure that everyone up here on the dice is hearing similar stories for example david a senior from beaumont california in my district contacted my office recently to tell me about the heart medications doctors wants to prescribe of which there are no generic alternatives the medication is so expensive that after the first three months of the year david goes into the donut hole where he will remain for the rest of the year paying three thousand two hundred ninety four dollars in nine months just for his heart medications for seniors living on a fixed income this not affordable and is not acceptable individuals and their doctors should choose the treatment based on what is best for the health of the patient not primarily on whether the patient can afford to pay for the drug out of pocket this system is unacceptable america can and must do better and it is time we do something about it health care is a right for everyone and access to prescription medication should not be reserved as a privilege only for the wealthy few

i have the opportunity to serve on both the armed services committee and the foreign relations committee um let me begin by just simply saying that this group of of of united states senators here stand in unison in unison when we talk about our foreign policy just to summarize number one we support what secretary blinken said today about the fact that we stand solidly with our friends the citizens of ukraine we welcomed his strong comments this morning second of all when president biden announced in february that he would not enforce sanctions on nordstrom 2 it was met by mr putin immediately beginning in march to amass soldiers and supplies on the ukrainian border not acceptable we strongly recommend that as a response to that that sanctions be imposed and that there should be a cost to mr putin and his activities in and around ukraine furthermore it is critical and you've heard this from almost all of us it is critical that we provide defensive capabilities to our allies in ukraine as they courageously defend their country against the threat of a russian invasion and finally we're not looking for war we want the diplomatic activity to continue and as a body we support a diplomatic response and a final outcome without bloodshed diplomacy is critical but mr putin has to understand that he cannot he simply cannot use aggression to reshape europe thank you thank you

thank you mr chairman and thank you senator cramer for letting me jump over you here with these questions mr goffman regarding the proposed good neighbor rule did you reach out to the states before deciding to move forward on that rule uh senator uh lummus that's a an excellent question um because it's a it's a topic that's really important to the environmental protection agency and in particular to administrator regan um my understanding is that our regional offices um uh worked with the states well they didn't reach out to my state in of wyoming and we've heard from numerous states and stakeholders that the comment period for this hugely impactful rule is too short even with this little two-week extension that you've added so are you willing to extend the comment period for the proposed rule given its massive impacts um well senator llamas i think that is a very important issue and if you don't mind can i make a request and then i'll answer the question i'd really like to get your guidance and advice on anyone in wyoming you think we need to be talking to before we finalize it i'd be happy to get you that information that's awesome okay and one of the big concerns is uh air quality models that are developed for eastern states uh need to be recalibrated for the western states there's a difference and so i'm curious why isn't there a model for the good neighbor rule that's specific to western states um well my understanding is that in fact we did look we did apply our model specifically to the distinctive topography and atmospheric dynamics in western states i think like you we fully recognized that what what we can see with our models looking at at eastern uh air issues is not identical to what we have to look at uh when we look at western air issues let me see so we ditch a little bit we did take account of uh the distinctive features of as i said uh western air movement and topography okay i will get you some some names because we have concerns about not having been contacted so switching to regional haze rules should states have the flexibility in the development of state implementation plans that meet the objectives of the regional haze rules generally yes senator regional hayes rules as you know as the senator from the state that includes grand teton and yellowstone where many americans have spent you know had wonderful experiences in part because the air is so clear there that's why it's so important generally the strategy of the clean air act and of the epa is to rely on states to determine the emission reductions that are needed to fulfill their obligations so this is a head scratcher for me because epa's substituted their preferences for the state's plan and the state implementation plan meets the objectives of the clean air act regional haze its programs why is the epa substituting its judgment for states given what your statement well um senator lumus i think i want to give you and governor gordon credit for the leadership you've shown on this issue because for the last year give or take um the state and um and the utility pacific that operates some of the critical plants in wyoming have been in extensive discussions some of them are confidential because they're being taken they're being conducted under the auspices of the circuit court's mediation practice but i believe we're very very close to a resolution that the state and the utility are have reached that will allow critical facilities in wyoming to continue to operate while making the emissions reductions that have been identified as uh required under the under the regional haze and how close are we i think we're waiting for one more step which would be the state uh submitting a revised implementation plan my time's up but i'll follow up with you on some of the things we've discussed today thank you very much mr goffman thank you senator i'm looking forward to it

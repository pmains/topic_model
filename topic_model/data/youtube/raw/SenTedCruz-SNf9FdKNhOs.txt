Thank You mr. chairman mr. Macklin good good to see you again good to see you thank you for your service and please express a thank you to all the good men and women aboard a patrol for their heroic service each and every day keeping keeping this country safe I want to start with a simple question in your judgment of your professional experience do walls work unquestionably so if I understand it correctly San Diego the wall there was built in 1992 illegal traffic dropped 88% over 18 years and 95% over 23 years we saw the same experience in El Paso and El Paso the wall was built in 1993 illegal traffic dropped 72% over one year and 95 percent over 22 years same thing in Tucson wall built in 2000 illegal traffic dropped 90 percent over 15 years Yuma the wall was built in 2005 the illegal traffic dropped 95 percent over four years or those figures accurate yes senator and and and does that reflect your professional experience that putting a physical barrier can have a significant impact decreasing and stopping illegal immigration yes and that's both for human traffickers and narcotics traffickers no question let's talk about a second topic which is kids and there's been considerable discussion about kids and and senator Feinstein mentioned that she and I have been working on legislation together I remain hopeful this ought to be an area bipartisan cooperation it seems to me that everyone Republican and Democrat should be able to agree number one that that families should stay together that the best place for a child is with his or her mom or dad but the rub is number two in what capacity it has been the position of some congressional Democrats that in order to keep families together what CBP must do is release both the children and the adults I think that is a mistaken approach the legislation that I've introduced that I have been negotiating with senator Feinstein would mandate that families stay together but stay together in a secure environment and then expedite the proceedings so that if that those families have a valid claim for asylum that claim gets adjudicated adjudicated quickly and granted but if they don't have a valid claim of asylum that claim gets adjudicated quickly it gets denied and they get put on a plane and sent home in your experience what is the effectiveness of a catch-and-release system a system that apprehends people crossing illegally and then then releases them it invites further unlawful behavior and and what is the differential in terms of the timing for adjudicated cases between the detained docket where the individual is in custody versus the non detained docket where they're released detained docket in my experience moves very efficiently six to eight weeks the non detained docket is years one of the significant challenges with our current policy is we have now created massive incentives to bring kids with you because we have essentially turned a child into a get-out-of-jail-free card to what extent are you saying conduct from cartels deliberately bringing either unaccompanied minors or family units over with the intention of gaming the system in the United States so I can tell you senator that in the last ten months as Chief Hastings briefed yesterday Borba qualities identified approximately 1,700 individuals underground that presented as a family unit that had made fraudulent claims and even more concerning there was reporting this week of attorneys advising people on how to do this in Central America and providing fake birth certificates fake indications of relationship before they depart from Central America to enable this process you're absolutely right that if you bring a child you will be released you're immune from the enforcement of the of the law between ports of injury and that's not a situation that's sustainable so let me underscore that point because it's I think really quite stunning so you've seen in excess of 1700 cases where children were with adults you were told they were a family unit you discovered that was fraudulent so whoever those adults were they were not actual family members of those kids correct and let me ask you if a child is in the custody of human trafficker or a narcotics trafficker how frequently are you encountering physical abuse or sexual abuse of those children in the custody of traffickers it's unfortunately a very common occurrence so if we were concerned with with taking care of kids we would want to do everything possible to prevent little boys and little girls from being in the custody of traffickers who are fraudulently using those kids to gain our law enforcement is that right of course well thank you for your good work in that regard thank you

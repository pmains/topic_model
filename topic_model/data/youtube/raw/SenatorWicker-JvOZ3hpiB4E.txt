senator from Mississippi president I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins senator in Hoff and I be allowed to give our remarks before the next vote without objection thank you madam president as we see this is that difficult time of the year when we pause and say goodbye farewell and Godspeed to departing members of this body uh Senator Collins and I are are prepared to act as a team at this moment to wish the very best and pay tribute to two individuals Richard Shelby of Alabama and Jim inhofe of Oklahoma senator Shelby is a gifted legislator and Southern gentleman whose impact on This Nation will not soon be forgotten his colleagues and constituents know him for his long record of championing Economic Development as a champion in the House of Representatives and in the senate for our military as leader of the Appropriations Committee here in the Senate Richard Shelby is the quintessential problem solver he's always known how to sit down negotiate and get a result and I wish him the best in this final month of his career and once again getting a result indeed the jobs created through Richard Shelby's legislation and committee work number in the hundreds of thousands the hundreds of thousands of jobs so it's no surprise that there are now monuments to Richard Shelby's leadership all over Alabama and the entire nation as his next door neighbors across the state line we mississippians have directly benefited from his leadership so I wish him and his wife Annette well as they begin the next chapter and I now turn to my friend the senior senator from Oklahoma Jim inhofe a man that I've had the privilege of working with on the armed services committee these last 14 years Senator enhoff represented Oklahoma for 28 years in this body and six years before that in the House of Representatives in all of those years he could always be counted on to attend every single Wednesday morning prayer breakfast and Thursday Bible study one time he had to attend by telephone because he was called Away by a family crisis but we could always count on him and he's been a close friend he's been a close friend on both sides of the aisle to people like Barbara Boxer of California Jack Reed of Rhode Island Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democratic leader Harry Reid perhaps it was those friendships that explained his mountain of legislative success with bipartisan achievements that include three Highway bills for water resources and development acts seven National Defense authorization Acts including the current bill pending before this body a bill which literally Bears his name but that success also came from his breadth of life experience he understood how to create jobs because he himself had done that as a businessman for 30 years working in aviation real estate and insurance he understood the challenges of local government because he had been the mayor of Tulsa in a state legislator as a leader on the armed services committee he could speak for our men and women in uniform because he had been one of them having served in the army as a personal friend of Ronald Reagan he never wavered in advocating for peace through strength Oklahoma's five military bases are unquestionably better off today because of their staunch Advocate Senator Jim inhofe thanks to his leadership veterans have better facilities our air force is better equipped and the military now has africom as a distinct mission on the African continent it Bears saying that Senator inhofe has a long-standing affection for Africa and the people of Africa there's no one in Congress or in the state department for that matter who can surpass his personal knowledge of African leaders on a typical Congressional Delegation trip he would hit an average of 12 countries in 10 days covering 18 000 miles and meeting with civilian and military leaders at every stop always looking for an opportunity to pray with him always visiting American troops he's been to Africa more times than any member of Congress since America's founding 172 visits on the African continent when he isn't making law or traveling the globe or watching his grandson's athletic events there's a good chance he's in the air somewhere flying a Cessna because Senator inhofe is also pilot inhofe with nearly 12 000 hours of flight time including a solo Flight Around the World he will also be remembered for that 1991 trip in which he flew the flight path of Wiley Post which went straight through Russian airspace his Russian escort pilot even remarked on his outstanding piloting skills as Jim inhofe departs this chamber he leaves behind a wealth of friends and an army of former staff whose talent and loyalty are a testament to the man himself I know he will look forward to spending more time with his wife of 63 years okay and is 20 grandchildren and his 20 children and grandchildren both of these gentlemen both of these friends Jim inhofe and Richard Shelby we will go down as Titans of the Senate their enormous contributions to the good of our nation will not soon be forgotten and we will miss their company I wish them both farewell and God's speed and now I yield to my friend the senator from Maine Senator Collins for her remarks about these two outstanding friends

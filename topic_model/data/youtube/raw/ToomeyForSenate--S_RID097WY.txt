well the house has passed a disastrous health care bill the Senate's going to take one up soon and we're hoping that our supporters will urge members of the US House and Senate to vote against any approach that really takes us down this path that the house took very recently the bill that the House passed over trillion dollars of new spending huge tax hikes taxes on wages on workers on employers mandates galore on employers and individuals it'll end up resulting in rationing and the effect on health care premiums they're going to be higher on average about three thousand dollars per family over time this is a disaster this is the wrong direction we ought not to be going in this direction what we could be doing and what we should be doing are the common-sense reforms that will actually lower costs and improve accessibility to health care we ought to give individuals the same tax deduction when they go out and buy health insurance plans that employers get employers can deduct the cost of health care but individuals cannot we ought to level out the playing field on the tax code in that respect we ought to create more competition by allowing insurance companies to compete across state lines pennsylvania families ought to have hundreds of choices of different insurers and different products so they can pick what works best for their family at the lowest possible cost and that's what would happen if we allowed competition across state lines that's what we ought to be doing and finally i really believe that tort reform has to be part of this process we've got too much expense in the direct costs of litigation and medical malpractice insurance but also the indirect costs of doctors having a practice defensive medicine and ordering tests and procedures that aren't really necessary but they have to do to avoid the risk of litigation this is the direction we can head in most Pennsylvanian support these ideas we don't need to have a trillion dollar bill with massive tax increases mandates that will drive people out of private health insurance and onto a government-run plan that they may not want to be on that's the wrong direction let's hope it's not too late and we can still reach out to members of the US Senate in the house and get the kind of common sense forms that we need and get away from this big trillion dollar bill

hi I'm congresswoman Marcia fudge may is Mental Health Awareness Month I ask you to join me in the fight against a mental health issue often misunderstood drug addiction I want to begin by thanking the alcohol drug addiction and mental health services board of kyle the county and your CEO build in a hand for enlisting me in the struggle to expand access to drug treatment i am honored to be named your legislator of the year on the federal level and i look forward to advocating on behalf of the people of northeast ohio drug addiction is an issue you all know well traditionally handled by law enforcement or the criminal justice system drug addiction is claiming the lives of many Americans simply crying out for help in 2014 44,000 died from drug overdoses across the country and in 2013 250 people died in Ohio's Cuyahoga and summit counties but when many of these Americans try to get help our community facilities turned them away because of current limits on how Medicaid money can be used to pay for care this is not only a health issue but a social crisis untreated addiction can lead to homelessness more drug-related arrest increased hospital visits and higher insurance premiums for everyone i introduced the breaking addiction act to address these issues and to help trouble Americans in Ohio and across the country under current law Medicaid funds can only be used for services provided in mental health treatment facilities also known as I MDS with 16 beds or less once those treatment facilities reach capacity they deny patients treatment my bill helps these communities facilities by allowing States to apply for waivers to change the way their Medicaid funds can be used the waiver increases the number of beds that can be covered under the federal program allowing them to serve more patients the breaking addiction Act will not increase the federal deficit it could actually save taxpayer dollars studies estimate that for every dollar spent on addiction treatment Society saves twelve dollars in drug-related crime criminal justice theft and health care costs yes we have a serious drug problem but it can be solved if we work together millions of Americans suffer from mental health issues and we need to listen to their cries for help we need to tell them we understand and they are not alone this may join me in calling on my congressional colleagues to pass the breaking addiction Act give States the flexibility that they need to help hurting Americans thank you

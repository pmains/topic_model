senator john kennedy is a member of the senate budget committee so this is very front and center on his desk right now he joins us now senator always good to have you with us you know i'm struck in that sound bite that senator schumer said that it was almost rooseveltian uh referring to the scope of the new deal and how that truly transformed the united states government a lot of agencies and entities that didn't even exist before existed after that but let's put this up on the screen because it's actually a lot bigger than that the first new deal represented 5.9 percent of the us gdp this whole kit and caboodle represents almost 30 percent 6.6 trillion of the united states gross domestic products are your well it's thoughts the new deal this is a bad deal let me let me be clear martha what we're talking about senator schumer sets the agenda in the senate and there there are two bills that uh he has put before of us not formally yet one bill is an infrastructure bill both senators and republicans are vote are working on that i'll come back to it the second bill is a tax and spend um orgy of bill that will cost three and a half trillion dollars that's three thousand five hundred billion dollars i don't know a single republican that would touch that with a barge poll let me move back to the the infrastructure bill we're not there yet we have unity and uncertainty i'll tell you what i want i want an infrastructure bill and by infrastructure i mean roads bridges ports uh flood protection clean water that is fully paid for then we don't have to borrow money to pay for it we don't have to raise taxes to pay for now i want to see the bill and if it really does that and it's true infrastructure and not a lot of other extraneous garbage i'll vote for it if it's not like that i won't i'm not going to buy a car to get the cup holders but but that's only maybe 25 of this equation the other bill let me say it again it is a 3.5 trillion dollar tax and spending orgy bill that president biden and my democratic colleagues have uh have come up with it is breathtaking and it will we will end up with 30 trillion dollars worth of debt would you vote to raise the debt ceiling uh we just learned that it's going to the ceiling will be hit in october november are you on board with that or not let me tell you if if my democratic friends want to spend this money like like it was like they were uh sailors on shore live if they want to run up 30 trillion dollars worth of debt that we've got to pay back by the way if they want to do this then let them let them figure that out let them vote to raise the debt limit that's on them that's their responsibility they can't they can't spend like sailors on shore leave and then come to me and say oh by the way uh you've uh you've got to raise to vote to raise the debt limit so we can keep spending more and more how long would your family last if every month if every month increasing the credit cards yeah you spent more and more on the credit card and every month you just paid the minimum yeah all right senator it's always good to see you thank you very much good to have you with us you bet

the chair recognizes the gentleman from California mr. mister madam chair the nationally significant freight and highway projects program in this bill will address critical infrastructure needs that will improve America's economic competitiveness but will also bring a tremendous benefit to our communities especially districts like mine which is the epicenter of the international supply chain flowing through ports the ports of LA in Long Beach freight quarters that run through districts such as mine and those in Chicago Houston Florida Charleston New York New Jersey and Seattle bring jobs and spur economic growth however they also create congestion pollution and safety concerns one of the primary strategies to alleviate these issues congestion air pollution accidents and accidents is to build rail grade separations that allow trains and cars to flow freely in fact grade separations are explicitly mentioned in the bill as eligible to receive funding from the nationally significant freight and highway projects program however the 100 million dollar threshold far exceeds the cost of most grade separation projects to better achieve the intent of this bill my amendment simply clarifies that a program of eligible projects such as the a corridor of grade separations to be eligible to receive funding from this program there's ample legislative precedent for programs of projects to be eligible to be eligible for funding most notably the TIFIA loan program the national highway performance program highway safety and improvement program this amendment recognizes that addressing nationally significant transportation challenges are not always best addressed through one major project but instead a comprehensive package of related projects that achieve a meaningful national objective an example of this type of project is the Alameda corridor East which was first recognized ten years ago by this house in the safety ax Lou oh the elevated quarter east was designated is a project of national and regional significance spanning four counties in the nation's largest urban area stretching over 100 miles of rail in my County alone Riverside County this federal funding and partnership with local self-help tax dollars has made possible nearly a half billion dollars in Freight projects that is that is cleaning our air making our constituents safer and making the national economy more efficient however of these 16 projects in the same corridor the highest cost project was 67 million dollars yet together they have had a tremendous impact on the transportation system my amendment ensures that this momentum can occur can continue not just in my district but in all communities that are impacted by our national freight system this is an easy technical fix and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment mr. Chairman I reserve the balance of my time

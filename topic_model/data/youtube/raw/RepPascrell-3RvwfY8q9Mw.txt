[Music] to the point with congressman bill pasgrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of new jersey's 9th congressional district [Music] hi i'm congressman bill passgrove i'd like to welcome you to the latest edition of to the point today's show focuses on a very important subject the congress itself more specifically congressional dysfunction so to discuss this important topic who other who else we're going to have we have with us dr norm ornstein one of my favorites for the 22 years i've been here a longtime resident scholar everything thank you can imagine and right now the american enterprise institute norm is one of america's leading experts on u.s politics the electoral system the congress he's written a number of books including most recently one nation after trump and it's even worse than it looks fantastic title fantastic book norma's the guy any reporter or academic or even senator calls up when i have a question we're going to discuss norm's ideas for fixing congress as well as a recent essay that i wrote in the washington post they asked me to write that uh concerning congressional dysfunction norm welcome and thank you for being here today oh my pleasure you know i was thinking this morning and people will see this various times over the next few weeks or so we were coming we were at the funeral of john uh congressman former congressman john dangel and mr dengel not only was an icon he represented the congress he represented the institution he had a respect for the institution and norm that's what you're all about uh you know i had a very close relationship with dingle over decades it started out in some ways a little rocky i had been part of a group that had recommended changing some of the committee structure and jurisdictions including taking some things away from uh his committee which he did not view with a great uh a pleasure so i got called uh to the carpet and actually i had to sit with my writing friend and uh partner and all of this tom mann across from john dingle dan rostankowski and jack brooks oh boy the three most powerful people in congress none of whom were happy but you came out uh we came out fine and of course they won um but uh that started a friendship with dingle that was built in part on our mutual respect for the institution what does that mean what does that mean i use the term too but what does it mean to you the respect for the institution so to me it has multiple components a part of it is a recognition that congress is the first branch of government and uh you know i used to take my students to the article one yes article one i take my students to the national archives to see the constitution in its original form because when you look at it you realize they have one page then they have another page article one is twice as long as article two which is twice as long as article three right why because the framers knew that they needed to be more specific about the powers and the duties of congress which represented i carry with me all the states and with with good reason so that's part of it a second part of it is res respecting not just the role of the institution which means of course that you are the check and balance against other institutions and the protector of americans against perniciousness what does that check balance mean to you so it means that whether the president of the united states is a member of your party or the other party you hold that not just that person but the executive branch and all the people who work in it who are supposed to faithfully execute the laws of the united states you hold them to account you make sure through oversight and investigations that they are doing things on the straight and narrow path and the constitution as a whole means something or it doesn't and one of the things that i respected so much about john dingle was when he was chair of the subcommittee on oversight investigations in the commerce committee which is an enormously powerful subcommittee chairman of the full committee ranking member of the committee or whatever role he had it didn't matter to him that a president was a democrat or a republican if bad things were occurring under their watch you were going to hold them accountable and do what was right for the public it's interesting because the ethics committee within the house of representatives yup is supposed to operate that way and it usually does you have democrats on it you have republicans on it irregardless of what the party affiliation is you're reexamining in confidence a particular act that any congress and member of the house remember the senate doesn't matter uh did experienced and to judge whether it's acceptable or not acceptable well why doesn't the whole congress work that way it doesn't always and the fact is for the past two years before uh 2019 it didn't it didn't work that way whether it came to judging its own members you know when i look at some of the disastrous things that happen you get a guy like blake farenthold of texas who you know pays out a huge sum of money of taxpayer dollars to basically cover up a terrible act of miscreants and then they drag the feet in the ethics committee until he leaves they force him at least to agree that he'll pay back the money and then he doesn't pay back the money so we have problems on that front but the bigger set of problems no oversight no investigations we know that we have a cabinet filled with people who are corrupt and who have done corrupt deeds we had 15 or so separate investigations of scott pruitt going on when he was uh the head of the environmental protection agency and not any hearings in congress about what was going on well republicans on in this case in this case have absolutely obligated their responsibility have they not if you are an institutionalist you have a fiduciary responsibility to check these things out and to put some checks and balances in place an even better example or two examples one is the child separation policy and it is a policy and kristen nielsen the secretary of homeland security lied to congress i don't use the word lightly lied to congress more than once saying there is no policy and then i'm on the board of an organization called the project on government oversight or pogo uncovers the documents that she signed that say the policy for child separation you let horrible things like that happen and do no oversight that's an abdication of in a huge measure then you look at the response to the hurricane in puerto rico which continues to be shameful and disgraceful nothing done nothing done about a uh fema administrator who's now resigning is this for before uh bad things happen to him well we know where we are yeah and i mean unless you put the blinders on you know we are how did we get here norm i mean uh because i wrote an article uh yeah i think you saw it oh i said sure they asked me to write the article and it resonated and in 1995 94 95 when newt gingrich comes in he sapped a lot of this oversight he attacked the gao he attacked the general research the congressional research service he attacked just about any agency that helps house members and senate members get to the truth why and he eliminated the office of technology assessment which nancy is trying to get back and speaker pelosi it was a very deliberate attempt to make sure that facts and science and science were kept out of the dialogue it was the beginning of the war on science but what newt did and it goes back to when he first came under the guise of saving money yeah of course and it was nonsense in 1978 he gets elected to congress and he had a strategy over took him 16 years of destroying the institution as he would put it in order to save it but he destroyed it in a way that it has not yet recovered from and it was creating a sense in the country as a whole that things are so bad and so corrupt in congress and in washington that if we throw all the ins out and bring the outs in how could it be worse that attitude by the way uh had a lot to do with donald trump getting elected in 2016. how could it be worse it turned out to be a lot worse what came out of these these agencies yeah the watergate report uh the iran iran contra situation reports on all of these things i could think of at least half a dozen of them off the top of my head we don't see that anymore the staffs are not up to yeah are because if i i recommend it which i do say well you're trying to spend more money for the government what does the government have if we don't have facts how are we going to make decisions and so who makes them for us who makes the decisions for us norm the executive branch and this is you know fortunately uh i was around when the budget and impoundment control act was put in place in the aftermath of not just watergate and what nixon did on that front right but he was basically uh taking money that he wasn't supposed to take in the budget and using it for purposes that were not appropriated he was withholding money unlawfully that had been appropriated and congress didn't have the resources to be able to even cope with the president's manpower and power over the budget so they created the congressional budget office if you don't have the expertise and the first branch of government is supposed to have more expertise and needs it you're going to be at an enormous disadvantage and not just when it comes to the executive branch when it comes to the lobbyists and the other interests around who can bring their own facts to the table that can't be challenged so easily they're not by nature evil people lobbyists i have a great respect for lobbyists never had any problems part of the first amendment the right to petition that's correct and they have every right to do but if that's who we're depending for all our knowledge in order to represent our people in our district in order to be a good member of the house good member of the senate and yet we're relying on information that's no longer there for us you don't even have enough people to look at it then what are we asking for here we have we are the problem yeah i can't blame the president of the united states or the executive branch of government or the members of that executive branch for reducing my power i've allowed it to happen while this is an erosion over a very long period of time the fact is that it accelerated dramatically in the last two years that i haven't seen anything quite like this with a total abdication of responsibility when we had a republican congress and george w bush was president you still got some oversight done you had people like tom davis of virginia a strong republican always stood up worked with henry waxman when he saw that something was wrong we also had a party the republican party that even if it had ideas that you might not agree with uh or i might not agree with wanted to solve problems for the country now i think that's eroded tremendously right and it's what's happened is the lack of interest in or respect for the institution itself for the way it operates for its rules for its laws for its norms uh it goes hand in hand with a contempt uh for uh the rule of law and for solving problems it all becomes about holding power how are we doing as democrats and in a very bipartisan which i know you are objective i'm asking that question how are we doing in in look and approaching what our responsibility should be under oversight when you move from the minority to the majority you are going to get more staff and some of the staff who've come in have been there before and are experienced but ramping up including getting experienced investigative staff is not an easy thing to do and then it takes a while to integrate them into the process on the subject of his taxes yeah we don't have the tax lawyers that obviously sure the president would have available to himself and uh this is what is needed research yeah many people are pushing the chairman of the ways and means committee to go faster and faster on this you can't go faster and faster unless you know what you're doing yeah and you have to have uh all of your facts in order and all of your ducks in a row also it it's taken a while to get organized to get subcommittees together new chairs who have to bring in their own staffs and then decide on an agenda but it's a good start and i find it a good start on a few fronts we're not going to see a whole lot of laws enacted in this two-year period right but you also can keep bad legislation from passing and you can use your clout to affect some changes and that's what we've seen i think with a very effective negotiation that speaker pelosi has done over this most recent uh embarrassing shutdown and and in its aftermath although we're not out of the woods yet um we've started to see some hearings done uh bringing have you looked at any of them cabinet members yeah and what were you impressed about were you more impressed with it so there's one thing that i find uh troubling more than anything else the tendency here is to do hearings with the usual format you know watching the hearing with uh matt whitaker um the faux attorney general um and it was important to call him on the carpet good marks for that uh and there were some uh exchanges that were memorable but it was it had all those problems and here's what i would do i would say we're not going to start with a bunch of opening statements maybe the chair and the ranking member and then we're going to get a council who knows this stuff inside out to take the first 30 or 40 minutes wow interrogating the witnesses and laying out a framework and doing it in a systematic way so that the important issues are there and they're explored in some depth and then you can turn it's not as disjointed as it is now you you set the table we don't set the table now right then you have members not in five minute segments but maybe 10 minutes so that you have a little more of an opportunity to explore and get follow-up questions done but frankly what i would also do is before i would hold a hearing that's an investigative hearing or a serious oversight hearing is i would get at least all of the members on the majority side together and talk about what those important issues are and divvy up the areas and let the members go back and do their own homework but make sure that you have in order people who can then follow up with what the previous uh member had had been discussing i can't say to you norm that i've always been a process person yeah i like to get to the results the final but you and some other folks that have worked with you i think are making it more and more evident that unless you get involved in that process unless that process is open and transparent yeah and unless you're doing your job in terms of oversight for instance you're not going to come up with anything really tangible at the end you're just not and it becomes much easier to excuse me to turn it into including the way the press covers it a circus it's uh okay you've got this thrust and this parry and this charge and then it becomes trivialized and these should not be trivialized now the other thing that i'm concerned about on that front is we've got a lot of committees and subcommittees but we have more areas that need to be explored of miscreants and bad behavior and bad government and corruption than we have ever had before the swamp it is very hard to find a cabinet member in this administration who doesn't have real problems that need to be explored it's hard to find a policy area where we don't have either incompetent people in charge or people who are protecting interests and not those of the public as a whole and what i'm saying is you can't have every committee and subcommittee out there doing its own thing you've got to focus and make sure that you divide up the responsibilities and then do them in the right way so that the larger impression that the public gets is you're doing your work and look at what they've been doing why are they not saying anything about this why do they allow it to happen they're almost acting like kept people yeah they're kept in other words we'll put all our eggs in one basket the president are going to look i believe in loyalty don't get me wrong but they are so obvious facts are laid across the record the record is open they're not doing anything about it why because their party was in charge for three years or whatever it was what i see on the republican side sadly is a party that's gone from being a conservative party of course but one focused on solving problems and what conservatism is supposed to represent which is a passion for institutions and process and making sure that things are done the right way and that's become a party of theology the theology is around tax cuts and denying climate change and other things where facts don't no science information but also it's all about winning and that's where you know i would see a republican party that some years ago you could point to one key moment being reince priebus's famous autopsy about the republican party it had a crossroads one road to take is understanding that your core supporters are declining as a share of american voters and you will be a minority unless you change things you have two ways to go you can try to broaden your appeal to a larger group of voters not just by changing rhetoric but within the framework of your company philosophy change your policies right uh or you double down on a base and you suppress votes on the other side and win that way and that's what they've done and it's reached a point where thinking about how you can work together to solve a problem if we do that then they may benefit it's a serious business we're talking about and in fact it's dangerous business horribly dangerous for the country because we have enormous problems that we have not dealt with very effectively do you think that the president's uh efforts at three or four times to say hey look we you know tomorrow moral equivalence if you remember back in charlotte i mean every everything everybody has a right to say what they do which they do unless you're endangering someone else that's a different story altogether he's he's almost forcing people to not only take sides but to be violent about it i'm very serious about that you know watching uh a portion of his rally down in el paso it was chilling i saw uh we had a cameraman assaulted and it was encouraged by the president no question about it just no doubt and he's done that many many times before this is extended over i think in a host of other very troubling ways his very close friend who managed the inaugural which is now under serious investigation tom barrack was over in saudi arabia and we now had a statement allegations that barrick tried to use the inaugural to advance his own business interests which is one thing but beyond that a statement that basically said uh hey who are we to judge the saudis we have a crown prince who overwhelming evidence tells us directly ordered the brutal torture and murder of a washington post journalist in turkey that's right and one we have a president who is violating the law by not issuing a report on the khashoggi murder and now at least there are stories that some republicans are furious with him about that the fury often means but you know i the statement about the charlottesville people that there are very fine people on both sides is going to be one of the most memorable phrases of his presence and it will not be in a positive way yeah moral equivalence yeah that's that's what we're facing that's what we're facing on right now what do we need to do and how fast do we need to do it so i want to see congress present a different public image as well i want to see real debate and deliberation i want earrings yes biggest tax bill we've had in a long time uh december 2017 no hearings no witnesses and in the senate behind closed doors right it is i believe the most reckless dangerous piece of public policy enacted into law in 50 years this is not just a ginormous tax cut it's a tax cut done at a time of full employment and economic growth the federal government is supposed to be the counter cyclical policy maker when you hit a difficult time the states have balanced budget amendments that means that they end up cutting spending and raising taxes at a bad time to do it and it's the federal government that has to counter balance that so that you can keep things from turning from recession to depression pro policies give you a sugar high that then lead to a collapse and then you've taken away all the weapons to get out of it and that's what they did with this tax cut and now you need to have not just the old standard hearings you need to do round tables and you need to have debates on the floor that talk about the best tax policy why this is bad what can be done about it not just legislation not just legislating because we're not going to see as much of that you need to pass bills through the house that show that you're capable of focusing on these problems but where's your own dignity how can you come to work every day and allow the executive branch of government to snuff you out literally and to not matter it doesn't matter what you do it's your allegiance to the president of the united states alone how can you come to work every day and do that you know i've had uncomfortable conversations with republican friends in the senate who voted for that tax bill and knew that it was a mistake and i've had republican colleagues of yours in the house who privately rail against the insanity of this administration and then vote every single time to protect it don't say a word about kleptocracy or horrible governance and it's hard to understand uh and i don't think it's just the job or just party discipline i think it's also uh the fear that if you step away from this and it's not just a fear of a primary challenge all the people who are a part of your circle will shun you um there is a almost a cult-like element to the way that people are behaving now and it can't go on and they're destroying themselves you know when i co-wrote the uh it's even worse than it looks and we really for the first time an eye-opener took on the republican party i had a ton of republicans who were no longer serving call me up and say thank you for trying to save our party while republicans in office were furious and others said well you're trying to destroy the republican party we can't operate without two sane problem-solving parties you're gonna have different ideologies but they both have to be there and what so many of the republicans in congress are doing now is destroying their own party it's gonna lose its ability to function the way it should in a democracy such as ours well norm you keep on writing about this um i'm i'm digging as best as i can i want to be helpful to the process because i want to reinvigorate the institution i belong to the house of representatives the key for the country and for the future and if we don't future generations if we don't yeah then you know where will we be two years from now we'll be six years from now yeah not in a good place not in a good place i want to thank you for coming on today my pleasure no breaks we just went right through you are what you are and i'm very proud of you i want you to know that uh well i'm proud of you too you do uh you know you represent what members are supposed to be doing here

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays the spirit of this season moves us to look beyond ourselves and as says to give generously to those in need whether it is a loved one a neighbor or a stranger let us hope that spirit will inspire us not only during the holiday season but throughout the new year also please join me in thinking about our brave servicemen and women who are away from their families during the holidays as they serve our nation there is no better way to celebrate the season of giving then to pay tribute to the men and women of our military and our veterans the freedom that they make possible is the gift cherished by all of us may 2014 be filled with every blessing for you and your family

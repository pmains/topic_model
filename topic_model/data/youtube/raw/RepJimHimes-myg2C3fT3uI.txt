Thank You mr. speaker I'm not generally in the habit of agreeing with my friend from Texas but I do thank them for posing some really challenging questions about our activities in Syria I think it is fair to say that the situation in Syria has gotten worse not better and only now that the chaos in Syria results in the flows of hundreds of thousands of people into Europe and into surrounding and delicately constructed countries only now that we are having a conversation about how many Syrian refugees we will take in the United States are we beginning to take notice of the moral tragedy that has been Syria for many many years the civil war in Syria has resulted in the deaths of more than 300,000 people it has created four million refugees and displaced more than six and a half million people into places like Jordan and Turkey and now in Europe and elsewhere around the world sadly it appears that the efforts that we have made that my friend from Texas referred to have been ineffectual to put it mildly and the situation grows worse we watch now the Russians introducing military equipment into Syria something they can only result in more violence more death and more refugees we see sadly and I have watched this closely from my perched on the house finet Select Committee on Intelligence we see Isis gaining in strength not losing strength there are lots of conversations to be had about our efforts the US efforts to train and equipped the so-called Syrian moderates there are conversations to be had about how we deal with Russian influence in the area but something we must focus on now and something that is the subject of a letter that I and 54 of my colleagues have sent to the president of the United States is that the only real Lucien in Syria a solution that should be implemented today is for the international community all of the players that have a stake and influence in Syria to come together today to begin the process of working out an international agreement the terms of which will undoubtedly be uncomfortable for us but an agreement that will bring an end to the civil war this agreement should provide for the exit of Bashar Assad he has lost all credibility as a global leader but he remains there apart from ending the crisis the humanitarian and moral crisis in Syria that conference would allow us to finally align behind an objective that I believe is shared by pretty much everybody in the region which is the destruction of Isis until we take this step of coming together around a table that yes will involve some unsavory characters that yes will not lead to an agreement that we regard is perfect until we do that we will simply be managing chaos and maybe we'll manage chaos well but it will still be managing chaos hundreds of thousands of refugees and the destabilization that that will cause more weaponry being introduced more US taxpayer dollars expended we can do that that's what we've been doing we can do it four more months and more years or we can do the obvious thing which is get around a table and I do call in the president united states to show American leadership in this and say we don't leave the room until this moral tragedy is stopped this is what it would be to be a leader in the world we can bomb we can send military equipment we do that a lot real leadership will involve saying we will come together with people we like and people we don't to solve this problem and I call on this house to assist me and others in the effort to make sure that this becomes a national priority so we can finally bring this tragedy in the Middle East to an end thank you Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

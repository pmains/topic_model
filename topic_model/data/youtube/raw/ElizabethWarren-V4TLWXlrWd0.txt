2020 is the most important election of our time we need to win back the White House but we can't stop there we need to elect Democrats up and down the belt so today I am proud to make my first endorsements 20 women who will keep up the fight in statehouses Congress and seats of power all across this country some of these women are running for reelection some of them are running to flip seats and all of them are fighting to put power in the hands of the people this year statewide and state legislative elections will be especially critical as we recover from the corona virus in the short term and rebuild our economy in the long term but if we all do our part this year a new slate of leaders will take office next January there'll be a breath of fresh air and a burst of energy in the fight to make our economy our government and our democracy work not just for the rich and the powerful but work for everyone now here's something I've learned about how to make a real change it takes a grassroots movement fighting from the outside and leaders fighting from the inside so today I'm endorsing leaders who know how to fight and know how to win join me in fighting by their side and thanks for being part of this you

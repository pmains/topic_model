  RECOGNITION? >> I HAVE AN AMENDMENT AT THE  DESK.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   CLERK WILL DESIGNATE THE   AMENDMENT. THE CLERK: AMENDMENT NUMBER ONE  PRINTED IN PART A OF HOUSE   REPORT 115-444, OFFERED BY MR.   SHERMAN OF CALIFORNIA. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION   647, THE GENTLEMAN FROM  CALIFORNIA, MR. SHERMAN, AND THE MEMBER OPPOSED EACH WILL CONTROL FIVE MINUTES.  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE   GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA. MR. SHERMAN: THANK YOU.  I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I  MAY CONSUME. I RISE TO OFFER AN AMENDMENT TO  H.R. 477, THE SMALL BUSINESS   MERGERS ACQUISITIONS   SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2017.  I WANT TO THANK THE GENTLEMAN  FROM MICHIGAN, IT'S BEEN A   PLEASURE TO WORK WITH HIM ON   THIS BILL OVER A PERIOD OF THREE CONGRESSES.  AND WITH THE ADOPTION OF THIS  AMENDMENT, THE BILL WILL BE IN A FORUM -- A FORM THAT WILL SECURE SUPPORT FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE   AISLE, NOT ONLY MY SUPPORT, BUT  MORE IMPORTANTLY THE RANKING   MEMBER'S SUPPORT.  IN THE 113TH CONGRESS, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES UNANIMOUSLY   SUPPORTED A SIMILAR BILL TO  PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE M&A  COMMUNITY FOR PROVIDING THAT IN  CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A SMALL   BUSINESS MERGER OR ACQUISITION   BROKER WOULD NOT HAVE TO   REGISTER.  AS A RESULT OF THAT ACTION BY  THE HOUSE, WHICH WAS NOT MATCHED BY ACTION IN THE SENATE, THE   SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION UNDERSTOOD THE WISDOM OF THIS HOUSE AND INTRODUCED A   NO ACTION LETTER DATED JANUARY,  2014, PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF  RELIEF REQUESTED BY THE HOUSE. IN THEIR NO ACTION LETTER,   HOWEVER, THE S.E.C. PLACED   SEVERAL LIMITATIONS ON THE   EXEMPTION FROM LEGISLATION THAT  WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE HOUSE   BILL BUT WITH THIS AMENDMENT   WILL BE INCLUDED IN THIS YEAR'S  BILL.  THESE LIMITATIONS PROVIDED   ADDITIONAL PR TECHES FOR   INVESTORS AND SMALL BUSINESSES.  IT EXCLUDED BAD ACTORS AND SHELL COMPANIES, PROHIBITED PASSIVE  BUYERS IN AN M&A TRANSACTION TO  ASSURE THEY CAN'T USE THIS   EXEMPTION AS A CAPITAL RAISING   MECHANISM. PROHIBITED AN M&A BROKER FOR   PROVIDING FINANCING FOR THE  TRANSFER.  PROHIBITED M&A BROKERS FROM  BINDING A PARTY TO A TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND I THINK THIS IS  MOST IMPORTANT REQUIRING THAT TO BE ELIGIBLE -- ELIGIBLE, A   BROKER WOULD HAVE TO DISCLOSE TO BOTH PARTIES AND GET THEIR   CONSENT IF THEY'RE BEING PAID BY BOTH PARTIES.  SO THERE'S BOTH A SILLER'S   COMMISSION AND BUYER'S   COMMISSION, YOU HAVE TO TELL THE BUYER, YOU HAVE TO TELL THE  SELLER.  NOW, THOSE WHO WANT TO STEP  OUTSIDE THE SAFE HARBOR CAN  SIMPLY REGISTER. BUT THOSE WILL BE EXEMPT FROM  REGISTRATION NEED TO COMPLY WITH THIS -- WITH THESE SIX ELEMENTS. THE SMALL BUSINESS MERGERS   ACQUISITION SALES AND BROKERAGE  SIMPLIFICATION ACT WILL CODIFY   THE S.E.A. NO ACTION LETTER AND  PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO THE SMALL   BUSINESS AND MERGER ACQUISITION  BROKERS. IN THE LAST CONGRESS I OPPOSED   THE BILL BECAUSE IT INCLUDED   ONLY TWO OF THE SIX RESTRICTIONS INCLUDED BY THE S.E.C. WITH THIS AMENDMENT THE BILL   WILL INCLUDE ALL RESTRICTIONS. S THAT BIPARTISAN AMENDMENT AND  INCLUDES ALL THE LIMITATIONS OF  THE S.E.C. NO ACTION LETTER,   IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WORK   WITH THE GENTLEMAN FROM MICHIGAN ON IT. IN ADDITION, OUR AMENDMENT   PROVIDES THAT THE S.E.C. HAS THE RULE MAKING AUTHORITY TO   DETERMINE THE CORRECT THRESHOLDS OF GROSS REVENUES AND OF EBITDA, EARNINGS OF A COMPANY BEFORE   INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRETIONUATION AND AMORTIZATION, IN DETERMINING WHETHER A COMPANY QUALIFIES  THURN BILL.  THE S.E.C. IS THE AGENCY WITH  THE EXPERTISE TO DO THIS.  I ENCOURAGE NEM TO EXAMINE THIS  ISSUE CLOSELY AND ENSURE THAT  ANY THRESHOLD IN PLACE IS  EVIDENCE-BASED.  AND I ENCOURAGE THEM IN FUTURE   YEARS TO INFLATION ADJUST  WHATEVER LIMITATION DOLLAR   FIGURES THEY HAVE IN THEIR   REGULATIONS. I AM PLEASED TO OFFER THIS   AMENDMENT WITH MY COLLEAGUE, MR. HUIZENGA, WHO I MAY HAVE   PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AS THE   GENTLEMAN FROM MICHIGAN. AND I OFFER IT ALSO WITH THE   SUPPORT OF THE RANKING MEMBER. I URGE THE PASSAGE OF THIS   AMENDMENT AS IT WIL

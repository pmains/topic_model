joining us on the news line uh senator from the state of virginia tim kaine the democrat senator thank you so much glad to be with you nick thanks uh let's talk a little bit about what's going on right now it's basically business as usual for the the senate day today but for the 21 hours previous to that it wasn't what's the net effect of this in your view my sense of it that the purpose was probably an effort by the senator from texas to try to convince more of his colleagues on the republican side to support him in an effort to to make the defunding of obamacare a leverage point even to including shutting down the government i don't think that's going to succeed uh and again the the net result is that it's business as usual today one of the things uh that the majority leader harry reid asked of uh ted cruz was if he would yield for about 15 minutes to hear from john mccain senior senator from arizona also a republican and quite frankly not a uh uh the political best friend of of ted cruz in your view do you think that maybe the uh those members of the republican caucus who don't find themselves aligned with ted cruz they're liable to sort of strike back if you will well i think they will be i think they will in this way not in a personal way there are there are many in the republican caucus who share senator cruz's views about we need to reform or even repeal the affordable care act they just believe there's a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it the right way to do it would be to introduce a bill here's my reform bill or here's my proposal to defund but not tie it up to the existential question of whether the government of the united states operates or shuts down it's the linking of the question to a shutdown of government or the linking of a question to a default on america's debt that has uh made so many of his republican colleagues say uh you're on your own on this one because you know that this is a government buy oven for the people we're we're about to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the gettysburg address in a month president lincoln finished it and said we all have to resolve that government by of and for the people shall not perish from the earth and that means not for a day not for a week not for a minute not for a second and the reason that senator cruz has a hard time getting republicans on board is using the threat of a shutdown or threating the threat of a default on our obligations as a leverage tool people just don't believe that's the right way to go senator let me ask you uh what's your feeling on the length of this continuing resolution there was some talk yesterday that perhaps rather than uh extend the the cr through december that maybe you shorten the throw of it a little bit so that there can be a little more time to negotiate if you will between not just uh both sides in the senate but the senate and the house on things like sequestration cuts and that sort of thing well i i think it's important you know i think the senate is likely now to take it up and uh and change there there will be we will accept i believe in the amendment that we do that the house's budget number for this for the cr but we will shorten the time period to november the 15th to show that we really want to sit down and negotiate the senate passed a budget six months ago monday march 23rd and we have been trying to get the house to sit down with us at a conference table every day for the last six months and they won't do it that's the only real outcome to this and that's the right outcome it's uh house and senate budget conferees having a negotiation and and reaching a deal via compromise and i think we've decided that if we if we make it november 15th that shows again we're serious we want to sit down and talk we recognize there will be compromise but let's do that for the good of the american economy senator tim kaine good enough to join us live on the newsline this afternoon senator we appreciate it we'll be watching

thank you Mr Speaker I rise in support of the long-term care veterans Choice Act the Department of Veterans Affairs has been running its medical foster homes initiative since the year 2000 and as of 2021 the veterans Health Administration oversees about 600 medical foster homes caregivers taking care of veterans in about 40 States medical foster homes or private homes where a caregiver provides services to a small group of individuals who are unable to live without day-to-day assistance currently veterans enrolled in home-based Primary Care through the VA they may elect to receive their care at Medical foster homes however the VA does not cover the cost of medical foster homes for veterans that would otherwise be eligible for nursing home care through the VA as has been noted by my colleagues full nursing home traditional care is far more expensive than medical foster homes and Veterans must pay for medical Forester homes out of their pocket or through private insurance this bill would fix that my bill would authorize the secretary of the VA to enter into contracts and agreements for placement of up to 900 veterans a day in medical foster homes these veterans are unable to live independently in addition medical foster home caregivers would be required to pass a federal background check and undergo VA screening they'd be required to participate in annual training and they would have to permit the VA to make announced and unannounced home visits finally the VA would provide these veterans with full interdisciplinary home care that includes Physicians nurses Rehabilitation therapists mental health care providers dietitians and pharmacists my bill is supported by the American Legion the VFW Disabled American Veterans and the Wounded Warrior Project enclosing I'd like to sincerely thank chairman takano and ranking member boss for bringing this bill to the floor and I urge my colleagues to support this bill

large vaccination centers serve an important purpose and they're good for getting large numbers of people vaccinated in a short period of time and sites like that work for someone who has a computer to sign up for an appointment a car to get there and a job with flexibility that allows them to wait hours to receive the vaccine but those are not useful for everyone like high-risk farm workers and other essential workers who are working poor and also high risk of getting infected from covet i know this from personal experience as a physician uh very early on in this pandemic i've been coordinating and organizing testing outreach at uh for the homeless as well as farm workers and trailer parks and churches and school areas uh and so i've had a really up close and personal interaction and have heard their stories their concerns their difficulties and many don't have internet to make an appointment they don't have hours to spend on a phone trying to reserve their slot they don't have transportation to get to the vaccination site let alone spend hours waiting to receive the vaccine and they don't have information in their own language to help them navigate the system so what we are doing now is just not working and it's disproportionately harming underserved populations and communities of color a recent kaiser family foundation analysis found that in mississippi black people account for 15 percent of the vaccination while accounting for 42 percent of the deaths in nebraska four percent of vaccinations are to hispanic individual individuals even though they make up 23 of the cases so this is not only a moral failure this is prolonging the pandemic we need a science-based public health approach that serves the hard-to-reach communities and we can't simply rely on our broken health care system that has produced the disparities in infections and deaths due to covet to begin with to address equity this makes this means making better use of a local physician offices and fqacs by and large physician offices outside of large group practices have been left out of the efforts of vaccinate patients that has heightened challenges particularly in communities of color where vaccine hesitancy remains high people trust their doctor and they must play critical role in addressing issues of access and hesitancy according to a recent harris poll the majority of americans would prefer to get their shot in their family's doctor's office and less than a quarter of americans want to be vaccinated at special sites built to administer the vaccine activating primary care and vaccination efforts will open up thousands of access points providing broader reach and better accessibility and fqhcs the sites of care that serve the very communities we are trying to reach have been massively underutilized throughout this vaccination process and they are ready they just don't have the vaccines and resources to activate their plans we need to provide our fqhcs with vaccines and the resources to administer them both in their clinics and out in the community we need to provide funding for mobile clinics we need to provide funding for promotors and the community health workers or for providers to make vaccines direct to take vaccines directly to the people like this past monday where i joined a collaborative of growers nonprofits and public health officials to literally go into the fields to talk to the farm workers about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and then inoculate them on the spot if we don't give them the resources to carry out a vaccination plan it won't work and we are seeing that play out now the trump administration told states and counties to develop their own distribution plans but left them no resources to do it states county and tribal budgets are already strapped from this pandemic they need more resources if we expect them to do this right so i urge this com this committee as we move forward in this reconciliation process to make this a priority

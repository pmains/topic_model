thank you thank you so much for your leadership and bringing this round table together obviously your work helps us highlight how disastrous the president's tax agenda really is for american families farmers ranchers small businesses literally the entire economy and this proposal the democrats proposal to repeal stepped-up basis encapsulates everything wrong with their entire tax agenda they propose doubling the capital gains rate at nearly 40 percent in the name of so-called fairness rather than prioritizing economic growth or even revenue and they've included repealing this stepped-up basis and tax and capital gains at death in their proposal to force people to pay capital gains taxes because they know that their confiscatory capital gains rate alone will create lockdown that stops economic activity which would actually reduce revenue economic studies have shown that even after proposed exemptions uh more than 95 of farms and ranches would be hit with the average tax bill in excess of one million dollars and that we would see 800 000 job losses in the first decade because of this proposal all by itself the last three economic hearings held in the ways and means committee attacked subcommittee hearing on taxing the so-called rich a joint tax and oversight hearing on irs enforcement in our annual budget hearing with secretary yellen have all focused on democrat efforts to tax and audit small businesses farmers and ranchers the primary takeaway from each of these hearings has been bipartisan concern actually about the effect of repealing stepped-up basis on family farms and businesses country if you have held a farmer ranch for just one generation the appreciation and land value during that time will ensure your kids will pay this tax if you have a small business and own the building you work out of there's a strong likelihood your children will pay this tax if you're a first generation homeowner and have been saving for retirement in major suburbs like long island or orange county california hoping to accrue a little wealth to pass on your kids there's a decent chance they will wind up paying this backdoor death tax today we will hear from a nebraska farmer about the direct impact repealing stepped-up basis we have on his family farm don beatty and his wife barb live and work on a family farm northeast of lexington nebraska in the central part of our state his great-grandfather actually immigrated to plum creek nebraska in 1873 actually settling the land under the homestead act and don and barb live on that tree claim which was filed in 1879 for generations their family has worked first to settle the west then to continue working the land to feed their neighbors their fellow americans and help feed the world don is here today to tell us how appealing stepped up bases would threaten that dream for future generations uh of his family i really thank all of our panelists and uh mr brady i yield back thank you

chair now recognizes the chair of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee Miss Salazar that microphone thank you chairman for holding this very critical hearing and as we have spoken the penetration of China Latin America is real and terrifying it has reached a level where our national security is in danger almost 30 percent of China Global Lending goes to Latin America that is almost 140 billion dollars China has a physical presence in 25 out of the 31 Latin American countries and is the second largest user of the Panama Canal but we know that the Chinese are not here for trade they're here for war and why do I say that because 10 years ago China sold Hugo Chavez Venezuela the N1 tanks and advanced Raider systems to Bolivia of the Evo Morales is using right now karakorum fighter jet planes one of China's most advanced fighter jets and now Argentina that is very concerning it's considering opening Chinese fighter jet factories uh chairman Xi Jinping has been to Latin America more times than presidents Obama Trump and Biden combined in the last 10 years and I will explain to you what bothers me the most at this moment and it scares should scare all of us assistant secretary Mr quintenbrink thank you for being here and for wanting to answer our questions ten years ago now who is today Vice Argentina's vice president Christina Fernandez who has been accused of corruption and who stole millions of dollars from the argentinians now she sold her soul to the Chinese by allowing them to have this a deep space station the size of 400 football fields in the middle of the Patagonia desert 400 football fields I am sure the Chinese are very interested in studying the Stars on every constellation but from the Argentinian Skies but the problem is that Argentina has no idea what's going on there because the Chinese don't let them in they do not let them in in Argentinian soil so my question to you is how dangerous is this station for our national security sir I'm asking you assistant secretary how are you as concerned as we are yes or no I will say two things ma'am one we are concerned with China's efforts around the world to increase uh its its military presence number one and but I'm talking about this number two station in particular I would have to consult with my colleagues across the interagency and get back to you and perhaps you don't know anything about this perhaps it'd be more appropriate in a in a classroom I'm asking you do you know about this deep space station in the Patagonia I am not an expert you are not so you didn't know this happened I I'm not 400 football fields in the middle of Patagonia I mean isn't that concerning does this have anything to do with the Chinese balloon that was flying over our territory again I'll say ma'am that we are aware of a number of steps that China has taken around the world I'm talking about Latin America and I'm talking about this understood you don't you don't know about this interesting okay so who does and as I said I'd be delighted to consult with my colleagues in the interagency and get back to you and perhaps it would be most appropriate to do so uh in a classified session but I'd be happy to do that Okay so interesting right so now let me ask you something else do you also know that Christina Fernandez the actual vice president wants to buy 18 Chinese J jf-17 fighter jets they want to buy them from the Chinese are you aware of that and then not only that to build a fighter jet Factory in Buenos Aires and sells and sell those fighter jets to other neighbors meaning Paraguay Uruguay Chile Bolivia are you aware of that uh ma'am again I'm not an expert on either of those questions I'd be happy to take that back and come back to you okay oh we certainly hope that either you or one of your colleagues can come back to this forum and explain to us look forward to that I would imagine that it's it's pretty um um concerning uh so since we cannot get any answers from you then I was going to use this forum to send the message to the argentinians specifically to the vice president and I'm going to do it in Spanish because maybe they are not hearing from you but maybe they'll hear it from me and I'm going to warm forewarn them that if they decide to build a fighter jet Factory of Chinese uh fighter jets it's a very bad idea for them and moving forward and everything that has to do with the relationship with the United States so that's why I'm going to say it in Spanish if and I I beg your pardon if you do not understand El Diablo consequences thank you Mr chairman are you back thank you Miss salazaren I will be requesting a classified briefing on this very issue thank you

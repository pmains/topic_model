madam Speaker I'm saddened today that I spent two Christmases defending our country overseas and I get a measly 30 seconds to speak in this laughable process a president made a campaign promise to drain the swamp and there are those today relying on swamp creatures words to preserve swamp how do you suppress the votes of 63 million people and an electoral landslide you keep repeating the same lies absent any factual basis I've heard some of the greatest fiction ever spoken here today if you don't like the facts just rewrite them in a parody and repeat if the facts are so clear and indisputable why is the Minority Leader begging for more witnesses you can't disprove something that never happened I ask my colleagues about no to this sham thank you and I yield back gentleman from California

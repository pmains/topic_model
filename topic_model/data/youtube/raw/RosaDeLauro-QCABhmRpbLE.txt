. MS. DELAURO: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE FAIRNESS FOR 9/11 FAMILIES ACT. 9/11 IS A DAY THAT LEFT AN INDELIBLE MARK ON ALL OF US. WE ALL REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE. WHEN THE TOWERS FELL, THEY TOOK SO MANY INNOCENT LIVES. AND THE FAMILIES LEFT SUFFERED IRREPLACEABLE LOSS. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE CATCH-UP PAYMENTS TO 9/11 SURVIVORS, SPOUSES AND DEPENDENTS WHO WERE UNFAIRLY EXCLUDED FROM THE U.S. VICTIMS OF STATE SPONSORED TERRORISM FUND. WHILE NO AMOUNT OF MONEY CAN MAKE UP FOR THEIR LOSS, THIS BILL WOULD FAIRLY COMPENSATE THEM FOR THEIR CLAIMS AGAINST THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF OUR NATION'S DARKEST DAYS. IT WOULD PROVIDE SOME RELIEF TO PEOPLE LIKE MY CONSTITUENTS, GAEL, GALE, WHO LOST HER HUSBAND, BRUCE, ON 9/11. HER SON, BRETT, WHO LOST HIS FATHER ON 9/11. HE WAS JUST 15 YEARS OLD. THAT DARK DAY, BRUCE SAVED LIVES. HE WAS AN INCREDIBLE HUMAN BEING, A DEVOTED HUSBAND, FATHER AND FRIEND. AND HELPING TO SAVE LIVES HE LOST HIS OWN. BRUCE WOULD BE PROUD TO KNOW THAT HIS SON, BRETT, HAS LED THE CHARGE ON THIS FIGHT. I'VE BEEN SO PROUD TO WORK WITH HIM, IT'S AN HONOR TO WORK WITH HIM TO GET THIS DONE. HE NEVER GAVE UP. THE FAMILIES NEVER GAVE UP. AND WHILE WE CANNOT FILL THE HOLE IN THE HEARTS OF THESE FAMILIES, WE CAN SAY WE UNDERSTAND YOUR SACRIFICE, YOUR LOSS, AND MAKE JUSTICE WORK ON YOUR BEHALF. TODAY I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO STAND WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES, DO THE RIGHT THING, SUPPORT THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION. IT IS SO LONG OVERDUE. THANK YOU AND I Y

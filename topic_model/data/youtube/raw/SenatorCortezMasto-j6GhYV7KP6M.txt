Rose Dominican Hospital said they would not bill or require payment from any of the victims they treated and UnitedHealth waived cost-sharing for victims so that they could get treatment four months after the tragedy with no out-of-pocket costs but the generosity didn't end there people from all over the world donated more than 31 million dollars to pay for basic necessities medical bills and funeral costs for the victims and their families one year has passed since the events of October 1st 2017 and I know for many in our community of Las Vegas and for the hundreds of survivors it feels like they've been forgotten but please know please know the survivors and those who were taken will never be forgotten we will always hold the names and stories of everyone affected by this tragedy in our hearts and in our minds in Las Vegas we are still healing we're still grieving for the family members who are no longer with us for sisters brothers mothers fathers cousins nieces nephews aunts and children we will never see again and we're still grieving for the survivors whose lives will never be the same I don't believe perfect healing is possible but I do believe we can learn to adjust to the searing pain of tragedy we do it through remembrance through remembrance the people we love are never truly gone as long as we are around to say their names or share a memory of them through remembrance the people and families who are still healing from their wounds are shown the love and comfort of our community today in remembrance of that awful night one year ago let's give thanks for the bravery and dedication of our first responders let's continue to do everything we can to support those those who are still struggling to recover from the emotional and physical wounds they sustained on October 1st fifty-eight innocent lives ended on October 1st but thousands more were changed forever we must keep the survivors in our minds and in our hearts as they heal from their injuries both visible and invisible and get back on their feet the Davis family lost their daughter Nisha on the night of the shooting Nisha's dream was that her three sons would graduate from college they decided that the best way to heal their family and their community was to start an organization dedicated to fulfilling nieces dream and I thank the Davis family for their resilience and generosity we must follow the Davis's family example and continue to come together as a community we must come together not just in Las Vegas but all throughout Nevada to bring healing peace and hope to everyone who was affected tonight at 6:30 p.m. the city of Las Vegas will host a ceremony at the Las Vegas community healing garden to dedicate a new remembrance wall I encourage everyone back home

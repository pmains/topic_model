Thank You senator hatch and Senator hatch let me just commend you because you and I have worked together off and on these kinds of issues and I think once again you're headed in the right direction I want you to know I'd like to work with you again on this important area for all of you as witnesses you may know what the Oregon Health Sciences Center we're very proud to have dr. brian druker who developed Gleevec it's the breakthrough drug of course that targets specific cancer-causing molecules and I've come to conclude after talking to him and some of his patients that there is absolutely no way to get a solution you know here without overhauling the reimbursement kind of process there are other issues that are important but that's right at the center and I can I can only imagine you know dr. Cobb what it is like for you and stellar physicians like dr. Drucker to tell patients that these life-saving treatments that used to be available are no longer avail it's a disgrace then in a country is good and strong as ours that that goes on every single day and that's what we've got to solve and I think as I've indicated centre hatches in the right direction now let me see if I can get in a couple of questions on the talk talk with you to start this off dr. Conte because with cancer drugs reimbursement issues are a special challenge because there is an issue not only of the amount of the reimbursement but also who gets the reimbursement with generic cancer drugs for the most part the person purchasing the prescription is the doctor as opposed to the patient so if you could just walk us briefly through how increasing the reimbursement of these drugs and they'll be part b drugs outpatient you know drugs for example to seniors to the doctor is going to provide greater incentives for a manufacturer to produce the supply thank you that's an excellent question there is no doubt that physicians do appear to make prescribing decisions based on the alterations in the reimbursement for these therapies and remember physicians both receive reimbursement for the cost for buying the drug but also for administering the drug to their patient that's a separate reimbursement line that physicians receive it is clear that increased payment for these drugs would also increase the incentives to choose I'm kind of more carefully between generic and and branded therapies however I am unclear how an increase in payment to physicians would generate would be immediately passed through to manufacturers unless manufacturers increase their prices in concert and group purchasing organizations would allow these increased payments to physicians to flow directly through to manufacturers I want to ask one other questions senator hatch but I think this is certainly one that will want to look at on a bipartisan basis because I had a number of cancer physicians and companies asked me about the relationship of the physician and the manufacturers and I need one we're going to have to look at now let me ask you one other question dr. Conte maybe some of the others of you would like to chime in on this in effect what Congress would be talking about and you all refer at least three of the four of you in your testimony refer to higher reimbursements in instances particularly with respect to cancer care where the need was urgent or necessary so in effect the Congress would almost be talking about a trigger that would in effect give higher reimbursements for drugs that were quote urgent or necessary and I got to think the American people are going to say holy Toledo how in the world is the United States Congress going to figure out how to make decisions about these life-saving drugs and it's going to set itself up as the authority to make judgments about drugs that are quote urgent or necessary and certainly a patient is going to say when it's my case you bet it's urgent they're congressperson and why don't we start with you dr. Conte this to me is sort of the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question is somebody is going to have to be part of guiding the congress in the country through what really constitutes how you get the reimbursement in those areas that have been declared to be urgent and necessary and so start with you dr. Conte and just go down the row and I'd like to hear how you all would go about making that kind of judgment because certainly senator Hatchin and legislators are trying to work on a bipartisan basis we're going to have to wrestle with that issue dr. Conte thank you clearly information regarding the availability of therapies and its distribution geographically and by page and by physician type is critical to understanding it's really anticipating and alerting the American population regarding the possibility of a shortage of a medically necessary therapy there are other existing systems in place that are many that are overseen by the FDA that monitor shortages for other medically necessary drugs including plasma protein therapies in terms of defining necessary I think that there are at least three important features the first is I think um that you would need a medical panel of experts to really define what we mean by medical by medically necessary however that that's possible we have other types of that exists within CMS but also within FDA as already first it would probably have to be used in a fatal condition secondly there would have to be limited or no therapeutic substitutes and set and third if there were any therapeutic substitutes that would need to there there would have to be no or very limited ahead trials I'm suggests establishing both safety and efficacy in limited patient populations but also in the general patient population that could be affected by these shortages any other witness I know my time is up senator hatch any other witness that would like to like to help counsel the Congress how to wrestle with the definition you want us to establish you could move all the ax sterile injectable drugs into a new reimbursement scheme in the context of cancer we're only talking about i think a few dozen drug so we're not talking about a huge subset of drugs and most of the low price drugs to begin with so you draw the line this is an important point you draw the line on an urgent drug for example as a cancer cancer drug and say that's life-saving well i'm not i'm not looking at it in terms of whether it's an urgent drug or not i'm looking at whether in terms of in terms of its a expensive drug to manufacture where there needs to be some margin built in for the allowance of companies to invest in better manufacturing especially in an environment where the regulatory burdens are increasing so that applies to all the sterile injectable drugs i would just take i would treat them differently as a category of drugs would not tell i think we're talking about a few hundred drugs in total in response to your less questions just quickly at me when we talk about moving away from the ASP pricing scheme for these drugs we're not talking about increasing the reimbursement to the doctor per se we're talking about allowing the companies to take price increases that wouldn't then leave the doctor underwater part of the reason why there's two reasons primarily why the manufacturers right now can take price increases one is their gpo contracts I'm sure Congress doesn't want to get in the business of regulating their contracting but the other is that if they take a price increase at least on the outpatient side they're going to leave the doctors underwater for six months and since they make very little money on these drugs anyway and in many cases these drugs of loss leaders the last thing they're going to do is leave customers underwater for six months and incur the wrath of their customers they'd rather just either take the loss or get out of the business all together so that occur well no I know my time is up senator cornyn kudos to just finish that on this question of how we make judgments about what's urgent necessary I think the idea of treating sterile injectables as a class makes a lot of sense it gets gets out of the value judgments in which drug is critical in which is not but for cancer patients it's almost all the generic injectables senator wyden that's a very good question we've been tracking this issue for a long time and drug shortages are all over the place and I think one thing you're pointing out is this is a very broad category oncology drugs are obviously the ones that you know concern us the mostest because of the implications but you know you're looking at drugs like heparin and aesthetics that are used in the o.r sweet drugs that are used for you know feeding patients parentally so it's really a moving target and you know we think there's going to have to be some more transparency in the entire supply chain so we can create some predictive models because you know creating the perfect list of medically necessary drugs is virtually impossible we've been doing this for a long time it's just a it's very hard to do Thank You senator Cornyn from a new clothes on your tongue

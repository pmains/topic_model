mr. chairman and thank you for moving quickly to hold this necessary hearing during a time of significant pain for our nation and I want to recognize and thank congresswoman bass for her leadership to heal that pain the justice and policing Act is an essential first step mr. Floyd I offer my deepest condolences to you and your family I can't imagine how difficult the last two weeks have been and it is courageous that you are here today just yesterday you laid your brother to rest but his murder is a tragic reminder that we cannot rest we have work to do so that George Floyd and Eric garner solando Castillo Walter Scott Antonio RSA and too many others will not have died in vain and have their lives spur us to action it's been more than four hundred years since enslaved Africans first brought to America's shores shackle and soul we are in the midst of a reckoning and facing a very difficult truth that since that moment there's not been a single day in which the maxim that our founders knew to be self-evident that all men are created equal has been fully recognized by our country for black Americans not a single day in which equal justice under the law has been fully experienced by black Americans there is no greater tragedy in our history and our generation has a choice we can sustain America's original sin or we can redeem her and be repairers of the breach I recognize that the ability to end racism in our country is beyond the reach of this committee we don't have the power to change every person's art in mind but what we can do is address structural racism and annex tangible measures of transparency and accountability in policing that can help make everyone safe this is a charge that every level of government must take up from those of us in Congress to everyone who serves on a city council during my time as the mayor of my hometown we started a community policing trust initiative which earned the recognition from the Obama administration's Department of Justice we enhance the escalation training for our officers we've rewrote the guidelines for interacting with our immigrant community we started putting body to worn cameras on officers on patrol and then when we saw the positive results we budgeted for every officer on the beat to wear a camera but I'll be the first to tell you there is more work to do in every state in every city in every community in America so I want to ask our distinguished panel specifically about body worn cameras in 2014 research by Arizona State University found that officers wearing body cameras or aware of their actions and sense into the scrutiny of the footage by their superiors and I believe that every police officer on patrol in America ought to be wearing a body worn camera professor Butler do you believe that body worn cameras help make members of the public and the police of the surgeon safer absolutely absolutely without body worn cameras there are before killer cops who remained are the police force of Minneapolis President Davis how can body worn cameras improve training for police officers I thank you for the question in addition to capturing what happens it allows the police department to go back and look at the everyday encounter car stops traffic stops pedestrian stops and evaluate the conduct there's a good study out of open what Stanford did you show that how officers engage men and it wouldn't occur is completely different than how they were engaging non-minority so there's a lot to me where just by watching a day to day activities at a distance and capturing the critical interesting we're talking about thank you miss Eiffel one of the main challenges is body worn cameras is that they can be expensive to not just the camera itself but capturing all the information that provide in your view are the wise and while investment for law enforcement agencies other body one cameras are vitally important and I caution that it is necessary to more than just people is body lock cameras and that means it doesn't need to be attention to the lawless that who gets to look at that film in jurisdictions where your law enforcement officers get to look at the film before they have to answer questions then the body worn camera is just another tool that assists the one who's been officers including I think you also have to pay attention to a jurisdictions that are embedding cease or recognition technology in their body worn cameras this presents a very serious privacy concern for communities and particularly african-american communities so they're important they're not going to be all and end all because we've seen film we saw film with Eric garner who sought physical office to have invited the officer to Field Marshal stock was originally acquitted where the jury was hung oh you know that film is not the defendant end all but it is final for all of the reasons to have been suggested and I do want to flag however those cautions about what happens with that film is also a question that I would encourage to also think about answering a little finer thank you so much I yield back the gentleman you

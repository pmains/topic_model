I knew him I knew it when I was in law school and he's a very entertaining nice guy but when I was listening to that argument and the third day of the argument was about what they call severability which is if you strike down part of a law is unconstitutional do you strike the whole thing and a fundamental premise of conservative judicial review is you scalpel the constitutional problem and leave the rest of the law because after all the law was passed by the people's representative through Congress the Senate House the Senate and signed by the president so it's the power of judicial review by unelected people as extraordinary and should be used most narrowly and that's that's the history of that doctrine and I heard him on the radio asking the government's lawyer do you mean if we find the the personal mandate unconstitutional I've got to read the whole 2,700 page bill to figure out what is my answer was that's your job I couldn't believe it

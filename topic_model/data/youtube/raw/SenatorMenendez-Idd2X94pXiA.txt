Senator Menendez of New Jersey is recognized thank you Mr chairman a lot of Securities regulation essentially comes down to one thing what actions are and are not permissible when one person is handling another person's money and by and large we in Congress the Securities industry and the general public have agreed on the major principles that should guide that activity for instance as you point out in your testimony Professor Owen Brokers are not permitted to use customer funds to finance their business they are required to fully disclose conflicts of interest and when dealing with retail investors they are required to go further and mitigate certain conflicts FTX didn't seem to have done any of this and if they had it seems like a lot of harm would have been prevented so Professor Allen is there any reason why we shouldn't apply the same broad regulatory principles that are now in place with the traditional financial sector digital assets I see no reason the reason we typically hear is that crypto is different because it's decentralized but in fact it's not decentralized at every level there are people controlling things so you know we heard that block sorry that Bitcoin was decentralized well you know Bitcoin is controlled by a few core software developers fewer than 10 and they make can make changes to the software and then that software is implemented by mining pools and there's just a few of them so in all these spaces there are definitely people often a very few people pulling the strings but the fact of the matter is that they are unidentified and unregulated and that is not um an ideal space to be in yeah Mr O'Leary in your testimony you said you hope that the events that FTX would quote put renewed focus on implementing domestic regulation do you agree that FTX customers and perhaps your own Investments would have been better off if FTX had complied with the existing regulation we have that bars broke focus on trading with customer funds absolutely but they were not compelled to do that because they were offshore and unregulated I think the model will not work there's there's examples of how regulated exchanges that are attached to broker dealers have worked you only have to look up to Canada the osc order where bit by wallets are controlled by the regulator they limit the number of tokens they limit the margin they limit The Lending they do an exhaustive test of proof of Reserves we need and that's just the rules they implemented that they just copied from their own exchanges we need to do the same thing here it works it's been proven to work there's millions of Canadians that have accounts that are working under a very strict regulatory environment we can implement the same well I agree we already know what should and should not be allowed when one person is handling another person's money whether we're talking about a new celebrity endorsed coin or an index fund I think would be well served to keep in mind the basic principles that have largely saved and served investors uh in the markets well for decades as I was listening to some of your testimony back in my office it all seems like you looked at this as more of a security than a currency uh at the end of the day and that makes it pretty clear for me uh in the wake of FTX collapse many crypto firms have attempted to reassure the public of their soundness by hiring outside Auditors to provide proofs of Reserve however the quality of these audits are inconsistent and oftentimes provide an incomplete picture of the company's assets and liabilities Professor Allen can you explain some of the flaws in these reports and why they are not as helpful to investors as the crypto industry claims well I mean there is the fundamental issue that where do you even get the valuation number from these assets do we treat them on a sort of a fair value accounting basis if so we're essentially accepting whatever the market says about these um asset prices and then they're entirely based on sentiment so um you know in addition even if we put that aside the actual um attestations Etc that we're getting as I said they don't have the this skepticism that we expect from professional Auditors who who look at the financial statements to find red flags they're required to look for red flags in these attestations and proof of reserves it's basically just the accountant sort of reporting what they've been told by the industry yeah one of the things I'm concerned about is the extent that Crystal cryptocurrency becomes integrated with the financial system and therefore the risks to the financial system which up to now has been pretty pretty stable uh and that is something I'm concerned about let me close on this prior to its collapse FTX was well known for huge spending on Celebrity endorsements dozens of sports stars actors received millions of dollars to generate hype for FTX and assure the public that crypto was a safe investment there have even been reports that FTX was pursuing 100 million dollar sponsorship deal with Taylor Swift earlier this year even as the film uh I mean as the firm was hemorrhaging money so FTX isn't the only firm doing this endorsements from public figures are just one of the factors contributing to misinformation about crypto Mr shank and how can we combat the spread of crypto disinformation and encourage investor education uh use words that are accurate the cryptocurrencies are not currencies uh we need to classify them as Securities properly I also think that uh we should consider um treating crypto like gambling and uh having uh you know potential limitations on advertising and disclosures thank you chairman

Joe all right Thank You Kaylee for for the update meanwhile the Senate is expected to vote tomorrow on a bill that would link 15 billion dollars in disaster aid with the deal that was struck by President Trump and Democrats to raise the debt limit and keep the government open until mid-december Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced the bill last night McConnell announced the support for the plan following the surprise announcement by Democrats the president from back their requests that any deadline for extending the debt ceiling line up with the short-term spending package and now Republicans wanted a longer deal on the debt limit 18 months through the midterm elections for more on this let's bring in congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland House Minority Whip and second ranking Democratic leader in the house how did you how did you see yesterday leader Hoyer it's enemy of my enemy is my friend or you know I mentioned earlier that a lot of the liberal websites immediately said Trump caved total defeat handed to him by the Democrats do you think that's the way that this should be poured every night that's not very nice whether you finally get something that you want you get some bipartisanship and you immediately you know cast it that way how do you cast this well when you say they I'm not sure they is us I'm not sure all the broad brush in any event I was surprised you asked me what my reaction was I was surprised clearly the Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate wanted to do an 18 months extension on the debt limit so that they would not have to have another vote on it before next November's election and that's what I expected to happen it didn't happen both leader Pelosi and leader Schumer suggested that the debt limit be coterminous with the CR and that's apparently the president I wasn't what not at the meeting but apparently the president said well yeah I'm sure that makes sense and did it much to I think the chagrin of Senator McConnell and speaker Ryan I was again not in the room but I garner from the press reports that both of them were surprised and not happy what were you gratified leader for I mean does that does it indicate that you can work with President Trump on on tax reform I don't know whether that's the case or not with President Trump you take it one day at a time as we know but I think on this issue he apparently thought that the proposal made by the Pelosi and Schumer made sense that we address the two issues at the same time in December I think it's going to complicate the issue and very frankly the debt limit extension interesting enough will not end in December because they will again I have available to them extraordinary circumstances so it could go into late January or February in terms of then the debt limit extension has to be acted upon having said that frankly I think the debt limit extension vote is a phony vote America incurs bills the premise is that America will pay its bills the debt limit is sort of a phony process where we beat our chest and say where we're going to with withhold spending we don't the debt goes up and we extend the debt because the global economy depends upon America's creditworthiness but having said that the CR will come up in December and in ends December 8th as you know in addition to that the Harvie relief will be on the bill and this is something that we need to do it's interesting that it's expanded about twofold from the house to the Senate it went at about seven point eight foot seven point nine to the Senate's coming back at somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 so we'll see what some folks who said when you add extra money they couldn't support sandy relief let's see whether they support this relief you know if we watch how politics works lately leader and when one party gets leverage I guess all all's fair in love and war right did was there a sense of Glee yesterday that the Democrats now have more leverage for December and will we'll Democrats use that leverage to extract what they see is their agenda in whatever the negotiations are going to be it's gonna be much uglier that's what the journal thinks well maybe I'd open I but let me say this the Democrats are not euphoric today one of the reasons we're not your Fork is because earlier this week 800,000 people young people were put at risk by the Attorney General apparently at the request of the president saying that they were not going to pursue dr. Reneau of America really who came here at a very early age it is interesting that even rush limbaugh said yesterday or the day before nobody wants to kick these children the president said he'd like to see Congress act on that is that that's correct and that's the good news the president said look we have to act on this and he said quote we have no choice obviously senator Graham senator Rubio senator hatch have spoken out on behalf of this so we have a lot of very significant Republican leaders who've spoken out on this speaker Ryan has spoken out on this I am very hopeful and I'll be euphoric or happy at least when we come to an agreement in the next hopefully few weeks not wait to six months not keep people in one bow for six months not keep the economy in limbo for six months the business community has overwhelmingly Chamber of Commerce high-tech companies overwhelmingly come out and said this is bad policy and we need to extend and get permanent relief to children who were brought here who were brought here as children through no conscious effort on their own but would you have preferred that the executive order would be maintained you saw what happened with the other one and in the court system with the four million with you can't see that that that was that was not constitutional probably the president admitted it President Obama when he signed it that he really didn't have the authority would you have rattled me contained the status quo or secretly do you believe that if you get some legislation that that that is actually a better place to be when it's all said and done I I mean I hear a LARPing but but did anyone want to keep the status quo that was so so tenuous and not permanent we didn't have to take action and the president didn't have to take action he could have asked for legislative action certainly we all agree that legislative action giving certainty to these eight hundred thousand plus young people who were 90 percent of them working in our economy and paying taxes wouldn't have put any urgency on it and you guys had a chance to do it in the first two years of the Obama presidency when you Hill House the Senate and the like didn't do anything with immigration you did Obama care but don't it's not we didn't you know dreamers bill passed the House of Representative representing so we did do something the house did its job when we when I was the majority leader we sent a bill over there having said that I think you're right i mean the glass is half-full in the sense that the president says we have to deal with it he's given a six-month framework in which to do it so from that stamp infant from that standpoint it may and I hope it does but I think the earlier we act particularly in light of the overwhelming overwhelming numbers 84 percent of Democrats 70-plus percent of independents 60 plus percent of Republicans all believe as Rush Limbaugh said nobody wants to kick these kids out of the country and we need to give them some sense of stability and assurance that they're not going to be kicked out of the country this is the country they know they grew up here they went to school here they speak this language and and they're working in the economy and as a matter of fact to kick him out people say it's going to be about a four hundred billion dollar plus hit on the economy over ten years so the smart thing to do and I was glad you're right that President Trump said look we have no choice we need to work on this he said I love these children and if that's the case we're going to act positively I'm going to be urging leader McCarthy and speaker Ryan to bring a bill to fluor the dreamer bill to the floor as soon as possible so the Congress can pass legislation to give certainty I believe that majority of votes are on the House floor and Senator Graham said he believes the votes are on the Senate floor I am just can't wait to see when this tax reform is up and and and you and a lot of Democrats saying you know what I remember President Trump with with Harvey and the debt senator let's let's go ahead and do this bipartisan thing and work together on it cuz you think back and remember how that worked yeah yeah the problem will not be with Democrats working on well when did we last pass it in 1986 who was president nine states Ronald Reagan who was in charge of the Congress of the United States Democrats nothing seems similar to those days now I think you're right on that I think that's unfortunate but I think you're right but the fact of the matter is let me say this we need tax reform we're for tax reform what we don't need is tax cuts that are not paid for that pushes this country deeper in debt and passes the cost along to our children okay all right congressman thank you thank you all right we will we'll see you again soon I'm sure and look forward to

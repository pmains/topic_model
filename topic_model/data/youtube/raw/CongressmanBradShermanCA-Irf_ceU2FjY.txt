a few acres here are there after all they plotted against us in an apartment building in Hamburg we need to prevent terrorists from getting a whole state or a training facility as large as Tora Bora was in early 2001 in evaluating our Afghan policy I think we've got to get away from looking at the sunk costs the exhaustion of the last 18 years and look only at the future and see what are the future costs of being involved and what future benefits if any are available the one lesson I've learned over the last 20 years is we are very good at breaking things we broke the Taliban and entered Kabul we broke who's Saddam Hussein's army and entered Baghdad we are not very good at fixing things and at nation-building and so we should restrict our future military involvement stew those where our case for involvement is so strong that we are not morally obligated to go in and fix it the Pottery Barn rule should not apply the worst example of our behavior was Iraq we invaded even a few days after Saddam Hussein said he'd allow all the international inspections we found no weapons of mass destruction and then to justify our behavior we had to announce that we were going to turn Iraq into a into a democracy with rule of law I wonder how well that's working out mr. rosecope oh you've you've shown us that our Afghan nation building was not done well foreign policy Foreign Affairs magazine gives our efforts there a d-minus but going forward we're going to be confronted with similar situations let's say we had done a B job who would the federal government long enough not to expect an a job we did a B job one view is we can do nation-building at reasonable cost if we learn from the lessons of Afghanistan and do it about as right as the government can do it another lessening is we can't do nation-building would a be job from the federal government had done the job in Afghanistan I used to teach in college I think you've even get it did a D job D D it would have been okay in Afghanistan you're saying if we had just a - and it would have worked a lot better so you would have given it you what we did was an F F - something like that e you showed up he showed up for class that's it all sighing that we can do nation building if we do a good the kind of good job that the federal government's capable of doing absolutely and and what we tried to do is we tried to give the Afghans and I think one of your staff asked us about Miss assumptions that we've identified there's a whole list of them one was trying to give the Afghans what we had when they only wanted a little bit of peace and a little bit of justice and if you look at our report on stabilization we talked about that the whole stabilization program was coming in after our military clear to district the pride to bring in a government services so that the locals would go back and support the the central government well they wanted a little bit of justice what did we do we built courthouses they weren't looking for courthouses they weren't looking for something that looked like this they were looking for just simple justice and as much as you hate the Taliban and I do and I hate their brand of justice to the average Afghan it's better than the Justice provided by the national unity government and that was one of my trips was the most shocking thing where and I believe well congressman Connolly is left so I can repeat the story so no one of you would be bored but I came back as so depressed because I met three separately three Afghans who I'd been working with smart young brave Afghans who risk their lives every day and and for some reason we all started talking about their families and their families lived in the countryside in Afghanistan and every one of those young smart bright Afghans told me a story where they recommended that their mothers and fathers that if they had a justice problem and all of them did go to the Taliban don't go to the local government so instead of creating a government similar to what Afghanistan in the some time in the last 50 years we tried to create the kind of government we have in the United States tried to create you know a little America we tried to create I call it Norway what they wanted was fair justice and what happened is if you went to the national unity government justice first of all the judges weren't there because they were afraid to go there you had to pay bribes and it's the bribes that determined wherever you got the land or wherever the dowry was recognized or whatever but the holoband came in it was rough justice and I'm not advocating Taliban justice I remember is there a period of time in Afghanistan had the kind of government that those villages would have wanted I think it probably would have been before the Soviet invasion and it goes back to that and before the communist regime that nakhon ceded the horror that I believe my time thank you yeah thank you mr. Sherman mr. Smith

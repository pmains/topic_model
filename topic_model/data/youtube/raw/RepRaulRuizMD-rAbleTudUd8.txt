this issue isn't theoretical for me or my constituents i grew up just a few miles north of the sultan sea and spent years working in a hospital where i treated children with asthma and other pulmonary conditions indicative of long-term exposure to particular matter i understand firsthand what the dying sultancy means to my constituents and how it has ramifications for public health the economy and the ecosystem as a whole today's hearing is the first congressional hearing on this issue since 1997 and which means that 23 years ago congress sought to the need to address the federal role at the sea and yet today we find ourselves on the verge of a crisis and i'm committed to making change and i'm urging everyone here to commit with me and representative vargas to making change at the salton sea when i arrived in congress there was no salton management plan there were no projects and there was no money in 2015 we broke ground at the red hill bay with the federal agencies also co-partnering and leading this effort in 2016 i held broker that mou between california and the department of interior to bring more federal resources to the sea and in 2017 the california released its 10-year plan under that assault city management plan and each year i have secured appropriation language and funding to push this administration to get more involved so we are building momentum in 2018 senator feinstein and i expanded programs in the farm bill so sultan c projects could compete for millions of dollars of funding in 2019 secretary crowfoot joined me at the salton sea for a roundtable discussion with the community earlier this year energy and water appropriations committee chair marcy captor joined me at the salon safe for a tour and a meeting with our federal and state partners and now today we are holding the first congressional hearing on the sultan sea in over 20 years the house of representatives and these committees are doing our jobs but we must get the same level of commitment from this administration and its agencies to use their authority to make a difference for my constituents my patience is running thin i have called for an all hands on deck approach to break ground expedite and complete projects at the salton sea and that must include the administration the federal government owns half of the land at the salt sea and has a significant role in managing that land they cannot sit on the sideline and leave my constituents high and dry while the shoreline disappears in front of their eyes in their fiscal year 21 budget requests the bureau of reclamation acknowledge a future obligation under the clean air act of over 300 million dollars yet they have presented no plan no funding request and show no sense of urgency to do anything about it it is this lack of action that precisely demonstrates the need for federal legislation to create resources and prioritize and expedite projects so my draft legislation the sultan c public health and environmental protection act would require the department of interior to work with california to rapidly increase the amount of land covered by mitigation and dust suppression projects increased coordination between agencies to identify funding streamline permitting and expedite new projects and require epa to regularly report on air quality so we can better mitigate and respond to the public health risks in the region

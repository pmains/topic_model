hi i'm congresswoman jackie wolorski and i wanted to take a moment to update you on a growing challenge in indiana and across the country as you know supply chain bottlenecks and workforce shortages are impacting every american family worker and business northern indiana is home to one of the largest manufacturing centers in the country the supply chain and workforce issues are devastating to hoosier manufacturers and small businesses not only are they making it harder to manufacture and transport vital products supply chain bottlenecks and workforce shortages are also adding to the skyrocketing inflation crisis that is evident across the country from manufacturing inputs to the gas pump and the grocery store unfortunately these problems continue to get worse under president biden and congressional democrats radical agenda that chooses no strings attached government checks over workforce development we simply cannot keep an entire generation of american workers regulated to the sidelines it's time to get americans back to work to get our reports working overtime and to keep our economy moving in the right direction the administration's current approach is simply unacceptable i have urged leaders of president biden's supply chain task force including department of transportation secretary pete butterjudge to get to the bottom of these problems and to prioritize common sense solutions to restore the critical transportation industry and strengthen the workforce for the sake of our local and national economy alike we need to help americans find and keep family sustaining jobs instead of sending endless government checks by providing job training and equipping americans to succeed common sense reforms would help people move from welfare to prosperity reduce the labor shortage and resolve the supply chain bottleneck as we continue to confront these challenges know that i am fighting every day for you and for all of our communities

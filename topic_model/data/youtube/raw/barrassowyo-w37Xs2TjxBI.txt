joining us now is Senate Republican conference chair Dr John barrasso Senator let me first ask you whether or not you think the reporting is accurate whether or not you believe that there was a deal to increased production um and if so what could have happened to to Nix that deal well Trey thanks for having me look Joe Biden has put America in a position where we have a kick me sign on our back so it's not surprising that Saudi Arabia would treat us the way that they have with regard to energy that's what's happening today in America the things that have happened in the last two years with Joe Biden to weaken our country whether it's 40 percent High inflation whether it's crime in in the cities whether it's a porous order all of those things have weakened America and now to the specifics of energy I'm in Wyoming and energy state I'm the ranking member of the energy committee and to me I think the greatest sin of President Biden has that of giving up America's energy Independence I mean we have it and we don't have it now so I'm not surprised that Saudi Arabia would treat us the way that they have there is a solution to this and the solution is more American Energy but Joe Biden in every single Democrat who's running this year who serves in the house and serves in the Senate they have a very different idea they do exactly whatever these climate extremists tell them to do what they demand of this far left group and they shut off the choked off American energy production that's hurt us they've now spent down are emergency energy supplies we are in an energy War and the president doesn't want to admit it all right I'm a big believer in setting realistic expectations but let's assume for the sake of argument that Republicans do take the Senate a week from Tuesday is there anything given the fact that Joe Biden's still going to be the president is there anything you can do any pressure you can put to get him to go back to energy Independence days there are a number of things we could do I would be chairman of the energy Committee in the United States Senate and my focus would be on lowering the costs of energy for the American public and that involves unleashing American Energy so what we need to do is restore our energy Independence and restore our energy economy which is huge in this country so we're going to be putting forth legislation we'll also do it with oversight we'll do it with who gets confirmed to different positions in the economy all of these things focused on more infrastructure pipelines more oil and gas permits and no dependence on anyone whether it's critical minerals from China whether it's oil from Russia or Saudi Arabia we and look you know this trade we need all the energy we need the oil the gas the coal uranium we need the solar we need the wind we need it all and from the environmental standpoint we need to make continue to make energy as clean as we can as fast as we can and do it in ways that that don't raise costs because it's affordable energy I mean that is the issue that's sucking the lifeblood out of the American people that's why people are so mad and that's why I'm so optimistic about our Republican chances of taking the house and taking the Senate come next Tuesday before I'll let you go Senator this is what vexes me I mean even if the climate or the environment is your number one issue how is Saudi oil cleaner than American Oil I mean if you're asking the Saudis to increase production it means we need more energy why not use American Energy I mean is American Energy not just as clean and not cleaner yeah we are the best environmental stewards in terms of how we produce our energy here like I was at Lube Express in Casper yesterday getting my oil changed talking to folks there what's happening now in terms of energy the Wyoming economy with this Administration it's personal it's emotional we understand we're cutting tied up in red tape from this Administration affordable energy is the lifeblood of this nation that's why I'm so optimistic about the election but for folks if you want to stop the damage that this Biden Administration and every single Democrat has done to this country over the last two years we need to vote for Republicans House and Senate come next Tuesday Senator Dr John barrosso who may be in charge in the Senate of energy policy come January thank you for joining us senator look forward to seeing you soon thank you Trey

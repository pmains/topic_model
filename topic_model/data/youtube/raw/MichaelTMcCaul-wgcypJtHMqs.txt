let me give another round of applause for Scott nor survivor and his mother Nancy this is why we're here people like Scott all of you in the room have been through experiences like this whether you're a parent you lost her child or you have a child who survived with survivorship issues we've come a long ways but we have a long ways to go cancer is still the number one killer of our children and it is our goal to eradicate and destroy this disease once and for all you know I chair the Homeland Security Committee and I try to protect the American people from the threats that I see but this is one that is the number one threat really to our children and I can't think of a more worthy greater cause than this one and I want to thank all of you for being here today to be a part of this mission this cause that we have and we have made great success and I do want to thank a few individuals in addition to Scott who survived leukemia one reason I got involved in the fight is that a lot of parents who came to me who lost their children I also lost my best friend in grade school to leukemia back then it was a death sentence today it's not and that's the good news but we have a lot more work to do i also want to recognize an andy taylor who has been really the brain child genius becoming quite the celebrity in the childhood cancer circles and I want to thank my wife Linda for all of her great to work on this effort actually introducer is my daughter at the last event but we have five teenagers and I thank you for raising them we call them domestic terrorists at times and I also want to thank nancy goodman who was also the genius behind the creating hope act not just a messenger I'm an advocate i form the caucus because these children don't have lobbyists here in Washington they don't have advocates and so unfortunately they're not made the priority oftentimes in Congress that they should be and that's what the caucus it is designed to change the caucus has has resulted and I think some good legislation and this let me say a few things about the creating hope act you know when Nancy and I were working on this Andy Andy in London and brianna's out there are great childhood cancer survivor advocate and I took on the House floor and violation of the house rules to lobby that bill but we got it done and you know what it was experimental we didn't know if it was going to work and guess what it did and now since the 1980s we only had one childhood cancer drug since the 1980s and thanks to the creating hope Act we now have a drug to cure neuroblastoma in little Rex Ryan you know Dell Children's you're going to hear from them later today but you know United therapeutics really discovered the drug had a clinical trial in my home town of Austin at Dell Children's Hospital and Casey and Leslie Ryan have a little son named Rex whose a survivor now because of this new drug and I got to meet Rex Adele children it's a little three-year-old kid full of energy blonde hair running around I wish you could be here today but as parents are here I can't think of anything more gratifying we do a lot of stuff up here that doesn't amount to anything but to be able to do something like that where you can see a direct result that actually saved a child's life I can't think of anything more important than that and Rex gave me a drawing of the Capitol and it sits behind my desk here in Washington and I think a lot about Rex and I think about all the children who have both died and survived and the children of the future whose lives were going to save by continuing this great cause and so we convene here is advocates and talk about what can we do it's cathartic and we come together to to to eradicate this disease but I can tell you the most important two things on your agenda one is to reauthorize the creating hope Act we did that we passed the cures act in the house which increased funding from the National Institute of Health at a time when it's hard to do that but we did that we increased NIH funding and we also reauthorized the creating hope act the Senate needs to act if the Senate does not act by st. Patrick's Day that creating hope Act will expire and that's unconscionable legislation that has been proven to save kids lives with over four drugs that have come out each of these vouchers were 50 million dollars that can go to further research and development it's unconscionable that the Congress not act on this the house has done its job and now it's time for the Senate we've also introduced the star Act which essentially stands for the survivorship treatment access and research that does many many things and there's a lot of hand out material on this but we put together a package that we thought would relate to those four issues that we think is realistic that can be achievable that can be passed by the Congress so when you go to members offices tell them about the star act tell me about the bipartisan support for it that Jackie Speier is joining me in the good fight and also telling about reauthorizing the creating hope act in the Senate you know my state were always a little bit proud in Texas but we have a sub called seaport it's a Cancer Research Institute and you know three percent of that budget was directed towards childhood cancer but just recently they changed that priority from three to thirty one percent at the National Cancer Institute we're going to hear from NCI later four percent is allocated to childhood cancer four percent through our children who have a far greater lifespan ahead of them that's unconscionable I think we could take a little lesson from my state let's increase that number from four to thirty percent I just just really want to scat thank you a little hero there's so many little heroes out there when you go to these hospitals and I do it very frequently fortunately many are surviving now but some don't and it's probably one of the most heart-wrenching experiences you can see is a child that's dying losing their hair dealing with needles every day it's one of the saddest experience as you can see we need to stop it we need to stop the horrific experience everybody in this room has been through and again I want to thank all of you for your heroism for standing up for this cause we're going to continue the fight and we're going to eventually defeat this terrible disease thank you very much

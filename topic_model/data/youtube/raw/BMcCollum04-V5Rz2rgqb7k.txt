Mr Speaker I rise to urge the immediate release of two workers journalists while on and Joe so who who have been imprisoned in Burma for their Phyllis reporting on the atrocities being perpetrated against Sura hinga the ethnic cleansing of the rahaga has shocked the conscience of the world in part because of the important public testimony gathered by these two journalists in december these journalists were invited to meet with the police they were handed documents by officers they had never met before and then they were immediately arrested under obscure colonial-era law the rest of these journalists and the Burmese government's refusal to grant them bail is highly irregular it seems obvious that the only purpose of their continued detention is to chill the independent media in Burma mr. speaker a free press is essential to a democratic society and I joined the State Department and governments around the world urging Burma to release these journalists immediately and to allow them to reunite with their families and return to their important work

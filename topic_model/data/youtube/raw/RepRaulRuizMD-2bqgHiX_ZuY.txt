G FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE IMPACTED BY BURN PITS ON MILITARY BASES OVERSEAS. THEY JOIN PRESIDENT BIDEN AND CELEBRITY ACTIVIST JON STEWART FOR THE SIGNING CEREMONY OF A BILL THAT VETERANS ARE CALLING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT VETERANS HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION EVER. MADELEINE BRAND HAS MORE DETAILS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE KARLO AND HEATHER, SOME OF THE VETERANS WHO INSPIRED THIS NEW LAW HAVE SINCE DIED FROM THEIR CANCERS RELATED TO BURN PIT EXPOSURE. BUT ADVOCATES SAY THEIR PRESENCE WAS FELT HERE TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY WILL LIVE ON THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION AIMED TO HELP THOSE STILL STRUGGLING AND THEIR FAMILIES, VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES SURROUNDED PRESIDENT BIDEN AS HE SIGNED INTO LAW A BILL THEY SPENT YEARS FIGHTING FOR WHEN THEY CAME HOME. MANY OF THE FITTEST AND BEST WARRIORS WE SENT TO WAR WERE NOT THE SAME. THE PACKED ACT EXPANDS HEALTH CARE BENEFITS FOR MILLIONS OF VETERANS WHO RETURNED HOME FROM WAR SICK. WE KNOW THAT I HAVE LEAD POISONING, THAT I HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF URANIUM, BISMUTH AND BARIUM IN MY SYSTEM ALL OF WHICH THE DOCTORS ATTRIBUTE TO MY SERVICE IN IRAQ. ARMY VETERAN ERIC DONOHOE, WHO DEPLOYED TO IRAQ SUFFERED TOXIC EXPOSURE FROM BURN PITS ON BASE BURNING TRASH AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER DEBRIS LIKE BATTERIES, HUMVEES, TIRES, MEDICAL WASTE. HUMAN WASTE IS BAD FOR US TO BREATHE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT AND THEY DID KNOW THAT THIS NEW LAW HELPS VETERANS MORE THAN 20 RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES AND CANCERS TO THEIR TOXIC EXPOSURE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO GET CARE AND BENEFITS. THE BURDEN OF PROOF WILL BE REMOVED FROM VETERANS FROM PROVING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWENTY THREE ILLNESSES AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT. NAVY VETERAN TOM PORTER OF IRAQ AFGHANISTAN VETERANS OF AMERICA SAYS BEFORE TODAY MOST CLAIMS HAD BEEN TURNED DOWN. IT'S MONUMENTAL. THIS IS THE BIGGEST DEAL PROBABLY THE BIGGEST VETERANS HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION THAT'S EVER BEEN PASSED INTO LAW. THE HARDEST THING IN THIS ENTIRE CHALLENGE FOR ME HAS BEEN MY KIDS WITNESSING ME GOING IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. WHILE THE HEALTH BATTLES MAY BE FAR FROM OVER. TODAY PROVIDES NEW HOPE.  ANOTHER PART OF THIS NEW LAW AIMS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TOXIC EXPOSURE THROUGH RESEARCH AND IMPROVE TOXIC EXPOSURE FOR CARE. ONE OF THE CONGRESS MEMBERS, A CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE RAUL RUIZ OF THE COACHELLA VALLEY WHO IS ONE OF THE DRIVING FORCES BEHIND THIS LEGISLATION IN THE HOUSE. HE SAYS THE NEXT FIGHT HERE WILL BE MAKING SURE THE MILITARY STOPS USING BURN PITS ALTOGETHER. HE SAYS THERE ARE SEVERAL THAT STILL EXIST AT THE WHITE HOUSE. I'M NATALIE BRYAND CBS8. THANKS, NATALIE.

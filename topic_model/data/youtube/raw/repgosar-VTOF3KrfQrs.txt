hello I'm congressman Paul Gosar proudly representing Arizona's fourth congressional district I regret not being able to be with you in person today but I wanted to extend my deepest appreciation to all the hard-working golf course superintendents a cactus a pine and I especially want to thank Rory van puck and the rest of the Board of Directors for their excellent leadership over the years I'm happy to share with you some news about what I'm working on in Congress and how it impacts the golf industry in Arizona at the end of 2016 I was elected to serve as chairman of the Congressional Western caucus this informal group of House members is dedicated to protecting private property rights strengthening local control fostering economic growth preserving multiple use of public land and increasing energy independence initially the caucus was born in the West out of concerns of the undue federal interference with rural values that have been a part of our lives for centuries since I've taken over leadership with the Western caucus we have added 23 new members making 69 total members in the House of Representatives as chairman of the Western caucus is my responsibility to support Arizona's important economic drivers one of the biggest being our thriving golf industry the Arizona golf industry had a total economic contribution of nearly 4 billion in sales in 2014 while impacting a total of more than 4,100 700 jobs it's critical that our elected leaders support golf and that's why I'm happy to report that we have already scored a huge victory earlier this year in February President Trump signed an executive order requiring the administrator of the EPA to review Obama administration's harmful waters of the United States rule better known as lotus and rescind any aspect of this water grab inconsistent with federal law I had the privilege of joining President Trump in the Oval Office for the signing of this important executive order literally ditching the wotus rule will ensure our precious water resources will remain in local control not in the hands of Washington DC bureaucrats I've been fighting to overturn wotus for more than four years and during this fight I have often cited Arizona golf industry as a leader in effective water management in the southwest much of the science and best practices we have today regarding efficient water use flood control and water utilization our result of advancements made by the golfing industry as it adapted to growing demand in the arid Arizona well we have great confidence in president Trump protecting farmers ranchers and property owners from this lawless water grab Congress must once again utilize the power of the purse and take a clear position against Lotus I will continue to lead in this effort to protect the jobs and economic growth the Gulf delivers to our state I'm proud to call cactus pine a loyal friend and ally in our mutual effort to build a better Arizona thank you again for letting me share my thoughts during this year's annual meeting and I wish you all straight drives short putts and smooth greens out on the course today thanks

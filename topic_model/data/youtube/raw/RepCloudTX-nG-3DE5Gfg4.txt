I'm a congressional delegation including our congressman Michael cloud has been touring the border area of the past three days they toured several border patrol processing facilities down in the valley and also spent time with Border Patrol agents to get an inside look at their day-to-day operations our Emily Hamilton traveled with the delegation she joins us now with more on that visit Emily Lee the lawmakers we spent the last few days with came from Texas Georgia and Wisconsin and they said this trip really opened their eyes to what they feel as the depletion of Border Patrol resources and the need for congressional action those delegates toured several facilities pertaining to border security this week and that visit wrapped up just a couple of hours ago in congressman were given a behind-the-scenes look at a facility for unaccompanied minors in driscoll no cameras were allowed in that facility but after the tour representatives told us it's important to see these things firsthand and take these experiences back to Washington it's heartbreaking this is the the situation that we've allowed by our inaction to develop it's heartbreaking and it deserves a dramatic response it is absolutely stunning it is heartbreaking to see the conditions at our border agents who are working under and the enormity of the problem that they're trying to address they are just massively out manned and outnumbered and out financed in in every way the congressional visit wrapped up just about an hour ago at the Corpus Christi International Airport where the delegates held a roundtable discussion about their experiences this week and possible next steps and coming up tonight at 10:00 you'll hear from some of the Border Patrol agents that met with their congressional delegation Lee and Katia back to you

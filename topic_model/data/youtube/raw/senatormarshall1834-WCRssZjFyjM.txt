uh mr senator you've got to leave us shortly and go over to the senate to start the impeachment trial what are you expecting well i i think that we're going to hear both from the president's team as well as the the democrats and i think listen to the tone of the democrats opening statements and you're going to hear the hatred and just the revenge and in their voices but more importantly is what what this is not doing it's keeping us from doing our jobs up here that it's raising the temperature across the country we should be focused today on how we get vaccinations in people's arms instead just like a year ago when speaker pelosi was walking over impeachment orders we're doing the same thing today a year ago i was on the house floor talking about this virus and they were they were trying to invite people to chinatown so our focus should be on this fire risk getting shots in the arms and getting the economy opened again

thank thank you madam speaker and i want to thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for handling the rule and highlighting this very important issue as he said if the previous question is defeated republicans will amend the rule to immediately consider house resolution 1233 that's the resolution that condemns the spate of attacks that have recently occurred against pro-life facilities groups and churches in the wake of the dobb's opinion madam speaker these acts are reprehensible but we shouldn't be surprised that they're occurring all across the country they've gone unchecked for far too long ever since the draft dobbs opinion was inexcusably leaked to the public in that unprecedented act republicans immediately condemned that leak as a threat to the institution of the court itself as a threat to the justices themselves as individuals and as a threat to our very republic the democrat leadership of this body did nothing weeks went by as tensions grew protesters harassed sitting in supreme court justices a clear violation of the black letter federal law republicans filed a resolution condemning those acts the democrat leadership of this body did nothing even as threats continue to pour in against the justices and their families you know what the senate acted they unanimously passed legislation to extend security to the families of the justices i and many of my colleagues repeatedly called upon the speaker of this house to bring this legislation to the floor so we could pass it here and send it to the president's desk but you know what we got nothing it was only until an attempt was actually made on the life of justice kavanaugh that the speaker finally gave in she finally brought that legislation to the floor so that we could push back against the angry mobs madam speaker the leadership of this body has another opportunity before them today to once again push back against the mob this has gotten out of hand radical leftists were emboldened by the inaction of this body in the aftermath of the leaked opinion and now they've targeted their violence against the very groups that care for women and their unborn children in their most vulnerable moments it's unconscionable here's a short list of some examples on may 3rd 2022 individuals vandalized the care net pregnancy center in frederick maryland with pro-abortion graffiti including the messages not

countless women over the years women's new life clinic is doing extraordinary work i'm proud to call many of the leaders of that clinic personal friends they do not deserve the treatment that they've endured but they certainly deserve the support of the house of representatives in condemning violence from the radical left america's care pregnancy centers provide absolutely essential services in all 50 states there are 2 700 of these care pregnancy centers they serve millions of women every year they're supported by over 10 000 medical professionals i used to serve as legal counsel to a number of these groups i'm telling you this from personal experience madam speaker i can go on all day with these examples i'll spare you i would assume that you recognize the obvious when will this body stand up against the mob when will we restore law and order you know chuck schumer stood on the on the the steps of the supreme court itself infamously called out justices kavanaugh and gorsuch by name said they would we would release the whirlwind well here it is this shouldn't surprise us i'll tell you madam speaker our side is ready to act we're ready to do something we have an obligation and responsibility to do it i urge a no vote on the previous question and i yield back the balance of our time of my time you

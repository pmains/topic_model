congresswoman welcome to tmz live thank you for having me and thank you for bringing attention to this gruesome horrific but important issue this waste of taxpayer money that we're sending overseas to murder these puppies and it's disgusting and if this is the one thing that can bring people together republicans and democrats i led this letter on friday and had 24 two dozen colleagues of mine sign on to it for both sides of the aisle we have a lot of questions and we are demanding answers from dr fauci it's a total freak show right now so i wonder about this so he is not the head of the nih um head of their immuno yeah i'm just wondering where his role is in the nih vis-a-vis this experiment right well there's also another agency where this letter was also directed to the niaid which is also under the nih um is the leader i mean we see dr felchi all over the news almost every single day leading the nih effort leading our effort against covid19 and this is just when we talk about animal experiments because you would never do this in the u.s right that's why they send this our money overseas to these experiments but it's not just the the neck up you know eating beagles alive with insects that's that half a million dollars was spent on that it was 1.7 million spent to kill the 44 beagle puppies they debarked them they drugged them they killed them and then they dissected them but there are all sorts of animal experiments this money's being used for we're getting mice addicted to cocaine we're having beagles eaten alive from the neck up we are frightening monkeys this is not the purpose of american money we shouldn't be spending them on these horrible and gruesome animal experiments the thing that really gets me here is that there has been a real movement in the united states to stop doing these cruel awful experiments on animals and you know forgive me i don't know how else to say this it feels a little diabolical that we're kind of secretly funding these these studies overseas right because it's more under the radar no one's looking in tunisia to see where the nih money is going no one's looking at no one knows right we found out about this from the white coast code waste project and then i sent the letter out on friday but you can see by the hundreds of thousands of of social media posts millions even probably today people are enraged about this that their tax money these are republicans and democrats alike are enraged about the abuses that they're that are happening to animals with their money this is unnecessary it's not helping us get through covid for sure and uh it's a wasteful and abusive use of money so congresswoman i i know you're waiting to hear from dr fauci i'm just wondering if you've also sent this demand to uh dr collins who is the who is actually the the head of the nih director of the nih and warren if you heard anything from his office not yet that'll be a good next step depending on what dr fauci how he responds he should respond to this letter uh as someone who oversees a lot of the funding and spending at nih i do expect to hear from them if we don't then we'll reach out to others as well this is a first step i i once i've learned about other experiments i'm going to have more questions about how this money is being used to harm animals elsewhere in the world with our money you know this seems horrendous on its face um but does this bleed into covid and the way the nih has handled kovitt in your opinion or do you see this as two separate issues i i think the two things are separate i do think the way that we communicate about covid19 has been horrific the way the federal government uh has used selective science right so if you're if you're if you've had copin 19 for example you're about 27 times more protected than someone who's not had it and is vaccinated but we treat people with natural immunity versus those who've been vaccinated very differently um and so i think that the are a lot of frustrations from people on both sides now people who want you vaccinated or not et cetera because of the selective science but the two are separate in my opinion okay well we hope that you can get some answers uh obviously these photos and reading about what this study what was done in this study is alarming and like you said if there are other studies like this that are being done uh there should be answers that the nih should answer for this absolutely and if this is what brings the american people together i'm here for it fair enough all right congresswoman thank you so much for the time we really appreciate it of course thank you thanks again

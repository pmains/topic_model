uh thank you chairman casey and ranking member scott for the opportunity to be here today the south carolina department of mental health is a comprehensive statewide health system that is comprised of 16 mental health centers that cover the entire state and provide whole person care meaning that we are focused on both the physical and mental health care of our patients we work in concert with federally qualified health centers health systems as well as non-traditional locations of service including schools churches and other community partners additionally we operate two freestanding psychiatric hospitals an inpatient substance treatment facility and five veterans nursing homes like all states south carolina has seen an increase in the number of individuals seeking care throughout the pandemic the two populations of greatest increase are the youth and the elderly we have identified several reasons for this increased service need first social isolation has had an incredible impact on our elderly population the activities that seniors in south carolina often find helpful such as attending religious services going to day programs among other community services have been unavailable during the pandemic secondly is a sense of loss that has been experienced over a million americans have died from covet or its complications greater than 75 of those covet deaths were among individuals ages 65 and older the majority of elderly individuals have experienced at least one personal loss over the past two years further complicating issues that in many programs serving the elderly have shut down or moved to virtual platforms during the pandemic the expansion of telehealth has been able to fill this void scdmh the department of mental health of cares for approximately 100 000 individuals yearly 20 of those individuals are older than age 55. in april 2020 the department moved all of our services and telephonically within two months we had contacted 99.9 percent of all the patients that we were seeing pre-pandemic part of the reason is that we have been successfully shifting telehealth over the course of 20 years and is now the largest telehealth provider in the state of south carolina additionally because we're a unified service delivery system we're able to track centrally all of our services that are being delivered throughout the system and move assets as needed telehealth has certainly not been a panacea as many of our patients live in areas of limited broadband coverage or do not have devices that adequately provide care or cellular plans that afford them the opportunity to connect full-time thankfully we are now fully operational and able to provide telemedicine as well as in-person care we have found that our elderly population has adjusted very well to these changes the challenges for providing care among aging populations are numerous one of the biggest challenges has been an increase in substance use during the pandemic since federal funding for substance use and mental health care are often split at the federal level developing programs that address these co-occurring issues is often difficult and challenging secondly many organizations do not provide both mental health and medical services in the same location as a result many older americans have to visit multiple locations in order to obtain services each additional visit increases the likelihood that they will not obtain services or will drop out of services there are several areas where south carolina has done an exemplary job we have developed excellent partnerships with law enforcement to make sure that officers are provided the skills needed to identify and manage services in a mental health crisis we have also increased our crisis intervention teams where individuals are able to provide mental health care to the extent possible south carolina has been very committed to increasing services to our veteran population the state has worked closely with the department of veterans affairs to increase the number of veterans nursing homes in south carolina the blending of state funding and federal funding has allowed us to expand and make a difference i appreciate the opportunity to appear before the committee today and i am proud to lead the 4 300 individuals at the south county department of mental health who strive each day to provide both physical and mental health care to all south carolinians thank you

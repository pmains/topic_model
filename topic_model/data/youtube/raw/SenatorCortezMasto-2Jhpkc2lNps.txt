and mr. president I stand today in support of my colleague from Maryland as the 36th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment I couldn't agree more I think it's time to eradicate discrimination of any kind so I mend my colleague for standing up today in his comments I stand up today to talk about an issue that continues in our communities and it's the issue of housing discrimination I recently read an article from the Center for Investigative Journalism about a young woman named Michelle at the time Rochelle was in her early 30s and living in Philadelphia she was making $60,000 a year as a contractor at Rutgers University she had savings good credit and an undergraduate degree from Northwestern when she first went to apply for a home loan she thought she would be the perfect applicant on paper it seemed that way but a few weeks later she received an email informing her that her application had been denied in the email her broker told her that because she was a contractor not a full-time employee her application was too risky for the bank to approve she was at a loss she had been planning to purchase a home for years and thought she had done everything right she then asked her partner Hanako to sign on to the application with her now at the time hinako was working a few hours a week at the grocery store making three hundred dollars a month that's about $3,600 a year hinako tried calling the bank to speak to a loan officer about the application and to Rachelle's surprise the loan officer picked up he was attentive and helpful and friendly to hinako a few weeks later he approved the couple's loan now this makes no sense right Rochelle was the one making an income in the upper five figures $60,000 a year she was the one with good credit and she was the one paying for hinako's health insurance the difference here was that Rochelle is black this story did not take place in 1930 when it was legal for housing lenders to discriminate on the basis of race and it did not take place in 1968 the year that banks were formally banned from using race as a factor in deciding home loan applications it took place less than two years ago in 2016 today fifty years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act stories like Rachelle's are all too common for any person of color who has tried to navigate the housing market Rachelle's experience is a case of deja vu we now know that Rochelle was the victim of redlining redlining is a term that describes the practice of denying goods or services to people on the basis of the color of their skin the term originated in the 1930s when redlining was the official policy of the Federal Housing Administration back then federal officials divvied up cities and assigned a color to each neighborhood the color system was supposed to help mortgage lenders know where to invest green and blue neighborhoods were home to desirable borrowers with good credit yellow or red meant risky borrowers live here so don't invest the practice became known as redlining because the FHA would draw red lines on city maps to designate quote-unquote bad neighborhoods for the FHA a bad neighborhood was but defined by the color of your skin now redlining was banned in the 1960s but as we learned from stories like Rachelle's the practice still goes on under the radar so much though so that in 1975 Congress passed the Housing Mortgage Disclosure Act to help regulators identify when it was going on but even with the new requirements redlining continued then in the 1990s the financial industry began selling a thing called the subprime loan subprime loans have high fees adjustable interest rates and payment shocks characteristics that made them extremely dangerous people who weren't approved for traditional loans were offered subprime loans said in 2008 when the markets crashed subprime loan holder saw their interest rates skyrocket they suddenly became unable to afford to stay in their homes and who do you think was most likely to hold one of these so-called subprime mortgages people living in red lined neighborhoods people of color people who had been denied access to traditional loans my home state of Nevada was one of the hardest hit states in the country by the financial crisis we had the highest foreclosure rate for 62 straight months we had the most number of underwater mortgages and over 219 thousand families lost their homes anyone driving through parts of Las Vegas and Reno in 2009 could see boarded up houses for sale signs and empty lots everywhere on many streets you would see more houses in foreclosure than not and while all neighborhoods suffered African American Latino and Asian Pacific Islander communities were hit the hardest entire neighbors my neighbor hoods were hollowed out trillions of dollars were lost I was the Attorney General of Nevada at this time we did everything we could to fight for homeowners and help them stay in their homes and this was going on and as it was going on I asked myself how could this happen the federal government was supposed to regulate these banks where were they why didn't they put a stop to these practices before it all came crashing down the federal government was supposed to be the watchdog but they were letting banks write their own rules as Attorney General of Nevada I sued the big banks for their fraudulent practices and secured over 1.9 billion dollars to help homeowners in my state and then in 2010 federal lawmakers passed the dodd-frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to ensure that what we saw in 2008 would never happen again the bill was not perfect but it did a lot of things right it's strengthened oversight of the big banks it made the big banks undergo stress tests and develop bankruptcy plans and it also strengthened HMDA the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act it strengthened the reporting requirements to help regulators fight back against discriminatory racist redlining practices banks say they don't treat borrows differently but the data shows us that's a different story redlining remains a major problem for communities of color the legislation we're now considering s 21:55 would roll back Wall Street Reform it includes a section section 104 that would repeal many of the reporting requirements we added after the financial crisis to prevent housing discrimination some rural and low income census tracts are predominantly served by small lenders if this specific loan data is removed for them government officials researchers and the public will not have information on the quality of loans made nor will they know about the credit scores of the borrowers or even a way to easily track the loans after they are sold to an investor when I was at Ernie General I needed the information on the quality of the loans in the state to protect consumers with what were the teaser rates and what were they were set what was the reset who were the homeowners who might not be ready to pay twenty thousand more on their monthly mortgages these were the questions I had with no data with everything we saw ten years ago I cannot now believe that we're considering restricting access to this kind of data the kind of data that is important to prevent housing discrimination I've seen what happens when you don't have strong enough protections against housing discrimination this is why I've introduced an amendment to strike section 104 to preserve access to data we need with better information and protections we could have prevented a crisis in which twelve million people lost their jobs in which the banks took the homes of more than 7 million people let's not take away access to this information let's not make this mistakes that we made ten years ago and so I urge my colleagues join me vote for fairness vote for equality vote for inclusion vote for everyone who got burned by the big stake big banks vote for folks like Rochelle who just need a break who just need a fair mortgage loan so that they can buy their first home support my amendment to prevent loan and housing discrimination to protect that access to data to protect the progress that we made under Wall Street Reform

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to with a call of my action to make sure that the country recognizes that we have got to focus on and talk about the more than 20 million people at risk of famine in South Sudan Somalia Yemen and Northeast Nigeria this is a humanitarian crisis starving children and families are crying out for our help right now 1.4 million children are acutely malnourished and at risk of death worldwide and additional 50 million people are severely hungry surviving day to day on only what they can find the United Nations is calling this the largest humanitarian crisis that has faced the world since the organization was founded in 1945 but Mr Speaker we can end this crisis if we just find a political will that's why I'm joining my colleagues in Congress and humanitarian and faith leaders around the country to mark a global week of action on hunger and famine earlier this month we were successful in securing an additional nine hundred and ninety million dollars for famine relief in the fiscal year 2017 spending bill thanks to a bipartisan coalition of members and our passionate grassroots organizations but this is not enough the United Nations needs for four billion by July to avert catastrophe we need other countries to step up to the plate and we must absolutely preserve our commitment to addressing famine we cannot allow the Trump administration's proposed budget which would decimate food aid to be enacted

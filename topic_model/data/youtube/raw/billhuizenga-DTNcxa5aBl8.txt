uh thank you mr speaker and to my colleague from uh puerto rico i appreciate the opportunity to be up here uh mr speaker in the the bits of a divided washington dc it's important that congress comes together to prioritize the protection of the great lakes as co-chair of the bipartisan great lakes task force building bipartisan consensus that preserves the great lakes strengthens the their economy and protects them for future generations has been one of my top priorities while environment while the environmental sensitivity index maps may not be the headline grabbing legislation that we're sometimes used to these maps are critical to the communities across the great lakes system we must have accurate assessments of coastal resources that are at risk of severe damage from an emergency or natural disaster these environmental assessments include information on endangered and threatened species vulnerable shorelines and widely used community resource resources such as beaches parks and boat ramps the maps are vital to disaster planning as well as recovery research and restoration efforts it is essential that we have an accurate representation of vulnerable locations in areas in the great lakes that are in need of protection in the event of an emergency while maps for the east coast the west coast and the gulf coast have all been updated recently maps for the great lakes have not been updated in over 20 years to be clear while the great lakes holds over 20 percent of the world's fresh water providing drinking water to more than 48 million people it supports over 1.3 million jobs and generates billions upon billions of dollars in economic activity yet as i stated before our region hasn't had a proper environmental map update in more than two decades this legislation which i'm a proud co-sponsor would solve this problem by modernizing and updating our maps of the great lakes along lake michigan and throughout the great lakes shoreline the current state of erosion and high water damage is at a crisis point in my district along the shores of lake michigan the high water levels are threatening not only people's homes and public infrastructure but the overall ecology and the economy of the great lakes communities throughout the region have declared states of emergencies as roads bridges harbors and wastewater treatment facilities just to name a few are in danger due to these high water levels as we continue to see disasters and emergencies in the great lakes region government at all levels must be prepared and have up-to-date information to act upon this bipartisan bill would accomplish that while demonstrating another way my michigan colleagues and i and really all of us from the great lakes region are making sure the federal government prioritizes and protects and pro the prison and preserves the great lakes whether it is responding to rapidly involving events such as natural disaster or planning long-term projects such as habitat restoration we need to have reliable and accurate information available to all the players when it comes to protecting our lakes habitats and shorelines these updated maps will allow us to better prepare to face natural disasters or emergencies may i request a number 30 seconds let's yield two more minutes to the gentleman the gentleman is recognized for this for two minutes uh thank you mr speaker well having this updated information will help us analyze and assess the threats facing the great lakes and allow us to be more proactive instead of a hundred percent reactive the great lakes are a way of life for many of us in west michigan and throughout the great lakes system and these pristine resources help define who we are as a community and a people i will continue to work support and advocate for common sense reforms like today's legislation that will protect these incredible natural resources for generations to come and i do want to thank my fellow colleagues who have been working on this mr kildy from michigan mr joyce from ohio the the rest of the great lakes task force uh this has been a great true bipartisan success story as we've looked at increasing funding for protecting the great lakes through the great lakes uh restoration initiative the glri as well as initiatives like this and with that mr speaker i yield

together tonight for national Bible Week over the weekend I finished reading through the Bible in a year and I can testify it's been the best year of my life in giving me perspective and quiet confidence for every day reminding me to lead with love the Bible says to love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you the Word of God is the source of love joy peace patience kindness goodness self-control everything that we long for in life is found in the Word of God the Bible so why haven't I been more faithful to read the Bible every day earlier in my life because like a lot of people I didn't always feel like I had enough time or I struggled to relate to the language so I read the Bible why wake up 15 minutes early each day why go to all that trouble that was my struggle for many many years the Bible says in Psalm 90 12 teach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom Psalm 103 says our days are few and brief like grass like flowers blown by the wind and gone forever yet the Word of God endures forever it's the Bible that provides us answers to our questions about life more than any other book seminar or self-help program the Bible offer also offers words of encouragement and hope at a time when despair has come over our country we have records suicides a million people in America attempted suicide last year 47,000 committed suicide I grieve this loss the deaths of despair skyrocketing suicide drug overdoses opioids alcohol and drug abuse people are giving up on life the Bible says in Matthew that not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your father knowing it and the very hairs on your head are numbered so don't be afraid you are more valuable to God we need the truths and the wisdom of the Bible proverbs 12:18 says careless words stab like a sword but wise words bring healing as I begin a second year of taking 15 minutes a day to read the Bible and then pray I would invite each one of you to join me let's do it together let's agree that it cannot be business as usual let's see what God could do on Capitol Hill through members and staff who daily walked the halls of Congress Democrats and Republicans House and Senate men and women if we all read through the Bible in 2020 I'm convinced the Democrats can't fix it the Republicans can't fix it only God can fix it my daily prayer is second Chronicles 7:14 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and forgive their sin and heal their land Lord God heal our land may you bring order out of chaos lift the heaviness of misery and despair and busyness and remind us that you are with us and everything that we do and I'll yield back to my colleagues thank you I thank the gentlelady for her words of wisdom and her personal experience and for being here tonight

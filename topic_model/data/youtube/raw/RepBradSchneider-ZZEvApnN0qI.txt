Claudia piccolo of the family Dell care in Waukegan Ernesto Romero CEO of green world copier and supplies as well as his colleague Marvin Morales and Andres we're at the Turner acceptance corporation thanks to each of you for joining us this morning I look forward to having our discussion our discussion today will focus on the distinct challenges small businesses are facing in dealing with the koban pandemic and in particular issues comments latino-owned businesses will also come recover some of the resources available to help our small businesses through this crisis the coab in nineteen pandemic that hasn't been easy for any small business but we know that Latino owned small businesses have additional barriers for example they're receiving less benefit from federal stimulus programs and other businesses in fact while half of all small businesses reported receiving support through the PPP program only twelve percent of black and Latino businesses owners polled between April thirtieth and May 12th and received any funding had we seen the total funding they requested about one-quarter had received early some of the funding furthermore we know that minorities are suffering from this pandemic at higher rates than white people on Sunday last Sunday the New York Times published data that demonstrated what many of us have already suspected Latino and african-american residents in the United States have been three times as likely to become infected as their white neighbors and black and Latino people have been nearly twice as likely to die from the virus as white people the data shows I believe it's important that we understand the roots of these disparities and work at all levels local state and federal to close the gaps Congress has taken a number of actions to help individuals and small businesses in the Cova 19 pandemic including the paycheck protection program forgivable loans to small businesses administered through banks to keep employees on the payroll the economic injury disaster loans working capital loans administered through the SBA and expanded UI unemployment insurance increase unemployment payments by $600 leak and we made more people well including gig workers in the self-employed and direct assistance $1200 payments to Americans earning up to $75,000 taping tapering out up to 999 thousand dollars these programs have had a great impact but they haven't reached everybody who needs help and many of the programs are set to expire this month it's clear that pandemic is going to be wreaking havoc in our country and the world for months to come we have to do more to ensure all Americans have the resources they need to make it through we understand the urgency in the House of Representatives on May 15th the House passed the heroes Act this three book trillion dollar package would provide desperately needed additional assistance to state and local governments to schools and students to small businesses and the people still unable to work and as we look to the election in November the heroes Act also would invest 3.6 million dollars in election security so that every American can safely cast their vote and be confident in the integrity of the outcome of the election it's been eight weeks since we sent the heroes Act to the Senate to date Mitch McConnell has refused even to have a debate on the bill or offer alternative ideas on how to help our country at a time of need I hope in the days ahead we'll have the chance to hear and we can start to craft the real solutions that we all challenge to the challenges we all face so with that let me now turn it to our guests I'll introduce each one and let them have some time to make Reap remarks and then we'll have time for questions against remind people use the chat function or use the Q&A function if you have a question and I'll start with a sunny steamer she is executive director of the Lake County Chamber of Commerce since December 2019 as well as the Buffalo Grove Lincoln cherry chamber this is actually her second tour as executive director at the Lake County Chamber I've been previously served in the position from 2011 to 2013 believe it or not Shanice has 30 years of marketing and public relations experience and nonprofit commercial arenas she also served in the Lake County Community Foundation board the Lake County Partners micro loan committee and the North Chicago City Council welcome Sinise were so glad to have you here thank you very much congressman Schneider and good morning to everyone once the encouraged from Schneider thank you so much for this invitation to join you today I'm so pleased to be able to share information about the Lake County Chamber of Commerce the Lake County Chamber founded in 1915 has been serving businesses throughout Lake County for it's actually a hundred and five years at this point one of the one of the benefit so that the lake Kai chamber once again is that we service businesses throughout Lake County as opposed to the Chamber's that support support municipal areas I can tell you you know with everything happened relative to Cove at 19 it really made a change for us I would say back in March when all of this was announced it was kind of drastic we were very active with offering I'm regular networking events early-bird networking after-hours networking women's lunches lunch and learns on a wide level of topics and of course all of that had to be backtracked a little you know at the turn of the new year for the most part I'm back in November we will relocate it into a new space of almost 2,400 square feet which would allow us to host luncheons and dinner event with almost 160 people and as a board actually outlined a complete strategic plan for the entire year we were ready to kick off you know coming in March you know right after our new member orientation and I think it was the day before um Governor Pritzker made the announced that we had actually scheduled a luncheon that was to take place and you know we did wasn't supposed to take place with less with more than 50 people but as we turn the corner so we based on that event we immediately made some changes in order to offer virtual programming to members so starting in March we we were already set up I'm pretty much with zoom we produced our first online virtual programming in March as a way to expand our connection to members that we knew that we could no longer connect with so throughout March April May and June we did video programming I think that was you know the crux for us to just basically stay connected with members it was a perfect opportunity to take a look at what was happening also on the federal because realistically all businesses whereas we are closed and down you know where's the funding going to come from so we immediately started with our first programming was a complete follow up on the cares Act and all that entails we followed that up with a another 30 minute program on PPP funding on how that works and of course by the time that program actually aired the money was gone so the next day I put out another notice saying they're going to put I think another 360 billion back into the program stay tuned get your application ready so we were very upfront with with giving information on funding putting an application out there and we felt that was very important at this point just to keep members on what it could be taken care of at this time one of our recent programs that we did relative to our virtual programming first of all we started with the youth program because then it come up that with everyone and what everyone was going through there was concerns about our youth and what what their concerns were so we produced a program called youth and the coronavirus getting the point across and we were lucky enough to have that program be expanded to air on Comcast and that program it actually aired on 7 different times on 47 different stations 47 different cities throughout Lake County and so we continue to follow that with additional programming most recently we did one we interviewed Lake County Board Chairman sandy Hart after the federal government announced that they were giving counties with over 500,000 residents on funding to support their area and Lake County Board announced that they had received 221 million dollars and the county but wanted to take a look at how they can begin to you know outline the use of those dollars considering the fact that the funding had to be allocated by December of 2020 so in that program of a chairman Hart outlined all of the different levels of funding in addition to the one I'm going to talk about today which is a 10 million for businesses but there's a lot of funds that are out there and available for communities and Families that program can be seen on our website at Lake County Chamber com also we've also connected with Comcast once again to promote these programs and on seven nights which actually started last night you can see this interview with the county chair on 78 cities throughout Lake County so if you have Comcast I'm just watching the evening programming so you can hear more about the other dollars because in addition to the 221 million 200 and 122 million there are a lot more dollars at the Lake County as putting out north to health residents in addition to that that partnership we are actually still looking forward to providing programming and additionally keeping members informed on relative funding which is what we've been doing we have recently announced our return to doing online virtual networking with businesses so if you don't have you're not connected please give us a call at our office I'm eight four seven two four nine 3800 or I look at our website and now I'd like to talk a little bit about the ten million that's coming from the lake county board as I mentioned with the 122 million ten million from the board has been allocated for small businesses it's called the Lake County small business assistant Cove it 19 grant it launched July 7th and applications will be accepted due July 20th so if anyone's interested you can go to like website what Lake County Board Chair did she coordinated a committee a strategic committee to kind of identify how funds would be distributed throughout Lake County I serve on that committee it's called Lake County forward and we took a look at the number of funds that are available and how it would best for us to allocate the 10 million to businesses in Lake County once again this 10 million I want to stress as a grant not alone if you would call with the PPP and the e IDL those are pretty much loan based this these are a grant so it's not going through a bank I'm it's actually being held I'm handled at the primary level with Lake County partners who will be I'm accepting on the application and coordinating them with an Side agency that's going to review them and once again these funds are slated to be distributed very early because funds have to be dispensed by December just a little bit about the grant it covers for the maximum it caps at 30,000 for people that are interested in that low and that that grant for example covers four and a half times the average monthly rent payroll utility a roll utility is inventory and kovat 19 related expenses if businesses need to have extensive office cleaning or need the PPD material mask cleaning service and supplies it covers all of that the priority will be given to businesses that did not receive the PPP or the Eid alone and of course these businesses do need to be located within Lake County and their annual revenue needs to be less than 2.5 million on one trade the county has approved these funds and it and has indicated if necessary they may consider an allocation of a second round so if anyone is interested please take advantage of funds are available at this time good thanks Denise anot it's important it's wonderful that Lake County's doing that and as you noted it is a grant I will add that the IDL is economic injury disaster loans as the ten thousand up to $10,000 grant aspect to it and the Paycheck protection program PPP is a loan but it's a forgivable loan with quality so thank you I won't turn out how long Paula winder she's the cheerdance panic chamber of Lake County Paula

I'm now going to turn it to an ester room Romero and Marvin Morales Ernesto is the founder and CEO of green world copier supplies business specializing in rebuilding refurbishing top-tier equipment while also supporting environmental sustainability by keeping printing equipment out of landfills GreenWorld copiers have started 2016 before their arnesto ran an accounting firm to focus on small business and self-employed people and that's though at Marvin I'm turning it over to you hi everyone my name is a nice time working as a CEO this group dream world copied and supplies I work I start working two years ago on this great company we buy original copy machines and I invite the president of the company Marvin Morales to join this meeting to talking more about the company oh good good morning morning braless um you know immigrated from Guatemala but thirty years ago leave and working what kind of my life I you know loved up lay coffee I'm very proud of our state um I'm a little bit concerned concerned about the way you know our whole politicians and politics and the way our country goes we had a you know 30 people thing is the word for us and with this situation and not having a clear guidance now for like oh no I believe our governor is doing a great job but from the federal government or how the procedure is you know a simple thing is wearing a mask you know where we going is there something then these states can do sending our kids back to school you know I am NOT gonna be safe sending my batter to school you know how that's gonna affect everything and is there you know the president saying something and our governor say something am I feeling safe to say Mike is to school you know as courses are one of our business partners where do a lot are they gonna have enough funds to continue doing business as normal I have all this question that keeps dragging me and taking me away from my normal life I would like to see if no congressman can help us given us some guidance it's our governor has the right to decide those schools if opening in Illinois or those depressing has the right to take you guys hoping because I say so I mean where we stand and our discos gonna have enough funding to keep operating you know we service them a lot we pick up their you know off lease equipment we sell them a lot of consumables which you know schools are one of the main businesses them print a lot which you know in a direct way affect us and I think the would like to know where we are where we stand what the losses are we you know if they're governor gonna protect us from having to school enough onto our the governor gonna keep the schools closed or open and if you can give us an insight or what the procedure is yeah Marvin great questions I wish I had precise answers I think I share your frustration is there's so many other people I'll talk about in QA we do next week I'm on the Small Business Committee we do have a number of hearings including next Friday a hearing with the SBA administrator Carranza and Secretary of Treasury munition and in that context one of the things we've been asking them for consistently is clear clear and consistent guidance right they say one thing today do everything tomorrow that's within the business context you touch them on it in a much more broader context we've seen it with you know opening schools I think you touched you hit a really important point it's not just that parents need to know that their kids are going to have a safe place to go and study and that's the ability but it's the teachers it's the lunchroom workers the attendants but also all the people who supply to those schools need it's going on it has a full cascading effect to our economy so one of the things I'm hope and we'll talk about it more later what I hope you can get to is how do we create this stable environment so that as individuals we have an idea of what we're supposed to do let me use this as my commercial for the three w's we're a mass wash your hands watch your distance we all need to do that but winkin the more we do that the more confidence we can have in opening our schools opening our businesses and making sure everybody is safe so thank you for that I really appreciate it and speaking of masks I'm going to turn to dr. Claudia piccolo who's at work as she speaks to us now and is a board-certified dentist practicing with family dental care in Waukegan dr. piccolo is a member of the major dental associations in our country including the American doll Association Chicago down Society in the American Academy and facial aesthetics among others dr. piccolo graduated as a general dentist University of Illinois in Chicago College of Dentistry has a fellowship in dental implants and is additional in as it and is additionally certified in facial pain and aesthetics dr. piccolo so thank you so much for joining us I'll turn it over to you um good morning everyone and I wanted to send you all best wishes that do you want your loved ones are safe and healthy and thank you for your invitation so my husband dr. Jose Vidya and I play the piccolo we have two offices we have one in Waukegan and the other one in Chicago dr. video went on to open his first practice saying what he owned in 1990 and 1991 in Chicago so we are offering the latest technology our safety and the patients and stuff safety is our priority sorry I don't know if you can hear me well we hear you great hard to breathe yeah I can imagine so one of the biggest challenges is to you know we're using our protective equipment the PPE we have to invest in a lot of equipment for ventilation for extra aura suction because we need to deal with aerosols so those are our biggest challenges of course finding the right team it's hard to find people who want to come back to work so those are some of our biggest challenges our safety our patient safety and our staff is our priority great thank you and you touch on a number of things all of us when we go back to work we're going to deal with contacting people but no group more so than perhaps Dennis or right dealing with people in their mouths the aerosol is just to remind folks aerosols are when we breathe easy example the thing of it is in the winter when you see that steam coming out of your mouth every time we breathe we exhale that and this virus is transmitted in that exhalation to the greatest extent but you touched on you know people have been putting off dental appointments you know whether it is a cavity or a need for a just even a cleaning to ensure we have healthy teeth it's an important aspect of our overall healthcare and again I want to emphasize we we know from the national studies but also in Lake County the Latino community has been significantly faced a significant greater risk of infection than the community and large in Lake County eight times and the need to wear a mask and have that infective gear not just when you're working especially in your work doctor outfit glow but when you go outside and when we can't have that social distancing it's really important so thank you so much but let me turn to our mouths we could be free other questions Andres with us is chief learning and marketing officer at Turner acceptance corporation his worked on responsible lending branch operations marketing strategy and implementation and credit underwriting at Turner acceptance corporation since 2001 he studied at the Wharton School of Business and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has published articles and leading industry publications about auto consumer financing already turned over to you Thank You Brad thank you for the invitation to the chamber and I think that you know Turner has been in business since 1973 and I think we were not in the finance business with were in the business of transforming people's lives for the better I think that every time that a customer is successful we were successful and discipline Deming has brought incredible challenge to us we were basically branch centric he like you know consumer interactions we have a lot of Hispanic customers that have been hit really hard and actually during this pandemic we have been able to work with most of our customers even with pain with some sort of payment forgiveness or payment deferments and we have been able to touch a lot of our customers and see actually the real impact of the ODA pandemic we have a branching in Waukegan that we have been operating for for some years now unfortunately this branch right now is temporary closed for safety reasons that doesn't mean that we were served in the community and actually something that the pandemic did was positive for us it really moves in the right direction or together with legislators local legislators in order to start providing more services online so now our customers can apply online and then they also they can get their loans online and they can restructure and work with our with our company all from the couch one of the things we have most of our employees now are working remotely you guys see you know I I mean my home all fees are low so most of our employees so in that sense we have been able to participate in in some helps and we have been able to help a lot of customers still the pandemic is a big concern for us we see that a lot of customers especially Hispanics are being hit hard because those were the ones making things happen in the community working in restaurants working construction you know taking care of customers and this has been kind of our main concerns about it what's gonna happen next you know how we can get how we can help them how we can be in touch with them and have them not to lose hope fortunately for us you know our company also have had a decrease in business a substantial decrease in business because we do a lot of outer lending things that we have been able to remain open so this a lot of construction Hispanics that were in construction that cannot get loans cannot get finance we've been able to finance a lot of these customers and we were very pleased and we were very thankful that we we continue to help the community you know we just deploy a system where we can automate a lot of the steps that customers needed to do to get access to to financing so and dee has been really a big hit with some of the dealer partners that we work and even with customers even though we're really in a service where we help customer the never bought a car to get them through the process of getting their first cars financed you know because not only that you know there is a lot of needs in our community for those services that is not only about lending but about transforming people's lives and we hope that this fund aiming you know pass fast so we can it we are able to help more and more customers great well thank you and thanks for what you're doing again thanks everyone for your comments this is wonderful I'm gonna start with a really broad question Sao Paulo and Shanice as I understand access to capital is transformative and no one saw this pandemic coming a year ago you know last summer I think people were investing into businesses think economy was growing and suddenly it's like flying a plane into the mountain you stopped rather suddenly the PPP program was intended to help people bridge a period from the members of the the two chambers what you heard from your members about how that that PPP program and the idle program as well helped and what challenges are people concerned about especially within and all brothers everybody within the Latino community businesses that are just you know oftentimes not it don't have as much capital may not have as much history as other businesses so basically the at the beginning of the implementation of the PPP loan one of the things that word is that they wanted to have the information if possible in Spanish and they a lot of the Hispanic community that needed the help we're trying to communicate through the banks and unfortunately the banks were sometimes taking the bigger clients and also sometimes where organizations kind of wanted to provide support but at the same time we're charging very high fees to help them to walk them through the process which in reality is a very simple process and they could go directly to get support then based on that I guess that it was it was hurt by the local governments and information I start coming in Spanish both English and Spanish to to provide this information I think that I was from the Hispanic perspective what some of that are concerns that that I've heard so nice so nice yes and that's actually just to add to you know everything apologist said you know I think at the beginning you like I said immediately the chamber was able to put it give out information I think the concerned at the beginning was that everyone was getting information from the television there wasn't there wasn't the feeling that there was a central office to call to get information at the same time all this happened people were dealing with unemployment not being at work and now businesses work we're trying to seek funding and there was the issue relative to you had an association with the bank that provided SBA loans that was that were that were part of the SBA that were providing the loans so I think like I said when we put out the information by the time all that information will get out there the first level of funds were gone which meant the information was distributed in such a way that certain businesses had access to primary information while others were just getting on board so it was really good that they extended the funds provided more funds but then when you start to get into the small print I think the issue came about from conversations I had with members that were calling number one access to the application realistically we found the application and instantly blasts here's the application they couldn't really talk to banks maybe there are some concerns that they couldn't that the phone call conversations weren't being had because the applications were going directly to portals so people felt like they really couldn't ask questions immediately and then it turned out there was a whole question when the first level of funds were sent and they were cut off people didn't know whether or not they should apply again or just wait so yeah I did the research and it basically said if you have application already in just let it sit and ride because when the funds open up you will be first in line it also came up with several conversations also within the african-american community is that when the applications were sent through because it was very clear that these were forgivable loans there was a question people were saying well why is my credit being checked so they were they were you know it was the understanding that it was a forgivable soak up of the government's providing the funds to businesses to help them out during this difficult time where they had to lay off the employees furlough their employees you know if you're checking the credit that means you're checking the creditworthiness whether or not you should give them the funds and I believe that somewhere along the line there may have been some businesses that didn't get funding because of that so when it comes down to this to the county and we're looking at the Small Business Assistance code 19 grant there are some documents that are going to be a provider and they're gonna be needed in order to get the funds but it we're not going to have that same level of price the whole idea is that we're gonna look at the needs of businesses and and look for ways to help them instead of determining whether or not you're you're that level of creditworthiness because realistically as we talked about it on Wake County for strategic committee we want to see business to survive we want to be able to help them as much as we can to remain in the county because we don't want in the next three or four months to see all these businesses closed down because they didn't apply for funds or because they didn't know about it or because they could not get them to help them survive these businesses have been a year and they've been in existence for five years to say at this point they're they're not credit worthy and that help them is not going to help Lake County as a whole so I think on the federal level there was there were those issues nothing that's why when they put out the other 30 billion a lot of people still didn't apply yeah you make a good point and not making excuses part of the whole process we were moving so quickly in March when they passed the care exactly we went Congress went through the SBA SBA went through the banks banks did what banks do which is to check credit we were trying to just get as much capital out there and he did I mean it's the Paycheck protection program the idea was to help the businesses keep their employees through this crisis and still encourage it's trying to do we learned a little bit so the first tranches you guys touched on in March it was 349 billion dollars in April there was an additional three hundred and ten billion dollars allocated to the PPP programs by the way there are still funds available and the program has been extended to August 7th so people can still apply that's an important thing to point out here but the difference between the two groups that first amount of money the average loan is more than $200,000 it was more sophisticated businesses Paulo you touched on it information wasn't readily available to the small mom-and-pop you know jack of all trades I know when I had my business I did everything I didn't have a person to sign for going and getting loans I would have had to do it myself that's like so many other small businesses in the second round of money that's me near 10 billion the average is dropped down to seven thousand over all the averages of now around $100,000 low that's the loan amount so we are doing a better job but we know we have to continue to improve as we continue to help our local businesses and let me ask the local businesses the three of you did any of you apply for a PPP loan or emergency our economic injury loan died alone government stimulus package uh we were able to you know practically keep most of our employees at the beginning they went they were collecting you know unemployment but then when we reopen we brought them back most of them they didn't want it to come back because they were getting more money uh from the unemployment you know stimulus so it was a little bit hard but now everybody wants to feed their families and there's a lot of emergencies and it helps us a lot but at the same time we have to invest in a lot of equipment a lot of safety protocols in order to keep us our staff and our patients safe we need to provide a dental health or a help there's a lot of infections that they can wound up in an emergency room and is life-threatening so it's important for us to continue that is taking a toll on on us our you know our health it's also compromising a little bit the keeping like the eight-hour hours in our office but actually we only can see less than half of what we were seeing before so hard we have to give not time to clean and all those things off sure I heard I heard the same thing not like death but as you may tell it I finally got a haircut after six months but I was talking to that person who cuts my hair and they were saying and there she's working eight hours a day but she's seeing happens any customers because there's so much cleaning they've staggered their time each person has two chairs that they're managing and they they work in one when that one's done they spray it down extensively with a disinfectant and go to the other one and they go back and forth but it's really tough so that does take a lot of money one of the things I want to try to help with small business committee to get Congress to pay attention to is providing assistance to our companies to to make those adjustments to make those changes in your office you're investing in more PPE we have to make sure it's ready so we need to supply chains are who can ensure that we have the the face mass and the shields and the gowns that are necessary but also that supplies for work yeah there's so much and that's the piece of it but the capital I'll be thinking about a manufacturing firm that had laid out their their manufacturing floor but now social distancing is gonna have to expand that floor so I want to be at least six feet apart it really can't change change everything Ernesto did your business apply for capital needs that you guys are facing yeah we applied for PPP program we get it Marvin was a little because everybody around us they say I get it again and we are the last I think but we we got a TV program and we applied for SBA disaster loan program something like that and we get to so I think so and our goal is is to make it easier how about you undress yes did your business yes our company had to do pee pee pee you know we have so we were able to to to sustain this standard independent even though you know since we do a lot of out of lending pretty much out of sales came to a crash in in Illinois when everything closed down right so we were able to repurpose you know some of our staff and in working with customers trying to do payment the Pharaoh refinancing stations working working with our customers I think that the main concern is like everybody says so we you know maintaining people people saves in the branches so we we had to do the plexiglas and actually some of the challenges now that we're seen during the reopening is some customers don't even want to come in into the branch and conduct transactions the leave was the payment or they leave some paper war they say hi they wave and they and they go they see people they're kind of little bit so we're requiring masks we are opening our branches on a limited capacity the most of the people is working from home now let me take a couple questions from our audience first one from Terry which I think the heroes Act says the PPP funds are not taxable but the Senate didn't pass it yet is there other legislation that Congress is working to ensure PPP isn't taxable Terry thanks for the question and you know just background and let me qualify that I'm not a tax expert if you have questions you should check with your accountant or tax advisers but the PPP forgiveness loan forgiveness does not create a taxable event so if you borrowed $100,000 and you use it to pay your employees follow up in the 60% for payroll and for your brother the hundred thousand dollars will not be taxed about it's not passive and income but at the moment and this is a treasury guidance not the intention of Congress the expenses you used that money for are not deductible so if you use a prepay role if you use it for supplies whatever normally you would deduct them the IRS or the Treasury Department said you cannot conduct that that was not the intention of Congress so as Terry mentioned in the heroes Act the House addressed that and said nobody should still be deductible expenses we are hoping that the Senate will pick this up and we'll have some legislation this month to take care of that however until now is taken care of there is this contradictory position of the of the Treasury Department so you should check with your accountant now the next question Brian asks is thanks for mentioning Lake County small business program is there one for Cook County am i understanding in Chinese or Paulo you may jump in there is there was one for Cook County but the deadline it has passed is that correct I can I can tell you absolutely there were there are I would say a lot more funds that I read about that were available to businesses and Cook County relative to their population so once the federal government gave it to all um counties that had over five hundred thousand but because of the number of people that are in Cook County they received a much larger allotment of dollars realistically I mean I wasn't aware of the deadline but I read that they had so many other loans and grants that were available if you just kind of take a look at the governor's website and I'm actually DCEO Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity they recently took over as a primary lead on distribution of funds through all areas but in Cook County they were noting a lot of those dollars right and they have a big program and when I say big program 500 million to big but it's also the name of the program the business interruption grant program that's through Dec Oh Illinois gov and there'll be multiple application rounds on that that program as well the Illinois treasurer's office I believe has a 500 million dollar loan program for small business and you can visit the website there kill annoy treasure god I think that's worth repeating so statewide business integrated business interruption grant a big program decl anoint gov or the treasurer's office Illinois treasurer are a couple of big ones so thanks for that let me go a general question is for anyone on the panel you know the the programs we passed PPP was supposed to expire June 30th it's been extended to August 7th with the additional funds the hero's grant heroes Act would extend some things through the end of the year like unemployment insurance but we know as I said in my opening remarks we know this virus isn't going away see the spikes yesterday I think United States at 65,000 confirmed cases places like Florida Texas Arizona are having them the experience that we were suffering in in April and May here in Illinois I pray that we don't have a second spike but I also believe in the motto you prepare for the worst and hope for the best so I'll hope hope that we don't go there but if there is a second spike what are some of the challenges that you as business owner owners are thinking about and why Congress help and then Chinese and Paula what in a broader sense might Congress do so I'll throw it open yeah Ernesto maybe you first me about it those programs I was checking they you're talking about the end 8:30 looks like looking forward is you think about the fall what are the things that keep you up at night for the fall Marvin talked about you have a lot of school customers what are their needs gonna be but are there any other challenges that you're thinking about we should be aware of actually we have another challenges and another thing is we exported so many consumables and coffee machines to a lot of countries and other countries and clothes now the point is that we have so many pallets of coffee machines and consumables waiting for open government like Colombia Mexico Guatemala Salvador because we can send them because they they are close so we are we are waiting that for this situation we have less cells to on exportation because we can send up those are those consumables to them so that's another big big challenge for us great point and we should I'll take that back with me to my colleagues we should be saying how we hope reopen our export markets that's gonna be a really crucial piece of things so thank you dr. piccolo what about you things that you're thinking about the fall which should be aware I'm sorry are there things you're worried about in the fall as you're looking the next three months six months what what issues are you worried about what with what issues should Congress be aware of a lot of people they didn't have a job so they're losing their dental and medical health so that's one of the biggest challenges also they need an emergency and if they don't have the money I don't know what's gonna happen those are my biggest concerns that the bear is still gonna be around even if vaccine you know it's introduced to the market so we need to continue that in you know using the safety protocols that the CDC the American Dental Association Illinois Dental Society the Department of Health our our you know our the stipulated right now so we need to follow and continually this older my other concern is that these supplies are hard to find so they're getting you know very expensive our supply company they only allow us to to buy a certain amount in every 30 days so and also the safety of my staff know if they have the cop in nineteen everybody has to be checked and the 14 you know they stay at home and the biggest product to tell you the truth right now is they're the UM the dental insurances they don't wanna help at all and I don't know there's something that there's something that you can do about it yes I'm touching that you know it broadly speaking health care that the house has passed to expand ACA access an affordable care act access and that's a piece of it but and I'm talking about this even before the crisis dental care is so important to overall health and you know healthy mouth healthy body and if you know people that have dental issues it's very likely if they aren't taken care of I'm not telling you anything you don't know but my dentist tells me you don't take care of it you could have other other problems down the road so we need to make sure that we're providing access to good oral hygiene dental care and I think that's something that we'll be talking the house some Andres in your business things if you look forward certainly if we have another shutdown like we did in the spring it's gonna affect car sales for sure but other things you know I think that right now and looking at risk on trains we're looking at the overall economy our main concern is no that's not not not only as a lending institution that overall you know you have the advantage that we you know we're open to the general public if the economy employment is a big concern for us you know once the PPP moni's is out you know and you know for example in Illinois you know we have seasons here is not like we're in Florida when restaurants can open and reopen so or part of the service industry doesn't reopen one go now what's gonna happen next you know because I think in the pocket see you know I was I still drive if I need to go to Chicago and drive you know that traffic is like 25 percent of why we used to leave before going there and I cysteine a lot of places that are closed or they have some limited services so you think the uncertainty of for how long business is going to operate with minimum capacity with minimum sales with minimum personnel it's gonna have you know what's gonna be the medium term long term impact in the overall economy at all and is there is Congress is the House of Representative okay now are they looking into him to you no other solutions or things that can be done I read the news and you just learned that may your airline just announced that they may lay off half of their staff almost half of 36,000 people so so that's that's what it when it comes when it comes to mind you know PPP all the programs are great I'm fantastic but you know obviously health for everybody you know thanks to the measures that we took it in Illinois we were able to flatten the curve but this is something that we are we are continuing to see obviously the the what I call the stimulus you know some out of dealership that I spoke with they have good sales they have you know they moved they were able to bring some money back some people back they were able to catch up because it's not about now businesses making money or now it's about some businesses and small businesses surviving you know paying the bills keeping everything afloat making any any harsh long-term decisions so this is this is kind of the concerns was gonna happening before you know sure happy neighbor I have to start right now that they have issues with Acree they cannot take care is a critical hearing take care is vital and we need to really address and I have many many bright managers that work for me they are young mothers is that the company don't want to help is how do we have an they're like oh we're in a waiting list or but now they cuz I'm charging twice as much right now so there was a problem before the crisis yes it's a crisis within the crisis now yes so let me take let me turn to Shanice and then all of it so these broadly speaking as we wrap up things that your members are worried about they should be aware of and I'll turn to you too close we really focus on latino-owned businesses was stated thing about but Chinese you first you know thank you I have to agree with Andreas relative to the economy I think really needs to focus on the healthy economy and what's that what that's going to mean in the next several months if in fact you know we do have this issue again people are still unemployed you know the government is talking about reissuing stimulus checks if businesses if people are still have a fear of going out to shop they're not shopping then what is the value of businesses being open if they can't be assured to have customers we don't have customers if customers don't have funding so employment appointment support is going to be important once again redistribution of funds and I know I think it's really important to businesses that they're making the funds available for businesses to stay open but there has to be a complete look at the whole circle as far as people having the funds to go out and shop and I think you know if the Congress takes a really good look at the complete dynamic of funding and spending and business support then businesses can begin to feel that at least the turnover funds coming in and out can take place even if the customers aren't exactly there they CH need the funds to do it you can you can spend online you can spend you can have things delivered you can go out for services but if people are going to reduce the level of services they go out for these businesses are trying to stay open if people are going to go to restaurants for a while if that doesn't begin to get better those businesses are staying open they're just begin to see a continual drop in their annual income and they will have to live with that so unless we economy strong this is this is going to be an issue I think it's just important of course with kovat 19 but they're saying six to eight weeks were for a vaccination but realistically economy is going to be a number one issue to keep hundred percent you know Paul let me give you the last word this was a conversation about the challenges Latino businesses are facing on the one hand no different than any other businesses facing it's a tough economy access to capital access to customers customers being able to come in and be safe the employees being safe but there are others just let me let me you have you wrap it up so yes just piggyback you just say it is Shani's just said it but I theme that and it to that I think that information is key and consistency with that information because unfortunately that the communication channels sometimes are not the best by the time didn't make it to to our Hispanic community so I think that one of my personal bigger fears is that that communication sometimes stops at certain levels and and then our communities kind of find out things last-minute and and if there's not a consistency as well and I'm talking about I mean business and just in their regular life right now is do we need to wear a mask we do now or to wear a mask what what exactly is going to look like because like you said if we look at the models it's probably gonna be a spike is the summer people are outside people are tired to to be in the house and now we're start feeling a little more comfortable and that so how does going to look like I think that it's important to to just continue communication and campaigns on put in the word and what is the requirements and what are the guidelines and just stick to to them I think that that would help and alone wrong and also in forecasts and economics what is going to happen I mean it's it's things that people are not really talking we are having it on the back of her head unemployment rates right now companies you know closing their doors so I know that there's not a lot of information or forecasting how to prepare for that what are the steps are going to be taken to kind of overcome those challenges to kind of give people more ease or more to feel a little more secure or what's going to happen in the near future great well thank you let me thank everybody for joining us this has been a great discussion I appreciate all that you are doing I know we can have this conversation last all day long I wish everyone on the call today good health and strength as we get through this call you uh mentioned something nothing like me just you as a challenge and this was a we simultaneously broadcast this in Spanish we've been trying to do that as much as possible and I'll just say you know if I'm talking to someone speaking Spanish I'm not understanding it if I don't if you don't understand what we're saying just ask and and it's we we can get through this together language shouldn't be a barrier to anyone if anything is unclear if the forms don't make sense reach out I'm sure the chamber you guys are there to help my office is there to help we're gonna get through this together we're one community working together so again I wish everyone a good weekend before I put another plug in for the census I know everyone on this call has filled out their census form so I'm preaching to the choir here but to your neighbors your friends your family who haven't done it so far please tell them to do so it manatees on to our communities especially our local business communities because it provides the resources to build the infrastructure they need to prosper and grow so again thanks to everyone it's so wonderful to see you and forward to hopefully seeing you in person sooner rather than later take care everybody thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

let's go back through so here's some other ones um this is our uh this is our hometown paper at the top thanks the rising price of natural gas in the summer heat electric bills for louisiana residents and businesses are expected are set to shoot up drastically so so mr chairman natural gas prices as i recall and i apologize don't remember the latest number uh but i believe they've gone up about 300 percent since president biden took office 300 percent the majority of our electricity comes from natural gas-fired power plants and so therefore you're going to see a little bit of a lag in electricity prices because most often you have long-term contracts on natural gas but as these contracts are renewed and the new prices are locked in you are going to see skyrocketing electricity prices so so ladies and gentlemen it is not limited it is not limited to just gasoline and diesel it is going to be electricity prices and they're coming you're going to see doubling and tripling of electricity prices uh one of our local tv stations the cost of gas reached record record highs in louisiana in march it's only gotten worse the price per gallon varies by 10 cents or more across capital depending on the gas station remember houma newspaper industry officials say jobs economy and tax revenue at state if biden delays oil leases the first president in modern history to not have lease sales i had a conversation with secretary of energy who came down to louisiana recently which i will tell you i very much appreciate her coming to visit and i appreciate her giving me time to talk but my conversation with her she says i'm talking to her about leases the fact that we need to offer up lisa's new production areas i don't know how about in the united states versus saudi arabia iran venezuela or other countries you know what her response was we don't need new sources of energy okay let me ask you a question mr chairman how is it that you don't need new sources of energy when our own president is going to iran venezuela saudi arabia and others and our own president is releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve it's supposed to be for disasters not disastrous policies help me understand how you don't need new supply whenever you're tapping foreign supplies and attacking our emergency reserves putting us in a precarious or a dangerous situation how can those two things coexist anybody how can they coexist this is this is the stupidest energy policy i've ever seen in my life and and i don't care who you are if you're if you're a hardcore liberal you're a hardcore conservative this is affecting every american it's undermining our economy we have the resources right here in the united states why aren't we producing it this is absolutely idiotic these policies that we're moving forward on there was a treasury official under the bible administration who was quoted as saying it was their objective to raise energy prices

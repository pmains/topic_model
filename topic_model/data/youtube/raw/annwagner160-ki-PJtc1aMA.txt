sher and i think thank our witnesses for for their time and for their service to our country miss Lenehan I understand that Russia has been expanding its footprint in Sudan and is considering establishing a naval base near Port Sudan but after months of protests against the autocratic regime russian-backed Omar al-bashir has been deposed in a peaceful coup will regime change in Sudan increase or diminish the likelihood of an enhanced Russian presence in Sudan and how would this affect US interests Thank You congressman for the question Russia also is the strategic concern for the United States as outlined within the national defense strategy and we do see increasing interest on the continent in the context of Sudan there certainly is a relationship the situation is obviously very dynamic at present as far as what will occur within that country with the transitional knows well the regime change do you think increase or diminish the likelihood of their enhanced Russian presence I'd say we difficult to tell but certainly once there's an established relationship that could be affected once that leader is gone ambassador Nagy Russia's actions in Sudan look a lot like his activities in Venezuela in Syria to me what do you think Russians Russians intentions are in what lessons should the u.s. draw on this area and Venezuela Venezuela scenarios thank you very much congressman I believe that Russia is very opportunistic in Africa they don't have the resources of China they certainly don't have the resource of the United States they look for places where they can cause trouble basically and poke us in the eye or as in the Central African Republic specifically folk the French in the eye we just have to be very careful and and block wherever we can with you asked about Sudan I'm hoping that if the transition in Sudan goes in the direction it does go in we end up with a civilian controlled government then they will have a totally different view of Russia than the government that they will be replacing we absolutely are all hoping for that mr. day I am so glad that you highlighted the centrality of women's empowerment in achieving sustainable development goals education and economic empowerment for women have positive positive ripple effects in developing countries all across the globe I am particularly interested in efforts to reduce the gender gap in property ownership in sub-saharan Africa where the World Bank found that men are almost three times more likely than women to own property by themselves this disparity has wide-ranging economic consequences for women and their their daughters can you tell me how USAID is working to reduce gender gaps in property ownership in sub-saharan Africa Thank You congresswoman this is this is absolutely vitally important to Africa's development so thank you for raising it it's also vitally important to many of the countries that I've worked in in my career including the Middle East but it's it's probably even more so I think in Africa and that I sometimes say that these economies are not going to succeed if they only use half their brain and I think that's never more true than in than in Africa and so women need access to not only land rights but also education and they need access to finance so that they can access markets anybody I can have access to networks but then also there's a regulatory and a policy illegal and a cultural environment that needs to also be that needs to be changed and that's exactly what USAID is doing in the the women's global development prosperity initiative wtdp right so we're really looking forward to digging in our heels in the program well let me know how we can be helpful because I see it as a really the only way forward and the property ownership gap is is outrageous at the moment I have a little bit of time left so mr. de Tanzania has long been considered a democratic success story however current president john john mcgoofy i believe has begun to violate democratic norms in the name of eradicating corruption you tell me how USAID is working to prevent Democratic backsliding in Tanzania thank you again for the question and and and I have had numerous conversations about this lamenting about the elements in Tanzania we are we are deeply concerned about the rhetoric coming out of Tanzania not only from a human rights perspective but from a democracy perspective as well and a business perspective because there are a lot of American businesses who are waning their interest in in Tanzania because of the developments there now we have continued to work on our health programming particularly PEPFAR which is vitally important in Tanzania but a lot of our programming has really had to shift away from support and partnership directly with the government as a result of these developments and we're now really focused more on civil society and independent media and that's where we shifted a lot of our programs I really hate to see the backsliding and investor Nadja and I know I'm out of time but I would be very much interested in your perspective on this too and certainly I think our committee would so either in writing or perhaps would be sure it would be best very quickly Tanzania especially sad because that was one of the beatings of democracy through Africa's history and decolonization so it is it is hurtful to the entire continent and the Friends of Africa and our embassy believe me is extremely engaged across the whole spectrum of inter oculars of making the point of trying to promote democracy and also trying to help those organizations that are Tanzanian right and are trying to hold on to democracy because there's a danger of it evolving into what we would call a Potemkin democracy where you have the structures of democracy but without anything really behind it well the backsliders as is it's just terrible and I appreciate the chairs indulgence and for your tremendous service and work in the area and representative

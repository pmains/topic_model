hey and uh mr tilney welcome back to kdk good morning guys thanks for having me just to make it clear you are a republican i am and a republican one in massachusetts you gotta like what you saw well absolutely i was delighted to see scott brown pull off really a stunning victory i think this is a continuation of a trend that we have been seeing for uh some time now remember uh there were stunning republican wins in virginia for governor new jersey for governor investigate republicans won six out of seven statewide judicial elections and now we we just uh we just want a senate seat that ted kennedy and the kennedy family has held for over 50 years and i don't think it's because everybody has fallen madly in love with the republican brand i think it's it's mostly because they see a government out of control spending that is at a staggering and unsustainable level way too much debt an effort to take over health care an agenda to push this country so far left that the american people are just they're just not on board with that agenda and they're they're standing up and saying you know let's put some breaks on this three weeks ago as you pointed out just before we went on the air a scott brown was trailing by 20 points in the polls three weeks what what what made that difference because this tips the balance of power in the senate that's right it's a very big deal and i'll tell you what what happened is very straightforward it was a very short race because it was a special election as you know so it was not the the typical conventional uh election that you planned for for many many months nobody had heard of scott brown nobody in massachusetts except a tiny number of people in his faith senate district that ever heard of him and so he was unknown he was way behind and then he stood up and said wait a minute we got to get spending under control we should stop bailing out failing companies we don't need a trillion dollar government takeover of health care and we should spend money putting terrorists away not paying for their lawyers people around massachusetts said yeah he's right and we saw this stunning turn around so it's an impressive performance but i think it just shows how out of step this very liberal government in washington has become senator bob casey says the message out of massachusetts is that the senate needs to go ahead and pass the stimulus plan that the house approved in december uh another jobs bill more spending like the first ones did much remember we had a stimulus spending bill uh under president bush in the final year of his uh his term and then they came along and spent 800 billion dollars more remember the president told us unemployment won't go above eight percent if we uh if we give him this spending bill so they got their spending bill unemployment is ten percent now and i'm afraid it may even go higher this you know the idea that we can borrow and spend our way to prosperity is simply ridiculous and i think most pennsylvanians realize that huge issue is health care reform how will this change how that uh flushes out well they're simply not going to be able to pass this monstrosity that they've been working on they just won't be able to do it and it's not only that scott brown would provide a vote to block it in the senate frankly i think after what happened in massachusetts they probably don't have the votes among democrats in the house anymore so it's a question as to whether they want to give up altogether or do they want to approach this with some modest common sense reform that guys like me and many others have advocated for a long time you know focus on affordability and access help the lower costs i've i've long argued that we should for instance give individuals the same tax deductibility when they buy health insurance that employers get and we ought to allow people to buy insurance plans that originate in other states that that would force the insurance companies to really have to compete the heck with that i just want the health care plan that they have for congress yeah i want what they have yeah that that'd be fine yeah i'd agree with that too you know this is a you know they actually voted in congress not to require members of congress to be subject to whatever they pass i don't know how that's even possibly indefensible how is that possible well unfortunately they you know they they can vote for whatever they want but you know you know that's that and and they they don't always uh uh about that constitution and the and the principles they were sent for and that they crosses the aisle too it's not just one party absolutely the problem on both sides i think they'd get a health care reform done in a hurry if they had to live with whatever they decided was going to happen then personally for everybody else that couldn't it couldn't hurt i'd certainly think that it as a any measure of decency and common sense whatever they pass auto apply to themselves pat toomey we appreciate your time we will talk again for sure thank you thanks for having me guys pat toomey a united states senate hopeful here in the state of pennsylvania

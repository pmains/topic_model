hi and welcome to this month's installment of ask Derek where I answer your mail Kelly from Port Angeles recently sent me a note regarding the Affordable Care Act and how we should be working to improve health care now as many of you probably know the Supreme Court recently upheld key provisions of the Affordable Care Act and I've heard from a lot of you wondering if this puts the debate to rest or whether we'll see more efforts to repeal the law well simply put the decision ensure that millions of Americans will continue to have access to affordable health care now at the same time I think we all know that not everything that comes out of Congress is perfect I do not subscribe to the theory of congressional infallibility even the best laws need to be tweaked now and then and what I can tell you is that through the Affordable Care Act we've seen lowered costs for seniors important protections for folks with pre-existing conditions increased health coverage for young adults and investments in life-saving care so instead of taking another vote to repeal and turn back the clock on these key reforms in my view we should focus on making progress and fixing the parts of the law that need fixing we need a health care system that works for doctors and hospitals and most importantly for patients one area in particular that I think we need to work on is helping more employers provide insurance to their employees you know I worked in economic development for a decade and I can tell you the vast majority of employers that I worked with over the years actually provided insurance to their workers but those that didn't chose not to because they couldn't afford it not because they didn't want to so we should fix that and provide additional tools to help small businesses also in the more rural parts of our region and the state we have too few primary care physicians and need to do a better job of paying them a rates that ensure that all patients have access to quality care I think it's time for Congress to put away the political games and get back to the hard work of improving our health care system I also got a question this month from vern on fox island pushing to see Congress reauthorize the export-import bank Vern I absolutely agree with you so what is the export-import bank and why does this matter well basically we have businesses in our state that are making products attracting interest all around the world there are customers around the world who want to buy products stamped with the words made in the USA and whether small businesses like panel tech and grays harbor or big ones like Boeing they have huge opportunities to export their products and to grow jobs in our state but businesses with customers ready to buy their products all across the grilled globe still face hurdles and getting their goods to new markets an important part of doing these sales involves getting private export financing or finance insurance and that's where the US export-import bank steps in the Exim Bank serves as our nation's export credit agency financing the export of American goods and services it provides us businesses with direct loans and loan guarantees and working capital finance and export credit insurance and this is huge for our state over the last eight years the bank has supported 149 small businesses in our state for a total of 130 billion dollars in exports unfortunately the bank has become a bit of a hot potato in our nation's capital as folks are looking to play politics with an institution that plays a really important role in helping American products actively compete around the world and as a result of Congress's failure to act the bank's been forced to end its lending programs leaving Washington businesses without an important tool for selling their products now here's the deal there's strong bipartisan support for the bank and I'm confident that if a bill actually gets to the floor to reauthorize the bank we can get this done in my view we owe it to workers in Washington state and all across the nation because I want us to export products not jobs and that's something the export-import bank helps us do so thanks for sending in your questions and I look forward to answering more next month

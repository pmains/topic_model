but you also in your list of categories which i agree with uh and i recently wrote a letter stating that uh to the administration uh that it has to have a public health approach that will focus on high risk of getting infected and high risk of dying but one of the things that you mentioned is those with essential jobs but not all essential jobs are created equal there are high risk essential jobs which are the farm workers the packing houses the grocery store workers and there are lower risk essential jobs like yours and others where perhaps you can and others can work from home and have video meetings so one is how are you going to distinguish the latino community in particular uh in the distribution and the higher risk and prioritize the higher risk jobs uh over you know the those that don't have underlying diseases are young and can work from home uh and then finally um what plans uh are there with the cdc to and the administration to work with local vulnerable uh high-risk communities like latino underserved communities to administer uh and hold them accountable to ensure that the system doesn't leave out latinos like it historically has done um i don't have the answer that i think is gonna satisfy you yet but i will try to shine a light on that this is what the cdc is responsible for doing i can tell you in my conversations with dr redfield he's acutely aware of the points that you are making you know the supply chain and distribution is going to be done through the standard means but as you point out correctly the standard means have failed in the past and i think we need to re-look at making sure that the populations that you mentioned are addressed in the distribution of that again as i mentioned uh to congresswoman escobar these are things that i can only bring up at the task force meeting i you know i'm always very honest and transparent with you ralph i can't guarantee you i'm gonna fix it but i at least can bring it up and make sure it's a matter of discussion

thank you mr bynum with my brief remaining time rural transit uh the chairman has admirably focused us on the importance of rural transit in the upcoming infrastructure bill could you just comment on the importance of rural trans to expand opportunity and access to basic services particularly in communities like the chattahoochee river valley of west georgia which you know well in and around surrounding muskogee county along the alabama line how can investment in rural transit improve quality of life in the chattahoochee river valley if you do not have access to adequate transit then you may as well be unemployed in rural areas because you're there yourself so much territory to cover uh if you don't have a car or truck in rural areas you may as well be unemployed low-income people and people of color in rural communities are more likely to be preyed upon and receive access to high-cost predatory financing to get access to mobile car loans and truck loans and so transit solutions are vitally important again cdfis have a historic track record of addressing transit-related needs and financing to help close infrastructure gaps such as transit and healthcare and education

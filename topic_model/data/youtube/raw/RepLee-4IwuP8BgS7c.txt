thank you very much Thank You mr. chairman and let me thank our ranking member congresswoman waters for yielding also for her tremendous leadership on the Financial Services Committee as our ranking member she has been phenomenal in terms of making sure that our legislation is bipartisan and also I remember serving on the Subcommittee on housing for many many years with congresswoman waters and she constantly worked to make sure that people had access to affordable accessible clean and safe housing and she has not wavered on that agenda so thank you very much the need for affordable housing it's never been greater that's why I'm very happy to be here today to support the has an opportunity through modernization act of 2015 the bill would make critical improvements to our nation's public and assisted housing programs and take steps to ensure that low-income communities have access to safe and affordable housing now let me just tell you in my district in Oakland California rents have risen faster than anywhere else in the nation in fact the average Oakland renter if average Oakland Renta had to move tomorrow they would be spending a staggering seventy percent of their income on housing seventy percent of their income that's outrageous my constituents like many students around the country they can't afford this so this is a crisis this step this bill takes steps to address this issue by protecting voucher holders from losing their subsidies when fair market rents drop something that reached recently had a major impact in my community thankfully with the help of congresswoman waters and our Secretary of HUD we were able to navigate the agency's red tape to find a solution so the tenants could keep their assistance and live in their homes and stay at home so I support this bill the critical amendments offered by congresswoman waters price and aderholt so important it's important that we update the formula used to distribute funds under the housing opportunities for people living with HIV and AIDS to reflect the main and the nature of the hiv/aids epidemic and to ensure that those communities in greatest need receive critical hop-hop low funds this is one issue the congresswoman waters been working on for many many years to make sure that these funds are targeted to the the people and the communities who need it the most also the bill allows for home ownership for those whose dream the American dream of homeownership that's been shattered for so many so thank goodness in this bill we have provisions now that will allow that dream to be fulfilled it's I just want to thank congressman cleaver thank our majority and minority members for this bill and just no just in my district from a very parochial point of view I just have to say how badly needed it is and the gentrification is a big issue my constituents constantly ask me what the federal government can do this is a major step in that direction and so thank you again general

but yesterday the White House sent up two and a half billion dollar a spending plan to respond to coronavirus we had a hearing this morning with the Secretary of HHS was a briefing of all senators before that a couple of points to make one is in the 2019 spending bill for the first time we gave HHS an infectious-disease fund that they have a lot of flexibility with one hundred and five million dollars so that fund has not been exhausted yet but beginning to see when it might be the secretary has some transfer authority that would add another hundred and thirty six million dollars that the secretary can use without Senate or House or congressional action so we're almost at a two hundred and fifty million dollar level of money immediately available we don't have all the time in the world but I think we do have time to look at what it will be the right number if two and a half billion is the right number if the pay-fors for part of that are the right faith wars secretary a czar this morning and others from the White House the yesterday and today have assured me an assured chairman Shelby and I think the house leaders as well and Senator Senator Leahy that they're going to be working with us to find that right number we intend to do that but in the near term money's available to meet the immediate needs of beginning to deal with this health challenge and we're going to work with the White House and we'll decide the final number and we'll decide the pay-fors and the secretary this morning was very clear that they understand that that's how this process works

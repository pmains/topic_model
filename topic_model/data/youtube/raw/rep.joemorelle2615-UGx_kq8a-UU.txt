i rise today to acknowledge the significant struggles facing working families across america struggles that have been exposed and exacerbated by the covid pandemic that's why through the american rescue plan we took action to expand the child tax credit helping to uplift families and reduce poverty in my community more than forty thousand households will receive an average benefit of nearly three thousand dollars that will begin being dispersed in just a few short weeks this is projected to lift 8 200 children out of poverty in my district alone when we talk about transformative investment to support working families this is exactly what we mean and that's why we need to make the expanded child tax credit permanent to book kids and parents on the path to success because when we ease the financial burden on families they have the security and flexibility to contribute to the workforce strengthen our economy and set our children up for a stable and successful future thank you mr speaker i yield the balance of my time

we now Democratic congressman from New York Jerry Nadler he's the chair of the House Judiciary Committee what do you make of these revelations from your perch chairing that committee congressman well I very carefully to Nick Ackerman and it certainly seems very indicative I think the Walt the the walls are closing in on the president the proof is beginning to be assembled of a best conspiracy to defraud the American people with several different aspects whether it was the hush money to the women that the the president seems to be I've been personally involved in or this collusion with Russians in which they're given data in which the people gave it to them from the Trump campaign knew had no value to them other than to help them micro-target social media into illegal social media interventions in the American election and of course the the Trump Tower meeting relating to to the hacks from the DNC this is why it is so important to protect them all investigation and to make sure that that report that may or may not be coming out soon becomes public and is not pocketed by mr. Whittaker or mr. Barr and that's what we have to make sure it's one of the things we have to make sure of on the Judiciary Committee that that report is public that the American people know the results of this investigation and of course we have work to do also we don't we now have enough leads to do our own investigation on some of the things that Muller probably knows already but hasn't said yet so on the publicness this is something I've been asking a lot of folks the the regulations at issue do not require that it be made public you're saying if you view it as your job to make it public do you have that power as the committee chair to do so well the committee certainly has the power to subpoena the report if necessary we have the power to who certainly to invite former prosecutor Muller to testify in front of the committee and ask him about it you're saying once he once he were to finish if the executive attempted to essentially keep it under wraps those are two avenues you have the power to pursue that's exactly right now there's reporting about Steve minuchin who's someone that I know that various committees of oversight have been pursuing particularly as relates to the decision to lift sort of walk back sanctions on Oleg Deripaska mannithen sort of center of all this and he has now agreed to give a classified briefing tomorrow is that correct yes and what's the nature of that well I don't know what the nature is it's a classified briefing to all members of the house as to why he is proposing to remove the or removing these sanctions now these sanctions were imposed on Deripaska and other Russian oligarchs close to Putin because of the invasion of Ukraine of Crimea the occupation Crimean the invasion of Ukraine and of course we know from everything you've talked about we know from the the the testimony about the Trump Tower meeting that the chief quid pro quo for all of this help to the Trump campaign from the Russians is the lifting of sanctions they wanted to do that from day one and now we see now the president of course tried to you know try to delay the imposition of sanctions that Congress voted and and Congress forced them to impose them and now he's trying to lift sanctions without the Russians doing anything to remove themselves from the Crimea or stopping their aggressions in Ukraine so why you would lift the sanctions except as a quid pro quo for illegal help in the election by the Russians I wouldn't know and presumably the Treasury secretary will speak to that in classified briefing tomorrow another item that just broke in last hours is stores in Washington Post about the beefed up legal team inside the White House and their strategy sort of aggressively to assert executive privilege in matters having to do with the investigations of Robert Muller is your committee staff prepare for what can be some extremely high-stakes legal battles between these two branches of government our committee staff and the House Counsel who was just hired last week are very much prepared for whatever legal battles may be necessary and the fact of the matter is you know Richard Nixon tried to assert executive privilege and the Supreme Court very sharply slapped them down there is no reasonable case for executive privilege executive privilege is always pierced by a reap buy there any reasonable necessity in a criminal or congressional investigation and the Nixon case which was the unanimous Supreme Court made that point very clear all right congressman and chair of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler thank you very much

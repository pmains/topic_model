i thought i would share with you all of the many memories of the many many acts of bravery and heroism and compassion during this unprecedented and really unimaginable before that time attack on our democracy one year ago today i thought about a moment that for me was perhaps the most terrifying of that day it was the moments just before those of us who were trapped in the gallery were able to get out it was when we were waiting for someone to open the door we had heard the mobs outside we'd heard the banging on the doors that we've heard about we heard the rattling we heard the gunshot we didn't know all that was happening around us then but we watched and waited as the brave capitol police officers who were with us in the house gallery were trying to determine who was on the other side of the door and whether it was safe for us to get out and at that moment we couldn't know but when they opened the doors i was so relieved to see capitol police officers there they had secured a path for us out of the gallery to get us to safety to get us out of the chamber to get us we thought out of danger i felt a wave of relief as i walked out of the gallery i saw immediately to my right what others have described just beyond the stair part of our escape route men lying spread eagle on the floor with the capitol police officers guns trained on them so that we could pass so that we could escape and capitol police officers stationed themselves along our path guiding us to safety at every turn through the stairs and the tunnels and i felt a sense of relief but also a sense of uncertainty and i found myself trying to say cheerful reassuring things to people around me and one in particular as we approached an elevator near what i learned would be our destination one of the capitol police officers looked at me and very calmly but very clearly said hurry it was clear to me in that moment that we were not in fact out of danger and every day of this year i have remained so grateful to the many capitol police officers and police officers from the metropolitan police department and others who faced those dangers that day who saved our lives that day who saved our capital that day and who saved our democracy that day and i share this story now because as i thought about all of the things from that day it is clear to me that in this moment we are not out of danger our democracy is still under attack and all of us every single american has a role to play in preserving protecting and defending it and as we just heard from our distinguished historians our history is still being written and we all of us as americans we get to write it that is the beauty of our democracy that is what we are celebrating and remembering and honoring and recommitting ourselves and vowing to protect today

I am very excited to be here because I know just how many disabled veterans in our country are on wait lists for adult day health care and now we'll be getting a service that is just so important and overdue I certainly want to thank chairman Roe and his great staff the House Veterans Affairs Committee the ranking member and his team as well everybody come together working hard on behalf of our disabled veterans who need it most I rise in support of Senate bill 3 2014 companion to my bill HR 1005 which is a bill to provide adult day healthcare at save veterans homes to veterans who are 70% or more service-connected disabled this bill is an extension to the Veterans Benefits health care and Information Technology Act of 2006 which currently provides no-cost nursing home care at any state veteran's home to veterans who are 70% or more service-connected disabled medical model Adult Day Health Care provides comprehensive medical nursing and personal care services combined with engaging social activities for physically or cognitively impaired adults medical model Adult Day Health Care offers a complete array of rehabilitative therapies including physical occupational and speech therapy zhh hospice and palliative care Social Work spiritual nutritional counseling and therapeutic recreation the program is designed to promote socialization stimulation and maximize the participants independence while enhancing their quality of life the program is staffed by a great team of multidisciplinary health care professionals who evaluate each participant in customized and individualized plan of care specific to their health and social needs adult day healthcare is an alternative care setting that can allow some veterans who require long-term care services to remain in their homes as opposed to being institutionalized in nursing homes such veterans typically require support from some but not all activities of assisted daily living ADL such as bathing dressing or feeding in many cases a spouse or other family member may provide the veteran with much of their care but they require additional support from some of the veterans ADL's by filling these gaps adult day healthcare can allow these veterans to remain in their homes and communities for additional months or even years and thereby lower the financial costs of caring for these heroes adult day healthcare also provides family caregivers support and relief to meet there are other professional and family obligations or provide a well-deserved rest bite while their loved ones are participating in the program in addition to thanking chairman Roe for his leadership and support on a support issue I also want to thank Senator hatch for carrying this effort in the Senate as well as Fred's Ganga and a Long Island State Veterans Home in Stony Brook for their great efforts that's a state veteran's home located in the first congressional district of New York one of three places currently offering adult a health care mr. speaker this is a piece of legislation that I'll yield Nation and additional minute Jen was recognized for additional man thank you chairman Thank You mr. speaker this is a piece of legislation that would provide a valuable necessary service to our nation's veterans and I'm urging my colleagues to support this common-sense bipartisan legislation and what goes on too often unnoticed in this house is the great staff that we have to help make these efforts possible so from the leadership team I want to thank Stanford Jonathan leg and Sookie and Kelly Dixon in my office office my legislative director Kevin Dowling and Matthew Scott and thank you again to the great house Veterans Affairs Committee

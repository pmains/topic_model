24 earlier tonight i asked congressmember adam schiff if any of those were top of mind for him during these meetings well i wouldn't describe those as top goals of the committee our top goal is to expose how close we came to losing our democracy uh what the president's the former president's plot involved to uh interfere with the first uh for the first time in our history with the peaceful transfer of power uh and to prescribe remedies to protect our democracy going forward it'll be the justice department's job to decide uh if laws were broken and who should be prosecuted uh but i will consider our work successful uh if we expose the danger if we alert the american people to just how close we came to losing our democracy and the fact that we're not out of danger the big lie that led to that violence on january 6 is still being used around the country to disenfranchise people to run uh local elections officials out of town sometimes with death threats people need to understand just how fragile our democracy is in order for us to protect it yeah and we don't know what the future holds yet but when it comes to what has happened in our past and how people understand it uh some recent polling from the group morning consult show that the farther we get away from january 6 of 2021 the less likely americans are to find donald trump responsible for what happened so far when it comes to these public hearings adam schiff how well do you feel like what has been said and heard and seen has moved the needle and and what's your strategy for making the most of this time and the public's attention you know i think uh since the more than a year after january 6 you know the president and his enablers including many of the republicans in congress have continued to push this big lie uh and up until now there hasn't been a comprehensive rebuttal to that uh because we've been doing our investigation we've been wanting to wait to gather the evidence and present to the american people and i think it is a really powerful rebuttal we have shown just in the first couple hearings the president's role in this coup attempt we've shown that he lost the election and that he knew he lost the people around him told him he lost his own people were telling him that uh and what's more uh these bogus claims of massive fraud his own attorney general bill barr said we're bs as did other high-ranking people in the trump administration so the president was lying and he knew he was lying and i think we've shown this with really quite dramatic testimony and evidence and there's a lot more where that came from uh anecdotally and and so far just anecdotal uh i'm hearing uh from my colleagues and constituents uh that uh they're you know quite shocked at what they're seeing and it's not just people in the choir i think independents as well as modern republicans are really uh shocked at what they see of the former president and i hope that it is alerting people to the danger you mentioned his own people not something i really want to ask about because it does seem that part of the strategy seems to be letting those who are closest to donald trump tell their version of history i know not everyone's been able to see these hearings so let's take a listen to what former attorney general bill barr had to say specifically about trump's claims there was never an indication of interest and what the actual facts were i was somewhat demoralized because i thought boy if he really believes this stuff he has you know lost contact with with uh he's become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff congressman schiff let's talk a little bit more about that you mentioned republicans independence may be having a little bit of a change of heart how important a how persuasive has been having these former colleagues make points like these well i think it's very important uh you know it's one thing for me to say it or other democrats to say it it's another when people they respect people that they thought were loyal to the president and for a long time were loyal to the president uh look bill barr used the justice department to protect and defend donald trump uh he intervened in the sentencing of roger stone someone who lied to cover up for himself and the president he intervened in the case of michael flynn to make the case go away completely another person who lied to cover-up this was someone who carried a lot of dirty water for donald trump but even he got to the point where he couldn't do it anymore uh so you know these were trump loyalists uh and uh and and tomorrow uh we will hear from a very well respected very conservative jurist as well as the vice president's council you know about how this effort that they were making to get the vice president to essentially overturn the will of the voters was unconstitutional and it's very important that people hear from those kind of witnesses it is indeed you mentioned at the outset that a big part of your goal is preventing a future erosion of our democracy and i happen to think having watched this that maybe a part of it is that we don't understand our democracy and how it's functioning in this current era but i'm seeing changes in that when i watch the testimony for example a former fox political editor chris steyerwaldt who really broke down how elections and pallet counting works i don't think the average joe does get that we also happen to live in a very fast-paced world where our expectation of quick answers is very high yet we've also got this long-standing commitment to election integrity and it seems to me that sometimes that can create a bit of attention how can and should we restore america's trust in that system given these competing factors it was a really important question and uh this is really part of our mission which is to explain uh how the system works how it's supposed to work and how the former president really assaulted that system and continues to assault it uh you know people vote for president uh and each state uh has agreed that whoever wins the popular vote in their state will get that state's share of electors well that meant that donald trump was going to lose because he lost the popular vote in enough states to lose the presidency so he didn't like that so he tried to get the state legislatures to basically overturn the will of the people it's a astonishing thing and he had a great many people go along with him and he did this knowing that he lost he did this knowing that his claims of fraud were were bs in the words of his own attorney general um and so i think we need to uh do do what we can to explain this uh in no uncertain terms uh so people understand what a radical departure this was from every other president that went before who accepted that when they lost the election they were out of office but not donald trump and that ultimately led to violence on january 6 people getting killed and it has continued to to plague our democracy congressman adam schiff very grateful for your time this evening thank you so much thank you

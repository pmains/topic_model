DOWN THE CHINESEZMGbCa SUSPECTE  SURVEILLANCE BALLOON. HE MAINTAINED HE ALWAYS WANTED  TO BRING IT DOWN AS SOON AS IT  WAS APPROPRIATE. JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS DEMOCRATIC SENATOR TIM KAINE OF  VIRGINIA, A MEMBER OF THE  FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND  ANNOUNCED HE IS RUNNING FOR  RE-ELECTION IN 2024. WE WILL TALK POLITICS IN A  MOMENT. THERE IS THAT ALL SENATORS  CLASSIFIED BRIEFING ON THE  SURVEILLANCE BALLOON THURSDAY. WHAT QUESTIONS DO YOU STILL  HAVE? >> I THINK FINDING OUT WHAT  CHINA IS UP TO THE EARLIER  INSTANCES OF BALLOONS OVER THE  UNITED STATES DURING THE LAST  ADMINISTRATION, HOW WE PUT THE  DOTS TOGETHER TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT. WHAT INTELLIGENCE WE COLLECTED  FROM THE BALLO. ONCE THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION  REALIZED IT WAS THERE, WE DID  THINGS BOTH TO BLOCK IT FROM  GAINING ACCESS TO OUR  INFORMATION AND ALSO GATHER  INTELLIGENCE FROM THE BALLOON TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CHINA IS UP TO. OBVIOUSLY, THING THAT WAS  RECOVERED OR HAS BEEN RECOVERED, WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT  CHINESE PLANS.  >> THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE DOESN'T WORRY THIS WEAKENS U.S./CHINA  RELATIONS.  >> IT SHOWS THE [MGbCaSTRAIN. IT WAS INCOMPETENT, INEXCUSABLE, VERY POORLY TIMED BECAUSE  CHENEY, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, WAS  LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SECRETARY BLINKEN VISIT. THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC  CHALLENGES. THEY WANT TO MAYBE DO A LITTLE  BIT OF AESET IN THE  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED  STATES AND THEN THIS  INCOMPETENT, YOU KNOW, BUNGLED  EFFORT BLEW UP IN THEIR FACE AND IT SHOWS THE STRAINS IN THE  RELATIONSHIP, BUT, LOOK, THE  U.S./CHINA RELATIONSHIP IS  PROBABLY THE MT IMPORTANT  BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP IN THE  WORLD FOR THE NEXT HALF CENTURY  OR LONGER, AND WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT -- WE ARE GOING TO THE  COMPETITORS AND ADVERSARIES IN  SOME SPACES. ARE THERE AREAS WE CAN  COOPERATE. WE HAVE TO HAVE COMMUNICATION TO FIGURE THAT OUT.  >> PRESIDENT BID WILL BE  SPEAKING ABOUT CHINA TONIGHT IN  THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ANY  PRESIDENT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST TV AUDIENCES  THEY GET. WHAT IS IMPORTANT? >> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO  JUST DEMONSTRATE AMERICAN  STRENGTH. I THINK IT'S NOT JUST WORDS. GbTHCaE ACTIONS OF THE LAST YEA  REMEMBER LAST YEAR THE STATE OF  THE UNION HAPPENED A FEW DAYS  AFTER RUSSIA INVADED UKRAINE. AND WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS  DONE IS ASSEMBLED A GLOBAL  COALITION OF DEMOCRACIES WILLING TO STAND FOR UKRAINIAN DEMOCRACY AGAINST AN ILLEGAL INVASION BY A DICTATOR. THE MESSAGE IS NOT LOST ON XI  JINPING. THE DECRACIES OF THIS WORLD  ARE NOT BYSTANDERS, THEY ARE NOT ON THEIR BACK FOOT. THEY ARE ABLE TO LINK ARMS  AGAINST DICTATORS AND CERTAINLY  AGAINST DICTATORS THAT ARE  CONTEMPLATING INVASIONS AND I  THINK PRESIDENT BIDEN NEEDS TO  DEMONSTRATE THE RESOLVE OF THE  UNITED STATES, BUT ALSO OUR  ABILITY TO FORGE ALLIANCES THAT  ARE STRONG.  >> ONE THING THE WHITE HOUSE  ALSO WANTS HIM TO TALK ABOUT ARE LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS. A NEW POLL SHOWED THAT A  MAJORITY OF AMERICANS DON'T  BELIEVE HE ACHIEVED MUCH SINCE  TANG OFFICE. WHY IS THAT? >> YOU KNOW, KAITLIN, I THINK  THERE IS STILL A COVID HANGOVER. A MILLION PEOPLE DIED AND IN  THAT SAME TIME WE HAVE HAD  ECONOMIC]MGbCa CHALLENGES, WE H  ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL, T TWO  IMPEACHMENT TRIALS, RACIAL  JUSTICE PROTESTS DRIVEN BY  HORRIBLE INSTANCES OF VIOLENCE  AGAINST FOLKS BY POLICE AND JUST IT'S BEEN A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TIME. AND MY EXPERIENCE, I AM ALMOST  65, IS THAT DURING CHALLENGING  TIMES PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE BIT  WEARY ABOUT LETTING IT THEIR  HOPES COME UP AND THEY ARE A  LITTLE BIT SLOW BECAUSE IN A  TIME LIKE THIS THEY DON'T WANT  TO HAVE THEIR HOPES DASHED. YOU HAVE SEEN PRESIDENT BIDEN  NOT ONLY ACHIEVE LEGISLATIVE  VICTORIES, BUT VICTORIES MAKING  A DIFFERENCE. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS DOWN FOR SENIORS, JOB GROWTH AT RECORD  LEVELS, MANUFACTURING BACK AND  BOOMING. I SEE THIS AROUND VIRGINIA. A COMMITMENT TO AMERICAN  INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN UNPARALLELED SINCE THE  EISAN HOW ADMINISTRATION. AS I GO AROUND VIRGINIA I THINK  PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO GET THE  HANG OF IT. THEY DON'T YET SEE EVERYTHING  THAT THEY WANT TO SEE. THEY ARE WEARY ABOUT GETTING  THEIR HOPES UP. BUT I THINÃ­MGbCaK WHAT PRESIDENN NEEDS TO DO IS EMPHASIZE THE  WINS AND SAY YOU AIN'T SEEN  NOTHING ELSE. WE GOT MORE TO DO.  >> HE IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE HE IS RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION, TOO. YOU KNOW HOW BRUTAL THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO BE. HOW IMPORTANT FOR HIS DELIVERY  TONIGHT? >> I THINK HE HAS A LOT THAT HE  CAN PROMOTE THAT WE'VE GOTTEN  DONE. THE GOOD NEWS, YOU MENTIONED HE  HAS LEGISLATIVE WINS WITH THE  EXCEPTION OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AND THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, THE WINS, INFRASTRUCTURE,  CHIPS, VETERANS BILL, GUN  SAFETY, BIPARTISAN. HE CAN SAY I SPENT 36 YEARS IN  THE SENATE, EIGHT YEARS AS VICE  PRESIDENT MAKING DEALS,  INCLUDING ACROSS THE AISLE. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED IN THIS  COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IS PEOPLE  WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER AND I  KNOW HOW TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT  NOBODY ELSE CAN MATCH.  >> AND WE HAVE KEVIN McCARTHY  WILL BE

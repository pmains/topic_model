mr speaker and thank you chairman capital for yielding i rise today in strong support of the amended version of h.r 5817 the eliminated privacy notice confusion act under current law all financial institutions are required to provide annual privacy notices explaining information sharing practices to customers banks and credit unions are required to give these notices each year even in the even in their privacy notice even if their privacy nodes have not changed this creates not only waste for financial institutions but confusion among and increased costs to consumers in his book entitled the financial crisis and free market cure john allison reports that one bank offered at the end of its privacy notice to pay one hundred dollars to any customer that read its notice in full only one customer took the bank up on that offer year after year millions of dollars are spent on privacy notices that are either disregarded or by confusing the customers let's think about this cost for a second this outdated requirement doesn't cost only in postage alone but also costs in compliance costs cost of supplies printing fees and man hours i talked to one community bank in my district has said they spent roughly 70 cents per disclosure the minimum of 250 000 accounts and customers this one bank spends 175 000 a year on this requirement it may not seem like a lot of money to some of my colleagues but i can tell you that 175 thousand dollars is a lot of money for a small institution like this one in my district especially when a lot of those costs are passed on to the customs of the customer this is some debate there is some debate over what this legislation will do let me be completely clear this legislation will only remove the graham leach by the annual privacy notes requirement of an institution if an institution has not in any way changed its privacy policy or note or procedures this legislation does not exempt any institution from an initial privacy notice nor does it allow a loophole for an institution to avoid issuing an updated notice we worked in a bipartisan fashion to amend this legislation to remove the stipulations for state regulated financial institutions the amendment language is now identical to the language the legislation passed by the house by a voice vote in 111th congress additionally i would like to remind my colleagues that's similar language language that was the basis for the first version of legislation passed in both 109th and 110th congresses this language is not controversial does not jeopardize consumer privacy and it does not exempt any institution from having to produce an initial or amended privacy notice this legislation does eliminate millions of costly confusing and often ignored mailings and as with the passion of spill the information included in these mailings would likely become more significant to the consumer because it would come only after a change in the privacy policy this legislation is supported by independent community bankers of america credit union national association the american banker association national association federal credit unions and the consumer bankers association among others i'd like to thank the gentleman from california mr sherman for his work on this bill also like to thank general bacchus ranking chairman capito ranking remember maloney for their work with us toward a swift passage of legislation with that mr speaker ask the colleagues for my i'll ask my colleagues for their support and i yield

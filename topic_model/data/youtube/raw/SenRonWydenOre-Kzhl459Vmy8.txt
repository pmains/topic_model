the debate about boilers madam president stems from the fact that epa did not originally get the boiler rules right the agency admitted that they didn't get them right and the agency said that they needed 15 months to fix the boiler rules but the court said that the agency couldn't have the time they said that epa could have 30 days to fix the rules and as colleagues said this debate has gone on for so long there's no way it's going to be turned around in 30 days so madam president i joined in the legislation to give epa 15 months to rewrite the rules so as to protect good paying jobs and communities that are affected by the boiler rules while ensuring the health of our people and the protection of our environment now madam president that was 15 months ago epa got the time it said that it needed to rewrite the rules and the new final rules will be out within 90 days the question i'd ask senators is who knows what will happen to these important rules that are just about ready for implementation if in effect we say as the amendment does let's go back to the beginning and talk about addressing this again over 15 months if the amendment passes an epa is told as i've been advised under the text of the amendment to take another 15 months in my view what would happen is the agency would go back to spending this additional time working to try to get to the point where we are today that in my view madam president just doesn't add up it doesn't add up for the industries that have been concerned about this it doesn't add up for the communities it doesn't add up for the health of our people and the protection of our environment i urge the senate to reject the amendment we're going to continue to watchdog this issue until these rules are fully uh implemented and with that madam president i yield the floor

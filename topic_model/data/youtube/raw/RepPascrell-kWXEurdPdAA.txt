DeFazio continues to speak out over the din and over the years for the American consumer and for fair trade policies I salute you the United States has run a persistent trade deficit with the world since 1978 including structural deficits were with several major trading partners year after year this includes a 220 billion dollar trade deficit with China alone in 2001 just think of it nine years ago China was granted admission to the World Trade Organization that number was 84 billion its increased in nine years by 136 billion dollars one study by the economic policy institute estimates that the dramatic increase in our trade deficit with China alone has cost this country 2.4 million jobs the American people the middle class know that our trade policy has not worked for them they see in their everyday lives my own town of Paterson New Jersey I still live there we open we closed factories we reopen them south of the border or overseas why haven't we stopped the hemorrhaging of jobs to places offshore a minute the gentleman from New Jersey is additional two minutes thank you gentlemen we cannot continue down this path our trade deficit is unsustainable we must begin to tackle it if we want to create jobs here in the United States or remain a prosperous country in the future there's no silver bullet out there that will balance the books which is why a comprehensive study of the problem and recommendations for policy solutions which is prescribed in this legislation specifically is very necessary the Commission will look at many of the tactics we know our trading partners use in order to place their exports at an advantage in in order that they have played and gained the system to our disadvantage foreign currency manipulation we've addressed it in some esoteric statements now and then but we know what China is doing and it hurts us in terms of what the Americas are trying to do tariff and non-tariff barriers just mentioned before in the previous legislation by the gentleman from Illinois foreign subsidiary of manufacturing other countries have different tax taxing methodologies than we do they subsidize their industries how can our industries compete against that unless we address that particular issue which are afraid to do both sides of the aisle are afraid to address the real issues on trade in the week environmental and labor standards I'm pleased the Commission will include the impact of border tax adjustments on our trade deficit which penalize our exporters by an average of 15.2 percent and are currently totally legal on the current global trade agreements we will not deal with the imbalance and our trade agreements unless we understand how countries have gamed the system to her our workers and that's why we continue to offshore these jobs at the end of the day the gentleman's time has spired additional additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey thank the gentleman at the end of the day the United States is the most open accessible and dynamic market in the world we hold our trading partners hopefully to the same standard we must tackle our trade deficit head-on so that United States businesses and families can continue to prosper in years to come I urge passage of this legislation I eagerly await the report of the Commission I yield the rest of my time back which is nothing but thank you mr. speaker and thank you

good afternoon and thank you chairman Collins ranking member McCaskill and distinguished members of the committee for holding this hearing my name is Bernie Heyman and I am here today to share my personal experience as a Wilson disease patient confronted with sudden and dramatic increases in drug pricing and also to speak for others with devastating illnesses facing high drug price increases having Wilson disease is like being stuck in a tunnel this genetic disease is bad enough with its many uncertainties risks of organ or cognitive failure but the exit to the tunnel is barricaded because of obscene drug costs the cost increased by a factor of more than 20 over the past five years the drug is essential people can die without it the drug company deserves the right to make a profit but it is unconscious that one company valiant can hold Wilson disease patients hostage Wilson disease is treatable with proper medication progress of the disease can be haunted and a patient can live a normal life treatment is aimed at removing excess copper and preventing reef cumulation treatment for Wilson disease is lifelong I was undiagnosed for 60 years making me one of the older individuals to survive that long without medical intervention I was shocked when a radiologist informed me i had cirrhosis of the liver a DNA test confirmed that i had wilson disease and i immediately began taking supreme I was librarian at the College of William and Mary and had very good health and drug insurance upon retirement I was insured through Medicare including Part D along with supplemental insurance Cyprien has been around more 30 years it's an old drug as I understand it valiant did not spend a cent on research and development for this drug Balian purchased the drug in 2010 and began increasing prices my copay for Cyprien was under seven hundred dollars per year until 2013 by 2014 my projected copay exceeded ten thousand dollars per year with my insurance paying over two hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year that is untenable something has to be done my doctor and I applied four valence patient assistance program and I was denied financial assistance I then wrote Michael Pearson the CEO of alien asking why there was such a dramatic price increase valiant customer service replied the investments to develop and distribute novel medicines are only viable if there is a reasonable return on the company's investment the president of the Wilson Disease Association and my doctor communicated with valiant representatives and we're told I did not qualify for aid because i was on medicare i also applied to patient access network foundation and was told my income precluded support from their foundation my doctor and I then discussed switching to an alternative in 2014 october i switched to galcen a zinc salt galcen works differently than supreme it inhibits the absorption of copper rather than extracting it is this treatment sufficient for me we are still monitoring its effectiveness galcen cost me about four hundred and eighty dollars per year the only reason I changed was the cost even though none of the cost is covered by my insurance my health was stable with Cyprien and my doctor and I made the change only under duress galcen is not the preferred treatment for me a year after I stopped taking cybering a reporter from The Financial Times interviewed me and then talk to valiant about my case later that day a valiant representative called offering to help he noted that while valence strives to help everyone there are limits because of the government he said he might be able to work with me as an exception I told him I did not want to be an exception I wanted everyone to have the same opportunity if the money for assistance comes from insurance companies we are still paying if the money comes from the government we ultimately pay the price shifting who pays doesn't solve the problem then a local florist called inquiring where to deliver flowers they told me valiance sent the flowers with a note saying it was a pleasure talking to me and to let them know if they could be of assistance I refused the flowers and asked that the sender be informed of my refusal my doctor and I received letters stating I was enrolled in the assistance program and receiving free Cyprien which was not true a message was also left on my phone asking if I still needed help all of this happened more than a year after I stopped taking cybering this is my story I am fortunate but i do not want others to face these same challenges I don't have answers but as a victim of this disease and the outrageously high cost of the preferred drug to treat the disease i do question how valiant can justify financially and morally how increasing the price of supreme can be done since it is an old rug out of patent and has been reasonably priced until they began manufacturing it thank you for the opportunity to address the committee today and for the opportunity hopefully to contribute to some action to stem this contemptible development in the pricing of orphan drugs I look forward to answering any quest shins you might have

on the other end of our line congressman bill Huizenga the Republican from West Michigan how are you sir hey MPs doing well and I think I'd have to go with an elephant it would seem appropriate you are a Republican after all that's right who would want a donkey that would be kind of a funny thing you gotta clean up after him hey what do you think is going to happen in Congress now with this student loan issue oh my gosh yeah this is interesting we woke up to a couple of interesting editorials one on Wall Street Journal today which reminds us it's not just about rates we got to talk about college costs and what's been happening there but you know our our good senator here has been pushing the Senate plan The Washington Post not me The Washington Post said that was quote quote a pathetic non solution and quote to what what's going on and I wholeheartedly agree I mean we all they want to do is just punt once again you know let's let's put this off for another year and come up with a real solution guess what that's what we did last year the house came up with a market-based solution in the Senate's not willing to do it I just I don't get it why not I mean what's wrong with that market-based solution well that's a good question i mean the president has asked for that he understands that we need to we need to start making this market-based and so what we're going to do in the house we and by the way we've reacted on this in may when we pass our bill and it takes 10 year treasury notes and adds two and a half percent on that and and that that seems to me a reasonable it's not just about rates it's sort of like buying a home right now you know are you going to buy a home or not buy a home based on whether that interest rate is half a percent higher or you're going to do it based on how the cost of the home sort of the same thing with college education here we've got to make sure that we bring a market-based solution but we do have to make sure that we're attacking those costs that these students are coming up with a night look I've got kids in high school it's coming up quick I've got a nephew and a niece that it both had to suspend their their college and my nephew he's had to deal with another interesting thing because of Obamacare his employer at the restaurant called him in and said sorry nobody's going to be getting more than 29 hours so you know that those kinds of things are really punches to the gut for our for our students when you wait does it scare people when you say market-based with is it my understanding the Democrats want to lock it in at a low rate so it stays right there that sounds appealing or do I have that wrong well it sounds appealing the problem is is that we know that a long-term interest rates are going to be going up the Fed has said that we we need to make sure that we're aware of that and what are we going to do are we going to make sure that everything is handled by the federal government subsidized by the federal government or are we going to just like we have with our home loans and our car loans of student loans are we going to have those based on what interest rates really are and again it's got to be more than just the decision about what interest rates are we gotta look at college costs we got to look at the debt and the burden that students are coming out of in their study after study showing that these kids are coming out just absolutely swamped with debt and that that's a huge huge problem we got it we got we got to deal with that you expect some kind of action today or is it a stalemate I mean we've already we're already past the deadline it have to be retroactive at this point yeah in the Senate will see what they're going to do there get a test vote today to find out whether they're going to be able to really move forward I can tell you this Washington Post editorial probably is not going to help their cause it's it's kind of become a laughingstock here in DC let me play one clip for you this is karl rove the guy they called the bushes brain and he took after your colleague in west michigan there justin amash here's what he said National Journal put out its ratings of the most liberal to conservative Republicans most liberal Republican is Justin Amash of Michigan far more living far more liberal than any other Republican and why because he is a one hundred percent purist libertarian and it was not entirely perfect I'm voting with Nancy Pelosi which is how he gives up with all these liberal ratings I vote no because unless my side has something that's completely one hundred percent perfect any reaction to that congressman huizinga I know obviously we all have we have our constituents that we have to deal with I'm a conservative I'm not not a libertarian yeah and those are going to have some some differences when you know when you're dealing with whether it was the funding of Planned Parenthood or you know the Keystone pipeline and some of those other things Justin and I differ but that that's okay I you know we're we all have to be comfortable with where we're at he obviously is very comfortable with where he's at and at the end of the day we we all get very public job reviews every two years and at some point or another you got to go before the the electorate and in plead your case so he's he's got it again it all depends too on what you look at whether it's national journal or all these other things there's there's there's a lot of different metrics that you can use so I'm comfortable where there i'm at he's comfortable with where he's at two very interesting congressman bill heisting of the Republican from West Michigan on Michael Patrick Scheels weather is

so when you have your house built in warren county there are some rules that make sense about how the plumbing's done the electricity to make sure things are to code and that's so there's safety in your house and some of that's reasonable and we've had it for a long time in local communities there's a bill in washington that would federalize that and the concern is that it wouldn't be about safety but it would be adding cost to the house so my concern is that if you're trying to get in your first house if you live in an apartment and you're trying to buy your first house if the building code becomes federalized and we add ten thousand dollars to the price of the house maybe people trying to buy their first house won't be able to afford the first house so i think those rules should be done locally not in washington so i'm blocking a bill up there that would federalize the home building code i think the code ought to be determined locally and in the state if you need assistance with federal agencies please contact our bowling green office or visit our website

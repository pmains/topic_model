and Mike low thanks Mike bill Eliza congressional delegation showing rare bipartisan support for the strike democratic representative Brad Schneider calling the reaction measured but like Senator Duckworth he wants a more comprehensive plan from the Trump administration for moving forward in war-torn Syria we caught up with Snyder earlier this afternoon well look I think it is important to the point of vital that not just the United States with the international community stand up to Syria make it clear to Syria and any one other any other individual or government does considering uses chemical weapons that it will not be allowed and we will not let it stand I think the military strike last night that went after the very specific air base from which attacks into believing the week or launched what was appropriate and measured you had an attack Syria understands the United States symptom is a clear indication that we are not going to sit idly by while Assad uses chemical weapons on his own people Bashar al-assad is demonstrated willingness to do that it is a war crime is committed many more times in the six years Civil War and so I think this was an important statement that said I think it is critical that the president president Trump share with Congress a clearly articulated comprehensive strategy to address and achieve what our goals are in Syria so it needs to state the gold makes the state the strategy and Congress has a responsibility to weigh in I think it's important for the president to come to Congress for an authorization for further use of military force and Congressman Schneider also said no matter what happens next Syrian President Bashar al-assad needs to be held accountable I think there's reason to be concerned by a lot of the things president Trump said before he was president since he's been been president I was very concerned by the Secretary of State's cavalier attitude towards via the events in Syria we also be very clear there's not a military solution to a civil war in Syria a war in which nearly half the population is into place this place 500,000 people have been killed war crimes have been the norm not not the unusual exception but it's going to be a political solution that will bring Syria to a better place you know what we we should be trying to do we need to be working to do the United States working with international community is changing the calculus of both sides that they understand that they will not achieve a military bringing them to the table for a political solution a political solution that in my mind does not include opportunity for Assad to remain in power but more importantly a requirement that Assad will be held to account now many local Syrian Americans

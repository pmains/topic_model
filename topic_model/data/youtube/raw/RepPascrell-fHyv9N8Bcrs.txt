pleased to yield as much time as he may consume to my colleague from Paterson New Jersey mr. Pascrell gentleman from New Jersey is recognized Thank You mr. speaker and I want to thank both managers hitch up Stadium overlooks the Great Falls of Paterson New Jersey one of the largest waterfalls on the East Coast in the United States it was built by the citizens of Paterson as a public works project during a very difficult financial situation in the United States 1932 and it was named for the mayor at that time Judge John Hinchcliffe the stadium site sits directly adjacent to the Great Falls National Historical Park and you know the new york yankees played their to New York Cubans these games featured Baseball Hall of Famers such as Patterson's own hometown hero Larry Dobie the first player to integrate the American League other greats such as Josh Gibson Oscar Charleston and judy johnson made their appearances here besides baseball the stadium hosted events in professional football boxing wrestling soccer even auto racing throughout its long and storied history they also was the home of the participants as a professional football team and the great concerts that went on there recently it played host to all high school sports under the stewardship of the Paterson public schools but sadly the stadium has satiny stated this used since 1997 when they can no longer the school system afford to keep up with the maintenance however this legislation would not place the burden of restoration or maintenance on the National Park Service this bill would spur private donations as well as the state and local investments to make the necessary improvements in insulin stadium the stewardship of the National Park server we'll simply provide certainty about Hinchcliffe future mr. speaker we're not talking about putting purple ropes around an edifice we want this stadium to be functional again and I think therefore Hinchcliffe stating provides a golden opportunity for the Park Service to meet its goal of reaching out to urban communities minorities and immigrant groups this legislation would vastly enhance the significance of the Great Falls National Historical Park which this body had voted on a few years ago although the Great Falls parks current historic assets focus on Patterson's role as the birthplace of American industry Hinchcliffe stadium shows us the human side of our workers the blue-collar worker who came to this country who came to patterson to work in mills to wave of emigration and great migration their descendants are the Palestinians and New Jerseyans and Americans today and new immigrants continue to seek the American Dream as it was originally introduced the legislation establishing the Paterson Great Falls National Park included Hinchcliffe stating within park boundaries the stadium's historic significance was found to be in need of further study the study was completed last year reaching a conclusion at the people of New Jersey have long known that Hinchcliffe stadium has played a vital role in our history as a result Hinchcliffe stadium was designated as a National Historic Landmark the importance of this effort to the people of New Jersey is evidenced by the fact that the entire New Jersey delegation has joined together as original co-sponsors and of course in a bipartisan way we have the support of the broad group of stakeholders from local community organizations to a large so advocacy organization I would ask permission to enter into the record the letters of support from the National Baseball Hall of Fame the National Trust for Historic Preservation the National Parks Conservation Association the New Jersey community development corporation they Hamilton partnership of Paterson the Friends of Hinchcliffe stadium our former pass mayor mayor Kramer and current chair of the Great Falls Advisory Commission and the current property on the Patterson Board of Education mr. speaker our nation has recognized the significance of inch love stadiums contributions to our country in our history this is a vital part of the history of our state and our nation now is the time to ensure that the story has a place in our national park system for generations to come I would urge my colleagues to join in supporting this legislation I thank you for this time and I yield back and I fact against both managers with

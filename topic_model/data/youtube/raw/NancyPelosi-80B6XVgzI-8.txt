I now have a very very great privilege I think this might be the first time I had this opportunity in my life to introduce an extraordinary leader a woman of righteous courage a Democratic House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi good afternoon everyone and a good afternoon it is here we stand in this historic Capitol building on the wall looking down from us is president lyndon johnson who signed and fought for the civil rights bill as well as the civil rights act as well as Voting Rights Act Medicare Medicaid many anniversaries this year out the window we see the Supreme Court in full view from where we stand and as senator Booker said engraved on its walls are as the vision of America in this room we stand with an icon of ending discrimination in voting liberty and justice for all John Lewis also in this room we have the voice of the future this little child with their moms with their moms and we are here to put forth historic legislation because of the leadership in the house of David Cicilline aided by jared Polis I got over a hundred and fifty co-sponsors in a matter of hours it was quite remarkable and we thank them for their leadership and we thank Senator Merkley for his leadership in the United States Senate Thank You senator Merkley for your leadership but all of the inside maneuvering that is done would not be successful or possible without the outside mobilization and for that i want to thank Chad Griffin when he Stackelberg Mara Keisling for their leadership thank you for helping to make this day possible and pretty soon we're going to be hearing for the real stars of the day when we hear from our guest Krista and Jamie Contreras Carter Brown and Luke Peterson there what we're here about but I want to associate my interest of time associate myself with the remarks of all who have gone before me that's pretty presumptuous because they were pretty great senator volca right before me senator and John Lewis before him and Damian and there to lead sponsors but i want to add this because we're talking about history and where we stand in our perspective and how we got here it hasn't been that long ago when we passed in the Congress the hate crimes legislate fully inclusive hate crimes legislation that was step one and it was a big step and then we had the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell with the help of President Obama taking the lead and we salute him for his courage and leadership there and then the court the marriage equality crimes Don't Ask Don't Tell Enda and marriage equality both the court and the public took care of the marriage equality issue but more work needs to be done and so it was time for Enda and we looked at Endor and thought most people thought there wasn't discrimination in the workplace against LGBT people they didn't think so they were because we live in California so what but that when we went to address that issue David and Jared and others and Jeff in and Tammy and others and friends outside said wait a minute there is no place for discrimination in America not in employment not in housing not in transportation not in health care not in any subject that you can name because we live in America Anna's other speakers have said in a book or most recent with liberty and justice for all we pledge allegiance to that every day we pledge elite liberty and justice for all for all and our founders when we take that pledge and when we honor it we honor the vows of our founders who pledged life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all Americans so what we are doing here today is very patriotic it's very American and it's a proud day for all of us who have been engaged in this fight for a long time to see what people call now the rapid process like a star is born LGBT community which has been fighting the fight for many many years so thank all of you have borne the pain who have fought the fight and now hopefully savor the victory and I just want to add one more thing this legislation is very good it has very strong protections for women in it so for many reasons this is a cause for celebration

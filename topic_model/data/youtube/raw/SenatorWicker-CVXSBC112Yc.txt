Thank You mr. chairman my question is for mr. modally and it concerns the 355 ship requirement as I hope you know mr. Mowgli this committee has taken this requirement seriously as has the House Armed Services Committee and we've included language in both authorization bills to facilitate this I was disappointed to hear the acting under secretary of the Navy mr. Thomas D say recently that the Navy's 355 ship requirement is probably out of reach until the 2050s I act frankly a little tired of hearing this sort of thing from the Navy we had a 307 ship requirement we had a 313 ship requirement I would continue to ask about that members of this committee would continue to ask about that and we would get lip service but no action now as I understand it from hearings that we've had generals and admirals throughout the service have been asked what the need is then we've trimmed it down to accommodate the the fiscal constraints that we have and that 355 ships is our minimum needed to protect the United States interest I'm glad to know that the Chief of Naval Operations supports this requirement I am heartened to know that the Secretary of the Navy disagrees with mr. D and I think a 355 ship fleet should be our goal for the next decade and I can tell you that that members of this committee the leadership of this committee are looking at ways to make this a reality so do you take this 355 ship requirement seriously mr. Mowgli yes senator and are you committed to achieving this 355 ship requirement yes sir if confirmed cannot count on you to support the requirement without hedging and equivocation yes senator the the John s McCain and Fitzgerald collisions reminded us that the Navy has a supply and demand problem there aren't enough ships to meet growing mission requirements we're going to try to do our part in Congress we need the top civilian and uniformed leadership in the Navy to get behind its own requirement Mr modally what are your thoughts about innovative ways to accomplish this goal are there better ways to buy ships faster through what other procurement methods have you given thought to about receipt about attaining this 355 ship requirement well senator I think there are we're gonna have to be creative first of all because it's a shipbuilding capacity needs to be invested in in order to be able to meet this goal we have ships that we currently have in fairly decent condition that have been mothballed they can be brought out at a much lower cost than actually acquiring a new ship I'm very much in favor of the frigate program where they're going to be looking at existing designs rather than starting from scratch there are proven proven designs ships that are in the water that are performing missions around the world that we can look at and I think those are some of the ways that we can really accelerate the path towards 350 we can extend the lives of current ships can we not yes sir yes and mr. Kurtz you're nodding your head yes sir I would agree with that mr. Marley I think you have to take a multiple approach here extend the ships you have as long as you can aggressively look to increase ship affection at the max rate that the industrial supply can can handle and then work closely on those ships we may have in Ready Reserve that we could activate rapidly on to get up on the step and to both of you gentlemen isn't it a fact that our current shipyards have capacity for increased shipbuilding manufacturing currently isn't that a fact it's my understanding sir that they have the capacity but to meet the goals to get to 355 they're gonna have to invest too but they're only going to invest if they know there's a commitment from the Navy to do this it only makes sense from them from a business perspective and I support their perspective on that so we have to show resolve that this is what we're gonna and we and we want to help you from from this side of the table also to show resolve because our nation needs it and the people who've stepped forward and volunteered for hazardous service and in support of their country needed and deserve it thank you very much Thank You mr. chairman

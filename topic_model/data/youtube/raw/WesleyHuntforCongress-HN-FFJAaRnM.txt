texas congressional candidate wesley hunt joins us now to talk about inflation and what it does to the vote coming up uh good morning how are you sir good morning how are y'all doing today we're doing well we just ran down some of the numbers in advance of your appearance here in terms of the polls and uh the impact of inflation on people and there's a bigger impact at least reported by the individuals demographically speaking by minorities and they are tired of it and they believe that maybe it's time to start voting republican that's got to make you feel uh pretty good right but i'm actually feeling great and i want to say something as well that that that this impact has actually had impact had an impact on everyone on all relations all races religions colors and creeds but the democrat party is a party that claims to be the party for minorities and yet minority communities all across the country were far better off under president trump and under joe biden black men and black women were employed at an all-time high the honor the unemployment rate for hispanics was at the lowest that has ever been in recorded history and in just 15 months that vanished and again i'm always a big fan of our party the republican party because we believe that the rising tide raised the elevation of all ships we were all better off because we are the party that that's about a meritocracy about doing the right thing for everyone about having low regulation and low taxes and let allowing everyone to prosper so this past year has been ridiculous and people of color are waking up it's probably time you know does it take this though i want to ask you this it's personal i guess as a former apache helicopter pilot what would have it meant to you if you had to depend on russia or iran or some other country a bad actor to be able to fly that helicopter in combat as you did you know great question ma'am and even add to it just a year ago or two years ago we were completely energy independent we are sitting here in texas in the united states and god has blessed us with the permigan basin and a marcello shale we have our own natural resources we don't have to rely on dirtier oil from russia or or or or these horrible regimes like iran and the middle east like we had to rely on them in the past we were literally energy independent and with one stroke of offense joe biden destroyed all of that it's really sad because this we went from literally having the policies that put americans first and then now this is clearly the america's second regime we have to get better about this i think this midterm is going to be outstanding for our party because now we know what socialism gets us we're going to take back at least 50 seats i think we have a really good chance at getting the senate and we're definitely going to take back the presidency here in 2024 because people are waking up to these failed policies of socialism how long wesley hunt will it take though if you do if the republicans do win majority majority in november will it take to get anything changed considering it likely will not be a super majority a veto proof majority and biden is still going to hold that card great question so our constitution is set up for things to move slowly and i think what we're going to do is we're going to have an opportunity to make a contract with our country and say hey we're going to do these 15 to 30 13 to 15 things and we're going to get them done in the house and then we're going to show the american people that we can stop the direction that we're heading right now you're right you're right uh if if the democrats keep the senate and if uh joe biden will probably say well joe biden or someone else will probably still be the president you know it's going to be tough but that's kind of good gridlock is good sometimes in our country that's how it's supposed to be set up and then that gives us an opportunity to build on what we say we're going to do uh in 2022 and then go into the senate and then go into the presidency in 2024 and then take back all three chambers and then we can negotiate on our terms which in my opinion are far more reasonable and far more rational than what we've seen in the last 16 months

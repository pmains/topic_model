someday a hundred years from now family will camp on a masive in Utah or hillside at North Carolina or they'll hike the rocky coast of Maine and it will be because of the work that we're going to do this week in this Congress what we are talking about this week and the great American outdoors Act is making a gift to our fellow Americans setting aside special places setting aside opportunities for outdoors and recreation is a sacred trust and it's one that goes back to the beginning of this country there's very little that we can do that's permanent but this is one of those things a visit to Maine to see the Seacoast and the forest would be rewarding for any family and what we're doing today will enable families to continue to make these kinds of journeys the next generation and the next and the next they won't know who it was but they will know what we did

health disparities in minority communities are stark African Americans have the highest death rate in short a survival rate of any racial and ethnic group in the United States for most cancers for the next few minutes we'll discuss efforts to advance health equity hello everyone and welcome to Comcast newsmakers I'm Robert Traynham and I'm joined today by congressman Donald Payne jr. he's a democrat from new jersey congressman welcome to the program well thank you for having it is always good to see you i know this is near and dear to your heart not only because you are a minority but because your parents sadly died of your mom died of brain cancer and your father most recently about what three four years ago three years died of colon cancer yes why is it that in the brown community whether it's a Latino community or the african-american community even in a Native American community when you take a look at diabetes when you take a look at health issues in general there's a huge disparity well just just as their disparities in the economic wealth of different Americans of different racial groups in this country it seems to permeate health issues as well more educated people or seem to have better understanding of what they need to do in terms of staying healthy and we find that being the case in the brown or communities as well it really should not be that way and so we are continuing to push the efforts in making sure that we make sure that people are aware of their health needs to promote more better living sure so we know that healthy eating is a part of this puzzle if you will we know that some of its genetics we also know that it's its culture and so forth you mentioned raising awareness how do you do that in the context of if someone is eating a plate of fried chicken and macaroni and cheese and things that are just a part of the community but we know that's a wrong thing but it's but it's part of our culture how do we change the behavior if you will you really have to set examples for people you're really beating them over the head and making them feel negatively about what they're doing doesn't seem to help you shut people out writing them off so you really have down to them it's patronizing that all of those two exactly so you you have to send an example me recently myself in going through a major medical scare room I got an infection in my foot and I had been a non-compliant diabetic for over 20 years not doing the things that I needed to do knowing what I should do but just not being not being non-compliant has led me to an issue now where my diabetes is hampering the healing of a foot room that I have so it's become evidently clear to me what I need to do so we need to just continue to beat the drum and get as many people through nonprofits through their religious groups through any way we can reach people to bring these disparities to learn Congress would I think one of the biggest things that we can tell individuals that are watching a program at home or in their smart device have a relationship with your doctor yeah be open with him or her about your diet and exercise and so forth there's a lot of things that one can do in order to contribute to their overall wellness absolutely talk to us about what the Congress is doing in terms of funding in terms of raising awareness and so forth well you know I have a piece of legislation that is moving through the Congress it's called removing barriers to access act and what that will do is will allow people to get the type of colonoscopy screens as you spoke of my father colorectal cancer has become a mission of mine in trying to eradicate it it's this it's the second leading killer of african-americans in the cancer Illaria my grandfather died of it my uncle died of it and my father had it we got about 10 seconds left and it's the most curable and it's the most curable you're absolutely right so just raising awareness yes congressman Donald Payne democrat from new jersey thank you very much best of luck when a speedy recovery for you and please keep up the great work in terms of raising the awareness thank you very much it and thank you for joining us for this edition of Comcast newsmakers I'm Robert Traynham have a great day everybody will see you next time make sure you have a great relationship with your doctor to raise your webs

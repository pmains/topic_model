Democrats like to tell you that Republicans are against unions but is that true so tell me if the following stance sounds reasonable or not we think that if you want to join a union you should be able to join a union you should be able to choose to join a union if you want to pay dues pay your dues but if you want to independently contract make your own hours set your own rates then you should be able to do that too if that sounds reasonable to you then the next cut of questions would be why isn't that a bipartisan stance so last week Democrats passed the protecting the right to organize act in reality it doesn't protect any rights it actually forces workers to organize into a union when they might not have wanted to so it actually repeals right-to-work laws in 27 states these kind of laws give workers the freedom to either choose to pay union dues or not paying induce it's up to them this would actually force them to pay money that they might not have or not want to pay to a union that they don't really support so what is this really doing it's taking laws that have been in place in California that aren't working and it's trying to nationalize them so by dramatically redefining the way employees are hired this bill actually disrupts your ability to independently contract or participate in the gig economy so what does this mean well first of all it means that businesses hire less because they have more costs incurred on them but worse than that it's harmful to the employees and the workers out there who just want to sell their labor on their own terms so like who well uber drivers for one you would no longer be able to drive part-time or with any kind of flexibility in California ventriloquist's sheep shearers face painters all of these kinds of people who just want to sell their labor immigrants who want to sell their skill sets and language skills to be interpreters in Monterey California where we have the Defense Language Institute they're having problems with this bill in California so why would we want to nationalize bad California policy because this isn't about workers it is about union bosses it is about the leaders of these organizations that send hundreds of millions of dollars every year to left-wing causes between 2010 and 21.6 billion dollars to left-wing advocacy organizations organizations like Planned Parenthood and the progressive Democrats of America so why are Democrats doing this why are they passing this bill they're trying to help themselves not workers

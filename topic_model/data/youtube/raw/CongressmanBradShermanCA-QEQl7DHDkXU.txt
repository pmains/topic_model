thank you the next 48 hours has become even more pivotal in the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh his accuser of an alleged sexual assault decades ago has come forward and wants to testify joining us to discuss that and more congressman brad Sherman of Sherman Oaks he's a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia welcome back to mining see you so the attorney for this California professor who has come forward dr. Christine Blasi Ford says she wants to testify in public there are some Republicans who are saying now yes let's take a pause and hear from both sides here is this gonna turn into another Anita Hill like hearing I don't think that any of the Senators on the committee will be as disrespectful to dr. Ford as senators we're decades ago - Anita Hill but I can't imagine they're gonna go forward with a vote on Thursday obviously Kavanagh says he wants to testify dr. Ford ones to testify and what's what's more important and a bigger reason for the delay because I care how a Supreme Court justice votes is that they're over 600,000 pages that the archives are supposed to deliver to the Senate but they have to go through them it takes a while and they won't have them till late October so this unseemly effort to try to confirm a justice before we know what his paper record is what we do know is that he met with Donald Trump Donald Trump has promised to put somebody on the Supreme Court that will overturn roe v wade and I think Donald Trump is the real answer as to how Cavanaugh will vote it has been a few days since we have seen president Trump following you know news that his former campaign manager Paul manna for it has a cooperation agreement with the Muller investigation what is your prediction there when it comes to President Trump you know some saying may not survive manna for testifying we'll have to see what with Manta Ford has to say he has made a very ad plea deal which anticipates that he might spend as much as ten years in prison that's in part because he waited so long to make the deal that's also might indicate that he doesn't have that much to offer I think if Manta Ford had pictures of Donald Trump at KGB headquarters he wouldn't be facing ten years in prison he wouldn't negotiate at something else so I think it's Manta Ford will shed an awful lot of light and may lead to some additional leads but I don't think that this thing is over I think the obstruction of justice case has already been proven the collusion case is going to take a while you were the first congressman to suggest and to introduce a bill Moo asking to move forward with an impeachment of President Trump your leadership hasn't supported that yet many people on the Democrat side are saying we don't want to talk about that going into the midterms and and over the weekend at Kent Starr the former independent counsel said that trying to impress and Trump would be quote a hell the country does not need what's your what are your thoughts well I think the last 18 months has been a hell the country does not need we do need to enforce our Constitution at the same time there's more votes of four people if our slogan is contained Trump then if our slogan is removed from when I introduced articles of impeachment I thought that was my constitutional responsibility and I did it as far away from an election as I could possibly be I might have an election every two years so you're always within two years of election but I introduced the articles of impeachment in July of last year okay we want to get your take on this you're a member of the Subcommittee on Asia what do you think about tomorrow's scheduled meeting between North Korea's Kim jong-un and South Korean president moon jae-in it's happening Pyongyang what are the possibilities the hurdles of these two countries reuniting after having been divided for so long oh I I doubt very much that they will reunite the way Germany did anytime soon Kim jong-un has a fiefdom that he he controls he's in effect on monarch third generation he's not going to give that up I was briefed by the ambassador of South Korea they're hopeful but hopeful in terms of little steps keep in mind that we have given up an awful lot we are not really enforcing the sanctions we are not sanctioning for example the large Chinese banks that are stupid still doing business with North Korea and all they've done is they left the missiles out of their parade we still got the missiles they just it was nice not to put them in the parade and they you know they haven't been threatened they haven't aur√©lie threatened us with nuclear weapons in many weeks but we gave up those Sur sizes that are so important to keeping readiness and to demonstrating our commitment to South Korea so we've given up a lot and it'll be interesting to see keep in mind that continuously and right up to the day North Korea is producing more fissile material they will produce enough for two or three nuclear weapons this year and that hasn't stopped once again congressman brad sherman senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia

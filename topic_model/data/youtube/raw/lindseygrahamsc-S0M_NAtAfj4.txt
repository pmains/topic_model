and this is a fox news alert the obama administration has released 100 pages of benghazi related emails that directly contradict what press secretary jay carney has been telling us since the beginning now the documents confirmed that the white house and the state department in fact did play a large role in changing those benghazi talking points and also breaking tonight attorney general eric holder testified on capitol hill earlier about the ap phone scandal but before he entered the building a reporter from breitbart.com asked him about investigating benghazi here's what he had to say mr holder you appointed special counsel to investigate benghazi no joining me now with reaction south carolina senator lindsey graham senator let's start with benghazi let's start with the document done today do you think a we've got all the documents and what do you take out of these emails well i haven't seen the emails but i know why they were released they had to the pressure is building on on multiple fronts and for the first time we're beginning to get information about the white house's involvement in changing the talking points if i could have the answer to one question out of benghazi it would be the following who chose susan rice to go out on sunday the 15th of september to tell a story so disconnected from reality yeah well we'd like to know the answer to that are you confident that we have all the emails now or do you know that there are more that exist there's a lot more that exist about how the emails about how the talking points were manipulated what we got tonight was selective edited redacted and this is that does not in any way tell the true story because it does reveal that the white house but by the way it proves that jay carney is a total propaganda hack liar and that he should not he should be fired that's number one number two it also shows that the state department was up to its eyeballs in creating this lie and that there were political considerations both at the white house and and within the state department do these emails tell us how the talking points got changed from the intelligence version to what susan rice was given did they tell us why they were changed and did they tell us how they came to pick her of all people she was the most politically compliant person close to the president didn't know anything about benghazi but she was auditioning for secretary of state did they tell us how that came about how did we get to they had the talking points right they were going to tell the american people the truth and it evolved into an elaborate web of lies where nothing was true how did we get to that point well because of the election you don't have to be sherlock holmes to figure this out the story of benghazi if accurately reported would undercut the narrative bin laden's dead al qaeda's on the run and they manipulated the evidence to help their political re-election that's pretty obvious all right that's not all questions stay right there we'll come back when we come back i want to talk about a joint resolution that you're working on with the house as we continue with senator lindsey graham right after the break right here on hannity and we continue now with south carolina senator lindsey graham all right three big scandals senator what have we learned the last couple of days about the administration uh very political sometimes incredibly incompetent and they won't tell you anything unless you just keep pounding the wall and be persistent what do you think that the the president portrayed the the irs commissioner the interim one as being fired basically he was already planning on leaving well i i can't explain why no one's been held accountable before during after the debacle called benghazi they're reacting in a pretty appropriate way on the irs side you know he's not defending what happened he's saying we're going to get to the bottom of it good job mr president here's what i'd like him to say tomorrow about benghazi i am hereby as commander-in-chief president united states authorizing every agency of the government who has a survivor or someone who participated in benghazi the ability to come forward and talk to the congress without fear of reprisal i'm going to turn over to the congress uh all the relevant documents all the survivors all those who participated and let the chips fall where they may i wish he would do that well i wish you would too now you are working with members of congress for a joint resolution to do what in case he doesn't do that i'm going to try to challenge our democratic colleagues who have been stonewalling and defending the administration to follow it on benghazi we're going to do a joint resolution of the house and senate insisting that the administration make available to the congress the names of the survivors so we can interview them all the relevant information and those who participated in benghazi so we can get to the truth if you're going to provide to the accountability review board access to the survivors and all the documents surrounding surrounding benghazi you should do the same for the congress and i'm challenging my democratic colleagues to stop defending this administration and start pushing for the truth when it comes to benghazi four americans lost their lives in a death trap how did it become so such a death trap before why couldn't we help them during the attack for seven and a half hours and how did the story change so dramatically seven weeks before an election so we got a partial document dumped today and right and this is eight over eight and a half months later and you still don't know who the survivors are nor have you had the opportunity to speak with most of them in that unbelievable eight months after the attack we haven't heard one word voluntarily from a survivor who was at benghazi we don't really know lieutenant colonel gibson who told him to stand down we'll be talking about benghazi for months not because of politics but because when americans die in harm's way and when a bond has been broken between those who serve our nation in dangerous places in their government it must be repaired and the only way you can repair it is get to the truth stop the stonewalling give us the information so we can find out what happened and let the chips fall where they may all right senator it's always good to see you keep up the good work we uh thank you regardless of political affiliation people deserve answers we deserve the truth from our government thank you sir thank you sean for caring all right

where is Congress in the fight against Isis that's what one representative wants to know and she's taking to Twitter to make her case using the hashtag Congress m.i.a she's calling out her colleagues and urging them to repeal the 2001 authorization for the use of military force it's a resolution to the loud former president george w bush to use military force against terror groups responsible for 911 and those who harbored them that of course being al Qaeda the Taliban who Harvard them in Afghanistan President Obama says that that 2001 aumf give him the right today to fight Isis and other terror groups joining me now the congressman woman behind the twitter campaign representative barbara Lee representative Lee thanks so much for joining us and I just want to remind our viewers that you are the only member of Congress who voted against the authorization in 2001 if I remember correctly because you were concerned about what exactly has happened exactly since then which is that successive administrations have used that authorization to target other terror groups in other countries how did that happen absolutely Jim this is it was a blank check and the Congressional Research Service just published a unclassified report that has shown it's been used 37 times imagine the unclassified numbers in terms of how many times it's been used we need to go back to the drawing board repeal that 2001 resolution have a debate and vote on a new authorization now I have to just say the President did present a new authorization 15 months ago the speaker still won't take that up regardless of whether and not one agrees in the use of force the American people deserve to have their members of Congress talk about the costs and consequences of this new war and have an up-or-down vote but the speaker just refuses to bring it up I don't know why but that's why I'm moving forward to continue to try to repeal that resolution and to give the Congress 90 days to come up with a new one that's Isis specific because we all know and everyone agrees that we have to disable and dismantle Isis there a terrible horrific terrorist organization you just remind our viewers that the initial authorization right after 911 said specifically giving the president the ability to target with military force those responsible for 911 corrected as soon as that was it said it was very broad it was those responsible for individuals nation organization are Harvard those that were responsible or connected to 911 Isis didn't even exist well that's AG it's a great point because Isis didn't exist that I mean the administration will say that it's connected but I wonder is it your view that the military action the u.s. is taking now for instance in Iraq and Syria against Isis is it your view that that's military action is illegal it's my view that they're operating under a two thousand and run authorization that does not cover what they are using it for at this point this is a new war footing it's against Isis it's in a new area and we have to really understand that the American people are demanding that they know exactly what the circumstances are how long this is going to be if we know the costs and the consequences and so yes I believe that the current war footing in terms of Isis is really not appropriate because the 2001 resolution did not cover that but it was a blank check so I have to say it was so broad it was overly broad that's why I could not support it so the prep the president in a somewhat odd you might even say untenable position here because on the one so as you say he's introduced another resolution 15 months ago he says he'd like it but he does say he doesn't need it that he could still carry out military action he'd like to have one he liked Congress to get by in you know a phrase the administration likes to he likes to use but he does kind of cover himself by saying well but you know legally I don't really need it i mean do you buy that kind of fine line that he's walking there you know what what I x is that members of Congress have a constitutional responsibility to engage in our job and to do our job and so it's our job I had authorizations for the use of force we have three branches of government of course and so I'm talking about the United States House of Representatives doing its job we have been missing in action the president put for the resolution we could take it up if we wanted to but believe you me there variety of strategies and authorizations that are floating around we need to take up some of them and have a debate that's up to us not the president the speaker should bring forth an authorization and allow members of Congress the people's house to debate the costs and consequences of this new war so what everybody likes to talk tough as you know about terrorism and Isis and taking the fight to them why won't Republicans in Congress take up a new amf I'm not sure that the the courage is there to do that and for the life of me I don't know why Republicans are elected just like Democrats to represent the people and it's a constitutional requirement that we do these things we do our job now I'm not saying it's easy these are tough decisions but that's why we're elected to make these tough decisions decisions there is no way the Congress should be missing in action in terms of our constitutional responsibilities so I would assume speaker Ryan does not want to take it up because he probably has a lot of pressure from his caucus not to take it up but I do have to say on my repeal amendment the other night even though it did not pass there were 13 Republicans who voted for it we had a total of 138 members who voted for it so we're going to keep working on it and we're going to keep moving this forward because we have to do our job it's wrong and we're leaving our troops in harm's way I mean our troops are doing everything we've asked them to do and they're doing it without congressional legal authority so Congress needs to step up and we need to do our job congresswoman Lee you took that vote seriously as an American I thank you for that and I thank you for taking the time today thank you my

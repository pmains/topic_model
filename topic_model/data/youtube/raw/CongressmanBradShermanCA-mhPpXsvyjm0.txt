BUT FIRST, BACK TO THE BREAKING NEWS. THE HOUSE PREPARING TO VOTE ON ARTICLES IMPEACHMENT THIS WEEK. WE HEARD FROM WILL HURD BEFORE THE BREAK COMMONALITY OR FROM THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, BRAD SHERMAN, A DEMOCRATIC ON THE HOUSE THAT SHARES COMMITTEE, PRODUCING ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP BACK IN 2017. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. THE FACT THAT YOU INTRODUCED A ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT IN 2017, DOESN'T THAT MAKE WILL HURD'S POINT THAT HE MADE A MOMENT AGO THE REASON WHY THIS PROCESS IS PARTISAN IS BECAUSE YOU AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR IMPEACHMENT TWO YEARS? >> I WAS NOT PUSHING FOR IMPEACHMENT WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED. I INTEND IN HIS INAUGURAL, THEN HE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE WITH THE REVIEW OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY. HE THREATENED COMEY, HE FIRED COMEY IN ORDER TO DERAIL THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, ONLY THEN DID I INTRODUCE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. THE REPUBLICANS WHO WERE IN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE DID NOT TAKE THOSE ARTICLE SERIOUSLY, WE HAD NO INVESTIGATION. I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT IN 2019 FOR WHAT HE DID EARLY IN 2017. BUT I THINK THOSE WERE SOLID ARTICLES, THEY WERE NOT INTRODUCED WITH A FEELING THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT LEGITIMATELY ELECTED, BUT RATHER BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID IN HIS FIRST FIVE MONTHS. AND IF WE HAD NOT BEEN TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT IN 2017, THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE BLATANT IN 2019. HE WOULD HAVE JUST TWEETED TO THE UKRAINIANS AND EVERYONE ELSE, YOU BETTER GIVE ME, YOU BETTER GIVE ME DIRT ON BIDEN. >> Ed: NOW YOU'RE JUST OPPOSING THAT, DOESN'T THAT MAKE THEIR PRESIDENT'S POINT, YOU ARE THROWING SPAGHETTI AT ANYTHING YOU HOPE STEAKS? >> NO, I AM SIMPLY MAKING THE POINT THAT IF NONE OF US HAD TALKED ABOUT IMPEACHMENT IN 2017, THIS PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN BOLDER IN 2019. I'M GLAD THAT WE MADE HIM AWARE OF IMPEACHMENT BACK THEN. >> Ed: LET'S GET SERIOUS ABOUT THE VOTES AHEAD IN THE HOUSE, YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THE DEMOCRATS, YOUR PARTY IS GOING TO HAVE THE VOTES TO MOVE IT FORWARD. THAT SEEMS LIKELY. THERE WOULD BE A SENATE TRIAL, JUST AN HOUR OR SO AGO DEMOCRATIC LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER WANTS A WHOLE SLATE OF WITNESSES. AND IF HE DOES NOT GET SOME OF THESE TOP TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, HE ALLEGES IT IS A COVER-UP, HOW DO BACK THAT UP? >> WE WILL BE VOTING ON ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT BASED ON OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS PRECISELY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF ARGUING THAT THIS OR THAT WAS SUBJECT TO SOME PRIVILEGE HAS JUST TOTALLY STONEWALLED THE ENTIRE INVESTIGATION. SO I THINK THAT SENATOR SCHUMER WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THOSE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT BASED ON OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS AND ADD TO THEM ANY OBSTRUCTION OF THE CHANCE TO HEAR LIVE WITNESSES OR INSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION. >> Ed: CONGRESSMAN, YOU KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY HE DID NOT STONEWALL THE INVESTIGATION WHEN HE TURNED OVER THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE PHONE CALL WITH THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT. BUT TO YOUR POINT, WHO DO YOU MOST WANT TO HEAR FROM? IS IT JOHN BOLTON, SECRETARY POMPEO? WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE THE MOST RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR US TO FIGURE ALL THIS OUT? >> I THINK THOSE WILL BE EXCELLENT WITNESSES PRAYED I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THEM. I DOUBT VERY MUCH WHETHER WE WILL. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE SENATE IS GOING TO HOLD UP ITS TRIAL FOR SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR OR TWO YEARS WHILE WE WAIT TO SEE WHETHER BOLTON OR POMPEO WILL COME FORWARD. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THOSE WITNESSES, BUT I THINK THAT THE TRANSCRIPT ITSELF REFLECTS EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO DO. >> Ed: CONGRESSMAN BRAD SHERMAN, THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING LATER THIS WEEK AS A HOUSE BEGINS TO DEBATE THE ACTUAL ARTICLES HE

hi it's congresswoman jan churkowski i'm back with my pans and plans this was a big week in congress especially for me because as you may know i do chair the subcommittee on consumer protection and commerce and after years literally at least two three years of working to get a national privacy bill that would protect consumers online we finally had a bipartisan hearing on a bipartisan draft of legislation that would actually provide security for consumers of all sorts online we know that 81 percent of consumers feel that they don't have real control over their own data and one study said it would take 76 days to actually read all the privacy reports of of the average person's online databases so i i think that we have to do better to make sure that we make those guarantees overall and and so um we know that the european union already has a a policy we know that many states are working on that but this would be a pretty standard national policies for online consumers and among the things that it would do on on day one consumers will have uh companies will have a duty to only collect the minimum amount of data that they need for a particular transaction can't ask for extraneous data consumers will have the right to access correct delete and transfer uh your your data um that there will be no data sharing information unless you give consent to any third parties most of the members of congress really focused on children protecting them from harm and exploitation online and one of the most important things was raising the age of children who are covered from age 13 to 17. so many more young people will be protected and what that means that you can't have advertising that is targeted specifically toward them on online so we're going to be doing a lot about protecting our kids i know a lot of parents are concerned about that as well and then of course there's the issue of gun violence and i told you last week a package of eight different pieces of legislation that passed the house of representatives are very very significant we're going to continue to push all of them but i think the good news maybe not the great news the good news is is that there has been a compromise in the united states senate 10 democrats and 10 republicans got together and came up with a package for the first time really in decades we will now have some legislation let me tell you what it does for one thing it would also do what we call a red flag bill to prevent people who will be of danger to themselves or others there will now be a process to make sure that when those individuals are identified that they will be prevented from having a a gun that could hurt themselves a suicide for example or others so there will be a red flag law the senate has also agreed to end the boyfriend loophole right now if someone has been convicted of domestic violence that person in order to keep them from having a gun has to be a spouse now anyone who is in a relationship that has been convicted of domestic violence will not be able to uh purchase or own a a gun so that's an important one um there will be a federal ban on what we call straw purchasing of of guns and that's very important for the state of illinois i think i mentioned to you last week because so many of the guns that we have in illinois are trafficked so trafficking and straw purchasing will be outlawed so that will keep some guns from out of state from coming into uh from coming into illinois where most of the gun violence and the gun deaths are caused by guns that come from out of state we also have legislation that would require more background checks for for children really between the age of 18 and 21. you know that the shooter that killed 19 children was 18 years old there is a recognition that we need to do more scrutiny on kids that are at least a bit older and 21 seems to be a time when actually there's a reduction in these kinds of mass shootings so it's a beginning there's also a good deal of money that goes into mental health services something that we've needed for a long time i've reminded you that before though that people who often are um truly mentally ill are more likely themselves to be the victims rather than the perpetrators on the other hand we know that there is really a pandemic of [Music] depression and mental health issues that could lead someone to suicide and you know that more than half of the gun deaths are in fact suicide so the fact that we will put more resources into mental health services is progress now i would have loved to seen that we do something like a a ban on assault weapons this is still on the table i know that the house of representatives is going to be having a hearing on that the fact that these military style weapons as used in the last in many of the mass shootings have been on the street it's crazy and so we have to do something about that so we're making in steps we're finally cracking the ban on doing anything about gun violence and uh and and that is good news so i've been a leader in the congress on trying to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on our highways which i'm sorry to say are at a record high right now um and and so um we passed i was able to get into the infrastructure bill that passed last december major infrastructure bill legislation that dealt with automated driving systems that would actually help drivers to avoid crashes without actually having to do anything these would be automated within the built-in within the cars themselves this is a good thing the more that we have those systems in cars that are newly built but it would it requires the national highway transportation safety administration we call it nissa the agency that actually designates exactly what is the requirement for cars to have in in in their systems um and um so we are they they released information yesterday that as of right now there have been um in cars that use these kind that are testing these kinds of programs 367 crashes some of them have heard us hurt pedestrians and [Music] bicycle riders and individuals of course and there have been several deaths as well the biggest problem has been tesla of those 367 crashes 273 come from tesla now one of the things that's really a problematic i think that what tesla caused calls those systems is autopilot now my husband is a pilot and when you hear autopilot you think um that means you don't have to really pay attention and that is not true particularly in this testing stage right now and so we want to make sure that nitsa comes up with these rules of the rope these regulations for automakers so we we know exactly what has to be required in these automated systems to make sure that we really are protecting people on the uh on the road so we had a press conference yesterday um the the the advocates um were very strongly asking that we get these rules as soon as possible we don't have to wait a number of years as these uh deaths and crashes increase and that more experiments are done on our on our highways without the definitive rules we're moving moving on to uh to health care and prescription drug prices i want to tell you there is a i think little-known player that helps to decide how much pharmaceuticals are life-saving drugs are going to cost and they are called pharmacy benefit managers and what they do is to manage the uh benefits on behalf of insurance companies and there are examples that we that have been found over the years that the role that they played actually does have a role sometimes in unfairly increasing the price of our drugs which as you know is one of the top issues that people all across the country are facing not being able to afford their prescription drugs so the federal trade commission has has just decided to commission a a study to take a close look at these pharmacy benefit managers to see what role they are playing and to make sure that that's a constructive role and so now that we have five members finally appointed that's the full complement of members of the federal trade commission in place then we're going to begin this investigation that i hope will help to control and lower prescription drug prices um i also wanted to just announce it is the 10 year anniversary of what we call daca which is the program that was established for young people who have come to this country as immigrants with with their parents not a decision of their own and to give them certain rights to be able to have a job to be able to go to school we called those daca recipients dreamers these are the the young people who dream one day to be able to come become citizens of the united states of america and the daca program is the beginning of making making that happen so it's been 10 years the my district the chicago area has a lot of daca recipients working work is happening right now negotiations are happening right now to see how we can make this program go forward of course it's just the beginning really of the changes that we need and what is essentially a broken immigration system that is preventing families from from being united preventing literally millions and millions of people who have been in the united states of america for a pathway to citizenship but the daca program has been very very important especially for our young people who wanted to be able to get ahead as in the only country that they have known the united states of america sunday is juneteenth june 19th and it marks the day where the last slaves who hadn't heard about the emancipation proclamation which happened in 1863 they didn't hear about that until 1865. that happened in texas i think there were other some other southern states where people were enslaved without knowing that actually emancipation had happened and so really what juneteenth is is a celebration of the end of slavery the end of of enslaved enslaving people in the in the united states of america i know that my colleague sheila jackson lee who was the author of the bill to um help make june teen teen this a holiday will be having a big celebration but i think all of us should mark the day that the more we can end oppression and slavery the more we should celebrate that in the united states as usual i want to end with an update on the coronavirus and to say that after a pretty steep increase that has been seen now in illinois we are seeing um i was going to say slow and steady i hope steady decrease in in the numbers actually illinois reported 5737 new cases and five deaths on on wednesday um and so you know we should hope for the the best but continue to take care and finally finally let me just wish all dads a happy father's day i hope that any of the fathers in your life have a wonderful celebration i know i'm looking forward to in my family congratulating all the the dads and have a wonderful summer weekend i'll see you next week thank you for

and today's topped render joining the team former governor charlie crist introducing voters to his running mate my running mate the net today oh Tadeo considered a rising Hispanic figure in Florida politics we need a change in Tallahassee and the people need a voice Charlie critic SunNet tadeo as his Sunshine State running mate she truly is the American dream hunted she's a working mom founder and CEO of her own company he's chair of the miami-dade Democratic Party Krista newly minted Democrat now has a major party player with him Chris chose someone from miami-dade somebody hopes will win him votes and Hispanics and from women as well I think that's a huge asset to the ticket in every way together we can make a difference joining us tonight Annette today a candidate for Florida lieutenant governor and chair of the miami-dade Democratic Party Annette congratulations you are a successful businesswoman you've had a lot of success in your career you've been involved in politics all the way back to college but I think it's pretty clear at least a lot of people are talking that you certainly fit the demographic a woman a Hispanic from South Florida what do you bring to the ticket well the most important that I bring is a voice for the people in a seat at the table just just being a working mom and a small business owner we need that seat at the table and I'm so proud to be a part of the people's ticket because right now what we have in Tallahassee is special interests have a seat at the table but us regular people people who have been through the tough times I've lived of the minimum wage I know what it's like to have to meet payroll and wonder if you're going to be able to do it during tough times and then you're worried about your employees how is that going to affect them how's it gonna affect my own family these are the things that I bring to the table that are so important that we do not have we do not have a voice at the table and certainly as a woman we do not have that voice at the table it's a very important voice that Governor Chris really felt that was important for us to have that and that do you think that you will get out the Hispanic vote more so than any other candidate on the ticket well it certainly doesn't hurt and I hope so but I will tell you this is about all of us coming again when I say together we can make a difference I mean all floridians can make a difference and it doesn't matter if you're Hispanic african-american Anglo or Asian the fact of the matter is we're all stuck with a Scott Florida and we need to be scot-free and together we're going to be able to do this and and i will tell you sometimes i know that it's a plus and some hispanic i speak Spanish but you know african-american issues asian issues Anglo issues mom's issues those are all our issues together and we need to all understand each other and work together towards making a difference and not just divide us by our ethnicity the Miami Herald reports that Scott's campaign and packs have raised 24 million dollars since Charlie Criss entered the race in November now where's the money going to come from for the Democrats are you concerned about money with your team and the kind of money that you're up against and how do you combat that well we have the voice of the people we obviously are working very hard to raise the funds and there is no question rick Scott is racing a lot of money because he has special isn't interest on his side and big corporations that want him to stay there but we have the people and more importantly we we need to make sure that people get the message out and there's no question he said he may put his own money and even over 100 million dollars he plans on spending on this race which is why I need everybody watching this show to understand the importance of getting behind the people's ticket working this campaign we cannot keep our eye of the ball we need to get rid of rick Scott well there's been a lot of voter suppression effort in the state of Florida do you think that will factor into this election especially in South Florida there has been and certainly Rick Scott did everything he could to ensure that President Obama would not be reelected and he tried to suppress the vote along with many of his Republican colleagues in Tallahassee what we have done has been fighting it and I am so proud to be on the ticket of charlie Crist because when push came to in 2008 he was governor and nobody in the Republican Party wanted him to extend voting hours and he said that's just the right thing to do to allow people to vote I'm going to extend the hours and there were a lot of people mad at him on the other side but I'll tell you those of us on the Democratic side were so proud of him for doing the right thing and that's what he's going to do when he gets back to Tallahassee do the right thing for people and finally in it where is this race going to be one as you see it I think it's going to be one knocking on doors we are doing a ground game we have a lot of the Obama team with us and we are definitely going to just get out the vote and let people know that this really affects the future of even my daughter my eight-year-old daughter this is for the environment we have just such a sharp contrast between Charlie Chris and rick Scott it's night and day one is for science the other one doesn't even meet with scientists because he doesn't believe in science so there's just a huge difference and people are going to see that difference and I believe we're going to be successful all right and that today you have worked awful hard for this your whole life to have this opportunity all the best to you we will visit again thanks so much coming up

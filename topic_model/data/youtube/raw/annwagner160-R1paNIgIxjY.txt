um chairwoman LOI ranking member providers other members thank you for the opportunity to testify today as a former US ambassador and the vice ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee I cannot overstate America's centrality in safeguarding human rights fostering peace and promoting economic development trade and good governments worldwide I've had the opportunity to travel with miss Torres on these very missions across Central America and in our world with countries like China and Russia working to undermine democratic values and respect for human rights American leadership is more important than ever and the us-led International Order has helped populations across the the globe enjoy safer more stable and frankly more prosperous lives and I believe American diplomatic engagement is critical to leaving a better world for the next generation peace and stability are a prerequisite for prosperity but as we see in Syria Burma and elsewhere many states are engaged in large-scale violence against their own citizens and the United States has a responsibility to help these vulnerable communities for that reason I want to voice my strong support for robust funding for the complex crisis fund or CCF the CCF is a critical global account that enables the United States to respond swiftly and efficiently to unforeseen crises filling a gap when other monies are unavailable Foreign Service officers and USAID workers in the field rely on the CCF to mitigate incipit incipient human terian crisis and prevent conflicts from spinning out of control and data analysis from the Institute of economics and peace indicates that strong funding for the CCF could actually save taxpayers in the long run they would submit that every for every dollar invested now the cost of conflict would be reduced by 16 dollars I urge you to fund this account at at least 10 million dollars in fiscal year 2020 also one of the top priorities in Congress in ending human trafficking and injustice that has enslaved over 40 million people worldwide I could say that the State Department's office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons has been instrumental in building partner nation capacity and incentivizing effective anti trafficking measures I urge you to provide robust funding to the tip office so it can improve justice systems and prosecutions of traffickers and sex buyers in partner nations frankly doing my own chip report as a former US ambassador was so very important and impactful in what I was able to under bring to Congress and and promote legislatively from a policy standpoint and finally I asked you to allocate allocate robust funding for democracy programs in Burma in fiscal year 2019 the National Endowment for democracy anyd received four million dollars for its activities in Burma it has used these funds to promote the development of civil society and strengthen democratic institutions anyd is helping to build a Burma in which genocide brutalities and rights violations against the country's minorities are unthinkable and I urge you to continue supporting its mission at at least that four million dollar level I asked you to ensure that our assistance to Burma does not in any way make the United States complicit in the appalling crimes that Burmese military they have committed against the Rohingya Shan the kichan and other ethnic groups last year the House version of the NDAA included language limiting security assistance and military cooperation until the Department of State certifies that the Burmese government has held perpetrators accountable for human rights abuses I was deeply disappointed that the final NDAA did not include this language and I hope that that the s Fox appropriations bill for fiscal year 20 its provisions regardless members of the Burmese military responsible for committing genocide and other crimes against humanity must be held responsible for their actions the Burmese military should not receive one cent of US foreign military financing until it takes action to end an atone for egregious human rights abuses America excels at helping our partners build capacity good governments governance practices and democratic institutions democratizing and developing countries want and need us to remain a reliable partner I hope the subcommittee will support strong funding or again the u.s. anti-trafficking for conflict prevention and for capacity-building programming so I thank you for all your hard work on these issues I appreciate your courtesy and I'm sure woman and ranking member and I'm happy to take any questions or - give us your choice would you like to take quite if you want to join us join having missed occasion for that where's Burt where are we are they voting yet okay I probably leave in a few minutes if you have any questions I'm happy to entertain a couple but I just want to before I turn it over well maybe I'll give forum members who didn't ask some questions I'll do it that way I just wanted to thank you for your testimony and I must say that I was part of several celebrity events with also sushi and this was probably one the most disappointing results I can ever imagine the time that I was here and I thank you for your activism wish you had some advice and I don't know if you do fairytale I shall turn to another question before you leave I I agree I can tell you in terms of some of the priorities that I've laid out here I think the Chairman angle is very committed to the CCF and actually getting behind it I have fought for this on the Republican side of the aisle for some time he's committed to this also and I think that anything we can do from the prevention side early on is very very important I think that will make a big big difference in arming our Foreign Service officers and and others to to work more on the preventive aside I've had the pleasure of passing the gen genocide and atrocities Act which CCF was very much a part of and but I think we're going to put some more teeth to it in this next Congress why don't I turn to miss charts cuz you were next thank you for your leadership in these issues specifically with sex trafficking you know we were in Iquitos Peru and we visited a center that was built to help support infants that are sex traffic I didn't know that that type of tourism existed was just horrific it was horrible to find out that it's American citizen no traveler there for the purpose of exploiting infants so thank you for that work and I just want to encourage you I know that this is a very very difficult issue for you but women need support and when rape is you know a favorite weapon of war we have to find a way to help provide health care for the women that have been raped and yes result in unwanted pregnancies and are left on the side of the road you know to care for themselves and an unwanted child that no one recognizes as a human being and it's it's shameful it's a black eye but I hope that we can find a space where we can work to help shochu and I looked by the healthcare of these women I look forward to that and Jen and I can tell you that my gender side bill also is very much a part of that too though there are so many little girls across this country sadly that are killed in the womb because of their gender because they are little girls and it goes along the same line so we'll be putting that legislation I hope for it again and then generally on a bipartisan basis so I look forward to working with you on those issues mr. Fortenberry or miss Rosie do you have any questions before we go back to mr. case do you want to go now okay with great respect yeah thank you for being here to give us your perspective on this ongoing tragedy in Burma you but in the 19 bill that we just passed we've got 80 6.4 million in economic support funds to support civil society advance the national reconciliation process and improve the lives left vulnerable by decades of military rule it also has three and a half million for the International Narcotics Control funding no monies for International Security Assistance none and State Department air action where the Burmese military is limited to human rights and Disaster Response so we hear you it's an ongoing tragedy that I appreciate that and I you know I just again can't say enough about the National Endowment for democracy and that that four million dollars at any D needs that grant money that they need to have I think more programming control over and I think and also go a long way to helping to build a Burma in which these kinds of brutalities and genocide and human rights violations are unthinkable so I think you you know ranking member thank you all so very very much I didn't put my roller skates on and - back to Rayburn

I'm gonna say this again we are sending people pregnant women back to dangerous places in Mexico that have a level 4 threat that's the equivalent of Afghanistan Iraq Syria and North Korea before you decided to return families with children and other asylum seekers to wait in these very dangerous places in Mexico did you conduct any type of an analysis any type to assess the potential harms that these asylum seekers might suffer so the Micra protection protocols is a program in partnership with the government of Mexico I'm asking if you had any kind of assessment on the potential harm of where they were being sent did you did we do that there was a month long dialogue with the government that should go on them asking of the United States it says yes or no did you assess the threat level before you sent them there between the Department Homeland Security Department of State which jointly negotiated this program with the government of Mexico assessments were done on machines ability to manage this program and jointly with the United States okay so you did assess this and you thought it was perfectly fine do you know that there are public reports of kidnappings assaults and other attacks on families and other silent seekers that are returned to Mexico are you reading these reports are you hearing about them certainly we carefully monitor reports of violence in the northern water states in Mexico for lots of reasons oh have you heard about people being kidnapped yes or no yes we've heard have you heard about people being assaulted yes or no please let me finish the answer I don't have that much time and I want to know what you are aware of yes because my colleagues over here talking about how we're a compassionate and loving nation but sending a deaf child back to Mexico into a level-4 area is not compassionate to me sending pregnant women back to these areas to be raped killed and abuse is not a compassionate nation

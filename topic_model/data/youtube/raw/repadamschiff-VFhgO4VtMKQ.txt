CAPITOL, BUT THE EFFORT BY THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  TO OVERTURN THAT ELECTION. WE TALK WITH TWO MEMBER OF THAT  HOUSE COMMITTEE FROM SOUTHERN  CALIFORNIA, DEMOCRAT ADAM SCHIFF OF BURBANK AS WELL AS DEMOCRAT  PETE AGUILAR OF RED LANDS. SO CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, STARTING  WITH YOU, WHAT WAS SERVED DURING THAT PUBLIC HEARING ON THURSDAY? >> I THINK THE CHAIRMAN SET OUT  THE HISTORIC STAKES, THE FACT  THAT IN OUR LONG HISTORY THERE'S NEVER BEEN A PRESIDENT TO  INTERFERE WITH THE PEACEFUL  TRANSFER OF POWER UNTIL NOW,  UNTIL DONALD TRUMP. THEY'LL GIVE THE PUBLIC A ROAD  MAP TO THE PUBLIC HEARINGS BUT  ALSO JUST A SAMPLE OF THE  EVIDENCE WE'VE ACCUMULATED. SHOWING TESTIMONY OF BILL BARR,  IVANKA TRUMP, KUSHNER, CHAIRMAN  MILLEY AND OTHERS. AND THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO BE  SEEING MORE AN OF THAT TESTIMONY AS WELL AS LIVE TESTIMONY ABOUT  ALL OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN  WHICH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP  TRIED TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION,  BEGINNING WITH THE BIG LIE AND  ENDING WITH THAT VIOLENT ATTACK  ON THE CAPITOL. FINALLY, CONAN, I THOUGHT  OFFICER EDWARDS' PROVIDED THE  MOST POWERFUL REBUTTAL TO THE  FICTION THAT JANUARY 6th WAS  SOME NORMAL TOURIST DAY. I FOUND HER TESTIMONY JUST  INCREDIBLE. -- WHAT I LEARNED OVER TIME IN  THE INVESTIGATION IS JUST HOW  MULTILAYERED THE EVERYDAY WAS TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT  JANUARY 6th. IT BEGAN WITH THE BIG LIE THAT  BEGAN EVEN BEFORE THE ELECTION. THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAYING IT  WAS GOING TO BE PLAGUED BY  MASSIVE FRAUD, THAT VOTES  COUNTED AFTER ELECTION DAY WERE  SOMEHOW SUSPECT. WHEN HE KNEW THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A LOT OF VOTES COUNTED AFTER  ELECTION DAY GIVEN THE PANDEMIC  AND HOW MANY PEOPLE VOTED BY  ABSENTEE BALLOT. CREATION OF FAKE CERTIFICATES OF ELECTION, CONTINUED WITH THE  PRESSURE CAMPAIGN ON THE VICE  PRESIDENT, AND ULTIMATELY LED TO THE VIOLENT ATTACK. ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER TO  ANOTHER AS PART OF AN ORGANIZED  EFFORT, ESSENTIALLY A PLOT TO  OVERTURN THE ELECTION. AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE A  FULL APPRECIATION OF THAT UNTIL  WE STARTED DIGGING IN TO  EVERYTHING THAT LED UP TO  JANUARY 6th.  >> CONGRESSMAN AGUILAR, KEVIN  McCARTHY, THE HOUSE MINORITY  LEADER HAS SAID THE HEARING IS  ALL ABOUT CHANGING THE TOPIC. DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT TO TALK  ABOUT HIGH INFLATION, HIGH  CRIME, PROBLEMS AT THE BORDER,  THIS IS ALL POLITICALLY  MOTIVATED TO TRY TO BOLSTER YOUR CHANCE AT MAINTAINING A MAJORITY COME THIS FALL. YOUR RESPONSE? >> IT'S JUST DETACHED FROM  REALITY, BUT OUR JOB, OUR FOCUS  IS TO TELL THIS STORY AS  COMPLETELY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT A  POLITICAL CALENDAR, THE NEXT  ELECTION. KEVIN McCARTHY DOES A VERY GOOD  JOB OF ONLY FOCUSING ON THOSE  PIECES. OUR JOB IS TO DO THIS WELL, AND  TO TELL THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHAT HAPPENED JANUARY 6th, WHAT LED  UP TO IT AND WHAT WERE THE  CAUSES OF TO IT MAKE SURE THIS  NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.  >> CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, IS IT  YOUR BELIEF THAT AFTER ALL THIS  IS OVER, THE DEPARTMENT OF  JUSTICE SHOULD FILE A FEDERAL  INDICTMENT AGAINST THE 45th  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,  AT DONALD TRUMP? >> I THINK WHAT WE HAVE  ACCUMULATED SHOULD RESULT IN AN  INVESTIGATION OF MULTIPLE  POTENTIAL FEDERAL CRIMES, AND  THIS WAS OF COURSE NOT JUST MY  OPINION. THE FEDERAL JUDGE IN CALIFORNIA, JUDGE CARTER HAS SAID NOW IN  MORE THAN ONE OPINION THAT HE  BELIEVES THE FORMER PRESIDENT  AND OTHERS LIKELY COMMITTED  FEDERAL CRIMES, INCLUDING THE  CRIME OF CONSPIRACY TO INTERFERE WITH THE JOINT SESSION, FRAUD  AGAINST THE UNITED STATES, AND  SO I THINK HE'S RIGHT. I THINK THAT THOSE ISSUES NEED  TO BE INVESTIGATED BY THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS. ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE UP TO THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHETHER  THERE'S SUFFICIENT PROOF BEYOND  A REASONABLE DOUBT, BUT I AM  CONCERNED THAT SOME OF THESE  THINGS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT FOR -- OUT OF A  BR INTEREST TO AVOID CONTROVERSY,  AND FRANKLY AT THESE TIMES YOU  CAN'T DO YOUR JOB AND NOT BE  CALIFORNIA. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE ONE  STANDARD FOR THE RULE OF LAW  APPLIED EQUALLY TO EVERYONE, AND THAT INCLUDES THE FORMER  PRESIDENT.  >> WHAT SHOULD WE INCLUDE IN  THESE HEARINGS, INCLUDING THE  THREE NEXT WEEK? >> NEXT WEEK, THE PUBLIC WILL BE INVITED TO VIEW HEARINGS TWO,  THREE, AND FOUR. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE BIG LIE AND THE FRAUDULENT MANNER IN WHICH  THE PRESIDENT AND THOSE AROUND  HIM CONTINUED TO PERPETUATE THE  BIG LIE, EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW  THAT HE HAD LOST THE ELECTION. SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE STATE  PRESSURE CAMPAIGN AND  SPECIFICALLY THE GEORGIA  PRESSURE CAMPAIGN THAT WAS  UNDERTAKEN. AND WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THE  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE EFFORTS  UNDER THE FORMER PRESIDENT WHERE HE WANTED TO INSTALL HIS FRIENDS INTO POSITIONS OF POWER THAT  COULD HAVE AFFECTED THE OUTCOME  HERE. AS WELL AS THE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN ON VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE,  WHICH WILL BE NEXT THURSDAY AS  WELL.  >> THE TWO MEMBERS FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON THE HOUSE SELECT  COMMITTEE ON W

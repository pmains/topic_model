friends and fellow citizens good evening and aloha i'm congressman ed case proudly representing hawaii's first congressional district in the u.s house of representatives as you know hawaii has two congressional districts and two congressmen currently me and my full partner congressman kaialii my district the first congressional district stretches from makupu point on the east all the way through the city of honduras central honolulu out rural city and then up to mililani and mililani mauka before coming back down through waipahu ewa beach kapolei koalina and ending at kahe point that district is really urban honolulu and there are 750 000 people that i represent in the first congressional district congressman kahell's district the second congressional district is the rest of the state so the rest of the island oahu and everywhere else in the state and he also has about 750 000 constituents but together and we do act together we represent all of hawaii in the u.s house and we are the only two representatives for hawaii in the u.s house like every single other time i've ever done a talk story i believe it's critical to doing my job that i stay in touch with you that i let you know what i'm doing on capitol hill 5 000 miles away for most of the year uh talk story on the issues that we're facing um listen to your concerns and answer your questions i really wish that this was personal all over again as i've done so many times i wish we were sitting in many many school cafeterias and community centers and and other event areas throughout my first congressional district but obviously covet 19 makes that difficult and so therefore we must do this again virtually jackie let you know some of the basics of tuning in and asking questions and i'll repeat those from time to time but i want uh upfront to direct you to my website at case.house.gov there's a whole bunch of information at my website on case.house.gov much of what i'm going to talk with you tonight about um is on my website there's information on covet 19 information on my agenda on my actions in congress my voting record is there and important information on how to get in touch with us by email or by calling us at our honolulu office at 808 650-6688 that's on my website so i want to refer you there early and often in tonight obviously i'm coming to you uh tonight at a very very difficult time for our communities for our state uh for our country and really for our world um the difficulties are all around us every day all day of course quoted 19 our rages on throughout our country and our world um our economy and our communities are shaky at best we have very very difficult issues that we're facing in washington dc some of which i'll talk with you about tonight and i'm sure you'll raise them with me and and finally our world is a very very difficult uh a very very um um dangerous uh world uh and um it's a critical time for our country um in our world and you know i think it's pretty obvious to all of us that uh with all of this uh comes very very high levels of frustration of disappointment of anger of division of polarization um of even fear and all of that makes it very very difficult sometimes for us to talk together as fellow citizens of our country and our world it sometimes makes it very difficult for us to carry out a civil political discourse in washington dc and yet we've got to do that we must try to do that we cannot descend into yelling and screaming at each other across increasing a gulf we have to try to sort it out together we have to try to make these decisions and find the best way forward for all of us and certainly for me i have to move beyond it i have to make these calls in washington dc and if i'm making these calls simply by reaction to anger and frustration and resentment and polarization i'm not doing the right job for you and i'm not doing what i need to do in congress um you know when you represent 750 000 people um you agree with some of the people pretty much all the time um you disagree with uh some of the people pretty much all the time too and hopefully you agree with most of the people most of the time but it's never gonna be a perfect match and yet somehow i have to find a way to discharge my responsibilities to represent each and all of you regardless of what we do or don't disagree on issues to find the areas where we can at least find common ground and where we disagree that i explain to you what i'm doing and why and so i ask you as we go through tonight in this heightened atmosphere let's all show each other a little courtesy let's try to have a civil conversation with each other uh just as if we were sitting in the school cafeteria somewhere um i'm going to talk a little bit about my job and some broad stuff and then focusing on three issues that i'm sure you want to talk about and then i'm going to turn this over to you uh for questions uh first of all i always think about my job really in in three buckets out the first bucket are the parts of my job where is my responsibility to make decisions on behalf of our country in the us congress these are national decisions uh decisions on on national policy on international um efforts um that's one important critical part of my job the second is to help hawaii all of us uh in congress to make sure our federal government is responding to our needs here and then third part of my job um is to help you and yours with your concerns whether that are questions you have of your federal government or simply uh you communicating what you think to me and and me answering um your your concerns uh those are the three parts of my job and i just want to cover the latter two of those before i come back to the national issues which is where so much of our attention is currently so let me talk to you first about my obligation to help you and yours with your own individual concerns we sometimes refer to this as casework in my office and even in a non-coveted world case work is always very very intense but covet 19 has made this a particularly intense time for us to try to help you and yours with your questions by far the biggest question that many people have had is unemployment insurance accessing your unemployment insurance what you're entitled to when you're entitled to it why aren't you getting answers from the unemployment office which is operated by the state um and those concerns continue we've also had a great number of concerns and questions throughout this past 18 months with assistance to our small businesses assistants uh to you individually with with uh stimulus checks that you've all received or most people have received as a result of our federal action of those two continue as a major part of our of our efforts on your behalf um but we have others that are coming up now uh in increased importance uh where we think that um we can especially try to help with questions with efforts to try to sort things out for you we are seeing right now the end for example of the federal supplemental unemployment program which has carried uh helped out many throughout the last 18 months that is ending and it is all likelihood to be straight with you is not going to be uh continued uh and that's going to cause a whole range of issues for folks uh because um some people have not received the unemployment benefits that they're entitled to under the federal government those will still be uh considered some people want to know obviously what exactly can be expected uh we want you to contact us with those questions uh similarly uh we have had in place uh for most of the last 18 months a a moratorium or pause on any um evictions or for folks that are not paying their rent in their in their places of residence both the federal and state moratariums have now ended uh and that is causing a great uh uh increase in questions uh as to what you do in those situations uh and we are here to try to answer those questions although although although the what you do in those situations is mostly a matter of state and county law and regulations and efforts and at this point access to federal funding which is being directed to rental assistance through the state and county governments um we have increased um requests for help with immigration and passports where many of our consular offices around the world have been closed down uh for for all of the all of this time and people now want uh to have their loved ones visit them here or to go visit their loved ones overseas we can help you with that we have increased the needs in our veterans benefits uh where essentially because many of our service records have been very very difficult to access we have a backlog in new veterans benefits we are trying to sort that through at the bigger picture by funding uh increased people to go through those records but we can help you with your veterans benefits similarly with social security and with the internal revenue service because taxes have been very very confusing again we've helped thousands of people in all of these areas and if you can think about a concern that you think we might be able to help with uh give us a call or contact us by email we'll try to help you out i want to address helping hawaii because whether kovid19 is here or not that's always part of my job most of that occurs for me through my service continued service on the appropriations committee which is responsible for federal funding every year coveted or not we are responsible for funding somewhere in the range of 1.5 trillion dollars per year and we've been very very active uh this year throughout uh covet 19 to to um uh put together our federal funding bills um for for our country for the fiscal year that starts october 1st uh just in a few weeks all of those bills have been considered and reported out of our appropriations committee i was successful in getting many many good projects in there for hawaii um you can access by the way all of my work on the appropriations committee off my website again at case.house.gov go to press releases there and that'll summarize it for you but clearly that's been a critical part of my job throughout whether it be our defense industry here which was our number one industry throughout the last um 18 months so when tourism went down so severely uh clearly for our economy here including terrorism our social services education environment natural resources a whole range of other issues where i try to help hawaii through my uh service in in washington dc and then of course uh covid19 has had incredible demands uh here in hawaii that we've tried to meet at the federal government level those are about five or six major bills over the last 18 months that i've talked to you about before and i think you're familiar with the cares act um other acts on the american rescue plan most recently in march of this year with a total of somewhere around five trillion dollars of federal emergency assistance the result to hawaii has been somewhere in the range of 20 billion dollars of federal emergency assistance which is whether it's to businesses or to our governments to help them out with their needs or to you directly through a direct payments or federal unemployment um that's really been critical and much of that work continues those funds are still coming from our federal government that they are still being distributed here i mentioned for example renter's assistance and as you can see from the from the papers and the media also your state and county governments are making decisions right now about where they're going to allocate um the federal funds that are that are still coming to them so those are the first uh two uh buckets uh helping hawaii and helping you let me now turn to uh issues of national uh concern where my responsibilities are to try to make the right decisions for our country um overall together with my colleagues in congress um and i would cite three issues to you that are top of mind i think all around first of course we can't avoid covet 19 which of course is still increasing in many parts of our country with the delta variant and now um even new variants the the move variant um that has now been identified in almost all of our states uh which is is a potentially uh problem as was uh and is the delta variant uh we've seen higher rates of infection um hospitalization and death uh since january um even since january and in some cases throughout the entirety of covet 19. and i've i've said from the very beginning back in february and march of last year that for me the decisions had to be guided first and foremost by the advice of public health professionals professionals that no public health no epidemics no pandemics no health know what works and what doesn't work couldn't we couldn't make these decisions based on the political whims or desires or fights of the moment we couldn't make these decisions even based upon what they may or may not do from the perspective of our economy and businesses or what we just did and didn't want to do we had to make those decisions based on what the public health uh taught us we had to do uh to get through this uh pandemic uh and the public health has been consistent really throughout um it's no surprise we all know this um try not to gather in in large gatherings uh wear masks wherever possible and get vaccinated that's been consistent from the very beginning not just because not doing so is a risk to ourselves but because it's a risk to others because it risks our health care system which here in hawaii is at total capacity now uh total capacity and any increase as we fare from labor day i would put it over capacity and and and cause very very difficult decisions to have to be made uh where we are not not only um unable to serve those with with severe covid19 but unable to serve people with other uh healthcare issues who are being displaced from our intensive care units throughout the state um and so that that advice um stands um there is nothing in the public health um documentation that says anything different today than it ever was that uh getting widespread vaccinations is is is the key to getting through this um here in hawaii we've got a mixed result going as as you all know we've got about 86 percent of our population 12 and older now who have at least one vaccination about 75 percent fully vaccinated that is not top in the country as it was at one point and we have huge areas where we just are not having sufficient uh vaccination some of these are our neighborhoods with their particular issues uh one huge area by the way is age the younger of us are not uh getting vaccinated uh when the older of us are even though it's widely available and these pukas in the vaccination coverage are causing illness and death uh and they are causing widespread community uh disruption um somewhere around 96 percent of the cases of covet 19 in hawaii today or the last couple of months are among the unvaccinated the younger are particularly uh impacted so the the idea that somehow we're invincible from coveted 19 when we're young that is absolutely wrong young people are getting sick and they are dying um and um that's the fact and so you know number one and kovit 19 the your federal government um is not for the most part directly involved in the mandates at the state and local level as to how we how we um get through covet 19 from the perspective of restrictions or or or you know requirements of who uh must get vaccinated to to serve in the armed forces or or to go to work uh those those decisions are being left uh to to the individual businesses uh to our military in that case uh to our federal government and employees state government um and to our state and county governments in terms of the restrictions but the federal government certainly has a role in it how we have funded the means necessary to get everybody vaccinated and we are funding today um an incredible increase in the number of emergency nurses throughout hawaii through our federal emergency management administration fema we are we are doing what we can to support our state and county governments and communities uh to get through the public health side of this but ultimately those decisions are being made and i believe that as and when and how those decisions are based on the public health they are the correct decisions and where we are not making the right decisions it's because we are we are and i'm talking about the entire country not making decisions based on what is on the advice of the public health professionals so um that's my take on covet 19 we can get through this but um we need everybody to do what public health advises uh to get through it um let me talk about afghanistan uh the second huge issue that we all face right now of course um the end of a 20-year war um was was deeply tragic it was troubling it was confusing there was so many questions and i think you know certainly the time for questions is going to come i think i would say two things right now to you first of all we must at this point pause take a step back and simply remember reflect and thank the 800 000 of our fellow citizens who served in afghanistan over the last um 20 years the 20 000 who were injured in the 2000 almost 2200 who died uh in afghanistan including just 13 just in the closing days of the war this is the time when we can all step back as americans regardless of what we think about that war or about the exit from that war and and recognize uh that the true cost of war uh and recognize that many many served there uh towards uh our mission uh in afghanistan and they deserve that respect and remembrance and thanks and i expressed that tonight in every which way i can the second thing i would say is that i think where we need to focus our complete energy right now is on completing uh the mission of of of ending that war uh we evacuated in the weeks right before uh the exit the final exit some 123 000 from afghanistan many of them were american citizens but the vast majority were not that was one of the largest if not the largest evacuation in history those folks that were evacuated are in temporary shelters around the world many of them in military bases throughout our country they need to be processed they need to be um you know located somewhere else we need to finish that job and i think that's where our energy needs to be directed we also have a tremendous amount of people still in afghanistan to include american citizens who want wanted to leave and could not leave but including tens maybe even hundreds of thousands of others who want to leave afghanistan who were our interpreters our partners our allies our friends they fought with us they advocated on the basis of democratic values and they're at great risk right now and we need to continue the job of trying to get them out as well my office for example has been deeply involved in in trying to get out specific people who serve with some of our forces from hawaii for the last three weeks my staff has stayed up virtually non-stop to try to try to arrange those exits and i'm not alone many of members of congress are doing that so although i think the time for the questions is going to come and every war needs to be analyzed every exit needs to be need to be reviewed to overly politicize this right now i think is a huge mistake i'm not going to go there myself i'm going to ask the questions at the time get right in appropriate times and in the right inappropriate ways but for now um my focus uh is on completing uh the evacuation that is still very much outstanding finally let me talk about uh two huge bills that i face right now uh in in washington dc uh and these are referred to collectively as the infrastructure um bills um these are two huge proposals um they come out of proposals by president biden early on in his in his administration several months ago um there is a lot of misinformation on these bills out there i'm just reading my correspondence every day listening to the questions i get and it's very very clear that uh there's a lot of stuff out there that is that is twisting and turning this all around um there are also areas of of disagreement uh that um that are apparent uh between you know me and and uh some some of you that i want to address here uh directly tonight because it's possible that you're acting on misinformation but if you're not uh then at least i can explain my thinking to you and and and how i'm approaching it so i do want to take a little bit of time to talk about these uh two bills um there were two large proposals and when i say huge proposals i'm talking about proposals at the size and extent that have never been proposed before uh truly um as as referred to by some you know transformative generational revolutionary that all adds up to very very large and very extensive um and obviously one key question when we take these um in their totality totality are um is that the right direction we want to go for our country this is a matter of our federal government's involvement i think i think for me the answer is mixed yes in some areas and i'm not so sure in other areas but two of these proposals one uh was a 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure package of physical infrastructure so this was this was the largest infrastructure uh package ever proposed in congress uh 1.2 trillion dollars devoted to physical infrastructure so roads bridges sewers water pipes harbors airports the physical tangible stuff that we think about as as infrastructure but not only that to include for example renovating our va hospitals our veterans hospitals are some of our schools uh certainly a major transformative investment in the internet infrastructure where we saw in spades during covet 19 it was critical um to to distance learning to distance business to distance medicine that you had a workable internet and equipment um and so that was the first bill 1.2 trillion dollar physical infrastructure then the second bill was 3.5 trillion dollars for what is often referred to as uh social infrastructure so not so much the physical side of things but some of our of some of our social programs uh significant expansions of our social programs in some cases creating new social programs these included areas such as the extension of the federal uh child tax credit uh which was a was a was a um a specific covid19 limited extension of the child tax credit substantially increased paid family and medical leave free education at both the pre-k level as well as in for example our community colleges expansions of the affordable care act and and the health care extension um changes in medicare changes in social security um as proposed these added up to 3.5 trillion dollars certainly transformative and one thing that president biden said from the beginning was that these bills should be paid for meaning that they should not be financed by further borrowings by the federal government in those amounts uh we have it as i said earlier borrowed five trillion dollars um in the last 18 months for covet 19 and so president biden was basically saying i'm not proposing to borrow another 5 trillion and so when you pay for something what that means is you have to find revenue to support those huge expenditures on whether it our changes in our in our you know tax codes or changes in in in in other programs that are that are that are reduced or eliminated to offset uh those amounts in other words balance the budget on the on these bills that's what he said um and and he made some very specific proposals about how uh to pay for these bills uh the two main proposals that he made uh were to uh revert the corporate tax rate um um to to the level that it was before it was significantly reduced during the trump administration and similarly to revert the personal income tax rates for high income individuals 400 000 or more per year to the pre-trump reduction uh levels um but he did say pay for them um frankly both of these bills had very long odds of passing in congress a deeply divided congress um a congress in which um um as you know um in the in the u.s senate um the the uh the um split is a it's a 50 50 split with uh most bills requiring a 60 vote uh um margin in order to pass um and so these were really really critical um bills that uh frankly weren't given all that much of a chance of passing um but amazingly um because of the involvement of both house and senate members as well as the president acting on a bipartisan basis the 1.2 trillion dollar physical infrastructure bill uh did pass on the senate in fact it passed 69 to 30 substantial pass um and that was sent to the house and it's sitting in our lap right now all we need to do is to pass it and it goes to the president who says he would sign it into law and about a trillion dollars um now some um including my own leadership in the house wanted to hold up they want to hold up um the bipartisan infrastructure bill the one trillion dollar bill um until the 3.5 trillion bill was completed um and also passed um i disagreed uh with that uh very directly i i disagreed with it on two or three or maybe even four grounds the first one was i think when you when you get a bill that passes um all around and is agreed to um you gotta act on it uh right at that time and you gotta pass what you've got in your hand um second um 70 75 plus if this country supports that particular bill to include the folks that i represent according to a survey that i sent out um third i think any delay in passing that bill risks losing it and finally just from a hawaii perspective um that bill would probably yield somewhere around two 2.5 trillion dollars of major infrastructure investments to us um in hawaii so so i i disagreed on that and and um those discussions uh by me and others led to um a decision in the u.s house that we will vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill on or before september 27th and i'm hoping and believing that on september 27th uh it will pass the house and be sent to the president and we can all reflect that at least we got one huge thing done for our country even on a bipartisan basis which is worth worth uh worth something as far as i'm concerned now as to the 3.5 trillion dollar bill uh which is all often referred to or sometimes referred to as reconciliation which is a process um a very uh uh rarely used process under which you don't have to get 60 votes in the senate you just have to get 50 votes in the senate to pass it so you would have to pass the house on a simple majority and then 50 votes over on the senate by the way that means you would have to line up every single democratic senator to to pass it the reconciliation bill that is how the 3.5 trillion dollar uh social infrastructure packages is proceeding right now now it's a huge bill and frankly i don't have uh nor does anybody else have the details of that bill even sitting here today um the only details i have are pieces of it because they're in uh one of my committee's natural resources we we are in the middle of considering our piece of that bill um but um you know if you have questions on the details of it it's difficult for me to answer because i haven't seen the bill it doesn't exist today and so it's very difficult to make that call i can say generally that i support much of it i support many of the goals of that bill i support many of the very specific points at least as i understand it from president biden some of it i just have to ask myself is it really critically needed for example there's a proposal that we should the federal government should pay for community college for everybody and i asked myself well is that the right thing to do with so many needs out there if somebody can afford to afford to pay for community college um should should that be a free uh a free one given given other needs that i think um are more critical than that uh i certainly believe in in that uh when somebody is truly in need and has no other options but i'm not sure that that's the right way to go for every single person um it's one of those things that sure it sounds great but once you start to narrow in on the focus and on priorities maybe it doesn't work so well and then finally is it paid for um i am critically worried about our national debt and deficits we've increased that from 23 to over 20 trillion dollars inside of 18 months i am in the category that debt and deficits matter i know there are people out there that don't think they do i'm not one of them um and i think it catches up with you in many different ways we're not out of cove 19 yet we may well have to spend a lot more money that's borrowed to dig us out of profit 19. and so i think where we can be for these programs we should i support the president's general proposals for example on corporate and personal taxes uh and so this isn't a matter of of not wanting to implement those programs but i am focused on paying for them and so um basically need priority and um and pay fors are what are going to influence my own decisions on on the 3.5 trillion dollar package and reconciliation in the next few weeks um there's other issues but frankly i've gone on way too long already i'll mention briefly campaign finance reform hr one which i co-sponsored just sitting in the senate right now we have major needs for our voting rights legislation the john lewis voting rights act that i co-sponsored that we just passed out of the house that's sitting in the senate and then we have an absolute terrible decision by the state of texas uh severely restricting a woman's right of choice uh to to the point that i think uh is unconstitutional under the supreme court's formulation and i think the supreme court will decide that when they actually take the case on the merits but in the meantime we have a major bill that's going to be before us in the house in the next few weeks um that codifies the right of a woman to to choose within limitations as set forth in roe v wade that i think is the right thing uh for our country and i don't think this should be left individual states anymore um so with that i'm gonna i'm gonna stop and um before i turn it over to you for your questions and simply thank you again for spending time with me tonight uh thank you for your own input for your own partnership it has been an incredible honor to to serve you even in this difficult time and and i look forward to staying in touch however we can all right as a reminder um again to participate in the talk story if you if you if there's people that are out there that um can't yet although you probably already participating uh just dial eight five five two seven four nine five two eight and follow the instructions and to ask a question please dial star three star three you be put in the cube okay um let's see so i'm gonna just start from the top and um i've got a question here uh and by the way we're going to start with some personal ones and then i'm going to just try to whip them because uh we probably will run out of time so rex from pearl city on on technology and uh vaccines in the schools okay i'm not i'm not here oh yeah rex go ahead right um with the technology of it's not necessarily vaccines there i mean with the technology that is available especially with the dry peroxide that is being instituted for the nasa base as well as being used in the last 10 years within the space station why can't we get this in the schools i know it's funding there's possibly one um because because they've been proven in the aerosol form to kill kobe within three minutes okay um and if it's not yeah okay um appreciate the question i think um i don't know enough about the technology that you are discussing i've heard of some of that um i have to kind of assume that it is because the folks that are actually excuse me deciding on on how we're running the schools um i have some some questions or concerns about it that's all i can really um guess at um right now but um if you if you need to try to get uh further answers on that give us a call and we'll try to sort through it for you okay um i'm gonna go to um the gene uh gene regarding the infrastructure bill that is stalled um especially with hurricane ida exposing gene do you want to go ahead and ask in person or is that good yeah i could go ahead go ahead yes um uh yeah you know these infrastructure bills i you know they on like one of them anyway in the senate and um and then of course went to the house but it's just that they're just sitting there like you said you're gonna vote for it i hope so soon and uh with these past few storms that have come by and then we also have the fires of california and um who knows when that hurricane or tropical storm will get hawaii um we desperately need these builds because you know the bridges and roads and everything are just falling apart and the hurricane fighter really exposed that well um thank you so much gene that's actually my point exactly on the bipartisan infrastructure bill the the one trillion dollar um largest infrastructure investment ever um is is like i said earlier staring us in the face it's just there for the taking amazingly uh because it's very very difficult to get anything out of congress especially on a non-partisan bipartisan basis and um president biden himself after the devastation of the recent hurricane made the comment that that was exactly why we needed uh the the uh the physical infrastructure package um asap so i think he he kind of made the case that i was that i was noting earlier which is that we ought to grab that bill and run with it right now um many many of the provisions uh in in that in that bill would go directly uh to some of the the critical infrastructure needs that were exposed by these natural disasters whether they be wildfires or hurricanes or or any number of other um you know natural uh occurrences and by the way that's not that's before you even get into the big picture issues of climate change of climate resiliency which is going to be a massive investment by each and all of our parts of our country to deal with as we can as we as we know right here in hawaii and spades uh rising sea levels are are devastating our coastlines uh are are causing major transportation um uh challenges for us and and um we we need federal help um on a massive scale to try to address some of these uh of these um macro issues if i can put it that way that are that are related to climate change it's not going away and so um that's why i made the point earlier that um i believe we should vote on that bill right away and i'm i'm looking forward to doing that on or before september 27th okay um let's see um i'm going to just read this deborah debra doesn't want to speak live but she she says hopes the delay in the navy to reinforce the tanks that red hill will be addressed since the aquifer needs to be preserved well i completely agree with you that our aquifer does need to be preserved um in terms of red hill right now there are a number of things going on i think first of all um the navy and the state of hawaii as well as other parties are awaiting um a decision by a um a an administrative judge for lacking better way of putting it on the on whether the navy can continue its permit to operate red hill and if so under what conditions and so um i think a lot of clarity will be um um offered uh when that decision is made and all of the parties have to um adjust to it in the meantime the navy has committed uh to what's called secondary containment meaning um meaning basically a wall within a wall thinks it has uh some good solid answers i'm helping fund research for that which is being done in partnership with the university of hawaii through the appropriations committee the navy has spent somewhere in the range of 600 million dollars in the last few years on on maintenance and upkeep at red hill so i think it's taking it seriously uh but frankly we do have to find the answer on secondary containment because the status quo is is not going to work over time and the navy itself recognizes it by saying that either it's going to solve that problem or it's going to have those tanks removed by 2045 which is still a long time but um i think things are you know focused in the right places and again there are various processes that are going on that i'm trying to help out as much as i can at the federal level um let's see uh felicia you asked about the reconciliation bill um did you want to go yes hi good evening congressman cage yes i am interested in asking about the reconciliation bill particularly because it includes child care and elder care and i believe that many many people in the state of hawaii need help with both of those issues i understand that bill hasn't been written i know there's a lot of contingencies on how the bill is going to be funded and i understand that but you know i think that your constituents really need a commitment from you that you're going to support the reconciliation part of the bill the human infrastructure is is is you know the the physical infrastructure is really important for our state i didn't know that but the people of hawaii are really struggling and you know we need as much help as we can get and i believe both those need to pass okay well thank you so much for that um so a couple of responses back to you i like i said earlier um i i completely agree that the so-called human infrastructure or social infrastructure uh bill is is critically important as well as a physical infrastructure bill so i've always said that i believe that both bills should pass like i said i do believe that the bill that's ready to go should go um and the as to the reconciliation bill it's it's just impossible for me to make that commitment i'm just not gonna commit um yes or no to a 3.5 trillion dollar uh bill that i that i that i don't know the details of um i agree with you on the importance of the of the programs that are that are proposed by by president biden but at some point um i think that there are going to have to be judgments about which of those proposals can in fact be implemented on what basis it can be implemented and on what basis it is paid for and doesn't add um to the national debt and deficits and by the way i think that the that the revenue proposals by president biden would support a substantial uh reconciliation bill so this isn't a matter of of not not believing that we do need a generational investment in many of these programs i agree with you are critical uh but but you know frankly i need to see it and i need to participate in its development um again i've i've i've tried to reach out to um you know you and my other constituents to understand your thinking i've surveyed uh off of my e-newsletters on on this issue and i and i think i'm i think i'm speaking for um i guess i would call it the mainstream uh of my constituency here but that that's my take on it it's it's impossible for me to make that commitment today i hope that i can vote for it and i think i will be able to vote for it by the way um so i think that will come up and i think it will pass but i don't know what form it's going to look like um let's see um leighton on the jones act uh do you want to go ahead yes um what are you where did you stance on the jose okay how do you feel about you you think you it's important that we keep it or do you think that if if we uh release it and open it will help the country well um i object to the jones act as it applies to hawaii um i think that one could i guess make the case that um you know the rest of the country and and by the way just quickly the jones act for everybody is a 101 year old federal law that was passed back in a different time and place that basically says that when you ship when you when you ship between two u.s ports uh so for example oakland and honolulu which is our major shipment of everything that comes here you have to use u.s flag ships now that would be i guess okay if you had a lot of u.s flight ships but the fact of the matter is we're down to under 100 for the entire country now and the reality is that what that does is create a monopoly on the shipping lanes between the us mainland and the island parts of our country now um that's not okay with me and you and everybody else are paying significantly higher prices because you are paying uh for that monopoly uh you are not paying you know world shipping rates which are competitive you're paying monopoly shipping rates as a function of federal law and so yeah i disagree with the jones act as it applies to hawaii now if the rest of the country wants to keep it that's i guess their business at least they have opportunities like buses and trucks and you know trains and and um you know other means of moving stuff around so it's harder to it's hard to kind of you know grab on to the the the lifeline um of a of a place in that context but but we suffer from the jones actually that's my position on the jones act uh uh that doesn't make me very popular with the folks that um um you know operate uh the jones act ships uh but um i think that's the right thing for all of us here in hawaii um let's see colleen uh stimulus checks uh you want to go ahead yes i want to know if in this next video or will they the endless checks again and they've been talking about either another one or monthly can help us yeah kalina to be straight with you no i think the answer to that um is um there aren't any proposals in the current bill that we are addressing right now to provide um another round of direct stimulus payments we did two full rounds during the middle of copit19 of course in the original cares act we we did a a large um well i i guess i would say not large itself but um it's a substantial uh direct stimulus payment uh to most of the country that to help help folks through a very difficult uh time and we came back and did it again uh the second time at the end of last year uh because kovit 19 had not gone away as fast as we had hoped at the very beginning um i think that um the thinking right now is that that as most of the country has generally recovered economically and as jobs have come back and as uh as there's been some stability around covid19 um the need for a general stimulus payment to everybody regardless of individual need is is not as significant as it was however um in the same breath of course we are still funding uh various programs that are designed to help people in direct need so i don't think we're walking away from people that are still in great need but i think the honest answer to you on the stimulus payments itself is um unless we really see covet 19 taking the whole thing again we're probably beyond that chapter at two stimulus payments um calvin uh on i think on afghanistan [Music] yes um uh uh this case i i i've been a uh president for your 55 years now i'm a retired navy commander navy reserve okay i have heard the situation that we're experiencing as far as the afghanistan situation is concerned we're we're turning over 83 billion dollars for the tax file taxpayers money to the taliban there in afghanistan uh this money if it were taken and used for other uh important uh investments you know in our military would provide for over a thousand and 35 the most expensive and the most uh [Music] best aircraft that we have in the entire world could be paid for for that amount of money in addition for a navy person we could see that that money could be uh expense for a total of eight aircraft carriers that we could put into the pacific to help keep the homeland here safe i don't know who needs to investigate this situation but the idea of turning over 83 billion dollars worth of military equipment to the taliban in afghanistan uh hurts me as a military veteran right to the core what can you do or what can you say about this situation well i think first calvin i would thank you for your own service um i think um i think that um i can't imagine um what many members of our military and our veterans communities are thinking right now as i said earlier um um not only the end of this war but uh the way in which it ended um and i'm not going to defend um the the abandonment of military significant military equipment in afghanistan the fact is that i as i sit here don't really know the conditions under which it was abandoned or why as i understand it um the the the material was uh you know what's it called sabotaged uh by our forces to be unusable i don't know that for sure but i've heard it i also suspect very strongly that like everything else that that occurred in in our exit from afghanistan um although we did plan to leave and i supported president biden's decision to leave nobody expected the taliban to to to take power that fast it drove uh tremendous um needs on the ground that i can only imagine and i believe to you to your question uh congress does not have an obligation uh to investigate to oversee to provide oversight to try to get the answers to the questions that we all have and to try to find some some um answers and and guidance uh for for future uh such uh situations i and i think that's our obligation as a country uh there are too many questions and they need to be answered not only uh for for legitimate oversight uh by congress which is our constitutional duty um they need to be answered for for for future um lessons um all i'm trying to say is that um what i don't want to have happen and i don't intend to participate it in it um is the what i perceive to be uh really a very uh overly heated uh politicization of um all of this in a very difficult time when we still have people to evacuate including uh american citizens but we've got a lot of stuff that we need to achieve to not make matters even worse and so i'm not downplaying what you're saying but i'm saying there's a time and place and and i don't think this is it um let's see um greg on on hoas yeah thank you for taking my question my question is um uh there are hoas mine in particular that is uh able to foreclose even though the um my va is in forbearance and i'm just curious if there are programs that that i'm not aware of or what the state is doing to to help mitigate that and how many other people are going to be affected i might be so unique it doesn't matter but i just think it's pretty i mean it's extremely inconvenient but i think it's pretty disrespectful to the process yeah um yeah greg i i think i understand your question and the answer is i don't know i think what you're referring to if i'm not mistaken are um hoas so homeowners associations in condominiums that are one through foreclose on on condo orders for unpaid maintenance fees common area maintenance fees is that right are you still there i think that's what you're asking me and and what i don't know is uh clearly there was um a moratorium on evictions for direct rental payments by renters what i don't know um is whether that applied as well uh to homeowners association foreclosure cases as you're referring to and so i'm going to ask you to contact my office uh email me at dot case mail.house come right through my website we'll try to get the answer but i think the answer is going to be um if even if they were covered the moratoriums are are over now and the assistance would have to come from state and or county programs that assist um owners and or renters with um who are unable to pay their bills um that is something that actually the city is is administering right now for the rental assistance program but if you if you contact me i'll try to get to the bottom of that all right um well that brings us uh to the end of a very full hour and a half um i want to say that um i appreciate the civil uh discussion that we've had tonight these are very critical issues they're difficult to talk about but as we can sort through them civilly and as fellow citizens um i think you can find solutions to all of these uh dust solutions um i've talked about three of them in particular profit 19 afghanistan and the infrastructure bills are all very very difficult but nonetheless we have to work through them and find the best path forward uh through and out of them i value our partnership i value your advice i value your communications um we are here to answer your questions we're here to try to help you with your concerns please go to my website again at case.house.gov or call my honolulu office 650-668 and we'll try to help you every way we can other than that i'm going to sign off now and wish each and all of you a very fond aloha be safe and be well [Music] you

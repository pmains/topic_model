get the latest now on the thinking in congress we're joined by representative scott franklin republican of florida congressman you served in the persian gulf we had a veteran on last night who who didn't like referring to this situation in afghanistan as a loss what would you call it well i wouldn't call it a loss we went there well depends on how we exit but we went there initially to uh to root out al qaeda to try to destroy the safe haven that was being provided by the taliban and we had accomplished that but it's how we exit now that determines whether that was done was off or lost or not do you think we should have exited earlier yeah there's gonna be a lot of discussion on that personally i i think we we suffered mission creep along the way we accomplished our initial objectives but along the way when we ventured into nation building i think it we went in a direction that was not going to be winnable in the long run but i think really regardless of how we got there uh to the point we're at now what's most critical is that we make right by our citizens and those who stood by us in these last 20 years well let's get a little bit more on that congressman because we did hear from general mark milley earlier today about getting our people out we'll listen to this and get your comments after the taliban are in and around kabul right now but they are not interfering with our operations through the state department the taliban are facilitating the safe passage to the airport for american citizens that is u.s passport holders so i understand congressman that we can't send humvees out and do some pickups for for americans who are there but are you troubled at all about the idea of americans getting to the airport and ultimately getting out how this is going to work i'm extremely troubled even in the footage that you showed at the top of the show uh these are not people that can be trusted that they um they're violent people they're already showing that um they're gonna take the their violence to the streets and we're gonna have a very difficult time having getting people to the airport so they can be rescued so how long do you think this operation takes the president has hinted now that we will stay there as long as it takes are you hearing that we're not going to hold firm to this august 31st deadline well i'm encouraged some of what i heard this afternoon from the president he has indicated that he's walking back off of that there's no way we're going to be able to get this accomplished by the 31st and i think we need to do whatever it takes we cannot leave our wing now so there's a lot of criticism i'm sure you've heard about how this has been handled a lot of talk in congress as well there's a call bipartisan call for hearings let's just i guess concede that that there will be time for that i guess you would well understand the aar comment from the general today after action review there will be time for that now the year the issue is getting people out is that the focus right now should we worry about this later well i think both are critically important but first and foremost is getting our citizens home and then getting our uh our interpreters and other allies out safely and the when we do get there congressman the number one question you want answered i'd like to know what advice the president got this is such a bungled exit and i want to know what information he received did he get bad advice from the generals or he disregarded the advice but the public the families who've lost loved ones there over the last 20 years and our allies deserve to know that representative scott franklin of florida we appreciate you taking some time for us and joining us thank you sir thank you

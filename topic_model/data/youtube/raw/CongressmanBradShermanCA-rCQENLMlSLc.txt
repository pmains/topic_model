thank you i'm brad sherman from california's best name city sherman oaks [Applause] and reproductive rights have been safe in california for a long time but i'm old enough to remember where we did clinic defense in california and we may have to do it again but this is first and foremost about the right of all americans to have control over their privacy and to have control over their body it is an attack on the rights we've come to enjoy over the last 50 years birth control lgbtq plus and of course the woman's right to choose [Music] [Applause] long before i ever thought of running for office i spent decades as a grassroots volunteer [Music] bagging on people's doors just saying hey it's election day please go vote and all too often they would say it doesn't matter who gets elected they're all the same and i spent a lot of time trying to convince people that that wasn't the case but the supreme court seems to have done it in space they have shown us that who gets elected does matter it does affect the lives of even those who aren't watching the news today and that a woman's right to choose is on the line this november we need to pass the woman's health protection act i also have my own bill to provide federal monetary assistance to those who have to travel across state lines because [Applause] if you live in california new york that's fine if you need to travel that is a health care cost that should be borne by the federal government [Applause] so i look forward to working with everyone here and this isn't just for america we set the standard 50 years ago in this country and since then worldwide a woman's right to choose the rights of the lgbtq plus community 50 years of progress around the world is on the line and we have apparently five individuals ready to roll that back this is a dark day for the supreme court not just because their opinion leaked but because what was in what was leaked the content of that opinion has to be rejected by the american people so i look forward to passing the woman's health production protection act i look forward as was said to get rid of the filibuster and there aren't a lot of house members here today but i assure you the house is ready to act thank you very much [Applause]

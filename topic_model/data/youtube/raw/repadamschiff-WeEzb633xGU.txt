>>> JONAH ME NOW IS JANUARY 6  COMMITTEE MEMBER, ADAM SCHIFF.  THANKS FOR BEING HERE.  >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.  >> THAT HEARING HAD A LOT IN  IT.  LET'S START WITH THE EVIDENCE  ON THAT MEETING TO TRY TO  INVOLVE THE MILITARY.  THE DRAFT ORDER WHICH WOULD  SEEM TO POTENTIALLY BE ILLEGAL.  THAT WOULD INSTRUCT THE  SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO HELP  TRUMP WITH THE PLOT TO STEAL  THE ELECTION, EVEN AFTER  CERTIFICATION.  ONE QUESTION I HAD, CONGRESSMAN  -- A LOT OF IT WAS LAID OUT  CLEARLY.  I WAS CONFUSED, AND I DON'T  KNOW IF THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE  TRUMP WHITE HOUSE OR THE  EVIDENCE?  ABOUT WHETHER THE ULTIMATE  REALITY IS THAT IT STARTED TO  HAPPEN, THAT POWELL WAS THE  SPECIAL COUNSEL.  IF THIS WAS SIGNIFICANT OR A  MODEL?  CAN YOU SHED LIGHT IN?  >> WE HAD A CONFLICT IN THE  TESTIMONY ON THAT.  AS YOU SAW, WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL  DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE HAD  BEEN AN APPOINTMENT, THE  PAPERWORK HAD TO ABOUT DONE --  NEVERTHELESS, ACKNOWLEDGING  THAT THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO BE  GOING ALONG WITH THIS IDEA.  CITY POWELL ON THE OTHER HAND  THOUGHT SHE HAD BEEN APPOINTED.  I THINK IT IS UNCLEAR.  WHAT IS CLEAR, THE PRESIDENT'S  ALLIES WERE URGING HIM TO USE  THE MILITARY TO SEIZE VOTING  MACHINES TO APPOINT SOMEONE  UNQUALIFIED TO BE SPECIAL  COUNSEL.  TO ENFORCE THIS.  HE WAS VERY RECEPTIVE TO IT.  BECAUSE THEY WERE WILLING TO DO  WHATEVER IT TOOK.  THAT'S WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAS  ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING FOR.  >> YOU HAVE BEEN A PROSECUTOR  IN YOUR ROLE BEFORE SERVING  THIS COMMITTEE.  THEY ARE DIFFERENT ROLES.  I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE  KNOWN THE SERIOUSNESS WHICH YOU  APPLY TO THIS.  I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO GET YOUR  VIEW OF SOMETHING THAT FORMER  MOELLER PROSECUTOR SAID, HE  SPOKE ABOUT IT HERE.  TAKE A LISTEN.  >> YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING WITH  REGARD TO SOME OF THESE  WITNESSES, THEY WERE ASLEEP AT  THE WHEEL?  >> I THINK THAT IS BASICALLY  RIGHT.  THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD  MORE TOOLS, NOT FEWER TOOLS  THAN CONGRESS TO GET AT THE  TRUTH.  >> HAVE YOU HEARD BACK FROM THE  DOJ?  >> YES, I HAVE.  I CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT IT.  I HAVE HEARD SOME PEOPLE GET  INSIDE AND PEOPLE WERE.  >> MAKING SOME WAVES.  THAT WAS JUST LISTEN.  CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS A  COMPLIMENT TO YOUR COMMITTEE  WRAPPED IN AN ALARM BELL ABOUT  THE DOJ.  I THINK IT IS FAIR WHAT HE  WROTE.  WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS KIND OF  BREAKDOWN.  WHATEVER IT IS BETWEEN THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE  COMMITTEE.  IT ALSO REFLECTS THAT YOU GOT  WITNESSES FIRST.  DO YOU SHARE MR. WISEMAN  CONCERN?  COULD THE DOJ BE DOING MORE,  QUICKLY?  >> I VERY MUCH SHARE HIS  CONCERN.  I HAVE BEEN EXPRESSING A  SIMILAR CONCERN FOR MONTHS NOW.  IT IS SO UNPRECEDENTED, AND  I'VE BEEN PART OF MANY  CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS.  IT IS UNPRECEDENTED FOR  CONGRESS TO BE SO FAR OUT AHEAD  OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND  THE COMPLEX INVESTIGATION.  AS THE SENATOR WAS SAYING, THEY  HAVE GOT POTENT TOOLS TO GET  INFORMATION.  THEY CAN ENFORCE THEIR OWN  SUBPOENAS IN A WAY WE CAN.  . THE IDEA THAT A YEAR AND A HALF  AFTER THESE EVENTS, THEY WOULD  NOT HAVE TALKED TO THESE  WITNESSES -- EVENLY FOLK COUNTY  DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS WAY AHEAD  OF THEM.  I THINK IT'S CAUSE FOR GREAT  CONCERN.  >> ARE THEY AFRAID OF THE  ANSWER?  IN OTHER WORDS, IF THE ANSWER  BECOMES OVERWHELMINGLY TERMINAL  EVIDENCE AGAINST TRUMP AND THEY  HAVE IT, IT PUTS MORE ONUS ON  THEM IN THE EYES OF PEOPLE  INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT.  DO YOU THINK THEY ARE AFRAID OR  IS THERE SOME OTHER REASON?  >> I DON'T THINK THEY ARE  AFRAID.  SO MUCH AS A DESIRE AFTER --  HONESTLY, TERRIBLE LEADERSHIP  BY BILL BARR.  LOOK, I'M GLAD BILL BARR  FINALLY FOUND THE LIGHT.  HE CROSSED A LOT OF LINES  BEFORE HE GOT THERE.  INCLUDING INTERVENING CRIMINAL  CASES TO REDUCE ROGER STONE'S  SENTENCE.  TO MAKE MICHAEL FLYNN'S CASE GO  AWAY COMPLETELY.  THE DOJ SHOULD RESTORE THE  DEPARTMENT TO AVOID  CONTROVERSY.  I THINK IF THEY TAKE THAT TOO  FAR, THE DESIRE TO AVOID  CONTROVERSY, AND THEY SOMEHOW  IMMUNIZE THE FORMER PRESIDENT  BECAUSE IT WOULD BE  CONTROVERSIAL TO INVESTIGATE A  FORMER PRESIDENT, THAT'S A  POLITICAL DECISION.  THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS ONE.  >> I THINK YOU PUT IT VERY  WELL.  >> THANK YOU.  I THINK THAT IF THE ATTORNEY  GENERAL IS GOING TO FOLLOW THE  EVIDENCE WHERE IT LEADS, WE  HAVE ARTIE SEEN EVIDENCE  LEADING TO THE FORMER  PRESIDENT.  I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN  SIMPLY WAIT UNTIL YOU EXHAUST  ALL OF THE INVESTIGATIONS OF  THOSE THAT ATTACKED THE CAPITOL  THAT DAY.   THERE WERE MULTIPLE LINES OF  EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE  ELECTION.  THE MULTIPLE LINES NEED TO BE  INVESTIGATED.  THEY DON'T NECESSARILY START  OUT WITH THE PEOPLE ON THE  GROUND OF JANUARY 6th.  >> FINALLY, BEFORE I LOSE YOU,  WHATEVER EVERYONE THINKS OF  STEVE BANNON, THE PRESSURE GOT  TO HIM.  HE IS TRYING IN SOME WAY TO GET  OUT FROM UNDER THE TRIAL THAT  STEMS FROM THE CONSENT THAT  YOUR COMMITTEE AND THE CONGRESS  FOUND THE OTHER PERSON WHO HAS  GONE DOWN THAT ROAD IS MR.  NAVARRO.  HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.  >> I AM STUCK HERE WHERE MY  DUTY AND HONOR SAYS, I CAN'T  WAIVE THE PRIVILEGE.  WHAT I NEED TO DO IS RESPECT  THE LAW.  THE CONSTITUTION AND MY FORMER  COMMANDER IN CHIEF.  THE REASON WHY I THINK MIKE  PENCE IS GUILTY OF TREASON TO  PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE  COUNTRY, HE ACTED ON THE BASIS  OF A FLAWED LEGAL OPINION  CONCOCTED BY GENERAL COUNSEL  THAT HE DID NOT SHARE.  SELECT NOW CONGRESSMAN, DONALD  TRUMP WAIVED THE THAT DIDN'T  EXIST FOR STEVE BANNON.  WAS THERE ANY INDICATION FOR  BANNON AND NAVARRO?    >> YES.  THEY SHOULD HAVE TESTIFIED TO  BEGIN WITH.  YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT MR.  BANNON IS A PART OF WHAT LOOKS  LIKE A PRETRIAL PLOY, SUDDENLY  HAS INTEREST IN TESTIFYING --  YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK  DEMONSTRATES ANYTHING BUT A  DESIRE TO STAY OUT OF JAIL.  WE WOULD TAKE HIS TESTIMONY.  WE ALSO WANT THERE TO BE  JUSTICE.  IT CANNOT BE THE CASE THAT  SOMEONE WHO IS IN CRIMINAL  CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS WILL  ESCAPE

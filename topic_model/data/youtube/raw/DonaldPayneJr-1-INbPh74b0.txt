I’m glad President Trump listened
to Secretary Clinton and deployed
the U.S.Naval Ship Comfort to Puerto Rico— even though it was seven days after Hurricane Maria destroyed the island. But President Trump must 
do more and do it now. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States has a moral and legal duty to protect the well-being of our citizens. That’s why today—right now—the President
must order the Department of Defense to deploy all available assets to Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands to prevent this catastrophe from getting worse. The thousands of Puerto Ricans and all the
Virgin Islanders I represent deserve to know that our nation's priority is their well-being—and
their families' and friends' and fellow citizens' as well—American citizens.

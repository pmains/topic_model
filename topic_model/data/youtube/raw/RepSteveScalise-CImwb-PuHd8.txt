we discussed all this with the number two republican in the house gop whip congressman steve scalise of louisiana fresh off his own trip to the southern border and we caught up with him just a couple hours ago so you had a strong message for president biden we want to take a quick listen to that these kids are pawns in his dangerous game it's got a stop it was created when president biden got rid of things like the remain in mexico policy he could put that back in place tomorrow and stop this surge of illegals coming over so sir we've seen a lot of people go down to the border we've seen a lot of messages we're watching obviously the cartels make a killing off this uh talk a little bit more about what needs to be done yeah the situation is overwhelming and and it's out of control at our border and it was all created when president obama did some basic things the first thing he did uh was halt construction of the wall so right now we're paying contractors not to build wall they literally were told to abandon the work site which has created its own problems but the biggest change that that's having an immediate impact was when president biden got rid of the remaining mexico policy that was a plan that president trump negotiated with the president of mexico to get mexico whole to hold people that come across or try to come across illegally seeking asylum so instead of coming into the united states where they're given a basically a free pass into america and we never see him again they were staying in mexico and seeking asylum most of them over 90 percent of the cases were thrown out uh so they never even made it into the united states illegally uh but here you've got a case where by throwing that out the window it has sent a message around the world not just south and central america that our border is open and the drug cartels have been the biggest beneficiaries they they're literally controlling america's southern border they're making millions of dollars a day off of this trade the human trafficking or the sexual assault that goes along with it it's disgusting to see what they're doing to these young kids at the border and then they're being held in facilities in america the donna detention facility uh where literally they have cells where they're supposed to hold 33 kids and they've got over 400 kids in each of these and i thought it was president biden criticizing the previous administration for things like cages what they have is much worse it's inhumane in the middle of a pandemic yeah it's uh it certainly is we've been watching all this now for a couple of weeks and there hasn't been much to change anything is what's been surprising the administration actually announced today though uh that they've gotten mexico guatemala and honduras to put troops on their border which is if you remember exactly what president trump did with mexico to get troops to stop the flows and i just wonder i mean how priceless is it to watch the biden team slowly figure this out and realize they're going to have to embrace some of these trump ideas yeah it's not complicated what needs to be done to stop this surge at our border in fact every border patrol agent we talked to we talked to scores of them all said the same thing and and and clearly getting the northern triangle countries involved again uh is critical but the remain in mexico policy has to be re-established that was something president biden got rid of at the very beginning of his administration he can restore that it was working president trump negotiated it i don't care if you call it biden's remain in mexico policy but it worked and now uh the message has to be sent across the country again across the world that our borders not open biden has created this problem he can fix it sure the administration also considering cash payments uh to these countries i saw you had a reaction to this as well what exactly are they trying to do here it made a lot of people angry the idea of it yeah it's bizarre that they would create a crisis at america's border encouraging countries to send their young people to america illegally and then when they get overwhelmed because they botched this so bad the biden administration now wants to pay the countries off how about you just stop uh sending out the signal that america's southern border is open look you got new york giving 15 000 checks to people here illegally americans who pay taxes aren't getting that kind of money uh the lunacy has to end let's get back to common sense the things that worked that president trump did again biden doesn't have to like trump but trump's policies were working just put those policies back in place the bribes to other countries uh to reward them for sending thousands of people a day to our country illegally is not the answer yeah couldn't agree more what do you make of the new pick to lead customs and border protection this guy chris magnus he is a blm supporter from what we've seen appears to be pretty far to the left as well i'd love to hear his take on how he would stop this surge at the border you talk to the border patrol agents again they're overwhelmed they don't want to be in essence babysitters they came into this job because they want to stop the flow of illegal drugs from the cartels from mexico into the united states and over 40 percent of our border agents today are being diverted away from their main job because they have to take care of these kids that are coming in at such overwhelming numbers again the dawn of attention detention facility alone uh was set up for maybe 100 people there's over 4 000 there think about it you can't go to your favorite restaurant in many states at 25 capacity the federal government will shut them down and yet here you have at the at the border in america uh facilities that are over a thousand percent capacity and super spreader events where ten percent a minimum of these people coming over have coveted and they're putting them on top of each other not six feet apart six inches apart we saw this young girl crying and we asked her why she was crying she said i don't want to be here joe biden needs to go see that kamala harris needs to go see that they are ignoring this crisis hoping it'll just go the media will go away they don't want the problem to go away they created it and they won't stop it they ought to go see what they created it's a disgrace what they're doing to these young kids it's inhumane it's frankly it's if you look at texas's own law on child abuse and child neglect they're violating biden's folks are by violating the law on child abuse and neglect and the way they're treating those kids let's see yeah no it is it is something to see uh the way this is all happening and they won't let the media in the last few years what we saw they won't even let the media come of course yeah yeah they don't of course they don't want them to see it and the media just plays along which is just unbelievable um you also got to take a look at the border yourself you went to see the wall uh you went for a ride along there let's take a quick look at that so we're about to go over the levee that has the big section wall on it oh okay you look to the left here there's a massive gap that's where parker wall construction stopped there were gaps like that all up and down this stretch here so it's effectively worthless because there are gigantic holes in the fence so you've got you know this look here you talked about earlier how we're paying contractors to not build wall right now my orcas indicated last week and it was just hysterical that maybe they're going to fix some of the holes uh in the wall what do you actually think happens with this well again i mean think about the taxpayer getting fleeced here taxpayers are paying money to the contractors who have a contract to build the wall but biden literally told them to abandon the work site they didn't even clean up the works site so just the other day there was a border patrol agent who was chasing an illegal across a section of open wall that was being constructed that's now again an abandoned work site and it was at night so he didn't see a big hole that they had dug and didn't cover up and he went across it hit and severely injured himself they said they're not even sure if he's gonna be able to come back on the job this just happened the other day right so again they have no regard for the lives of our border patrol agents let alone these kids that are coming over the treatment they're getting the sexual abuse that's occurring on the 40-plus day journey for many of them uh this is this is a national disgrace what president biden created he broke it he could fix it today with the stroke of a pen and we i'm calling on president biden and kamala harris to come see it for themselves first of all but then to stop this they can stop this today we don't need an act of congress we appropriated the money to build the wall just start building it again it makes it makes no sense whatsoever congressman steve scalise sir thank you so much for the time good to see you as always great being with you thanks

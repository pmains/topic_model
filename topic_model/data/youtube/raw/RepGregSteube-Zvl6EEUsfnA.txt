the Chinese spy flight that hovered over key military bases in Mainland for days was able to listen in on our conversations quote we know the People's Republic of China used these balloons for surveillance high resolution imagery from YouTube flybys revealed that the High Altitude balloon was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations but President Biden completely downplaying the significance of that spy flight it's not a major breach I mean look it's totally it's a violation of national law it's our airspace and once it comes in our space we can do we want with it voter Congressman Greg stupid joins us now first off Congressman we're so glad that you're on the mend and you're feeling better and thank you for being with us but you know you've heard Biden say there no there's nothing to worry about this wasn't that big of a breach but now we're finding out that this spycraft was collecting data sending it right to China so how can I get up there and just dismiss this is no big deal well and then during the State of the Union Address he tries to act like it's some big deal that they shot it down after it traversed the entire Continental to the United States collecting the signal information and think about how debilitating this is is you have them collecting information and radio information of over military bases and they're trying to get nuclear information to try to jam signals to try to have uh knowing our our codes and our radio frequencies for things that we do this is a significant breach of National Security and this Administration sat back and let the Chinese Communist party surveil our military bases for the entire continental United States and then once they had gotten on all that information then shot it down what do you think happens going forward because clearly this was not a one-off they've been doing this for a while and presumably they're going to keep doing it well hopefully the armed services committee which I know there's been classified briefings of this there was classified briefings this week's uh in Congress but hopefully the armed services committee now that we have Republican control uh is going to have hearings on this and and pass bills to structure and to push the administration to actually defend our country from threats like this this is a significant national security threat the Chinese Communist party is the number one national security threat to the United States and this Administration Sat by and let them collect data and collect information for the entire continent of the United States and did nothing about it yeah and we have to get to this the house select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government held its first hearing yesterday let's listen to a piece of this and we'll talk about it in my time in Congress I have never seen anything like this dozens and dozens of whistleblowers FBI agents coming to us talking about what's going on the political nature at the justice department so you heard Congressman Jordan there what has been the most the biggest takeaway that you think from this hearing so far well we've all known that the doj and the FBI have been politicized over the last few years going back to the Russia collusion hoax and the surveilling on the Trump campaign but now you have actual FBI agents swearing an oath to be honest sitting before a congressional committee testifying that that's exactly what has been going on in the doj and the FBI so much so that they left the bureau because of the politicization that's going on so bringing these facts and evidence before the American people so they can see just how politicized that Joe Biden and the Democrats have politicized our intelligence gathering services our law enforcement Services is important for the American people to see the facts and evidence behind that and in that hearing I thought the Democratic response was appalling basically therefore this kind of weaponization because it helps them that's the bottom line finally sir uh this is your first time on Fox and Friends first since you're accident it was really really serious what happened to you how's your recovery going recovery's going great my head's back to normal um but my neck is back to normal I lost the sea collar a couple of days ago I still have blood in my lungs which is why I can't fly to DC right now so hopefully I'll be able to fly in March and then it's just time to recover on the pelvis crack I cracked my pelvis so I got six weeks non-weight bearing there but I will be back for the baseball game January or June 14th playing for the Republicans on the mound so we're on the men getting better every day so rehab is in your future until then that's right and let's face it the Republicans need you you carry them every year in that baseball game also you have a job in Congress but specifically for the baseball game Congressman stuby they need you there got to admit you look great you look better than a lot of people who didn't have what have happened to you we wish you the very best of luck we're thinking of you and praying for you looking forward to you hopping on that plane back to DC yeah looking forward to getting back to work thank you guys with that fun Fox and Friends starts right now have a good weekend go Chiefs [Music]

thank you madam president I rise today to urge my colleagues to reauthorize federal funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program children's health insurance it's not a person issue in this country and it never has been in 1997 the bill to create the Children's Health Insurance Program passed with bipartisan support it was introduced by late senator Ted Kennedy a Democrat from Massachusetts and our colleague senator Orrin Hatch a Republican from Utah this program has been a resounding success tens of millions of kids from all over the country have received access to preventive care doctor's visits prescriptions and dental and vision coverage as a result of this act of Congress children's health care is not a partisan issue in Nevada the great state that I represent either over the past 20 years more than 60,000 of Nevada's kids have benefited from our state chip program Nevada checkup together with the gains we have made due to the ACA s Medicaid expansion our rate of uninsured children has fallen by half making our program one of the biggest successes in the country today nine million children from low-income families nationwide including 27,000 from Nevada get their health insurance through chip if Congress continues to do nothing those nine million children won't be able to access won't be able to go to a doctor for their annual checkup nine million children won't be able to afford their prescriptions the parents of those nine million children will have to wait until their child's headache or infection or sore throat becomes an emergency before taking them to the hospital in 2008 the last time funding for chip was on the chopping block Senator Ted Kennedy said and I quote the test of a great nation is the way it treats its children we are a great nation we know how to take care of our kids Americans understand that children's health care is the kind of thing that should be beyond the reach of partisan politics governors from both medical professionals care providers and advocates from across this nation have already called on Congress to do its job and move as quickly as possible to reauthorize this funding Nevada's Republican Governor Brian Sandoval is one of those voices Republicans and Democrats alike know that kids can't go to school they can't go to soccer practice they can't learn their times tables or their fractions they can't do things that healthy happy kids like to do if they do not feel well but don't ask me why funding for chip is important listen to the voices of parents who lie awake at night worried that that coughed that their hearing down the hall in their child's room will not go away on its own it's scary enough to have a sick child no parent should have to live with the additional fear that they won't be able to afford the care their child needs no parent should have to choose between treating a cough that's been getting worse and worse for weeks and paying next month's rent people across the country are working every single day just to make ends meet chip is their lifeline just ask Lisa a self-employed mom her children are able to see the whiteboard in math class because chip allowed her family to afford glasses ask Leno whose daughter broke her arm on the monkey bars when she was four without chip Glenna would have had to take out loans to pay off that medical bill hear from Vanessa the excellent health care her daughter received after she contracted meningitis at age 12 was paid for with health insurance Vanessa purchased through chip Vanessa says that chip is the reason her daughter is alive today these are just three of the countless stories that I have heard from people who just don't know what they would do is private health insurance were the only option available to their family illness injury these things happen all of us get sick sometimes but going bankrupt trying to pay for your son or daughter's medical treatment that's not normal that should not be something we accept as part of our everyday lives every time I go home to Nevada I hear the same thing over and over from people I need they say to me my medical bills are out of control please please do something to help we should be working night and day around the clock to fix our health care system and relieve the burden of health care costs on working people allowing funding for chip to expire allowing state governments to go bankrupt allowing rural hospitals and our community medical centers to shut their doors and go out of business this is not what the American people sent us here to do we are the representatives of this great nation and it's time to act like it and stop playing politics with children's health thank you madam president for listening I yield the floor and I notice an absence of a quorum mark will call the roll

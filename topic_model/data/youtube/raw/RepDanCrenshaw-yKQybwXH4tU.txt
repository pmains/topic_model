we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw has landed hey welcome back everybody uh back to some policy deep dives um i hope you learned something today so uh to help you learn where you have a uh a phd with us a phd from harvard nonetheless uh dr scott winship thanks so much for being on a pleasure thanks for having me on so i got a long bio for you but i'm just going to say you're a senior fellow and director of poverty studies at the american enterprise institute so as the audience might guess we're going to talk about poverty it's a good subject to dive into especially as a republican because we're always accused of not caring about poverty uh and the left likes to uh make extravagant claims uh about it was it um it was it corey bush corey bush tweeted yesterday jayapal jayapal uh congresswoman jayapal yesterday tweeted that uh we have the fourth uh the fourth highest poverty rate in the world here in the united states i don't think that's true i think that's probably not true um doesn't mean it's not a problem doesn't mean poverty won't forever be a problem and something that we have an interest in solving we do care about solving it but i think we care about getting to the source of the problem and uh you being an expert on this you also it's also worth noting uh you're a senior policy advisor for um uh why can't i well i can't help me out man mike lee mike senator mike lee so uh you know you know what you're talking about uh so scott thanks for being on look let's um let's get to the to the initial question here which is what is the status of poverty in america right now how should we be thinking about it because everybody has all these different claims you know if you listen to bernie sanders and everybody else we just have more poverty than ever inequality is worse than ever everything is worse everything is worse and that's why we need socialism but you know to solve a problem you need to understand what it is first in an honest way so can maybe walk us through that yeah absolutely and i you know maybe we can come back to the tribal uh claim which you know my my response on twitter was if if if that's not fact checked you know the entire industry has really no no reason for existing i think um so what's the state of poverty america uh it's interesting this month we had new poverty numbers that came out um for calendar year 2020. so this was the year of the pandemic a lot of concern you know that hardship might have gone up there were all these claims in the middle of 2020 that hunger had doubled or tripled at the time my colleague angela rashidi and i had sort of said well you know that that doesn't sound right to us we think you're comparing uh apples and oranges here and and it turns out this month we were sort of vindicated um poverty in 2020 in the in the pandemic year was at an all-time low um it was at an all-time low among uh whites blacks latinos children single-parent families married parent families um you know in all all regions of the country uh and that's a great success story i think you know that as as conservatives um you know we don't necessarily always want to uh you know give give credit to um safety net policies but but the the policies that you all uh enacted in uh march and april of 2020 kind of in the middle of this emergency uh in a span of weeks um you know it was a huge success story um it wasn't you know how we would have done things if we'd been you know taking months to sort of think about the appropriate set of policies like probably not but uh but it was a great success given uh how quickly policymakers acted since then we've uh you know i think we've gone too far in the direction of uh of continuing to spend on safetynet programs and we can we can talk more about that but uh but we started pre-pandemic in a great place um and we're we're in an even better place now uh and i've sort of argued that suggests that we should be switching to some other priorities rather than uh continuing to focus on on the poverty rate yeah um so there's some interesting stats i think i did a video on this where you know if you compare this crisis to the 2008 one um the the lower quintile of earners were way worse off after that financial crisis way way worse off and they didn't it took them years to recover this time they ended up better off percentage-wise than the top did so there's always this talk about the how much more money the billionaires made and there's and the implication there is that they basically stole it from the middle class and and the lower quintile of earners but the but the numbers indicate that this just isn't true yeah that's exactly right there are all sorts of funny claims uh made last year about inequality in the top one percent um yeah if you cherry pick your dates um then you can you can compare uh you know a day in march when the stock market uh was not doing well because we had just entered a global pay endemic uh and then you compare that to later in the year you know when the stock market was doing quite well and you and you get these uh enormous um increases but but the data shows that really um you know recessions are uh tend to hit the top higher worse in percentage terms than they do people lower down um the best periods for growth of income at the bottom or in the middle class also tend to be the best periods for people to top inequality tends to grow um but if you want to reduce inequality the best way to do it is to start a recession um because recessions are not good for anybody uh so so yeah i i think there's just a lot of bad claims out there uh made by people who uh you know quote know that inequality is terrible and um and they're not going to move off of that position and and what's the give us a summary of the truth because it really my question isn't just the last couple of years but for the last 50 years and uh because because the claims are usually that you know it's just we're just way worse off than we were 50 years ago when it comes to inequality measures and poverty measures and you know again not saying everything is perfect and that we don't need to do anything but what what's at least what's the truth yeah yeah so you know the the perception has been heavily heavily influenced by uh the research of um of three economists thomas piketty who improbably had this best-selling uh 800-page book on inequality a few years ago um emmanuel saez and gabriel zuckman um and their numbers you know put out you know at this point 15 years ago uh more than that suggested that the top one percent um say in 1979 uh it received about 10 of of all income and then that by 2007 uh that was up to i think 24 if i'm remembering right so big you know more than a doubling of their share um over time so there were there are always criticisms of their numbers by people who are skeptical um over time those those criticisms have been borne out um and now the best research uh that i know of has been done uh by jerry otton who's a you know government economist in the treasury department um and david splinter who's in the joint committee on taxation um and they essentially find that the top 1 share of income you know really hasn't gone up since 1989 um in the 1980s it went up a little bit a few percentage points but but once you look at you know taxes and transfers all the redistribution that we actually do um because progressives and others you know want to worry about inequality at the end of the day we've done we've done a very good job keeping inequality down and and by the way you know if inequality had risen you know that shouldn't be the case that that's been a bad thing you have to actually make that case apart from uh whether inequality is reserved not rising inequality can have costs they can also have benefits um so yeah i mean i mean like to help people understand that a simple math problem right so if there's two people on the in the country and one makes fifty thousand dollars and one makes a hundred thousand dollars uh there's a fifty thousand dollar inequality disparity there and now if you double both their incomes a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars well then you also just doubled the inequality but it's but are better better is everybody worse off no no and so you know there then there's a question of what does it mean to be in poverty now versus 50 years ago as well that's that's another question worth worth uh unpacking uh you know being poor 50 years ago is probably worse than being poor now um being poor is always a relative term one question i have too is is how do we measure it who is included in this measure so i believe it's a it's household units right so but but again so is a is a senior citizen with a lot of savings but they're on a very small social security paycheck are they considered to be in poverty same same question about a 17 year old living with his parents but has a minimum wage job are they considered to be part of the poverty measure how do we like distinguish between like real poverty and that kind of poverty yeah no it's a great question and it gets very complicated the the official poverty measure um that we have you know is is the official measure because there are a bunch of policies over the last 50 years that are you know where it's actually written into the law that this is how you determine whether people are eligible for stuff um but it's it's a very flawed measure i think people on both the left and the right would would agree with that it only includes um uh government benefits for instance if they come in the form of cash so unemployment benefits count uh social security benefits count but food stamps don't count um the the the tax credits that we have uh which have expanded quite a bit in particular this year the child tax credit the earned income tax credit those aren't taken into account the fact that taxes have gone down for the middle class and for the poor over time doesn't show up as increased resources to them um so so that's a that's a big flaw housing benefits healthcare benefits don't don't show up as income in these measures yeah but but my question kind of still stands that like if you're just really rich because you're a trust fund baby and you happen to have a minimum wage job that you that you um report to the irs are you are you lumped into the lowest quintile of earners are you lumped into the poverty measure right in that case they would be if if they have a lot of wealth um you know which is you know different from income income is kind of a flow of resources but if you have wealth which means you just have assets that are uh accruing in the background um that doesn't go into whether you're poor or not um so so folks who aren't working much because they don't need to because they're wealthy they you know could look like low-income people in the data you can have a lot of business owners who have a bad year um and they actually have negative income uh that they report to irs for instance um and they will show up as poor um so there are all these tricky things as you say you know if you're if you're kind of a college kid a 20 year old living at home um you'll your whole your entire family's income uh will will get counted if you're a 20 year old living with another 20 year old and and you're both uh being supported by your parents that income probably won't show up in the data and and you'll look poor um so there's there's a whole bunch of problems with the official measure and you know what one thing uh you talk about is absolute versus relative inequality can you can you talk about that and how progressives often fail to distinguish between the two yeah so i think um you know you can think about so this absolute relative distinction comes into play a lot with with with poverty um with economic mobility for instance poverty i mean you know the the the way that some people on the left get away with saying the us has such egregiously high poverty is they use a relative measure um which a relative poverty measure says you know do you do you make at least half of what the typical person in the country makes um and if you don't then you're then your candidate is poor well of course if inequality goes up if the middle class you know gets a little bit richer than people lower down that means poverty goes up even if everybody's getting better off over time an absolute measure just says no we're going to draw a line we're going to try to we'll change that every year for the cost of living but it should represent like a fixed standard of living um if you're below that you're poor and and so the absolute measure makes a lot more sense to me on mobility um yeah there's there's there's sort of this um this distinction between absolute mobility which is you know do you end up better off than your parents uh or not um uh even if you're sort of still uh kind of stuck in the same station as your parents were if you think about in those terms so maybe you're a security guard and your dad was a security guard but you're a better paid security card than than your dad that's that's absolute mobility um relative mobility is all right my dad was a security guard and i would like to be a lawyer um you know do i how hard or easy is it for me to become a lawyer um both of those i think are important the the poverty side i think i think relative poverty is just a big um sort of red herring to focus on on the mobility side i think i think both are important yeah and that makes that makes more sense um you know and it's important to address certain claims like bernie sanders will claim there's a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one percent as again as if rich people are only getting rich by stealing money from the middle class and how how do they even come up with this i you know but but what's your response to it yeah i mean i i think there is this view that you know the the size of the pie is fixed and so if if one group you know if the top does better it's because they have uh taken it at the expense of people lower down um and that's that's just a silly view in in many ways you know the the first way is that the size of the pie is not fixed if if we lived in a socialist society and never let anybody get much richer than anybody else well one of the consequences of that would be that nobody would take risks nobody would work hard nobody would go through med school and residency and all of that for the rewards um that accrued to them later and as a result over time the size of the pie would would not increase nearly as much uh as it does when we say well we're gonna you know let quote jeff bezos become you know one of the richest people in the world because uh if we do that we're liable to help a lot of people on the form of jobs at amazon but also like all of the cheaper goods that that we now can get from amazon's website the economy grows faster over time and that that pays off to mid to the middle class and to lower income americans too and is it more accurate if you're going to assess poverty to to understand what people can afford i mean to understand what kind of lifestyle they can live because i've seen other studies that when you actually talk to people and do survey data on on their lifestyle choices then it's then it becomes pretty clear that they're they're they're affording a lot more things than you thought you know to be impoverished in america everybody has tvs and iphones so something's going on here well and you know i'm not sure what that is uh but it's at least worth unpacking um and now now oren cass would say look that's it's true that inequality is not as bad as people say it is because of wealth transfers but as conservatives don't we want to stop these wealth transfers and and that's a fair point right and and this we'll get into some of the solutions maybe a point you'd agree with right because you tend to focus on the source of the problem now it's long-term and it's and it's tough whereas we're always kind of looking at a band-aid right these like short-term fixes which create long-term dependency and uh it's hard to break that cycle um but i don't know can you comment on those studies that show what people are actually buying and consuming um and maybe does that give us a better indication of what poverty in america actually looks like yeah i think so a lot of great research in that regard has been done by um bruce meyer and jim sullivan there at the university of chicago in notre dame robert rector who's at the heritage foundation here in dc he's done some really good work there too and they do show that if you look at things over time whether it's you know what what kinds of things do people own everything from you know i think people tend to fixate on cell phones and big screen tvs and and things like that but but really you can sort of go much more basic things like you know what's happened to washing machine ownership over time what's happened to uh the share of households with air conditioning what's happened to the number of rooms per person or the square footage you know in in in their home per person and all of that has gotten um quite a bit better over time even at the bottom in some cases especially at the bottom and in a lot of ways that's that research is a lot less ambiguous than some of the research research about you know the official poverty rate or what's happened to incomes because all of that gets bogged down in some pretty technical measurement uh stuff that would bore your audience to tears uh but but that ends up being really important and and i think when you get those measurement things right it actually does tell the same story as as this story about you know what are what are people actually able to afford and what kind of amenities do they have um you know joe biden was talking today on uh in a statement and a variety of topics and one of the things he said um stuck out to me it's kind of the typical bernie sanders refrain which is you have um you know billionaire ceos and they because they don't take a paycheck you know they don't they don't pay their fair share um it's not the worst point uh you know because they're they're clearly engaging in a loophole there uh they'll they have a variety of methods um they're they're i think jeff bezos like loans makes gives himself a loan or something uh so they can write it off you know so that that's a little squirrely uh to be fair so you know but what do you i know this isn't necessarily your focus but kind of curious um you know how you would respond to that because it doesn't seem to me that the the the solution is what they propose it is which is basically a wealth tax and that that has never worked anywhere it's been tried it'll be a massive uh again these people are still gonna buy their yachts guys like this is what it's all about they're still gonna buy their mega yacht they're just not going to invest in anything new yeah you know so and it makes us feel good because it's like oh we got them but did we get them it doesn't seem like we got them well and a wealth tax in particular you know one way to make sure that the people at the top are buying more more yachts and more uh sort of ostentatious things as to is to create a wealth tax because then all their incentives are to spend uh whatever money they have because they'll keep you know saving it and accumulating more wealth will no longer make make any sense to them so you know are we better off as a country uh encouraging uh millionaires to buy more sports cars uh at yachts versus uh invest you know their wealth in productive enterprises that are going to create jobs that are going to create innovative new products that will improve people's lives i think it's pretty clear you know that what we want is probably the latter a wealth tax you know would be the single best way that that scenario i've mentioned before you know if we were living in a socialist society and prevented anybody from from getting very rich you know wealth tax would do that in a matter of a few years uh the kind of wealth tax that uh that gabriel zuckman uh and and uh and senator warren uh are talking about it would just be a disaster yeah and where it's been tried i think the the tax base decreased so you don't get the revenue that you're that you're asking for and there's like they're selling it to voters as if like voters they almost sell it to voters like as if you're going to get richer if we do this but it's not true the government government gets richer then we wasted on a bunch of bs so you know like they leave that part out um but it does beg the question like how do you prevent those loopholes maybe that's another topic but um i'm surprised you know what i'm surprised they don't do is propose like a like a millionaire minimum wage right because that would sort of solve the problem like if you if you are if you are jeff bezos and you're the ceo of this company you have to get paid this much and you just make them get paid i mean i would that would seem to be to be the most clear-cut way to do it but you know these aren't exactly but i don't think but in the end i don't think it's really about the fair share i think it's about resentment politics i think they just hate people um who are wealthy and they do believe in this this strange notion that um because somebody gets wealthier you get poorer which is the zero-sum game that isn't really true yeah i think that's right and they and i think where that comes from you know in some ways is just you know there was this period in the second half of the 40s you know 1950s most of the 1960s where there was a ton of economic growth and it and it was sort of broadly pretty broadly distributed um you know that was due to some you know historical circumstances that we don't fully understand that we that we can't repeat or we don't know how to repeat um there were circumstances that operated around the world um you know that was just an incredible period of growth for developed countries and we lost that and then with a lag after that inequality started going up but the 1970s you know was sort of a slow growth decade where inequality wasn't really increasing um it was only kind of in the 1980s or so when when the top 1 percent started to pull away they didn't do well in the 1970s um and since 1980 the best periods for the top have been the best periods for everybody else so it it's it's really kind of this nostalgia i think that we have um for for the mid 20th century uh and feeling like you know if we didn't have all this all this inequality um this increase in inequality which has now been questioned by by a lot of researchers then we somehow would would have that golden era again which is just not true yeah uh let's talk about uh some of the root causes i mean the different types of poverty and uh and how you distinguish between them and then you know we'll get to sort of how you solve them yeah so i think root causes you know it's it's it's hard i think liberals and conservatives tend to sort of focus on liberals kind of focus on outside circumstances conservatives tend to focus on individual you know personal responsibility hard work and i think both are important i think um uh you know there there is a fair degree of intergenerational immobility where if you're born to a poor family it is it's it's harder for you to escape poverty as an adult and that's for a variety of reasons from you know money being important which i think the left tends to think is the whole story um i tend to think that's a much smaller part of the story um part of the part of the story is you know just having parents who even with the best of intentions you know don't necessarily have the education or the skills uh to to know how to equip their kids uh to succeed out there in the world um part of it is you know the neighborhood that you grow up in you know what sort of aspirations uh do your neighbors have part of its deep-seated historical stuff i mean there's there's a reason why um african-americans have much lower economic mobility than that white americans do that relate to you know just a whole set of historical circumstances that uh that burden uh burn those families uh in a way that that that few uh white americans are um but i think that the trick for policy is to keep in mind that the messages that we send to people also are really important if we sort of tell people you know look there's nothing you can do about your fate because you were born with these uh you know with these barriers or these disadvantages that that what does that say to people that basically says okay well then you know you the federal government you know owe me uh you know uh transfers so that i can no longer be in poverty um that actually like works on sort of a mathematical level right we could we could just give everybody uh who's poor a certain amount of money and raise them above a poverty line but that's not going to help uh their long-term prospects it's not going to help them invest in their human capital it's not going to help them uh help their kids um you know escape poverty themselves uh and it also would threaten to kind of slow economic growth generally and encourage more and more people to sort of see themselves as uh as not being able to determine their own fate and is being owed recompense um from from the government because of that um so it is really important to to emphasize you know that people do have agency um to emphasize things like the success sequence uh you know which which basically shows that if you uh if you graduate from high school if you delay having kids until you're married if you you know have a a steady work uh experience then the chances are going to be poor uh are pretty are pretty small um so i i think policy's gonna balance both of those out yeah yeah and the research on that is good i mean you make a a series of very basic decent choices like finish high school don't have kids before you get married and have a job then you're going to be doing okay um but but you know the people who aren't doing okay like there's a variety of reasons some of it's intergenerational meaning it's just passed on and there's just no role models around you and that's that's a kind of a heartbreaking situation for a kid growing up into that it is hard to see how they do better um and then there's other situations where there's there's always going to be people who are just less talented and less hard-working than everybody else and there is it's harder to see a solution for that and so and one of the reasons we we should distinguish between um different types of poverty or even just lower income in general or lack of mobility however we want to call it uh is because it seems like there's a there's probably places where there's bigger bang for our buck from a policy perspective like where would we reduce uh poverty the most and it so where is yeah that know that that's a great question um uh yeah where how would i begin there so there's there's a fair amount of research showing that there are low-income kids um who do you know work hard in school and uh and and build up uh their skills um but then they don't go on to higher education or they go to a school that's much less rigorous than schools that they could get into and so there you know there's a big argument that there's a there's a matching problem for a lot of lower income uh smart kids that um that they just don't end up uh living up to their potential um for a variety of reasons not not sort of knowing how the college process works and things like that and the opposite is true too like uh people who aren't ready for prior colleges get in because of uh you know because of policy reasons um uh you know i'm talking yeah that's that's exactly right and then the sort of college for all mentality i think has been rightly criticized by oran oren cass and a lot of other folks that's what i was trying to remember to say because of affirmative action anyway sure and and and yeah having uh having a variety of pathways that aren't getting a four-year college degree i think is is really important um i think starting early you know by the time kids enter uh kindergarten there are these really big test score differences um uh by by class um and by race and so i think part of the solution has to be to figure out how do you narrow those things that is a very tricky question conservatives you know i think have not thought enough about that liberals have thought more about it but their answers have been things like head start which doesn't really look like it's that effective in the long run um it's things like pre-k you know which is a big component of the reconcilia reconciliation bill coming up but but the evidence base on on pre-k is is not great either um so i think that's a that ought to be a real real focus for policy makers on both sides yeah um i mean is it is it is it possible to focus on the the intergenerational side of it and i guess how would you do it um you know to sort of because it's you really want to help the people who are helpable uh and and there's they're like the the left does make a compelling argument in this in this sense when they're saying like look uh in a couple ways and this kind of gets to the the short-term versus long-term fixes and they're like yeah you can think long-term all you want but they've got to build pay bills next month so you have to give them money to do that and there's no way shape or form for them to get that done by next month so you have to do it for them now of course long term that just traps them into dependency and it and it and that dependency gets passed on generation i mean what they're teaching uh their next generation is how to get the benefits yeah and uh and more importantly what you don't do so that you keep the benefits don't like like get a job so that's a problem right um there's all these disincentives so how do you do both i guess yeah so i've been trying to think about that a lot this year um you know the the expansion of the child tax credit that um that the democrats have have done um back back in the march reconciliation bill and that they're trying to expand now um i and others have argued is a really bad idea essentially it gave you know it's giving sort of 250 300 a month um to people even if they don't work um which is a big change uh in the policy and and so you do worry that that's gonna uh create incentives for people not to work or to or to not be married um so what would it look like if you did something different well i i think you know part of the answer is um is you actually don't focus on on poverty um i kind of contrast what's happened to poverty rates which have gone down quite a bit in the last year with what's happened uh in education you know where increasingly increasingly the research is showing that kids have lost like somewhere between a half a year and a year of normal schooling because we couldn't figure out how to uh how to get them into into classrooms sooner we couldn't we didn't do anything like remedial summer school or tutoring which they've done in the uk so so that's just a gigantic failure uh in the long run that that we have an entire generation that that has you know fallen behind because of covet the other thing i think you could do is when you when you come up with policies that actually would reduce poverty you design them in such a way that these risks these kind of unintended consequences um are minimized and so i've proposed for instance taking the earned income tax credit which is a you know a sort of bonus that low-income workers get but you have to work to get it um i've proposed expanding that for married couples um who have one or two kids uh fairly fairly dramatically um and that would sort of send signals about marriage and sort of what the payoff is to marrying or not marrying you can do things like institute work requirements in our safety net programs you know we have we have those for uh this small cash welfare program now tanf which used to be a lot bigger and now has become pretty small we don't have them very much for things like food stamps for snap benefits or for housing benefits so we could actually be more generous with those benefits if we paired them with uh work requirements or time limits we could say like we're gonna we're actually gonna be more generous but you know after a couple years you're gonna be expected uh to work your way off of them um we could do things i've proposed this year something a little bit more controversial i guess which would be you know essentially a baby bond account where kids would essentially have money deposited into an account that when they turn 18 they could use for things like home ownership small business investment uh higher education things like that um so that so there are a number of things you can do that the where to get the money these days you know it's obviously a gigantic problem and so that argues less for expanding benefits and more for uh building incentives into the programs we do have like like work requirements or time limits yeah it seems like common sense there used to be in my estimation a little bit more bipartisan agreement on that but democrats are just fully opposed to any work requirement at all it just yeah it's like they want you trapped in that it's like they want it and and just to be clear the earned income tax credit the reason that works well is because it's like a glide path it's not this cliff that as soon as you st as soon as you take that promotion you lose money uh from the government and that's a disincentive to take a promotion and then again it traps people and so the younger income tax credits are just a better method for that um yeah is this kind of seeing this this question uh pop up and it takes us back to sort of the previous conversation about just assessing the reality that we live in um but i thought it's it's interesting so i want to bring it up and it's on this the the leisure time um so there's sort of a narrative about middle and lower income americans having to increasingly work longer hours uh two or three jobs to make ends meet and uh does the data the question is does the data reflect this and if not uh is there a sociological explanation for this trend yeah so the the data doesn't reflect that um essentially the amount of uh work that uh that men have done um so so i guess i put it a couple ways the the amount of work that working men do uh has not uh gone up in decades uh probably going back to i don't know 1940 or so um the work that women have done has increased a lot and that's you know to by my lights i i think that's a positive story it reflects you know kind of more opportunities for women we could get into the whole thing about how much of it is they're you know having to bail out their husbands um i think that's just empirically a totally totally wrong story uh big picture-wise um what has changed a lot is that uh the number of men who are working uh who are of working age but not working uh that has gone up quite a bit um and and and some people don't realize this that's gone up quite a bit for about 70 or 80 years 70 or 80 years as well it's another like very long term trend and because of that and because more of those men are lower skilled men uh it's actually the case that uh that people on the lower end of the income scale uh work less than than they used to um not more people on the higher end i think the research shows actually do work work more um it's partly because women are working more but it's also partly that professional men uh you have probably increased their work hours uh a little bit um but overall you know it's just not true that people are work you know sort of quote working harder um for the same pay or for for declining today and almost like they're working less for more as opposed to working more for less yeah and you are the retirement age you know has fallen uh over decades as well so it's not just sort of how many hours a week do you work or how many weeks a year you know we work fewer years of our lives because we're living longer and and retirement starts earlier so uh in that sense it's a it's a very positive story over over time the the men dropping out of the workforce uh part of the story is not is not a good story by any stretch but um but but it's a different story than like oh people are having to work longer hours and harder because their pay isn't keeping up in the current situation where employers are really struggling to find workers uh the current situation also kind of debunks that myth because if people were truly struggling and trying to work all these jobs then they would be working jobs so something's going on and look at obviously some of the explanation has been um getting paid to stay at home but that's that benefit has now ended so maybe we do see uh some resurgence but in states where we ended it like in texas i think months ago the problem the problem still persists so so how are people having enough income to just stay at home and not work uh and not go back to work i mean where are they getting this from yeah i think it's a really complicated story i mean i think i think at the end of the day you know the the safety net benefits um are a big part of the story um in particular you know the the the checks that people got the 1200 checks the um there were what three three rounds of checks i guess that people got over over the course of a year um you know when the data came out showing savings rates for the united states um we in 2020 we had just these off the charts savings rates um and and what that indicated is that a lot of those checks unsurprisingly went to people who didn't really need them um and just save the money i think a lot of a lot of it went to people who you know were lower income definitely benefited from them were able to sort of buy more food and things like that but probably even a lot of them ended up with more than what they were used to having um and and we're able to save some of it um i i think i think those benefits um and the monthly child tax credit would you know it has been going out since july i think those have um prevented a lot of people from from working who otherwise would have and i and i think the proof will be in the pudding you know now that now that the federal uh part of the expansion has expired um you know the other thing is in some places the health situation is still a scare for some folks for some people the child cares you know constraints are still a problem um but but as for how people are surviving i i think i think they're surviving because uh because of the policy response over the last year and a half which which i think probably went further than it than it ought to have poverty the the numbers i've seen poverty in 2021 are lower than they were in 2019 before the pandemic so so it's not that we kept hardship at the pre-pandemic levels we've actually driven it even lower um so i think i think policymakers really need to take a take a look at that moving forward wondering what like the perfect system would look like if you could just rewrite it all um you know we've kind of gotten into it you know it seems like it would be a very much a simplified welfare system that doesn't have a million different programs and it has the incentive structure that an earned income tax credit has and everything would just go under that now it doesn't quite solve some of the worst intergenerational poverty problems because there's a in any right about this plenty you know social capital right it doesn't solve the the social problem and uh it might make you survive but the goal in life is not surviving it's it's pursuing it's pursuing your happiness i think we wrote something like that 1776. and uh and so it's that's a hard that's just a harder problem to solve i mean and is there has anything worked there is it just community programs i i'm sure they've been tried over and over again right whether it's a community center with job training and social services and it just doesn't seem to make it dent might might help a few here there but not others i mean um any ideas come to mind yeah no it's a great question i think you know the place where we've tried to revive um if you think about it broadly in terms of associational life you know what we what we do together with each other um the place that we've that we've thought most about that i think as policy people is trying to fix the declining family and you know we have we have not figured out how to do that um single-parent households are no longer increasing it's sort of leveled off at a at a very high plateau but we certainly haven't managed to to push it down um we've tried everything from marriage promotion programs during george w bush's administration those were evaluated pretty rigorously and for the most part didn't work um uh yeah we've we've not the original welfare reform law in 1996 one of the big goals was to reduce out of wedlock birth that didn't happen and i think it just shows how difficult it is especially for federal policy to move the needle on some of this stuff i think one answer is that we need to figure out how to use this catholic idea of subsidiarity which basically says if lower levels of government or civil society can address a problem then they ought to be the ones to try to do it right now the federal government has become such a big actor uh that a lot of communities have have essentially lost the ability like their their muscles uh their policy muscles of atrophied um uh to sort of address some of this stuff themselves if the federal government's just writing checks uh to alleviate poverty what do you do as a mayor um or city council person you know you're sort of relying on on on federal policy to do all the work so i think we need to uh to send some more authority um policy-making authority back to states localities and ultimately civil society paul ryan had a really neat idea uh when he was uh the chair of the budget committee um which would have essentially consolidated a bunch of welfare programs and sent them to states and localities and let essentially non-profit caseworkers catholic charities things like that uh administer some of these because they're local they know the the people that are sitting on the other side of the desk from them uh in ways that a federal bureaucrat doesn't uh doing doing some things along those lines i think is probably the start of of trying to rebuild some of what we've lost uh at the local level yeah and that makes sense one of the most uh glaring examples of poverty is homelessness is that something you look at a lot and uh well again what would the right solution to that look like yeah yeah so i'm less of an expert there uh the numbers on homelessness are pretty uh lousy as you can imagine just because it's hard to it's easy to count uh people who are living in homes once every 10 years it's really hard to count the number of people sort of on the street and it changes over the course of the year um i i think there most people would say you know that that we've got to find transitional services um that's a pretty clear instance where the solution is not you know just give people cash right that's kind of the dilemma we all face when there's a panhandler you know do you sort of see this person you feel for them uh you want to give them cash but ultimately you don't know how it's going to get spent and uh and so rather than then sort of the just just give people money approach which is popular uh on the democratic side of the house these days um i think it's more about providing services um giving them uh opportunities you know by i don't know providing providing a place where potential employers could you know could reach them to tell them they have a job interview things like that providing clothes for job interviews things things of that nature transitional housing well the tough thing about that population though is they can't they can't work right they're they're not you you could offer them a job but there's no way they could they could do it because there's something wrong i mean there's something deeply deeply wrong and um you know we just haven't figured that out what what to do you know what do you what do you just did you create a massive community somewhere outside the city so they're not sleeping in tents in the city uh and we kind of did that in texas uh when governor rabbit stepped into the austin problem and um you know you you when you couple that with social services i don't see any other options there's a really interesting project in houston it's mostly privately funded too it looks like a college campus but now it's mostly for families that have become homeless so it's i'm not i'm not sure that they deal with like the schizophrenic on the street sure but uh but at least it's it's a it's a pretty successful model yeah the other thing that i've heard you know which which isn't satisfying uh to anybody is that you know a really valuable thing that you could do is along the lines of d regulatory stuff with housing there used to be back in the days you know these sort of single residency single resident occupancy kind of men's men's hotels you know which were kind of just a room uh not at all the sort of amenities that uh that most of us would would would be able to live with but which would be better than sleeping in a tent right in a dorm situation or something yeah yeah exactly and those have kind of gotten regulated out of out of existence um you know the last 50 years or so so that that would be uh a useful step too i think yeah that's interesting and uh that would make a lot more sense and any other any other parting words on on the subject well yeah i think you know i'm trying to write something now uh uh that's that's relevant to the reconciliation debates that are happening you know i i think as as much of a success story as it was that um that 2020 wasn't essentially a depression you know on the scale of what we saw in the 1930s i think there was a point where we needed to pivot away from you know getting safety net benefits into the hands of people um at some point we we ought to have focused more on uh the health crisis on you know figuring out how to get kids back in school and and and over their learning losses and so moving forward i think and hopefully you know is it during the debate over reconciliation um that that we just focus on these other problems including the deficit by the way um you know that that we are really behind uh the curve dealing with um whereas we've we've really had this this nice success story of of dealing with poverty over the last uh year and a half so that would be uh kind of my uh my advice to policymakers moving forward but we'll you're much closer to this we'll you sort of have a better sense of what's going to happen here than than i do but it should be an interesting month and a half the unfortunate reality is there's not a lot of uh common sense problem solving that's occurring at the moment it's uh it's extremely partisan so well we'll see what happens with that with that bill but um you know it it really is just a a massive lurch toward um the dependency driven welfare state and it's it's sort of the dependency creating welsh welfare state um and it's it's the the hard part about about this for conservatives is it's hard to unravel that you know um i mean you saw our side just get real mad when some of us were against two thousand dollar free checks you know that would go to well over 100 million people never lost their jobs i mean you know and uh maybe that explains why some of them still haven't had to find jobs because if if you have a family of four you're getting thousands and thousands of dollars and um it's it's you know is this is this really the best use of our of our taxpayer money um well yeah scott thanks for your thanks for your expertise on this subject appreciate it thank you for having me it's been uh it's been a pleasure

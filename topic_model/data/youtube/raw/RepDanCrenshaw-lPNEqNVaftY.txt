we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw hey everybody welcome back you know i want to get into some deep diving into some policy um i don't know we don't do that often enough these days well maybe that's not true um but uh today i want to talk about housing i think this affects a ton of people especially people my age millennials we we find it more difficult to find an affordable place to rent or and certainly buy more millennials are continuing to live with their parents gen z is going to have the same problem i want to dissect the reasons for this and maybe look forward to some solutions on what we can actually do about it um and i have a feeling that just free housing for everybody probably won't work very well but maybe my guest will disagree uh my guest today is howard husick he's an adjunct scholar in domestic policy studies at the american enterprise institute uh focuses on local government civil society urban housing policy uh also an executive senior fellow with the philanthropy roundtable look he's been everywhere to include the harvard kennedy school both graduated from there and uh now we're talking today howard thanks so much for being on thank you congressman it's great to be on so want to talk about housing you also have a book called who killed civil society the rise of big government and the decline of bourgeois norms i kind of want to ask you about that at some point too i think that's a that sounds like an interesting title and it gets it probably the heart of the culture wars that we find ourselves in um but uh you know maybe wrap it into uh i bet you can wrap it into our discussion however you like um but i caught my eye so um look why is housing so expensive let's just let's just start let's just get go right from the top what's your analysis on why it's so expensive and um you know what do we do about it well it's interesting housing is expensive in some places and not expensive than some other places so housing is really expensive in new york in san francisco in boston has been anyway and that's because this is not going to shock you demand exceeds supply yep and that's really basic and why don't we have more supply well because regulation inhibits the growth of supply and it does it in a couple of ways first of all it's really hard to build new housing california is the ultimate example they've got environmental laws that tremendously increase the cost of construction uh there's gonna there's gonna be new uh environmental laws they have solar panels on new construction and it goes on and on and on and so anytime you do that you increase the cost right sounds like a good social good but it increases and that's a fact like i've talked to developers in houston that do development in houston and in in california and they tell me it's maybe four times the the time to build something same thing yeah and housing is you know depends on your salary but housing is a lot more affordable in houston and that's why california for the first time is losing population i mean that is an amazing thing california has been you know the destination for generations for americans and now you have a reverse exodus because of high housing prices caused not only by the construction costs but by zoning right so if you look at san jose california which is one of the ten largest cities in the united states even though people don't think of it that way you know ninety percent of the land is single-family zoning if you want to convert your single-family house to a two-family you can forget about it yeah that's another way that supply is inhibited is do we have to acknowledge the fact too that we just have more people you know we're always going to have this finite amount of space that we can live in and more and more people have a preference for living in cities you know is this is this even if our regulations were perfect do we just have to acknowledge this inevitability of of rising prices well i actually don't think so i think we're seeing um i think we're at a watershed i think prices are going to stay high in california but i think the pandemic is a big change maker and suddenly you can work from home in buffalo and work for facebook yeah this is this is going to be a real game changer and we're starting to see an exodus from the expensive metros yeah expensive retros were a big so you think it's going to balance itself out in a sense well i i think it's too soon to tell but uh but i'm seeing that as well i agree with you i i'm i'm hearing it from people all the time they're like our office just told us never come back you know which is did anybody really like commuting no but i do like i mean i i like being around people you know i don't know i don't know that i would do well in a purely remote situation but some people do yeah but uh if if you could i agree with you you know i i miss the water cooler uh and and the mini fridge but uh you know if people can i like stealing other people's food in the mini fridge well i'm the boss so they can't tell me no that's great i'm just kidding ethics chill jeez but look if you can get a really great house i'm from cleveland ohio originally right there's a city there that used to be the richest wealthiest city in the united states called shaker heights ohio you know you can buy a mansion there for a quarter of a million dollars you can't buy a parking space in san francisco for a quarter of a million dollars or in midtown manhattan that is actually not much of an exaggeration so people are going to figure this out and say if i'm getting the same paycheck and i can get five times as many square feet you know i'm going to think about that okay so you've kind of successfully debunking that i mean that so the the real problem then is we're not building enough in the places that we have in the in the space that we have um you know i want to read some statistics here prior to the pandemic more than 20 of millennials lived with their parents which is up from 11 percent in 2001 and this has led uh in part or maybe perhaps a consequence of you know causality can work in both directions a delay in millennials forming families we definitely having kids at a later age as millennials but that's when they should be purchasing homes so you know where do we start i mean uh how can somebody you know normal middle class millennial um how do we make it more affordable for them or again kind of the same question as before should they just be looking elsewhere do we have to disabuse ourselves of this notion that you have to buy in this neighborhood right from the beginning or right downtown right from the beginning is that or have we just changed the way we think about housing well one thing we can do and i'll take a slight tangent on this we could help with school choice and with improving public schools because there's a lot of concentration of demand in quote-unquote good school districts yeah so we're playing a kind of a musical chairs game with those and when you're taking away some of the chairs or not adding chairs well the cost of the remaining shares goes up right but you know if you could say look i can move to this low-cost neighborhood but i still know the schools are going to be okay or if they're not okay i could take my voucher and go to a school that is okay that would help even things out too yeah um how do you see the effects of the pandemic the policies during the pandemic um have they been beneficial how have they affected the housing market maybe structurally speaking long-term speaking um you know so we've allowed for mortgage forbearance um which means basically delay in your payments um eviction moratoriums at federal level at the state levels so you know how soon do you think we can transition back to normal and have these been effective strategies and what's what's not an effective strategy when it comes to helping people in times like this what about canceling rent you know things like that right so i think mortgage forbearance is okay because it doesn't mean that it's wiped off the books right so if banks say you just pay later pay it later and we're not gonna you know put that on your credit rating but that's okay because people have lost income uh you know to the extent that people use that and they still have their income while they're getting an interest-free loan and you know that's unfortunate and we hope they're not doing that yeah the eviction moratorium and canceling rent is is a real a big problem and i actually criticized the previous administration for adopting that and i'll tell you why many many you know you say the word landlord and you you think of like daddy warbucks twirling his mustache right let me just tell you there are a lot of landers who are mom and pop immigrant most of them i would say most yeah and they bought you know uh a two three four unit place or maybe they bought two two family houses and suddenly there's an eviction moratorium well are they ever gonna get that money they don't think so there are people in new york that are owned tens of thousands of dollars and they're you know low-income immigrant families so and there are people who are basically taking advantage of this eviction moratorium because all you have to do is say yeah i'm a victim of the pandemic and check a box we don't even know if you're out of work what so we have to understand are there needy tenants yes they should get the kind of direct payments that this giant bill does a lot more than that but to the extent that it directs direct payments toward really needy people well that seems fine and then they can use that money to do what pay their rent yeah that makes sense but having an eviction moratorium we've got to understand this is this is a circle it's not unrelated to the health of small property owners yeah and i remind people like if you cancel rents um pretty good chance you end up in a 2008 financial crisis the reason we had that crisis because everybody stopped paying their mortgage at the same time and uh you're definitely gonna stop paying your mortgage if you're not getting rent and there's this yeah there's this mythology on the left like oh well just landlords can just eat it because they're rich it's like man i know that's just i know a lot of quote unquote landlords you know basically just means you purchased your first home and then you moved but you kept it and you rent it out but if if you go a couple months without rent you're in really really bad shape it's it's it's not it's not affordable right or it'll come out of the hide of the structure see that even with big property owners if they're not getting that revenue stream yeah you know why public housing went downhill originally public housing was supposed to have its maintenance paid for by the rents but then the federal government got in and said no more than 30 percent of of income for rent so they starved the housing authorities and guess what all the projects fell apart yeah how about so we'll do the same thing we're going to do the same thing with even with the big property owners because if they don't get rent income they're not going to fix the leaks well one thing i want to uh hit on too as far as why uh housing prices have gone up um we've been jumping around a little bit but so so look one you know supply is just not meeting demand that's a that's a product of over-regulation um you know the nimby's the not in my backyard uh issues which is to me that's the most understandable thing because i kind of get it right if you want communities to plan their own communities maybe they don't want a big high rise i i get it but that this causes a shortage in housing and san francisco being a huge prime example of that um but also just the the price of lumber uh the price of labor has has gone up dramatically right i've got a stat here lumber has increased 180 percent um added 24 000 to the price of an average new construction so is but is that is that a huge factor i mean these days 24 000 on a house that are hundreds of thousands of dollars doesn't seem like it's a huge deal um but is it you know i don't know well one thing we've had a a lumber trade war with canada which was probably not a good idea because it did increase lumber costs so some of us who are you know pretty much free traders i'm not sure i'd include china but pretty much free traders yeah i thought that was a bad uh confrontation to have because that did drive up uh lumber costs yeah i think we're in agreement on that um china is a different story but yeah yeah but there there are a lot of innovations with uh uh prefabricated non-stick building housing so if if the private sector is given a chance to innovate they will and they'll find ways to bring down housing costs and they're already starting to so kind of shifting to to policy here um especially at the local level what i mean you know i'm gonna read uh i'm gonna read a quote from you and just kind of let let you expand upon that um because we're talking about you know is there evidence really that there's that increasing the supply and pushing more and more families into government-run housing is a path out of poverty so this is just the common refrain from the left and i believe like to me the solutions are always that like first level that first layer of thinking like what's the first emotional reaction you have when you when you are presented with a problem and that's usually their solution um they haven't thought through it much it's like people people need places to live okay uh let's just build places to live and then tell them to live there right well sounds so simple but it's not necessarily so i'm going to quote you here nearly half 47 of all the households in new york city public housing have lived in their apartments for 20 years or more some 18 have lived in the projects for at least 40 years this is not just intergenerational dependency spending a lifetime in public housing also reflects a lifetime of missed opportunity two main features of public housing are artificially low rents and resident income limits low rents encourage long-term tenancy and income limits penalize those who work to increase their earnings both conditions block public housing families disproportionately african americans from building wealth right it disincentivizes the kind of things they would need to get out of poverty and so you know i mean so how should we be thinking about this well i i have another book coming out about housing in the fall it's called the the poor side of town and why we need one and it's basically built around the idea that small houses including small two three family houses that you own yourself has been the historic way that that poor people build wealth in this country and african americans had the great misfortune to arrive in the cities at the same time that we were on this massive public housing kick truman administration 1947 800 000 new units of public housing they're authorized here's what the problem is you can't build wealth in public housing there's a lot of reasons why there's a there's a black white asset wealth gap was there redlining by the federal housing administration yeah there was it was a long time ago but right now to the extent that 47 percent of the families in in public and subsidized housing are african-american 47 that's a lot more than the percentage of in the population you cannot build wealth because you can't own anything the government owns it yeah you cannot own assets i actually think we ought to well they it's a big problem that poor people poor black people have always been disproportionately represented poor black neighborhoods were torn down all across the country neighborhoods where people owned stores they owned houses they operated churches torn down and replaced with public housing this was a bad deal then and it would still be a bad deal if we did more of it today one other thing they argue that one of the reasons there's a supply and demand problem is because developers can usually turn bigger profits by building fancier new units targeted at higher income families rather than units targeted at lower income families and so that's why the government has to force them to build it is is that true is there any truth to that well uh the way you make money in in housing you can build a mcmansion on a two-acre lot and maybe you'll make a profit but if you could build eight smaller houses on that two acre lot because zoning didn't preclude you you'd probably make more money that way yeah right so it's the available space density of housing the more housing you have on a you know on the same land the cheaper that housing becomes now in terms of nimbyism not everybody wants to live in a high-rise you know i i really don't and not everybody should be steered and local communities shouldn't be forced to build high rises what we have to find is some kind of compromise with local planning boards local planning boards all over the country are the ones who are going to call the shots on this it isn't going to be dvd i mean or should we say look we we need some slightly smaller houses yeah because that'll make them cheaper so do you so yeah so i mean what are your thoughts on on zoning in general um like in houston we have no zoning laws um and uh you know creates kind of a funny mix of things like throughout the city but it seems to work okay um not a lot of uh planning involved in it uh what what do you think about that in general well zoning is not going away so i can reel against zoning jack kemp when he was hud secretary had put published a great report about how zoning and other barriers contributed to the high cost of housing that was 1990 yeah we're we're in this in this rinse and repeat loop on this what we have to find is a is a language for talking to local planning boards well there's two ways the buying administration wants to use leverage of federal funding to force suburbs smaller communities counties to build more subsidized housing that's a bad idea because subsidized housing doesn't really allow you to build wealth it's very expensive to build and it's not going to serve very many people the other way is to convince these local planning boards just build small a number of small houses that your teachers can live in that your firefighters can live in yeah that your sons and daughters if they want to stay in the same community they can live in we've got to find a compromised language that allows some kind of zoning relaxation because without zoning relaxation we're always going to be chasing our tails yeah so i mean you're not saying do nothing right that the free market's not going to completely fix this problem and that sort of gets at the last question and that's why and that's why they say it's it's not a crazy point to make that you know when developers are given a choice in manhattan or san francisco they're like i'm going to build the expense i'm going to build the really nice condos as opposed to the you know maybe double the number of not so nice condos because the the market will bear it and i can charge you know more than double the price um and there's just there's just this endless supply of rich people who want to live here so i might as well um i get that i guess i get that argument um you know in places like manhattan um but yeah but the question is what do you really do about it um first of all it looks like there's not going to be an endless supply of rich people in new york and san francisco because this pandemic has been a game changer yeah it's moving people out yeah it's true well there's a really you know hundreds of thousands of people have left manhattan not tens hundreds of thousands and a lot of them are moving out of the metro area because they found out there's no income tax in florida really and so they're checking it out and that's that's a big destination for new yorkers san franciscans are finding out that well coeur d'alene is really pretty i'm moving to idaho yeah and they are so it may be that there'll be a push to lower prices but in terms of the free market can't provide which is the the critique of the left we don't have a free market in housing anymore then we have a free market in health so speaking of non-free market mechanisms you know rent control um rent the left loves rent control again it's always it's always let's land on the that first layer of thinking um we want rent to be make it cheaper right well it's like okay well there's always consequences to this so um does it work i mean what are your what are your thoughts on rent control where does it where is it implemented and what do you see from that yeah there's no economist i don't even think paul krugman of the new york times who won the nobel prize in economy and economics before he became a pundit i don't even think he'd be for rent control the new york times editorial page before it got really woke used to be against rent control yeah and there's a good reason for it maybe there's a hundred good reasons for it but here's the first good reason so let's say i i own a rent controlled building who do i want to rent to do i want to rent to low-income people because the rent is low just the opposite i want to rent to somebody who i know will pay the rent if i'm only going to get a thousand dollars a month in midtown manhattan i want to make sure i get that thousand dollars i don't want to rent to somebody with a 500 credit rating because i'm a do-gooder so you you have a significant number of people in new york city who are relatively affluent living in there was some scandals i think i where like some new york city politicians had like 10 rent control departments a lot of hollywood actors have their rent control department in manhattan that's where they you know it's isn't that nice yeah and it's it's it's it's it's a feature not a bug because it's the logic of it from an owner's point of view second do i want to rent to a single mother with three kids i'm thinking well wait a minute there's gonna be a lot of wear and tear in my apartment i want to rent to dan crenshaw millennial nowhere i'm the best tenant yeah well all those parties man but you you know but seriously i want to write to somebody who is not going to not going to lead to wear and tear on my unit and then third of all it's a missed opportunity this is the same one point i make about public housing it's a missed opportunity because i am lured as the beneficiary that's such a great deal i'm gonna stay here forever i'm gonna stay here a long time meanwhile i could have bought something i could have moved to another city where the pay would have been better i am tempted by this low rent to make bad life choices yeah and what does it do to the market um you know what does it do to the overall market how does it affect it yeah so there are more than there's three million plus housing units in new york city more than a million of them are rents rent stabilized in one way or another that's a really really large number and what it does is it means that the non-rent stabilized units single two family houses uh new buildings that were built unsubsidized that didn't get pulled into this there's a game of musical chairs going on all the time all those other rents what happens they get bit up so because they're like operating in a totally different market so as if it's as if it's a market with less supply even um yeah and but if you if you've controlled everything and i'm buying you know a building from 1970 where those buildings need maintenance yeah if i can only get that thousand dollars a month you're not going to get it not going to maintain it no everybody complains gentrification i talk about what i call shabbification the rent-controlled city gets shabbier and shabbier and shabbier right yeah there's no incentive to invest and certainly if you can't build in a rent-controlled city either i mean there's no this causes a housing shortage generally speaking well if if you know you're not going to get if your return is going to be limited a lot of them they have an exception for new construction or this and that and some of them are complex but if for whatever reason you can't get the return you need for your investors they're not going to invest california's interesting in 2019 gavin newsom led the charge to limit how much landlords can increase their rent each year and voters actually defeated the measure so you know california cities are interesting because you got this what's basically a crisis in san francisco i lived in san diego for 10 years it's it's a much differently run city um and uh you can sort of you can see these these concepts play out in real time and saying and i follow the housing market pretty close in san diego so that when i bought a condo there and like you know i don't know after my first deployment in 2009 and so i've always followed the rent and um the rent has not gone up a whole lot um almost at all which is actually frustrating uh but the reason it doesn't go up very much is is not because of rent controls because they kept building all these buildings around it um in dc it's happening in the navy yard and in houston it's happening inside the loop there's tons and tons of new projects going up and so this is good it keeps it keeps it keeps rent down um and not artificially down but but in it and this is the point right it's down in a sustainable way you know when you artificially via mandate um control prices whether you whether whether it's a floor or a ceiling this is not sustainable it creates other consequences when it happens naturally meaning by market forces it is in fact sustainable and law and you can rely on it and predict predict based on it which is which is a much healthier thing so that's why i'm hoping that this this work from home deal is going to create these new market forces that will in a weird way increase supply because my choices have expanded and again i'm from cleveland ohio originally and so much underutilized real estate there with good infrastructure you know the weather isn't great i'll have to admit that but do a lot of these policies that we have in place i mean you know we have a the history of discrimination in this country in the you know 20th century and i think a lot of this stuff came out of that perhaps um you know how do we convince people that that's like that's you can't have the same policies for a different time and in fact these same policies that are meant to help people are are probably hurting them for for some of the reasons that you stated just trapping them in this and um and then let's move into what what is the right way to help somebody you know because a lot of our policies that you and i are talking about they're structurally intended so a little bit you know the causes better outcomes for the long term but there is a short term as well well well that's true and um it's hard your line about uh the first flush the superficials you know it's like minimum wage or rent control they're they're they're tempting yeah their reactions their reactionary policymaking right but um in terms of the history of discrimination minorities were discriminated positively and negatively and both were bad so the positive discrimination was hey you get to live in public housing well that didn't work out very well yeah you can't own anything the negative discrimination was this the the federal housing administration and again it was the government involvement we shouldn't forget that the government just like with jim crow in the south the government was the source of this infamous redlining here's how it worked so i want to live in detroit i'm a minority uh auto builder auto worker and uh one i'm sorry you can't get a mortgage above six mile road because that's the white area why is it the white area because the fha assumed that if black people moved there white people would move out and property values would fall and so they enshrined that in regulation and drew these red lines that was misbegotten but the to your point the other side of the coin can work out very poorly too so one of my least favorite federal programs is something called the community reinvestment act community reinvestment access to banks you need to invest supposedly the opposite of redlining you need to invest here in poor neighborhood a zip code low income zip code b the problem with that is that it incentivizes banks to push mortgage money out whether people are qualified or not and we saw what happened in the 2008 financial crisis community investment act was not the only reason there were crazy mortgage vehicles but it was part of the reason and if my next door neighbor defaults on his mortgage and that house becomes abandoned wow that is a nightmare for me in my neighbors i wonder what the stats on that are on um on um what's the word when you can't pay your mortgage totally yeah when you default on your loan i wonder what the stats are um i wonder if that yeah foreclosure sorry and and i wonder if um it adversely hurt minorities because these programs are meant to target minorities again in the opposite direction of redlining you know again seems like a good compassionate thing to do you know but it's it's um has consequences so were were they adversely impacted by the 2008 financial crisis i don't know that's a question minority families were in general disproportionately affected by it now to talk about the causes there are a number of causes like there were a number of uh neighborhoods like say bedford stuyvesant in new york in brooklyn sounds like well that's the scariest neighborhood but there were a lot of long-established uh african-american homeowners there who were tempted into borrowing against their appreciation because you had gentrification in that neighborhood and then they couldn't pay the bill right yep get cash out fast yeah and they got i don't know swindle but they got sweet talked yeah and then you lose your home and then you're in a worse off position than you were before you got it you know because you weren't ready for it in the first place it's kind of like affirmative action and there's a lot of studies that show that it puts people in in places that they cannot possibly perform in and you know who benefit did you drop out and then now what now you're even worse off than you were before you got that student loan but um but the the thing i have pushed for years and this would be something that congress could ask for the treasury department can do on its own the office of control occurs it can do on its own let's get the banks all the banks have to do to comply with the community investment act is to say we invested as to the fate of those investments they don't report on them they don't break them out that would be really really interesting to know and uh there's been resistance to that idea the basic idea is they should do it because it's good yeah yeah but it's it's there's there's consequences to everything there are no solutions in policy they're only trade-offs it's a good rule rule to live by um and nobody wants to live by that rule oh we can just get 1.9 trillion dollars it's just free it's like no you're making a trade-off um it's a pretty bad trade because we're going to charge you 5 700 and then give some of you 1400 the math is crazy um anyway sorry we're voting on that today so i'm like you know it's in my well you yeah that that's a that's a tough vote yeah it's it's ridiculous i i don't think there are i served in local government for a while man there's almost no vote that isn't tough yeah yeah that's true it's um gotten used to it gotten used to it i think this one's so over the top um you know just changing subjects for a second i the democrats could make these took these these votes a lot tougher they really could on all subjects um they just don't they they make them very extreme and so it's easy to it's easy to tell explain to people why i'm against it why are you against the equality act i mean it sounds so nice right you want people to discriminate against each other it's like no that's that's actually not at all what's in this thing here's what's in it and people are like wow really um you know yesterday they uh and the house passed the pro act which basically basically eliminates independent contracting so hey all you liberal freelance journalists sorry you're done like this is crazy um this really affects people and uber done lyft done california knows this because they had to have a whole other proposition vote just to fix the problem that they created with their stupid laws so um okay speaking of some stupid laws i mean what uh what could what could we do on housing as far as permitting goes um to just uh make it cheaper okay so like what exactly is california doing so differently than texas that it's like four times as long to just build the same exact apartment complex well environmental they have they have a law called the california environmental quality act which there's a whole class of attorneys that's all they do yeah just sue and settle pursue and settle uh mantra or or advise developers on how to uh sorry that's my phone oh no worries uh or advise developers on how to comply with squa so just think about that just the fact that you have to have this class of lawyers yeah charging got ungodly amounts of money just to comply they're not getting minimum wage yeah no they're not yeah so that that helps uh lif lifts the costs a great deal the time this sounds really basic but the time it takes to get the permit really matters a lot so if you're in in austin and it takes you a month to get a permit i'm just making that up or you're in san francisco and it takes five years right which is not crazy yeah hot there's a time value of money that matters a lot the more rules you have the more complex it is to get the permit right i wish that all municipalities would be pushed by the the bond rating agencies to report how long does it take to get a restaurant permit how long does it take to get a building permit and we'll compare your potential for prosperity and repaying your bonded indebtedness on those kind of bases but that doesn't doesn't happen right now i i have a couple other ideas can i tell them you can can okay let's go while you're here i've been pushing the congress for years i testified i testified before representative waters which was maxine auntie maxine well she's she's very um she's very tough i'm sure she cares a lot about low-income housing i mean um now she doesn't live near any uh she doesn't live in her district where there's probably a lot of low-income housing uh she lives in a mansion outside of her district anyway yeah well i i i won't get personal about that and and i i i don't know if that's right or not sound like you know what you're talking about but but um i'll say this we could manage five we have five million uh 10 million people living in low income housing uh 5 million units we could change the rules in some really basic ways that would make a huge difference to help poor people become openly mobile so for instance can you imagine signing a lease in san diego on that great apartment you used to rent was that when you were in the navy yeah yep yeah san diego is a navy town isn't it yep had uh four roommates it's kind of is a different thing it's like you know i i get the sense that a lot of young people these days don't feel like they should have to roommate with somebody they want to live in the best spots and it's like that's not how any of us grew up i mean just you know you know again there's cultural issues with some of the housing complaints as well but please continue but imagine you were signing that lease and the lease said anytime your income goes up your rent will go up would you sign that lease no but we ask every resident of public and subsidized housing to sign just that kind of lease that's true that's a good point you know so they have a you know a high marginal tax rate right they have no incentive to make more money the same with welfare right it's basically any government program because we want to means test it and so okay because it how do you get out of that how do you get out of that problem so you're aligning your incentives correctly well we've done it there's there's a small number of housing authorities that are called moving to work and they have latitude uh san bernardino california they say okay you can have a fixed percentage lease fixed rate this is your rent every month if you agree that after five years you're gonna move out okay and make way for people on the waiting list we could think imaginatively about how to incentivize people not to stay for 40 years in public housing right but to use it as a way station on their way up which is the whole point of all safety net programs or at least that used to be the point should be you know it doesn't seem like it's the point anymore it's some it's like it's it's passed down generation to generation it's so unhealthy for people and it becomes culturally imbued in us on the right and the left i mean i was terrified to see uh so many conservatives clamoring for their two thousand dollar check back in december when trump was promising it it was deeply wrong um you've never lost your job this pandemic why on earth would we give you money this is insanity over 100 million people getting this check we're really conditioning the american people to believe that there is money that they're entitled to and um and it's it what's terrifies me the most is that conservatives are believing it as well and um you know the fact that if the democrats are right about how popular this 1.9 trillion dollar spending bill is if they're correct about that then our country is in deep deep trouble now i don't think it's as popular as they say it is i think once people realize what's in it and how it's being spent they you know they they change their minds a little bit um but the fact that they're even hearing like oh relief and uh money it's a lot of money yeah i'm in favor of that like guys there are trade-offs there are trade-offs to everything you can't just spend endlessly so yeah well the difficulty of course is the trade-offs appear down the road yeah yeah they're costless right now yeah that's true you know so there are smart people who are saying inflation's going to happen that printing money can't work forever smart people are saying that and if we get back to you know i'm old enough to remember 18 inflation before paul volcker you know and this is not just oh the price of of of chicken has gone up this means that it will erode the value of all the savings of all the middle class that's how germany headed into world war ii because inflation hyperinflation now we're a long way from that you know but if we set the table for that through blowout spending and borrowing inflation is a monster and so we have to be really careful about it talk about housing costs going up you'll be carrying bushels of money and hoping that they're taking the zimbabwe dollar okay so sticking on the track of solutions then um i mean a couple questions you know what's the best way to help again the truly poor um who you know who have either fallen on hard times or just really really poor i mean again single mom two kids maybe she works a minimum wage job and uh like tru truly can't afford housing in any market um you know or somebody who just just lost their job needs some time to to get on their feet um and then another category of again you're kind of normal millennial um whose you know normal job but you know housing ends up taking up like 60 of their of their monthly income um so i guess two-part question i mean solutions to the especially the low-income is it is it vouchers um you know in the sense that you know uh like like like section eight vouchers choice vouchers um with with maybe that program that you just mentioned and then let's figure out on the next question how do how do we just make overall costs go down and i think we've kind of covered that in some ways structurally speaking well you know we tend to take a snapshot of a situation and say well this is really bad how do we fix that right now yeah well let's give that low-income person a cheap house and everything will be fine yeah i think that housing vouchers are no better than public housing they've distorted the market tremendously you've got section 8 concentrations bad maintenance in buildings where housing vouchers are concentrated because there's not enough revenue to keep up the buildings right and so you know what we i would rather go with something like a supplement to income like the earned income tax credit yeah i i don't think and i think that's in this 1.9 trillion dollar bill earned income tax credit even if you're not earning any money that's a really bad idea the child welfare allowance that people are talking about which would go to anybody with the child yeah whether you're working or not topping off people's income and letting them decide how to use that money is is the best idea i think if we're going to have a safety net and safety net is inevitable in an industrialized society we can't say you know sink or swim we're never going back to that so we have to be smart about how we use that money and i think you know i i once walked around a big public assistance office in new york that was at that time run by a gentleman named robert door who is now the head of the american enterprise war institute i'm associated with it but i tell this story anyhow i'm not flattering him he had these thermometers up on the wall there and one is how much you earn if you're on public assistance and the other was how much you earn if you're working and you're getting these death benefits on top of that because you're working and the second thermometer was at a much higher level that's what we have to have in people's heads that you're better off working that the government will supplement your income if you work and we have to continue to structure our programs around that i don't think we should say the only thing you can do with this money is to rent a house maybe people say you know what i'm willing to double up right and save money but if i get an eight voucher the only way i can do it is to live basically by myself yeah and you have to find a specific section eight housing qualified they um they also tell me that look you have to go through a lot more hoops to even build section 8 housing it has a lot of federal requirements on it that that you know don't make sense that a normal safe builder just wouldn't do um because it's silly um you know it's like you know where the sockets have to be i mean it's very very specific and so there's just less incentive to build it plus plus then when you do build it you usually i mean in theory i think you could charge more than what the voucher is worth but they tend not to because they know nobody's going to they're not going to pay it well to build low-income housing tax credit is a huge uh federal tax expenditure as they call it money that the federal treasury is not getting for building subsidized housing costs per unit in california is nearly four hundred thousand dollars build one low income unit why why is it so just because the extra regulations that they require to build it extra regulations and and it's new construction and it's got to be nice you know you're going to have a mixed income unit so they got to have units that appeal to market tenants yeah so because the uh the government accountability office has done a series of reports on uh why low-income housing tax credit programs are so expensive they're for people with low income but they are not low cost to build so are they effective at all are they helping anybody i mean what are we what are we getting out of this well that's interesting you know if you live in a cheap place and it's a nice new place you might be happy you might be pleased you might also feel weird if you're one of 10 low-income families in a building with 90 other higher income families you might feel strange about that yeah you might rather live people tend to be more comfortable with people they have more in common with more in their association and i don't mean racially ethnically i mean socioeconomically yeah you know otherwise you feel like wow is he looking down on me or what it's a strange and like i mentioned before if it's forever and not you know a stepping stone then yeah and it should be a stepping stone i mean you know there is upward mobility in this country but but not if we disincentivize upward mobility and that's exactly what we're doing with our our housing policies we're disincentivizing upward mobility so if i'm hearing you right i mean the best way to just deal with it's not just housing but all safety net programs all welfare whether it's food housing and just basic income i mean i think that's that basically covers the the three categories of some kind of welfare and earn income tax credit that just covers all of them and you can spend the money however you want it would just be a far more efficient i would i would basically cash them out yeah and let and let people decide give them right trust people to make good decisions for themselves yeah don't forget don't forget food stamps right oh it's enormous and there's like 80 programs i mean it's deeply confusing you could probably add health care into this too by the way medicaid you know you could my former colleague orrin kass who now runs an organization called american compass and says why do we pay people's pay people a ton of money and say the only thing you can do with it is buy this expensive medicaid insurance program let's give them money and say you want to buy a bare bones health care plan yep okay that's their choice too yeah and it's just more efficient right you're probably saving we could spend the same amount of money um give it to people uh now in healthcare i would i would argue put it in hsa so that you're only spending it on healthcare but you know you can you can work this stuff out but it's it just seems like a and then then the other thing about like i like about you know because like you said a section 8 voucher still has to be used on section 8 housing so they still know that you're a section 8 person it would be nice if they didn't know that right it would be nice if you could have like some form of anonymity and you know what i'm trying to say yeah an amenity um when you're uh when you just you know you have money that you get from an earned income tax credit and then you give to somebody one question i have i don't know if we have this level of detail but earn income tax credit the entire principle behind it is look for as you earn more money you get a bigger tax credit but obviously that can't be infinite that has to happen you get a lesser tax credit okay sorry that's true so it does work out yeah so at a certain point but you're not okay yeah sorry i totally misspoke so yeah yeah but here's what really worries me and it worries me about any of these housing programs when you pay 30 of your income in rent let's say you get married and your new spouse has a job whoa you get hit with a big penalty don't you yeah the higher your income goes we got a marriage penalty earned income tax credit housing subsidies everything and you know 72 percent of african-american babies are born to single parents now that's tragic and it didn't used to be true before we expanded this welfare say people think well that's always been true of minority families no when daniel moynihan wrote his famous report about worrying about this it was under 30 percent so we have created incentives that that have hurt children born into poverty what do you think you've written a little bit about uh biden's plans um you know he mentioned uh extending housing vouchers to any family paying more than 30 on rent i'm not sure 30 percent um okay of their income on rent that's like that's a lot of people these days i probably pay at least 30 at least 30 percent on rent that would be a massive new entitlement yeah i would rather i would get that atomic yeah because i mean i have to have two rents living in dc and houston um it sucks by the way i wish um so yeah what do you think about that how would that how would that affect the market well it's how would it affect you know the budget i mean we we it would be a massive new entitlement yeah because many many more people are qualified based on that metric than are currently served by low-income housing programs so you would vastly expand this and again if you give people money the only thing you can spend this on you're going to supermarket you can only spend it on hamburger wait a minute i really want tofu well i'm sorry man yeah you know hamburger is good for your housing is good for you why you know and also with my mom and double up for a while and save money and then i'll buy a house that's a better choice and as you mentioned it's it's the incentive structures are still backwards right it still disincentivizes getting that getting that higher paying job um disincentivizes marriage um which would or even moving even moving yeah right so if i have a rent stabilized apartment in new york and again for your listeners in heartland america a million rent stabilized units in new york that's more population than a lot of states right yeah uh and and they're they hear about well there's a great job in houston texas you know well i got such a great apartment deal here i can't move right it's a part of it what uh last question uh president trump made a huge deal about it he was saving the suburbs i think it was the worst possible messaging i've ever heard about a policy but it was um his the the policy was basically what you know federal government was subsidizes low-income housing in rich neighborhoods and makes the argument that i forget what the policy is even called but it makes the argument that um you know that's how people get out of poverty they have to be around other people who are out of poverty and that's somehow and that's better um and trump fought against this and uh i i think again with the probably the weirdest messaging ever um but what's what's the proper way to describe that policy and what are the arguments for and against it well it's called affirmatively furthering fair housing that's right yeah it was uh an obama-era policy and the idea was if you accept community development funds and you've got to accept income housing and we shouldn't have high income exclusively high income zip codes we should have a diverse economic mix and as you say that will provide better services and help upward mobility for the relatively small number of low-income persons who would be in those high-income zip codes again that thinking is the former president unfortunately i would say that was a kind of a race based dog whistle you know it was unfortunate i'm saving your suburbs well what are you really saying you know but here's what i do think um that he had that the policy has it backwards the way you get to a higher income neighborhood is by making a series of good life decisions not suddenly being plumped down there and saying you made it well no you didn't make it you got a gift you didn't make the choices the sacrifices the savings marriage all of those good life decisions that allow you to move from an apartment or public housing to buy a small house in levittown or in what's the equivalent in houston starter homes right so saying that all these good habits will rub off because you're living down the block from people who made good decisions what are you saying you're saying you get the same rewards without having made the same hard choices now does that mean there should be racial discrimination absolutely not anything that anybody can afford to buy or rent they must be must be we've got to enforce that we've got to do whatever it takes to enforce that to make sure people are not turned away but that's different maybe this is the last question that's an argument you hear a lot on the left they're hyper concerned about discrimination that was part of the re part of the reason for equality act they believe lgbt people are discriminated against in housing is there any uh data to back this up what do we see in reality is it still happening if you know a realtor they are so scared to death you know realtors i know are afraid to tell potential buyers about religious institutions in the neighborhood that they might be interested in attending because that might be considered steering realtors are afraid scared to death that they'll be charged with discrimination lose their license lose their livelihood so i think enforcement has been serious now should hud one of the things hud ought to be doing if we have to have hud is to send out inspectors yeah send out minority inspectors if they get turned away send out white inspectors and find out if they can get the apartment prosecute those people yeah i'm for that i'm for rule of law but to assume that it's going to happen when we passed the fair housing act in 1969 we've done something about this so i i to the extent that it's a problem it's a much less problem than lesser problem than it used to be and enforcement should be funded and be real um i think that about wraps it up and i got to go anyway uh howard thank you so much for being on that was uh that was really informative i think uh this is a subject not a lot of people know a lot about and uh thanks for distilling it for us and um giving us some solutions i always like to come away with some simple solutions on what we should be talking about and how we should do this all right we're not we're only supposed to say thanks for your service to military guys but i i thank people for their service in government because that's a hard job man it's uh yeah i miss the old kind of fighting for sure it was uh it was much easier so uh awesome i appreciate it thank you so much for having me on representative and good luck with what you're doing

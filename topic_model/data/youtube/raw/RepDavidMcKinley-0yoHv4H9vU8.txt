president biden and the congressional democrats are pushing climate policies calling as you know calling for climate emission uh carbon emissions from power plants by 2035 and net zero emissions economy wise by 2050. now can this be done well yes but i think we all three you panels forget that they're gonna be consequences and that's what we want the public to understand the consequences of it now we we see it it could be rising energy prices massive job losses dangerously high co2 levels that are going to stay up high and then we're still going to have extreme weather conditions we're still going to have hurricanes on the east coast droughts and flooding in the midwest and we're going to have wildfires on the west so our first is the average price of electricity would almost double by 2035 according to the electric power research institute if we go to 100 percent the institute for energy research and others i think aaf i think got in your group said that it'll go between 2 000 and 4 000 increase if we go to 100 renewables by 2035 and increasing the cost of electricity is going to hurt our basic industries like steel and aluminum making them less competitive and secondly we're going to see massive job losses we understand that already nearly 200 000 coal and coal related jobs were disappeared with the elimination of coal fire generation plants according to the energy futures initiative much needed tax revenue is going to be gone schools hospitals first responders are all going to be hurting we've used mcdowell county west virginia's example mcdowell county used to be the largest coal producer in the in the united states it's now lost 80 percent of its population now that may not mean a lot to you when we talk about a hundred thousand people but in mcgowan county they only started with 120 000 they've lost 100 000 people in that county by virtue of this war on coal so it's serious for them the closure of that they think what's happened to their hospitals and first responders and counties across the country are feeling safe broken promises we had all the presidents have said in the past we're going to step in and take care of you in your fossil fuel communities i heard it in 92 when bill clinton came to just north of us at a steel plant uh in whitten west virginia and he came in and said we're going to say stand up for steel then they didn't and the plant there went from 16 000 people down to 900. so this idea that we're going to step in and and shore up what we've hollowed out these communities there's just not a track record to be able to back that that up on that and and so i want to say just show me do it first before you start shutting out the lights but then thirdly it's more than electric costs people are paying more for everything we've seen the newspapers the wall street journal just came out with the inflation rate as the highest has been in 13 13 years gasoline prices i paid 315 this morning to come in uh i i heard another play just just south of us in west virginia was three dollars and 46 cents uh it increased by 50 some percent just last year we're seeing transportation costs are up 11 foods are rising at a higher rate uh so this is this is a problem we're going to have and fourthly the co2 levels will still be at a dangerous level that john kerry just said last year and excuse me in 19 he said the co2 levels anything above 350 is a dangerous level but yet he's also said whatever we're doing is not going to lower the co2 levels below 350. so i keep scratching my head up here so what are we doing uh if if we're still going to have uh higher utility pay prices we're going to lose our jobs uh we're going to the co2 levels are still going to be dangerous and we're still going to have hurricanes wildfires and droughts then i don't see why we're doing it so i think it's important in this hearing for you all that's why i'm really anxious to hear how what's the alternative because we see their approaches we're just going to do away with fossil fuels i'm thinking that you all i'm hoping are going to come out with some solutions i know we have one we're talking about innovation bill so we continue using fossil fuels but i want to hear from you all about what your approach so again higher utility bills neighbors losing your jobs schools losing their funding co2 in the atmosphere is going to be high but we still have extreme weather condition what are we doing this for so instead of this short-sighted friend let's hear from you all now so i'd like to turn it over uh if we can start tom let's start with you tom if you want to give your testimony please

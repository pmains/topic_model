thank the Chairman and the ranking member for organizing this hearing and I thank our witnesses for their time and their and their tremendous public service I I represent the st. Louis metro area which is home to the largest Bosnian community outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina about 20 years ago our Bosnian neighbors fled to st. Louis after war criminal Rocco Milan which initiated a horrific genocide against majority Muslim Bosniaks the Dayton Agreement ended the Bosnian war in 1995 as we know but today Russia is undermining peace and the peace agreement frankly they're undermining peace and freedom as we've seen in Syria as we've seen in in in in in Georgia the Ukraine our own elections now in Venezuela and across the NGO but they're undermining the peace agreement by encouraging separatists in the Sur majority Republica SERPs Srpska i am deeply concerned that Russia is fueling ethnic divides in the interest of weakening the Bosnian state better freed how can the United States counteract Russian activities in Bosnia the Russians are acting throughout the Balkans to try to prevent those countries from drawing closer to or joining the EU and NATO an attempted coup and not Negra the Russians tried to block the agreement between Greece and North Macedonia which is one of the best pieces of new you have come out of the Balkans in years and I'm sure I am reasonably confident that the Russians would rather instigate conflict rather than let bosnia-herzegovina succeed in reforming itself so I think they are playing the card of potential secession of Republika Srpska to prevent that from happening and also to prevent Serbia which is the big game from turning westward in subway um what we can do is principally show up work with Europe on in support of plans to integrate all of these countries into the West draw have them draw closer to the European Union and get on track for EU accession that's powerful the EU has money Russia doesn't the EU throughout Europe and throughout the Balkans means prosperity well the EU needs to engage because I'm very concerned about this and and and further let me just say because I've got such limited time further in Georgia in Georgia Russia uses a strategy of I'll call it creeping annexation to quietly sees more and more Georgian sovereign territory sometimes its yards at a time today Russia has managed to convert about 20% of Georgia's internationally recognized territory to disputed territory general keen how should the US response to Russian aggression in Georgia differ from its response to the Ukraine conflict where Russia moved moved much more more quickly and decisively I appreciate the question we we have begun to take some steps to assist them certainly last year we provided them in I tank weapons to the Georgian military and we we conducted some critical military exercises with the Georgians right on a tenth anniversary of Russia's invasion so what we're not ignoring them certainly and and I also think what we need to do is encourage our European allies to to be as involved as we have begun to be in Georgia also obviously they already are dealing with Ukraine the I don't believe for a minute that the issues of success that Russia has enjoyed using a hybrid warfare that we have to we have to cede that to that success we have significant geopolitical influence we have economically things that we can do and certainly militarily as well we we all must collectively step up in NATO the EU and and the u.s. Russia's behavior has been increasingly aggressive in the sea of azov and the cash straight after Russia seized the three Ukrainian vessels near the Strait last November the United States conducted a a freedom of navigation operation in Peter the Great Bay the first since the Cold War ambassador Noland noon what other methods can the u.s. use to encourage Russia to comply with international laws that govern the use of maritime Commons well we eventually did exact some sanctions but it took about six months if we had been ready ahead of time and been able to move quickly and move in a way that had hurt the criminal and a little bit more we might have been able to have more immediate impact but what's most important I think is how do you keep Russia from accreting into more Ukrainian territories so when they build this bridge across the Strait and then they land lock essentially with that bridge major grain ports you know of Mariupol and bridge on skin in Ukraine they essentially gain by see what they couldn't gain by land so my favorite idea and I don't know whether the administration considered it was put forward by Carl Bildt former Swedish Prime Minister and foreign minister which would have been to have the OSCE or some coalition of interested neutral naval powers like Finland and Sweden offer patrolling to keep the sea of azov open for both Ukraine and Russia and that's the kind of passive eyes on the street if you will that we might have been able to organize and help pay for very important I'm glad you had the testimony today on for the record just a bit to the administration I I have run out of time I appreciate the chairs indulgence I thank you all for your service and I yield back

Tournament endos of New Jersey is recognized administrator Fernandez welcome you and I have had multiple conversations about the Gateway program in the past broadly Gateway aims to modernize the rail infrastructure along a 10-mile segment of the Northeast Corridor connecting New Jersey to New York Penn Station this is a critical stretch of track that carries over 200 000 daily Amtrak and New Jersey Transit passenger trips on approximately 450 trains and is the linchpin of the entire Northeast Corridor a region that accounts for over 20 percent of GDP of the nation the Federal Transit administration's capital investment programs grants program is the primary Federal lending source for phase one of the Gateway program which includes building a new portal North Bridge which ultimately is critical for going from Boston all the way to Washington and new rail tunnels under the Hudson River the existing Century old tunnels were badly damaged by superstorm Sandy on in dire need of replacer now I appreciate the byte administration's continued support for the portal North Bridge Project which has already signed a full funding agreement with FTA and the work that has been done to move the Hudson River tunnel project towards nffga as well the fta's annual funding recommendations report released with the president's FY 23 budget recommends for the first time at the Hudson River tunnel project we see 100 million in Sig funding in FY 23. so administrator can you speak for a moment about the importance of the Hudson River tunnel projects and what went into the determination that it should receive funding fy23 uh yes Senator Menendez last fall the Hudson tunnel project Partners made some significant improvements uh by finalizing their uh their first step which was the financial plan and by updating that we were able to then rate the project a medium high under the Sig program and this rating is what resulted in the recommendation in the president's budget so for fiscal year 23 for the funds that you you noted this project is a project of regional significance and it is currently in the project development phase they are still several steps that need to be achieved in order for it to be considered for a full funding Grant agreement but nonetheless just last week the partners the project partners of the state of New York New Jersey and the Port Authority signed in memorandum of understanding with the Gateway development Commission which in fact uh is outlines the payments that they're going to be contributing towards the portal North Port of the North Bridge Project in addition to the Hudson tunnel and that uh is a good step in the right direction they've also hired an executive director at the Gateway development commission and that will then set the stage to stand up the entity that will become the designated recipient for federal funds to deliver that project I've made significant progress there's the Hudson River tunnel project remain on track to eventually receive FY 23 funding uh there are several other steps following the project development where there currently are they need to then request enter into engineering and it's at that stage that the federal government will lock in the federal contribution to the project now you you said it was a project of regional South Africans it certainly is I would say it's a project of national significance when you have 20 percent of the entire nation's GDP generated by the region and this is a linchpin to Mobility for businesses to get Workers to work and for people to go to hospitals and a whole host of other things I think it's a it's a project of national significance now I I understand I heard Senator Toomey question the need for strong uh Federal support for Transit due to lower ridership during the pandemic the regional Planning Association recently released a report that confirms the continued need for the Gateway project and found that trans-hudson ridership would return to or exceed pre-pandemic Levels by the time the New Hudson River tunnels are built and would exceed pre-pandemic Levels by 15 to 32 percent by 2050. so yes our Transit agencies like other industries were hard hit by the pandemic but the fact remains that Transit will remain a vital and growing part of our transportation mix and I'm proud of the much needed Investments that the bipartisan infrastructure law makes in modernizing our transit systems let me turn into one other subject I've long been an advocate of Transit oriented development because I've seen the transformative effect that it can have on Communities going back to my time as mayor in Union City when properly planned and executed it can bring significant new investment to communities providing new economic opportunities for families and business owners while ensuring affordable housing for residents the bipartisan infrastructure Bill expanded a Todd pilot program that I helped create several years ago and I appreciate the FTA announced the availability of 13 million for the program for FY 22. do you believe that that further strengthening the linkages between Transit affordable housing and economic development can help to create more livable walkable sustainable communities yes I do uh Senator Menendez as a matter of fact public transportation developed people and the models that are used to develop to determine where public transportation should provide service our models that are driven by original destination uh so housing affordable housing to keep individuals close to high-capacity Transit centers with high quality Transit service is definitely a need and the transiterated development which is uh encourages the public-private uh partnership through joint development as well would see uh Investments along corridors we're current we're Transit it currently exists and also create that density that is necessary that infilling that is necessary to support the continued growth of communities thank you very much

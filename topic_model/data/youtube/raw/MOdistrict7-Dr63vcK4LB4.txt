thank you mr chairman and thank you secretary for being here today and giving your testimony earlier and today you said that i'm responsible for the implementation the affordable care act i've heard you uh referred to and maybe yourself is the point person for the rollout the architect of implementing affordable care act so you are kind of the president's point person are you not for this rollout yes sir i earlier you were asked and there's a lot of things striking about the rollout of this and about uh the affordable care act all together but the thing that's most striking to me is that when we have the point person for the rollout here and you're not going into the exchange now i've heard you say that and you got some advice from the folks behind you but i'm asking you today can you tell the american public if your advisor is behind you that if they happen to give you some wrong information if it is possible for you to go into the exchange like all these millions of americans that are going to the exchanges will you commit to forego your government insurance plan that you're on now and join us in the pool come on in the water's fine all the congressmen all of our staff have to go into the exchanges we have to go into the dc exchanges and i will say that i tried to get on the website i was successful doing the hearing earlier and i got to the dc exchange which is where i have to buy from i got part way through and then when i got to the point to enter my social security number i could not bring myself to do that from what i've heard from people like john mcafee and folks about the security will you tell if your advisors are wrong and it is possible for you i'm not saying it is but if it is if it's possible for you to forego your government program you have now will you tell the american public that yes i will go into the exchanges next year like everyone else sir the way the law is written it's a yes or no let's say that you're wrong on that yes or no if you're wrong i don't know yes or no this information to the american public who may be i don't want to give misinformation i want you to go home and research it if if if you're wrong will you go into the exchanges i if i if you can will you that's a yes or no if you can will you i will take a look at it i don't have any idea that's not an answer that's not a yes or no gentleman's time has expired you're the architect of the whole program and you won't go into with the rest of the american public i'd say that sir i think it's illegal for me if it's not illegal if it's legal will you go in

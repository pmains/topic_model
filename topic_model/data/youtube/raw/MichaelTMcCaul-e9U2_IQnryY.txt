31 passed the arrow the White House says President Obama will veto a sweeping defense spending bill later today because of how the measure was funded the administration is opposed to any increase in military spending if it doesn't also come with an increase in domestic spending the bill circumvent the cap on military spending by adding billions to a separate warfighting account the White House called it a quote funding gimmick while Republicans said a veto would be irresponsible political games all right we'll be following that joining us now chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Republican Congressman Mike McCall of Texas good to have you on board sir let's check off the list here first of all ds support paul ryan for speaker you know i do we're getting ready to meet with him right after this interview i think he has now I think gained the support of the three major factions within our conference without being the moderate the conservative and then you know this freedom caucus as they call themselves I think he got that support last night so I think he's in a strong position to move forward I think he played it right because he didn't want to do this unless he had the full support of all the members of our conference let's uh let me ask you about Hillary Clinton's Benghazi testimony that were looking at today you said if I'm correct in 2013 Benghazi will haunt Clinton if she runs again do you still think that's true well I think I think it is I was one of the last ones that question her on the Foreign Affairs Committee I urge a speaker that point of [ __ ] committee because there are too many different agencies involved in too many different committees and I think that we'll see today what her testimony is I think the bottom line is we just want to know what happened that day what her role was and what we can learn to prevent that from happening in the future you have four Dead Americans including a American ambassador but we don't want that to happen Congress are like this is there a central point that you'd like to see answered at the end of this day having to do with the security are clearly the lack of security at the at the consulate in Benghazi is there a central point that you'd like to see answered the question I'd like to see answered and I asked it when I was on the when I questioned her last time is with so many warning there were so many warnings prior to 911 on the big Ghazi attack and we knew that the terrorists were there we knew the ambassador's going to Benghazi on 911 opposed to consulate outpost if you will and why was it more security provided particularly when it an emergency cable we know was sent by the ambassador to the State Department it was a cry for help and that cry for help went unheeded and unfortunately resulted in this tragedy and so I'd like to know who knew about this emergency cable did she know about it and if she didn't know about it why didn't they provide more security Nicole Wallace conduct would help me because I feel like the Democrats have been effective in painting congressman Gatti's work as politically motivated because of the comments by Kevin McCarthy so help me give me your best comeback or your best squat down of that accusation because I know that congressman Goudie is his histories as a prosecutor and I know that he really has been on the fact seeking mission on a true singing mission but I feel that the Democrats have gained the upper hand in terms of tainting network as politically motivated how do you respond to that well i agree with you i don't think Kevin McCarthy's comments were helpful he apologized for that I think it was this one of these heat of the moment interviews I've talked to trey Gowdy I know well he's a like me a former federal prosecutor you don't play politics with something like this what you want to do is make it a fair in it Marshall hearing and if you don't do that you lose credibility I did the same thing when I conducted the Wrangell trial on the ethics matter i mean the best thing they can do is keep this fair and impartial above the fray not a political exercise because any optics of partisanship I think you instantly start to lose credibility and so I hope you'll see today with the members on the committee a very professional line of questioning all right congressman mike mccall thank you so much we appreciate your being on the show

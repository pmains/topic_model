thank you to the sponsors of this uh bipartisan bill it's important and i and i just want to take the time to highlight why it's so important there's obviously vast agreement in this committee that russia is not our friend and um that that through third third-party actors it's likely that they've been responsible for a variety of attacks on our infrastructure including the colonial pipeline and that concerns us and this bill helps address that issue but it's also worth highlighting the broader geopolitical um challenge that we're facing with respect to russia it's not just in these these cyber attacks that they're that they're trying to hurt us they're also trying to spin false narratives about the oil and gas industry and this of course this i didn't get to speak before on on this my own fault but it is related and it's worth pointing out that pipelines are so important um to our energy infrastructure into our energy independence and important to global emissions too primary way to reduce emissions with respect to methane for instance would be to stop flaring and put that into a pipeline our own national laboratories have done studies on this and shows that russian natural gas has well over 40 percent more emissions than u.s natural gas with just cleaner producers and so it is simply not true that these supposedly high-minded environmentalists in france for instance working for ng declined to do business with texas lng companies because of our emissions and i got them to admit this privately to me by the way that the real reason was geopolitical concerns that's what they said the russians are trying to out compete us both economically in that sense and also and also in a more malicious way through these cyber attacks our committee needs to be fully aware of that so that we can come together as americans and say look we should be the ones providing cleaner energy to the world because there are certain facts we cannot escape such as the fact that global demand will increase energy demand will increase by at least 25 in the next 20 years if we continue to see that energy dominance to places like russia to places like iran which i just got word that we looked at sanctions on their energy production by the way um lifting sanctions on nordstrom too that's also not a good thing we're seeding that energy dominance to them this will increase global emissions that is that is something we cannot ignore on the the subcommittee for the environment as well as the select committee on climate change i do believe these are problems we must address but we have to think about how we're doing it and and maybe the unintended consequences of um some of these policies but thank you thank you all for supporting this bill i think it's a great bill and good show bipartisanship i yield back mr chairman thank you next

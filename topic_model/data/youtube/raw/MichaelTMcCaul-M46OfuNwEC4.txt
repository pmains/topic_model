could mexico be the next benghazi congressman michael mccall is warning us because u.s agents are helping mexican police go after the most violent drug cartels and yet our agents are not allowed to carry weapons in mexico congressman mccall joins us um why not uh well you know officially they can't under a treaty that was signed by the united states of mexico unofficially they do what they have to do to protect themselves but there's no clarity in the policy and i think it needs to be clear so our agents can protect themselves we had three consular officers killed in juarez we had ice agents zapata and avila killed or one killed and one wounded in an ambush by the los zetas in a u.s embassy vehicle and just this year ci agents ambushed by the police by 14 mexican federal police officers 150 rounds fired at them uh and the two agents were wounded in the process now they are indicted and charged with murder and and everything now links to the cartels being behind that telling that they showed up with ak-47s which they use in plain clothes and private cars even though they were on duty that day all right when i was down and uh we took on the record down mexico and we traveled around some atf agents and we were we had to travel in armored cars and supposedly they were not armed but because it's so painfully dangerous um for for our people down there uh the the we were told that the police are so corrupt in mexico that the calderon then president calderon had to bring in the military to get rid of the police to try to try to do something bring some sort of law and order to there but the the country was replete with the most incredible violence and corruption and now our people are helping them but are unarmed yeah and when i was in war the same protections we had in afghanistan to show you how violent it really is and uh you know the host country needs to protect our diplomats and our agents just like in benghazi the failure there and we can't really afford to have a benghazi situation happen right next door just south of us in mexico and i'm very concerned with these these trends with these ambushes on our agents and diplomats that that's the next thing to happen have they have they asked um to carry weapons or have they asked for more security for themselves well if you talk to the agents uh you know without the lines of authority of course and many of them do uh to protect themselves but they're really outgunned by ak-47s every time they get an ambush it's 10 guys 14 guys with ak-47s shooting at the vehicles and it's they're really outgunned and it's very difficult to respond to that so look we got to work with mexico to eradicate these cartels um but they've got to be protected down there are we winning this this war though with this war on the cartels i mean and this is like this is right next door this is not way over in syria or way over in afghanistan this is you know i was just in el paso last weekend and we're going to walk across the border i mean this is right next door to our country um are we winning this war against these cartels it's debatable and i think you know went down the president's inauguration in mexico talked to some of their cabinet officers they want to secure their southern border for the first time they want to go after money laundering cases and against the banks which is very significant but you know the jury's still out on the new administration i think there's a new opportunity for us to work with them as well as the new chairman incoming on homeland security though i can tell you one of my big priorities is going to be to secure that border well all you have to do is google mexico and cartel every night and you read how many people are murdered and it's like innocent people beheaded their hearts take cut out of them they're hanging from bridges i mean just the worst torch you can imagine uh and it's every single day if you just google but i'm gonna take the last word on that congressman thanks sir thanks so much coming up there's also breaking news out of

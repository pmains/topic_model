  OWN CHOICE, IT SHOULD BE SAID. APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US. YOUR COLLEAGUE, CHAIRMAN VINNIE  THOMPSON, HAS NOT RULED OUT A  SUBPOENA FOR FORMER PRESIDENT  TRUMP. I MEAN, IS THAT REALLY  REALISTIC, POTENTIALLY A  SUBPOENA FOR HIM OR EVEN FOR  VICE PRESIDENT PENCE? >> YEAH, I'M SURE, YOU KNOW, IT  IS REALISTIC. I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUMP  TO DOING THAT IMMEDIATELY  BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BIG. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT  KNOW A LOT. BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, I  KNOW THE MEMBERS OF THIS  COMMITTEE. WE'VE BEEN MEETING A LOT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE  ISSUES. WE ARE DETERMINED TO GET TO THE  BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH  THE POTENTIAL CRIMINAL REFERRAL  BY STEVE, OF STEVE BANNON BY THE COMMITTEE, HOPEFULLY IF PEOPLE  MISINTERPRET ANYTHING ELSE,  INTERPRET THIS. WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. AND ANYBODY THAT IS EITHER BEING SUBPOENAED NOW OR WILL BE IN THE FUTURE, THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU  REJECT A LAWFUL ORDER FROM  CONGRESS. >> SO -- BUT IN TERMS OF MOVING  FORWARD TO HOLD BANNON IN  CRIMINAL CONTEMPT, THE COMMITTEE IS GOING TO HOLD A BUSINESS  MEETING TUESDAY. WHAT HAPPENS THERE AND WHAT ARE  THE NEXT STEPS AFTER THAT? BECAUSE COULDN'T THIS JUST GET  TIED UP IN COURTS FOR, YOU KNOW, AND RUN OUT THE CLOCK ON THIS  COMMITTEE? >> YEAH, IT CERTAINLY COULD. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS. SO WE HAVE A BUSINESS MEETING. WE REFER IT OUT OF THE  COMMITTEE. IT GOES TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE. WE EXPECT IT WOULD PASS THE  FLOOR AND THAT THEN IS THE  REFERRAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF  JUSTICE. WE EXPECT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL DO THEIR JOB AND  REFER THIS TO A GRAND JURY. AND WE CERTAINLY HOPE THEY WILL. BUT THAT WILL BE IN THE DOJ'S  HANDS. NOW, KEEP IN MIND, REALLY FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, A  SUBPOENA FROM CONGRESS IS SEEN  IN ESSENCE AS A SUBPOENA FROM A  COURT. AND WE KNOW A LOT OF TIMES THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT IGNORE SUBPOENAS FROM COURT AND THEY ARE HELD IN  CRIMINAL CONTEMPT FOR DOING  THAT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. WHAT WE'RE, YOU KNOW, A CRIMINAL CONTEMPT REFERRAL IS NOTHING  FRANKLY CRAZY. DOESN'T HAPPEN AS MUCH WITH  CONGRESS, BUT IT IS IN ESSENCE  WITHIN OUR POWER AND IT IS THE  RIGHT THING TO DO. AND AGAIN, ANYBODY THAT GETS  SUBPOENA IN THE FUTURE, LOOK,  ALL WE WANT IS THE ANSWER. IF YOU'RE RUNNING FROM  SOMETHING, I MEAN, I THINK THAT  IN AND OF ITSELF SAYS SOMETHING. BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE  TO KNOW THE TRUTH. AND EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT TO  KNOW THE TRUTH TODAY, SOME FOLKS WANT TO PUT THEIR HEAD IN THE  SAND, WHAT MATTERS, I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING, IN TEN YEARS,  WHAT IS THE TRUTH, WHAT IS  UNDERSTOOD? I THINK THAT'S WHY THE WORK  WE'RE DOING IS SO IMPORTANT. >> THE COMMITTEE AGREED TO SHORT POSTPONEMENTS OF CASH PATEL AND  MARK MEADOWS' APPEARANCE, AS  THEY CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. THE COMMITTEE'S POSTPONED DAN  SCAVINO. CAN YOU SAY WHY THEIR  DEPOSITIONS WERE DELAYED AND HOW MUCH MORE TIME THEY'LL BE GIVEN? >> WELL LET ME JUST SAY  GENERALLY WHAT I CAN SAY, WHICH  IS AS IT'S BEEN REPORTED, DAN  SKA VIE KNOW WAS SERVED JUST  FAIRLY RECENTLY, SO YOU HAVE TO  THEN GO INTO A GOOD FAITH EFFORT WITH HIS ATTORNEY. SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT WE'RE  ENGAGING WITH HAVE SEEMED TO TRY TO PUT UP A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. NOW THAT COULD BE A DELAY  TACTIC. IN FACT, IT QUITE VERY WELL MAY  BE A DELAY TACTIC, BUT IT IS  IMPORTANT FOR US, I THINK, TO  ENGAGE IN GOOD WILL. BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, OUR  PATIENCE IS NOT INFINITE AND IN  FACT, IF WE START TO SNIFF THAT  THIS IS IN FACT A DELAY TACTIC,  I THINK YOU CAN EXPECT IN  ESSENCE MORE OF WHAT YOU'RE  GOING TO SEE WITH STEVE BANNON. >> THE COMMITTEE SUBPOENAED  JEFFREY CLARK, THE OFFICIAL WHO  WAS INTEGRAL IN HELPING  PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION, HOW  IMPORTANT IS HE TO YOUR  INVESTIGATION AND DO YOU EXPECT  HIM TO COOPERATE? HE WAS AN OFFICIAL OF THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. YOU WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD. >> YEAH. I CERTAINLY HOPE SO AS WELL. AGAIN, THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS  ONGOING. HE CAN PROVIDE A PIECE TO THE  OVERALL PICTURE WHICH MAY LEAD  TO FURTHER PIECES. BUT I THINK LOOKING AT, YES,  THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE PEOPLE  THAT WILL BE BROUGHT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN AND  SPEAKING TO US VOLUNTARILY AND  SO WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF  INFORMATION AND WE'RE GOING TO  CONTINUE TO TURN OVER EVERY  STONE, GET EVERY ANSWER WE CAN  SO THAT WE CAN PUT BEFORE THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE A TRUE AND  HONEST PICTURE OF JANUARY 6th SO THAT WE CAN, WHETHER SOMEBODY  WANTS TO BELIEVE IT OR NOT,  PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT IT  WAS NOT PEACEFUL AND FRANKLY  THAT THIS WAS NOT ANYBODY BUT  REALLY A TRUMP-INSPIRED  INSURRECTION. >> FROM MAR-A-LAGO, THE FORMER  PRESIDENT PUTS OUT THESE  STATEMENTS EVERY DAY TO HIS  SUPPORTERS, WHICH ARE RIDDLED  WITH LIES. WE NORMALLY ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN  REPORT ON THEM. TODAY, HE SPECIFICALLY  REFERENCED THE -- YOUR COMMITTEE AND KIND OF REFERENCED YOU. I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO  RESPOND, IF YOU WANT. HE SAID -- IT'S SO LUDICROUS -- THE JANUARY 6th UNSELECT  COMMITTEE COMPOSED OF RADICAL  LEFT DEMOCRATS IS LOOKING TO  HOLD PEOPLE IN CRIMINAL CONTEMPT FOR THINGS RELATIVE TO THE  PROTEST WHEN IN FACT THEY SHOULD HOLD THEMSELVES IN CRIMINAL  CONTEMPT FOR CHEATING IN THE  ELECTION. IT'S -- >> SO POWERFUL. >> YEAH. IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT THIS IS THE STATEMENT OF A FORMER PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES. IT'S AMAZING TO ME. >> IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE WHEN HE  STARTED PUTTING THESE THINGS OUT A FEW MONTHS AGO, I LITERALLY  THOUGHT THEY WERE PARODY. IT'S INCREDIBLE. IT SAYS A LOT. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT STATEMENT WAS EVEN OUT UNTIL YOU JUST TOLD ME. THAT'S A FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BASICALLY, WITHOUT NAMING ME, ATTACKING ME AND I  DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT HAPPENED. IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, JUST  RAGING FROM MAR-A-LAGO. LOOK, HERE'S THE REALITY. CONGRESS, YOU KNOW, IS EMPOWERED BY THE PEOPLE. CONGRESS DECIDED TO HAVE A  SELECT COMMITTEE. KEVIN McCARTHY DECIDED HE WANTED TO PULL ALL HIS PEOPLE AND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF REPUBLICANS  THAT SAID THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO  GET TO THE BOTTOM OF. WE HAVE THE POWER BASICALLY  EQUIVALENT TO GET THESE ANSWERS  AND WE ARE DANG DETERMINED TO DO THAT. >> JUST LASTLY, SOMEONE WHO IS  INVESTIGATING WHAT HAPPENED ON  JANUARY 6th, AND I THINK IT'S  REALLY IMPORTANT OF WHAT YOU  SAID ABOUT REGARDLESS OF WHAT  HAPPENS IN THE SHORT-TERM, TEN  YEARS FROM NOW, JUST FOR THE  PUBLIC RECORD AND FOR HISTORY,  THAT DOES MATTER, BECAUSE WHAT  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, SO MANY OF YOUR, YOU KNOW, FELLOW  REPUBLICANS, SADLY, ARE DOING  RIGHT NOW IS -- YOU KNOW, IS A  SHAME AND IT IS A STAIN ON THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY AND IT WILL BE  SEEN THAT TEN YEARS FROM NOW IF  EVEN AMONG THOSE WHO PROBABLY  DON'T SEE IT TODAY. >> YOU ARE 100% RIGHT. WE'RE NOT TALKING IN 100 YEARS  WHEN WE'RE ALL DEAD AND GONE. WE'RE TALKING WHEN WE'RE NOT  THAT MUCH OLDER. AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT'S SO  SAD TO ME IS, THERE ARE SO MANY  PEOPLE THAT THINK, WELL,  SOMEBODY'S GOING TO COME AND  CHANGE IT, SOMEBODY'S COMING. LOOK, HERE'S THE REALITY. NO ONE IS COMING EXCEPT US. AND WHEN YOU HAVE, YOU KNOW, THE TEN OF US, FOR INSTANCE, THAT  VOTED FOR IMPEACHMENT, ONE  DECIDES HE'S NOT GOING TO RUN  AGAIN, ANTHONY GONZALEZ, AND  PEOPLE TRY TO PUT ON HIS  SHOULDERS THAT HE WASN'T  FIGHTING TO DEFEAT DONALD  TRUMP -- NO, HE DID HIS TOUR IN  VIETNAM, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO  BACK FOR A SECOND TOUR. THERE ARE 109 OTHER MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS THAT NEED TO DO A TOUR  IN VIETNAM TO SAVE THIS PARTY  AND IF THEY DON'T, I'LL KE

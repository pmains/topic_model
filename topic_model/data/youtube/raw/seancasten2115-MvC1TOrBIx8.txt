I'm Shaun Caston and I spent my career building businesses that will leave a safer cleaner planet to our children but when Donald Trump was elected president I knew I had to do more after 25 years Peter Roskam can't run on his record he's lost touch with the people who sent him to Washington and Congress I'll make decisions based on facts not partisan politics I'll work with Republicans and Democrats to tackle our problems and I'll be an independent check on Donald Trump I'm Shawn Caston and I approve this message

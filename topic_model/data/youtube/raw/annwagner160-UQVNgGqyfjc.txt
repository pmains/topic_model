thank you madam chairwoman mr. Carter you started your investment firm in 2007 to take a kind of different approach to Section eight and affordable housing how does your firm lift up residents of distressed communities and go beyond just developing a brick and mortar building thank you very much for that question mrs. Wagner you know we view that our investment strategy is holistic we're not investing just in brick and mortar for instance you know about half of our residents are Section eight and our section eight residents about ninety-five percent work and many of those are to income families they just have a little bit of very expensive place like Southern California and the like and so what happens in many of our communities particularly those that have kids when the school bus pulls up you have you know the the property is you know all these kids and what we do in a number of our communities where we have lots of kids we do after-school programs that really provide a place for the kids to go that are safe afterwards and and we can afford to make this investment in things like that if in fact you know and we find that it lowers our operating costs and many other things so we take a holistic approach to it it's a great model the tax cuts and Jobs Act created that we passed in the last Congress in 2017 created the opportunity zone program this tax benefit is designed to drive economic development and create jobs by encouraging long-term investments in economically distressed communities the st. Louis region where I'm from has 40 40 designated opportunity zones including some in Missouri second District I'd like to submit this map and chairwoman for the record without objection such as you order earlier this year you launched a fund to invest in one of the nation's more than 8700 designated opportunity zones how will the tax benefit help your firm continuous mission well that we're very excited about Opportunity Zones because it really made projects that maybe were not financially feasible people before that benefit feasible we believe it adds about 4% of return which allows us I mean we had invested 4% more in return we owned about 15 communities today that are in Opportunity Zones and so one of our strategy is to take a number of those communities and where there are already affordable and add more density add more apartments there you know we have communities in we have a community in Oakland which is real close to downtown Oakland an opportunity zone that it stays at a hundred percent occupancy and we have a waiting list of 200 people so it'd be great to add more units to a property like that that's that's fantastic so you've seen real positive results as a result absolutely standing out these opportunities owns based solely on the fact that we were able to pass and have signed into law the tax cutting Jobs Act is that correct absolutely are there other multifamily firms planning to participate in the new opportunities own many are yes and I do think this will help add more housing and places that we really need it great and we talked I know kind of at length about the local barriers and I just want to clarify with you it sounds to me like the barriers of terms of over-regulation and burdensome barriers for me are not at the federal level they are at the municipal level and the city level is that correct just ma'am most of them are at the local level thank you very much am i limited time I want to thank you miss gentle and the national Low Income Housing Coalition for your support of the disaster relief legislation that representative green and I have joined hands on we want to ensure that people who need money the most can get access to funding while safeguarding against fraud with the proper controls can you talk briefly about how catifying the cdbg-dr program would help grantees gain access to funding more efficiently yes and thank you congresswoman Wagner for your leadership in that area it's very important the CDBG disaster recovery grant program is the largest source of funds that local communities receive for their housing recovery needs after disasters but without codifying CDBG disaster recovery legislation Congress HUD and communities rewrite rules after every disaster which delays the funds from being put to use and the legislation that you have put forward would ensure that those funds are directed towards those with the greatest needs and for the housing needs I thank you miss channel anything else you'd like to submit for the record I appreciate I'm over my time but I'm so grateful for mr. green and for the Sherwin joining us and this is

the threat from terrorism is global and is growing and any serious military person will tell you that the first step in defeating an enemy is identifying an enemy and i have no problems in this regard our enemy is radical islam it's radical islamic terrorist radical islamic jihadists who follow a religious based ideology in which they're taught to kill their enemies we need people in washington d.c that get that so we can defeat this enemy unfortunately there are naive and politically correct liberals liberals like president obama hillary clinton and my opponent tim walls who don't want to identify the enemy they refuse congressman walls may be one of the worst abusers he's been spending his time in washington fighting u.s citizens who have political disagreements with him like the tea party but since the time he started running for office in 2005 and through the paris attacks we can find no record of him ever identifying our enemy as islamic terrorism radical islam or anything of the sort we need a new congressman in order to go out there and fight our enemy defeat our enemy and protect you and our country i'm jim hagedorn thanks for watching

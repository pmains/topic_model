69 million households now canceling their vacations driving less cutting back on their grocery bills thanks to inflation a new Gallup poll finding 56 percent of Americans say rising prices are causing financial hardship up from 49 in January joining me now Nebraska Congressman Adrian Smith he's a member of the Ways and Means Committee congressman if the Republicans retake the house in November really January what are you going to do about it well there's so much we need to do that the inflation crisis right now the supply chain crisis we need to get people back to work we have folks who have like who have left the workforce in huge numbers Workforce participation rates were actually better in the fall of 2008 than they are right now we need to fix that but how do you fix that and how do you alleviate inflation because quite frankly some of your colleagues have voted for or and maybe you did as well infrastructure the semiconductor bill but not voting to send money to the Border you know to close our border to stop fentanyl deaths but the Republicans in the last year and a half have been in some way part of the problem well I voted against those those measures that you mentioned uh and so certainly we need to change the spending spending patterns and that will happen with a new Republican majority but we need to get folks back to work we have we need to re-implement work requirements for federal benefits these are things that I think can ultimately ease prices overall given the fact we have so many job vacancies around the country that's leading to like this like I said the supply chain crisis and higher prices Todd jump in I'll jump on the beat up on Republicans train here for a moment Congressman are Republicans taking the bait laid by the Democrats when it comes to the campaign Trail by focusing on issues like abortion which basically play in the Democrat sandbox when in reality Republicans should be hitting the economy as exhibit a b c and d and Beyond on the Kane campaign Trail solely because at the end of the day we're in big trouble well I'll certainly point to what my colleague Tom emmer said this is an election about gas and groceries the American people are feeling this every every day several times every day and they're focused on that and Republicans are focused on that certainly given the economic concerns that we have and the American people know they they've already said that they trust Republicans to lead us to a better economy a stronger opportunity for the future for for everyone out there the fact of the matter is we need to get folks back to work and let's talk about the student loan bailout analysis has found Congressman that it could cost up to a trillion dollars and you are pushing a bill that would stop the mass cancellation of student loans and one that would prevent extending the moratorium on repaying this loans tell me more about this because I think Senator Joe manchin referred to the bet the student loan ballot as excessive instead he should be saying well illegal and out of the president's power well you know the Nancy Pelosi herself Chuck Schumer already indicated that the president cannot do this without a vote of Congress the president is trying to do it because I don't think that he can get it through the house in the Senate I think this is one of the most irresponsible moves by a president of our country and certainly as it sets the framework moving forward but it puts us deeper in debt it sends the wrong message you know the problem is high tuition rates and this is just going to add to higher tuition even more than what it is now and we do have a student loan problem we ought not just throw money at it we need to make sure that that these folks Across America feel empowered with better jobs and back into the workforce in ways that they can make those payments they're modest but we we should not send the wrong message like the president is doing again Congressman continuing my theme of how do you play this in the midterms Biden has seen a bump at least with the generation Generation Z cohort who could potentially be voting for the very first time in their midterms so how do you combat that on the campaign Trail because Biden's basically given a nice handout to a bunch of people that's going to be tough to combat how do you do it well it often is tough to combat but I really believe that you know folks across the age spectrum they understand the debt that our country faces the spending that has taken place uh recently that is leading us to this point and to just throw money at it just to throw money at it is not the solution in fact it it achieves quite the opposite result and the American people know this and when I engage with folks across Nebraska and even Beyond they do not like the fact that the president did this you know the president's speech the other night it was it was rooted in anger and the president I don't think can get more votes by by expressing this anger uh I think the American people want us to lead with inspiration I think of the American people realize that Republicans can do exactly that but it's up to us to carry this out to get us in a better trajectory economically and get the spending in order and to realize that hey we've got big topics to handle uh come January hopefully with the new majority and and we need to bring folks together unify our country and I think Republicans can do that well the White House is defending that speech that soul of the nation speech a week ago really quick listen to this congressman people have talked about uh if it was divisive it wasn't divisive the way that we saw this speech is that he was talking to majority of the country who uh who agree that we have to protect our democracy who agree that we have to protect our freedom who agree that we have to protect our rights he's vilifying and castigating half the country Congressman I'm going to leave it with that thank you so much for being here Adrian Smith

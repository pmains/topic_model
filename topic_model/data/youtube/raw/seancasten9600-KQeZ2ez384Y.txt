thank you madam chair and uh thank you to our witnesses and for allowing me to wave on here today um i'd like to to focus on numbers if i can we've talked a lot about these numbers on the back wall about the the volume of profits in the oil industry what's not shown there and i wish was is how many of those dollars are direct wealth transfers from u.s taxpayers the u.s tax breaks discounted royalty fees and direct federal funding to the fossil fuel sector add to 20 billion dollars a year now that's just the direct money the international monetary fund has calculated that including the indirect costs which are transferred from taxpayers and americans on to those shareholders works out to 662 billion dollars a year that is more than we spend on medicaid almost as much as we spend on national defense the only country that subsidizes their fossil fuel sector more than the united states is china many of my colleagues believe that we should be number one i do not want to win that race and i hope that my advoc free market advocates would support that dr webber as a reigning economist here um are there any good economic reasons for us to preserve those market distorting subsidies i share not think so especially not in the light of the kind of profit explosions that we have um observed and why we had numbers um just to put things in perspective our research shows that um 93.3 billions have flown from the global fossil fuel industry into u.s financial institutions in persons this is about 50 more than the federal only in the second quarter this is about 50 percent more than the federal government is spending on natural resources and the environment for all of 2022. um i'm glad to hear it i introduced with earl blumenauer and don mckeach and the people over petroleum act that would take just the six billion of the most egregious tax subsidies eliminate them today and give every american a 500 check that's only one percent of the subsidies so my friends in the fossil fuel sector who struggle to compete in the rough-and-tumble world of free market capitalism can rest assured they're still pretty well protected but let's do that in the name of i hope my colleagues across the island will join me in the name of capitalism i want to shift some other numbers with the time i have investors make decisions every day about how to allocate their wealth the price earnings ratio is a measure of how much would you pay for the right to own a share in a company a right to their profits exxon and chevron are both trading at a price earnings ratio about 10 right now shell is at six next era a leading renewable energy developer is trading at 68. first solar 75. tesla is trading at a hundred i would submit to you that a part of the reason why the fossil industry is not investing in wells is because capital markets do not trust them with their money they do not want liquidity they want to strip cash in spite of that many of my colleagues across the aisle are suggesting that when capital markets are saying i want to move my capital to more productive assets that are cleaner that are cheaper where people are investing in the future my colleagues across the aisle are saying you know what we should do we should block those companies from divesting out of fossil fuels dr werber would ask you again are there any principles of efficient market theories that would suggest that the best mode of government in this time is to block capital markets from moving to more productive investments i share not think so um and while we are at economic theory martha's has been invoked um several times during this hearing um obviously martha's had a great debate with david ricardo the liberal economist founder of liberty economics in the 19th century ricardo was worried that landlords would eventually suck out so much resources of the economy that the british economy would grind to a hold i think that the fossil fuel industries today are increasingly taking on a similar kind of economic function as landlords did in the 19th century britain last question for you can you think of any good reason why an industry that is receiving 600 billion dollars a year of subsidies and is struggling to attract capital that the best policy solution would be to throw them more subsidies i shall not think so we also have to keep in mind that in addition to the direct subsidies the exploding fossil fuel prices also hurt the budgets of federal and state governments which are the second most important uses of petroleum and coal products after the petroleum and coal products industry itself this means that taxpayers are picking up again the bill for this well thank you very much i thank you for your thoughtfulness this has been a an excellent panel and i wish it was not so partisan um every time i see mr schellenberger i'm reminded of that quote from billy madison we are all dumber for having listened to you today and may god have mercy on your soul i yield back

senator manchin chairman chester thank you uh for holding this hearing today on quality care and patient safety for all of our veterans across the country i've worked hard as a member of the committee to ensure that horrific murders that occurred in my home state of west virginia and specific problems that led to these murders never happen anywhere else in the country we must make meaningful changes at the va so that veterans in west virginia and across the country can begin to rebuild their trust in the va's care this is the first time since the clarksburg va murders that we are having a comprehensive look at the accountability and culture of the va and i thank you i truly do today we'll get to talk to the veterans health administration and the va office of inspector general we look forward to that i'm also pleased that the joint commission is here today as you all know the joint commission which accredits va facilities across the country gave clarksburg va a consistently passing score before and during the murders of more than seven veterans at the facility before and after in fact the joint commission did an on-site review at the clarksburg vmc uh on may of 2017 and clarksburg passed a review less than eight weeks later the vicious trail of veteran murders at the clarksburg facility began oversight is our duty on this committee we must hold those responsible for instance that have placed our veterans at risk accountable and i look forward to hearing from our panelists on how we can prevent these mistakes from occurring absolutely ever again dr kant clancy uh later in the hearing we're going to hear from the inspector general mike missile which i had great conversations throughout this whole process and i appreciate that but in a recent written testimony inspector mr states that when it comes to incidents like clarksburg the common contributing factors the oig has identified are poor and consistent or ineffective leadership that cultivate a complacent and disengaged medical facility culture in which the va goal of zero patient harm is improbable if not impossible that's clearly the case at clarksburg va and yet individuals in positions of leadership were able to simply resign able to simply resign and keep their valuable va benefits like retirement benefits i'll never forget setting when all this was unveiled and we heard we learned more in the one week that that mr missile was there than we had from the administration who'd been there forever and the head of nursing and i looked at the head of nursing i said sir with all due respect you're either lying to me or you're totally incompetent one of the two but you have no right of setting here that was in that hearing it was that bad so how do we hold the va leaders responsible in incidents like the murders at clarksburg how do their people stay in the system how are they able to retire with the benefit with such disrespect and such neglect and malfeasance of doing their job senator um you have just said very well and i certainly don't need to tell you what a horrific horrific tragedy this was and in my view the only way we can possibly possibly honor the experiences of those veterans and their families i can't even imagine what it felt like to be told your loved one would be exhumed what are we doing to cure that so that people that would make these grave horribly yes great mistakes and intentionally or unintentionally would be able to be benefited by doing such an incompetent job we have we have a whole new leadership team in there as you know and as well as a number of new nursing leaders we have made some very concrete specific changes in how things are done so a nursing assistant wouldn't be able to get in and get insulin or other kinds of drugs to um do the kind of uh horrible things i'm saying legislation i think we're talking and mr miss and i talked about that allows us to subpoena those people and if we find them in error in in responsible they would not get the federal pension they're losing that for giving just such horrible treatment to our veterans is that accurate we passed that so that hopefully that should should help tremendously um also when a quality care incident like what happened uh in either clarksburg or in arkansas occurs how do you all apply the lessons learned after evaluating so they don't continue to repeat themselves is that an alert you have a nationwide alert to all the va hospitals and see boxes and everything else the lessons learned from uh clarksburg and from fayetteville were discussed widely and continue to be and when dr scavela mentioned our daily calls and when we have you know big leadership meetings we start with the patient safety story and we are talking now about tough issues that are not so easy to say in front of colleagues and things we didn't discuss i would say several years ago we had a problem we did this wrong you all have got to pay attention because it shouldn't happen at your place and we screwed up i'm just saying when when it just it's just inconceivable that absolute murders happen in the hospital va intentionally yes not by accident intentional more than seven but we knew seven we confirmed when i had uh when i was governor we had mine disasters it got to the point i had to close every mine down just for safety reasons until let any minor go back in that mine something when that atrocious happened you would think that it would be race to a level where you just had absolutely automatic every va every review process how you your your nursing supervisors the control of your of all of your your substance and all of your medical equipment and all of your uh your drugs if you will that should have been reviewed immediately through every va i mean shut it down and tighten it up until it's right that's the only thing i would say i know my time has run out i'll have another round hopefully but i i thank you all for being here and i'm glad we're finally doing this and the country needs to know that we're not going to allow this to happen to any of our veterans anywhere in this country and senator if i might um i want to thank you and the inspector general because it is these events are thankfully of this magnitude of horror rare um but it is even rarer to hold the right people accountable and i think it's a tribute to the inspector general the attorneys and yourself so thank you for that thank you thank you mr chairman yes senator man senator manchin if you have additional questions for dr clancy i would defer to you thank you mr chairman dr clance in recent years uh our veterans uh uh have experienced massive breaches of trust in all the employees especially in clarksburg uh an employee uh who murdered multiple veterans at clarksburg never went through a proper hiring process what i'm speaking to you about is is the hiring process the need that we have and the shortages that we're having so how's the va updated its hiring process to reflect basically lessons learned vetting they only had to make one phone call they could have caught this woman before she ever got in the door so how are you doing that and how's your retention we have been going through a pretty extensive uh human resources modernization over the past several years and i'm happy to say that we're starting to see progress it was not easy in the beginning to put it mildly because hiring is a problem but a lot of our leaders are both reinforcing the importance of this vetting as you say a phone call almost certainly would have prevented this which is unbearably painful to think about but also um coming up with ways to speed the whole process up the pandemic allowed us to do to postpone uh some aspects of the usual hiring process which can take a number of weeks to bring people on rapidly because we needed that we now have been expressing in a hearing here last week additional flexibilities that might be helpful and look forward to working with that committee on this our retention by and large particularly for nursing is um much better than the private sector but we have seen it start to drop a bit which is why we're very worried about the nursing workforce let me go to to the security of the cameras and holding people accountable and all that we talked about we we have a piece of legislation we've all worked together on uh chairman myself and others senate bill 2041 is the va provider accountability act i think you're aware of that with senate bill 2041 and what it would do it's uh it would in the va healthcare system binds instituting requirements to keep va and healthcare providers accountable it's it's it's monitoring and cameras and instead it will give the office of inspector general the tools they need to make sure when they do their investigation they have all of real-time information uh so [Music] have do you uh first of all i know you all supported this this legislation do you find to be favorable would be helpful um i would have to check on that okay you know okay yeah well we'd like to get your input on that if not we're it's bipartisan i think that we have a a great deal of this committee that's on that piece of legislation and i wish you would look into that to give us a support that we need to make sure you do not believe it interrupts or interferes that's not what our purpose is our purpose is to make sure that we have the proper information at the proper time we will follow up with you we would do that i'd appreciate it those are the questions i have mr chairman i appreciate it well thank you we'll get to our senator from west virginia center mansion thank you chairman moran uh first of all i want to thank second panel for being here and mr missile is the va inspector general you and i've had a lot of conversations and uh they've been vital to us patient safety and quality care va and i appreciate it very much all your work to keep me updated specific issues that we're facing in west virginia mr perlin i really appreciate you being here and i will say this you are the new you're not you are not there when all this happened so i want to make sure we clarify that because my remarks are not that kind of the joint to the joint commission after this but you are new and i hope that these changes will come as you know i'm extremely concerned about the current state of the relationship between the joint commission and the va like i said at the beginning of this hearing the joint commission consistently gave the clarksburg va a passing score for accreditation uh before and after the horrific murders occurred at the facility the joint commission was even on site at the clarksburg va for a review which clarksburg passed they passed it that was less than eight weeks before the murders uh began that year the va paid the joint commission almost six million dollars for their services it really doesn't set right with me knowing the amount of money that we've invested there and the return we got as a senator or as a west virginian it all comes back to accountability it really does and i look forward to hearing your answers to my questions and i'll start mr perlin with you on this question here how did your joint commission miss this blatant oversight during their may 2017 on-site survey and so you were not in charge at that time and i want to clarify that again no thank you senator first um let me thank you for your passion around this topic um my career has largely been devoted to va as under secretary for health and otherwise i join you with outrage and also join you in sympathy to the families of those veterans so tragically affected i have had a reason obviously to review the history of the joint commission's presence there as i mentioned broad survey is sort of skims the surface it is a vehicle for accountability i didn't appreciate exactly how strong a vehicle for accountability it was until i personally went on a survey on the survey side this past week and i saw that you see things that you don't see in the place you'll ever work it's like your home where you may know that i don't plug in the toaster with the with the coffee pie because it blows the fuse only this is health care this is people's lives and the joint commission when we're on site can see those sorts of things it surveyed the broad exam of the facility in 2017 and as i understand that that particular nurse tech was hired in 2015. it's likely that that particular chart wouldn't have come up for review in retrospect clearly there were hr issues clearly there were medication management issues when va came back not at the time that the inspector general was available to evaluate in 2018 but when it found out with the rest of the public late in 2019 as i understand it based on your passion the passion of va leadership a lot of things were in place so there's an artifact of timing that said i am not comfortable with the organization that can't go deeper on these sorts of hope you make these changes uh here's here's a problem if if these changes don't the joint commission standards and ability for surveyors to identify violations don't align did not align with protecting patient safety that makes me wonder why we continue to use the joint commission while there are several other accreditation bodies including state surveyors to the centers for medicare and medicaid services that seem to have done and been able to do a better judgment for our veterans and our families uh that's why i'm finished with this one has the joint commission ever revoked accreditation status did you as you look back in the history has that ever happened has i am unaware of that va has revoked accreditation stat the joint commission has revoked v8 did the joint commission issue any corrective action for clarksburg va following these murders i i believe that there were issues that um uh were identified that would relate to that against being new and i and i again i say this i appreciate you being here if i could get more direct answers if you could look back into that and give me more direct answers how the joint commission when mr missile went through i found out more than seven days they were there that i found out through the whole time the investigations right well the drink the inspector general of course did a a very focused forecast review um and i will find out what we had um that said let me just make two points first you know we get our driver's license uh and that is a demonstration of basic competencies and safety if you abide by the rules of the road this was a malevolent individual with intent to harm i wish i could sit here and tell you that would never happen again um it's not possible yeah what i can tell you is that in contrast to the other accrediting bodies the joint commission has a broad range of standards that go far deeper uh into the both the culture of safety into mechanisms of safety and to accountability than others i'm sorry to cut you off i'm just i just want to ask mr mitchell one question because i gotta i have to go to this vote uh mr missile understanding that every incident is different what are the standards the oig uses when assessing and investigating va facilities both before and after the oig has made findings and issue recommendations how what's your follow-up procedures before and after well the standards are we follow vha policies and procedures and determine whether or not the facility is complying with those policies and procedures we will on occasion make comments if we don't believe the policy or procedure is adequate we do follow-up we on at least a quarterly basis we will look at any open recommendations and uh work with the facility to try to close those but again they have to be to our satisfaction that we believe that they've met the objective and it's sustainable let me just say this every member we have that serves on this committee is here for we've chosen to be on this committee because of the veterans because of people in our family our communities and what they've served and sacrificed for all of us so we care deeply when something happens it's tragic in mind and there's more than seven that we know and that's all she that's all she admitted to we know there's more you can only imagine looking at these families and saying my dad was okay he was okay two daisy what happened and there's no answers given that's that's the reason that we're in this the way we are i appreciate all of y'all we i don't want this to happen in new hampshire or in alabama and it shouldn't happen anywhere and then to go through this so how do we prevent it how do you hire what's the vetting process locking things down making sure that should be recognized beforehand i'm so sorry they're going to cut me off here anyway but if you want to answer very quickly please on the hiring i think that's so critically important there are things i learned in private sector that i wish i had known when i had the privilege of leading va um you indicated a tension right now between the shortages and workforce and the full vetting of an individual here's an approach which is a stoplight report green good credentials clean background yellow maybe some problems and competencies maybe some problems in the background needs vision approval red absolute dead stop and that can only be approved in the under secretary's office the office of the secretary thank you thank you mr chairman i'm sorry for taking a little bit of privilege there

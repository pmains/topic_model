mchenry vice chair of the committee mr secretary um we had the fed chairwoman yelling in a few weeks ago and i asked her about the cumulative cost of regulations that the fed and fsoc are proposing she continually referred to a 2010 study by the basel committee as a reference point i pointed out that's five years old i would remind you know obviously and long before we you know fully implemented or it got this far in the process of of new regulations um as as chair of the fsoc has there been a study done on the cumulative cost uh under congressman i'm not sure what constitutes a study but i think that the regulators uh are attentive to the cumulative impact show of the steps to their attentive but is there a some point of reference for the cumulative cost of these new regulations i mean each one uh for example that requires i can say no it's okay i mean i i'm just trying to get a straightforward answer i'm happy to answer the question i'm trying to if if you look at each of the steps taken you can look and see what the capital requirements are and you can add up the burden as it were and i think that it has been very clear that there was a a goal of internalizing risk in firms which does increase some somewhat the cost to firms of their activities we think that's appropriate it's appropriate because it should be the burden of a firm not the burden of the public if anything goes wrong and having things like more capital is part of addressing the risk that caused the financial crisis in the first place but more broadly regulation not simply the requirement for additional capital which is part of your answer but is there a broader review that you could point to so i'd have to go back and check if there's any kind of a comprehensive review but the costs that are i think most uh significant for firms are the ones i'm describing yeah would you commit to providing this uh information to the committee i'm i'm happy to go back and and and look at what we have sure thank you so uh back in june you testified before this committee that you're it was premature in your words to evaluate the effects of government uh regulation on market-making activities volcker basically um which i you know is uh in some regards uh caused um liquidity to vanish in certain marketplaces so is is that still your view that it's still too premature well i think as a practical matter volcker is not in effect so one is asking what a firm's done in anticipation not in in in compliance or because of requirement um i do think that there has been some movement by firms to get ready for the volcker rule i think that that's a good thing because they've had fair notice and there was some extension of the deadline to make sure they could prepare in an orderly way and if we're saying to financial institutions that they should exit the proprietary trading business to do it in in an instant is not the right way to do it so i i i i think it's premature to uh to to evaluate what its full impact is but i think it's a good thing that the industry is preparing for it so we had pretty significant volatility on october 15th of last last year and in some government bonds did you follow that i followed it yes yes um do you think that is it all connected to diminished diminished liquidity provided by uh institutions that have gotten out of of prop trading and anticipation volcker you know congressman what was going on on october 15th it was a complicated set of things there was a lot of news going on so that there was generally an off-risk kind of of a mood in the market that day um i think that there are many who jump to a conclusion prematurely uh that it could all be set at uh at uh the at regulatory uh practices i don't think that um that there's no evidence that i've seen that suggests that that was the predominant factor we're looking at was it a factor though well look there were there were many things going on um and uh you said there are many things going on but do you think the volcker requirements that firms in anticipation of volcker have gotten out of this place that some of the shock absorbers aren't there in the system that's a very reasonable question the evolution of the markets is being driven by a lot of factors at the same time so i'm reluctant to attribute causality to any one thing you have different players in the market a different mix of where the velocity is coming from many of whom are not covered by volcker so i think that this is something that requires a lot of analysis we're doing it i'd be happy to share with you a more complete analysis when we complete it so in many regards i think fsoc is is creating more problems by diminishing liquidity in the marketplace which will create future problems potentially in the marketplace is that a concern to you as chairman of the fsi well we are concerned about making sure that we maintain the most liquid markets in the world um i do think that it's a mistake to attribute to regulatory policy uh what happened on october 15th and i'd be happy to follow up with you the time of the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizing

support for the goals of the bill that we co-sponsored with don young uh to ban imports of of russian secretary but i also want to be clear that this iu bill is separate from from the don young russian seafood band bill and and this iuu bill was introduced before all of the ukraine mess and before don young had introduced his bill so there's the don young bill that we're a co-sponsor of on russian seafood being banned and then there's the iuu bill that we've co-sponsored with uh with the chair um so i just wanted to distinguish the two our iu bill was introduced and and i don't claim as you stated in your testimony that the the russian ban is meaningless unless the senp program is immediately expanded i think they're they're separate but they're important pieces of legislation the the goal is to to combat slave labor prevent human rights abuses protect our resources and and i think provide consumers with a choice like that's really what the what the objective is there um but in order for them to have a choice you've got to be able to distinguish and and so the simp helps to distinguish what their choices are and you've got to provide that information to consumers so so miss lahard similar what's required of our domestic seafood producers your testimony points out that additional overhead would be incurred as as a result of of compliance with with traceability and with transparency we did with mr huffman try to make a concerted effort to improve and automate the process but i'll tell you i'm all ears in regard to other ideas or feedback on how we can maintain traceability and transparency and accountability while while streamlining it so i'd love to hear if you have any thoughts or reaction on on that i i thank you very much uh representative um i think that's the point um we're rushing forward with this legislation to address the conflict in ukraine but this this concept is something that has been chugging along and the ncbfaa has been working with noaa and suggesting that they talk to the food and drug administration and giving them examples of ways that this could be addressed blockchain artificial intelligence the food and drug administration is doing some wonderful things with artificial intelligence we have ace 2.0 that's coming up from customs that is going to revolutionize the way that we file entries so i think the key is to look at all of these different things that could be leveraged to do this but if we rush this legislation through it may be too late to take some of those actions so my chief concern is that we pass a bill that um would be imperfect uh on a program that's already been um admittedly uh described as imperfect when we could make this a much much better program much more robust and uh stop goods from coming into this country illegally thank you okay so so just a couple things number one let's keep in mind i mean you talk about rushing through um the bill is largely already past the house um through competes in coast guard but but also this bill was introduced uh mr huffman i i want to say spring of last year right didn't we yeah so spring i'm sorry you are correct okay um so you know nobody nobody looks at congress as the model of efficiency but but um you know it's certainly been around for a while and i don't know that there's there's any rushing going on i'll tell you again i'm i am all ears in regard to ideas that you may have to help to streamline or prevent you know additional cost but still achieving the objective of the traceability the accountability the transparency that's there because i don't speak for mr huffman but but i think those are our real objectives here and and it also helps to provide the consumers choice and the only way they have the choice is if we know some of those uh some know some of those facts that are able to communicate to to consumers look last i just want to say that um oh i'm wrapping up i i just want to say that uh the objective of this bill we're one of the largest seafood producers in the united states the objective of this bill of holding countries like china and russia accountable that have some of the worst illegal fishing fleets in the world that is unfair competition it is it is overfishing it's its lack of sustainable practices and these are objectives that we should all be sharing so i want to thank mr huffman again

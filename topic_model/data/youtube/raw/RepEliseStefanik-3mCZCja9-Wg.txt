I want to thank chairwoman Fox chairman Guthrie and my colleagues on this committee today for working together to get to this point higher education in America has changed rapidly over the last decade and while the profile of the average student may be very different the federal government and institutions of higher education are still stuck in the 20th century today's students are coming of age during a turbulent time in our history within an economy that offers the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years and a booming economy there remains a climate of rapidly rising tuition a narrative that dissuades the pursuit of trade and technical education elevated levels of student debt and a widening skills gap with the wall street journal reporting that 43% of Americans with federal loans are not making payments CNN reporting that there are six million jobs available throughout the country and Bloomberg News reporting on a study finding 59% of students have no idea when they will be able to repay their student debt our national situation looks grim fortunately we know that students who complete their education are far less likely to find themselves held back by debt and those that per year pursue Career and Technical Education are graduating into a workforce that is desperately searching for skilled workers in this time of change the federal government must reassess its role and how actions taken in Washington impact the career readiness of our students the prosper Act takes an important step in refocus focusing the nation's higher education system on outcomes while continuing to provide access to the most disadvantaged students additionally this bill works to protect students constitutional rights on campus which is something we should all be able to agree on I am very proud of the Pell Grant provisions in the underlying bill the Pell Grant is the cornerstone of federal student aid these grants provide access and opportunity to millions of students across the nation and in this bill Pell students win in my district 52 percent of students attending public institutions are offered Pell grants today's learners are different than previous generations and their advancement toward completion has been stifled by a federal aid system built upon traditional spring and fall semesters earlier this year language from my flexible Pell grants for the 21st century students Act was signed into law expanding access to Pell grants year round I am proud to have worked on language ensuring students will receive will continue to receive a full Pell Grants for taking 24 credits in an academic year students who then take advantage of flexible Pell to enroll in 30 credits per academic year which greatly increases their odds of an on-time graduation will receive an additional $300 Pell bonus because of the true prosper Act this change will allow students to accelerate toward completion and achieve their goals with less student debt this legislation also does away with origination fees on federal student loans this consumer-friendly provision helps ensure that students are receiving more of the money they are borrowing to cover the cost of their education I'm also pleased with the investment in federal work-study this bill nearly doubles the authorization for work-study while shifting the program focus to better serve Pell populations and removing arbitrary caps that prevented students from working at for-profit businesses this common-sense change will give more students relevant work experience and accelerate their entrance into the workforce the time has come for the federal government to adapt and we must empower our students with the access flexibility technology and information needed to make sound decisions for their future regardless of if that decision is to attend technical school community college a four-year institution or pursue an advanced degree I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle today to advance the cause of American students I yield back

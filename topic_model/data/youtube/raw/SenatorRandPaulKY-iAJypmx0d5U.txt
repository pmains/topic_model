Senator Rand Paul Republican from Kentucky serves on the Foreign Relations Committee joins a snag of warning why do you say it was a big mistake well I think what you found in New York is that we ended up having a horrendous death we had 30 some odd thousand people die their death rate is about 1,600 per million the highest in the country eight times worse than Florida ten times worse than Texas even now with the surge in Texas in Florida so I don't think there's a lot in New York that we can look to and say oh that's what we should model after in fact I really think Governor Cuomo oughta be impeached for the worst public policy public health decision maybe in a century sending patients with Crohn's virus back to nursing homes so I don't think there's anything to be lauded up there but I think the one story people are missing is amidst this resurgence or surge in the disease New York has very few deaths and very few new cases has nothing to do with the lockdown I believe that it has a great deal to do with the level of immunity they've achieved I think about 25 percent or so of New York City is now immune and I think that is slowing down the progress of the disease I think that's little to do with human or government behavior but it has a lot to do with immunity Stockholm is about the same in Sweden and so you have northern Italy's about the same areas where you've had a you know there's great rise in cases a lot of deaths actually achieved a certain amount of immunity and I think are gonna be suffering a lot less unfortunately until we have a vaccine Florida and Texas death rates will continue but it's important to keep it in perspective that they're about 10 times better than New York New York State the senator you're not arguing for herd immunity in these places where it's out of control are you I'm not I'm not saying we have a choice all the things we do aren't stopping the virus and it's impossible really to stop the virus and put it dead in its tracks the virus has a mind of its own it's a scourge of mother nature and we do our best with it but even when we try to do our best even when we've locked everything down it still leads to a mountain of dead people that's what happened to New York and what I'm saying is that well we're not sort of advocating hey let's do nothing and get hurt immunity herd immunity is happy it happened in New York and I think we've actually achieved it but we've achieved it at a much smaller number than the theoretical predictions the theoretical predictions based on random behavior of a random mathematical model say you need 60 to 70% there are people now looking at that and putting in the factor of human behavior and that people don't all react and behave the same in public as far as their contacts and showing that a lot of viruses in the past we've achieved a form of immunity where the virus slows down and goes away at a much lower percentage maybe twenty to twenty-five percent we've had other attacks we've had pandemics in the 60s and the 50s and even going back to the Spanish flu where the virus doesn't get 60 to 70 percent of the world infected it gets closer to 20 to 25 percent and then there's enough immunity that the spread of the virus slows down and that's what my hope is I don't have a crystal ball I can't tell you that's for sure but I can tell you that we ought to at least offer that that that is an opinion out there and there's at least evidence from New York that looks like they're not being affected and one of the most logical things is that they have some immunity build-up that's slowing down the spread of the disease all right here's dr. deborah birx add our own special report last night take a listen this time we saw wide virus spread across counties across world areas across small metros and big metros all the way across the south south west and west almost simultaneously so this was an event that we think can be traced to Memorial Day and opening up and people traveling again and being on vacations so are you saying that we we really can't get a hold of this and that you know all of the talk about increased testing and contact tracing you're saying we're past that I think we have so many people getting infected and spread so far that we should try to do contact tracing we should try to do quarantine all those are good things it's probably beyond that where you're actually able to do contact tracing and others are admitting to that that we have such a large number but I will say that there's contrary evidence that the reopening has caused this the governor of Oklahoma was interviewed the other day and said he'd been open 86 days they do have more cases now but open for 86 days so I think there are arguments against opening being the the real scourge of this but that maybe travel has something to do with this I think New York was inundated with international travels and probably were seeded with hundreds of positive people all in February I think they said over 2 million people came internationally back to New York or to New York in February including like 139,000 from Italy so New York really got hit with a lot of didn't have patient zero they had hundreds if not thousands of patients heroes but those people now there's been travel throughout the United States and probably New York has seeded the rest of the United States and for a while the rural states did very well just because we're already socially distant and I still think the rural states will do pretty well throughout all of this but the bigger cities in the south now are suffering the way New York City did but the good thing is is that I think the governor's in Texas and Florida and the doctors are much wiser than they were and hopefully won't do as terrible a job as governor cuomo did with his and with this last thing on that it's fairly rare for a senator from Kentucky to call for the impeachment of a governor in New York yep it is rare only when they deserve it and actually Cuomo does deserve it I think his sanctimonious presentations of all the things he's going to do through Big Brother to make us safe again when what he did was the one public policy decision he had the ability to try to make it better he made it hugely worse by sending people with coronavirus back to nursing homes almost half the people died in New Jersey and New York died because of that public policy decision and died in nursing homes so we have learned it not and they're not doing that in Florida I think from the beginning the governor of Florida did not do that he was wise enough to see that coming and so we just shouldn't laud bad behavior and that's that's my point people can make mistakes and Cuomo's human but we shouldn't be out there lauding New York and that's where dr. Fauci makes a big mistake saying Oh New York is what we're after well only if you want 1,600 dead people per million the highest in the world not just the highest in the US New York has a higher death rate than any place in the world that is not to be admired and not to be emulated Senator Rand Paul up on Capitol Hill senator thanks for talking cube

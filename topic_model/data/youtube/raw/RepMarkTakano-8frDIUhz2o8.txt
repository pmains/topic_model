state of California this is one of my fellow freshman colleagues represented mark Takano I I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding time earlier today your colleague from Wisconsin mr. Ryan released his long-awaited anti-poverty plan this is a bold step for mr. Ryan because if you look at the history of the Republican Party there is a clear and undeniable pattern of implementing policies that help keep the top that help the top 2% but do nothing for those struggling to make ends meet of course they have proposed various quote-unquote reforms over the years but those initiatives were never anything other than safety net cuts or ineffective recycled ideas disguised as reform I thinking of a childhood jingle of you know the jack and the beanstalk fee fie fo fum I smell the budget of full reform and that appears to be the case here mr. Ryan calls his new plan an opportunity grant as it would consolidate safety net programs such as food stamps and housing vouchers into single a single grant to States if that sounds familiar that's because an opportunity grant is nothing more than block grants under a new name and block grants have shown have been shown to have limited impact in helping to lift people out of poverty now if mr. Ryan really wants to lift people out of poverty he would support a raise in the minimum wage raising the minimum wage will increase the take-home pay for more than 28 million workers at 35 billion dollars to the economy and higher wages through 2016 and create 85 thousand new jobs as a result of increased economic opportunity and at the very least I know that my colleague of bar belief from California is as I am undertaking the challenge to live on a minimum wage by living in office $77 the average amount of money left over for full-time minimum-wage workers after taxes and housing expenses I would challenge mr. Ryan to step inside the shoes as someone who is living on that minimum wage although I know I could never fully understand what it is like this challenge will give me a small glimpse into the lives of many people in my district so I'd like to invite mr. Ryan to participate in the challenge so he can for a brief moment understand what it is like for people in poverty to live on such a wage perhaps then mr. Ryan will understand that the same old recycled ideas will not help those who really are in need I thank you and I yield back well and thank you representative Kahn oh thank you work you're doing neck

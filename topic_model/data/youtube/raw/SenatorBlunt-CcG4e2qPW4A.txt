well the the speaker knows how to get things done if she wants to get things done and she also knows the way to get things done is not to say give me everything i want or i don't want anything and not just the money but the policy this has not just been a debate about the money which is well beyond the money we need to do the job that needs to be done but it's also not just about spending the amount of money they want to spend but more and more it's about spending it exactly the way they want to spend it uh that will not produce a result uh i think it's incredibly unfortunate as senator barrasso just said there's money in our package for for to complete the incredible effort we're making on vaccines uh the incredible effort we're making on testing to be sure that both vaccines and tests have the money necessary to get distributed and widely used and that shouldn't wait till the middle of december or the middle of january or the middle of february that needs to happen right now but it's not the way to legislate nobody knows that better than the speaker it is not the way to reach a conclusion it's the best way you can almost assure you're not going to reach conclusion which is to say give me everything i want or i don't want anything

four minutes to the chief deputy width and our colleague from North Carolina Patrick McHenry well I thank the secretary of the Republican Conference my colleague in classmate from North Carolina and Virginia Foxx but today I stand in tribute with the fine threads of a man named Howard Coble congressman state representative secretary of the North Carolina Department of Revenue captain of the United States Coast Guard school bus driver that's where it all began in high school that was his first public service John Howard Coble has held a variety of titles during his time and during his years but to me he's always been known as the Dean Dean of the North Carolina delegation which he has been for the last 15 years the longest serving republican member of this body in the history of the state of North Carolina and my friend and I'm here to pay tribute and to thank him for his time in public service he is what a member of Congress should be and that is concerned for his constituents and being their voice here in Washington and having an impact and you certainly my Dean have had a huge impact on my life the vote those that are paying tribute to say thank you tonight but also your constituents and American people and we thank you now there are a number of stories about the Dean number of them I like to tell over the over the years and most of them are in fact true by this one story I want to tell tonight actually to if I may it goes back to the first time Howard ran for Congress in 1984 the the the campaign committee for the Republicans brought up folks in tough challenging races to have some video and film shot with President Ronald Reagan help with his popularity to help get some folks across the finish line in 1984 Howard was so nervous that he forgot to shake the Gipper's hand and so one of the campaign committee staff were they were coming to Coble's district and howard said where were you and said well I was just an Alabama with President Reagan oh really yes yeah I told him I was going to Greensboro and President Reagan looked at me and said well tell that son of a gun that didn't shake my hand I said hello and so Howard got a little flustered and it was a little embarrassed and everything else until everybody started laughing but Howard's had a great sense of humor and that shows a real testament to how is integrity but the other other thing about Howard is a fiscal conservatism and it goes back to what he said is pain is going to bring a sharp pencil to the Washington budget and he in fact has in fact it wasn't very well appreciated during his early service in Congress there's a member of Congress who was furious who said that sharp pencil might actually get your ticket written out of Congress and Howard's told him that he thought well I believe there's life after Congress and let the guy go on is on his way well that guy was not re-elected and Howard's been reelected 14 times during his time here so true true proof that fiscal conservatism can still win there are a number of other stories that will talk about over over over perhaps a drink afterwards but the one thing is everybody from his district knows and those of us from North Carolina know that he knows every high school mascot in the state of North Carolina and every child that I see that comes through Congress is simply amazed that there Dean knows where they're from and knows their high school in their high school mascot that's because he cares and so we're grateful tonight and we want to say thank you to our friend our Dean arleta Howard John Howard Coble and with that I yield back gentleman yields back gentlelady from North Carolina

Sam bankman freed is facing a multitude of charges today at the 30-year-old former head of crypto exchange FTX was supposed to testify in front of the house Financial Services committee earlier today instead he was arrested last night and indicted today on eight criminal charges the hearing went on without SBF and California Congressman Brad Sherman had a big statement not only on FTX but all of crypto for five years I've been trying to ban American investments in crypto I'm the only member of the house to get an F from the only crypto promoting organization that rates members of Congress my fear is that we'll view Sam bankman freed as just one big snake in a crypto Garden of Eden the fact is crypto is a garden of snakes a garden of snakes Congressman Sherman joins us now he serves as the chairman of the house Financial Services subcommittee on investor protection and capital markets good to see you sir you wear that f as a badge of honor but why do you believe this collapse of FDX is also an indictment on cryptocurrency as a whole well the whole purpose of cryptocurrency is to become a currency and it hasn't it isn't a currency yet but it would like to be the only reason it might have value is that it might become a currency otherwise it's just the pet rock of the 21st century um and nft without any artistic value um and the you got to ask well why do they want a different currency Dollar's pretty good and the answer is the dollar is really bad if you want to engage in tax evasion sanctions evasion evade Bankruptcy Court which I don't send back when Fred is focused on now uh drug dealing Etc so the advantage of cryptocurrency over the US dollar uh if it ever became a currency is right there in its name it intends to be a hidden currency secret money and so when you invest in something the whole purpose of which is to evade the laws of the United States so to create a tool that will help others evade the law of the United States you shouldn't be surprised if you meet people who like to evade the laws of the United States um a cryptocurrency is a solution in search of a problem uh and what the problem that it is a is designed to be a solution for is that the laws of the United States are enforced so Congressman if all of crypto is junk is the idea of decentralized finance and also junk and then I guess what is your message to those Americans who are big Believers in this because if you take a look at the price of Bitcoin it's actually come back quite a bit in just below 18 000 today so there clearly are a lot of people who do believe in this well they believe that they can buy it at 16 and sell it at 17. and I would urge them to invest instead take those animal spirits take that willingness to invest and put it in companies that create jobs and plants and products here in the United States instead of betting on something which it might go up in value it apparently did today um but it's purpose is to undermine the US dollar and create a currency useful for tax evaders and sanctions Invaders I would say you can make money by investing in something that's going to help Society rather than in something that aspires to displace partially the US dollar as a reserve currency as they've announced as their objective which would cost every family in the United States thousands of dollars in extra costs and and bad economic results so uh you know you might be able to make money investing in a heroin processing operation it might go from Sixteen thousand dollars a share to seventeen thousand dollars a share but if the ultimate purpose of the investment is to process heroin or to do something that is anti-social that is designed to hurt the country uh maybe you want to invest in something else Congressman do you think that the SEC maybe dropped the ball here in trying to regulate ftx's U.S operations or is it something that they can't even look into because it's so opaque will uh in July I urge the SEC to shut down every unregistered crypto exchange and every exchange here in the United States that was dealing in unregistered Securities and of course all of the exchanges crypto exchanges do that uh so I wish the SEC had done more but the people who criticized the SEC at the hearing are the ones who had been hammering on them to do less who have been attacking them every time they do something and in fact uh 19 Republican members sent a letter to the SEC just five months ago berating them or being concerned that as what the letter calls the purported risks of cryptocurrency well those risks are not purported uh they're uh they're quite rude I really want to ask you if you heard from snake lovers but we don't have enough time I share your dislike of snakes can't stand them but I do want to ask you you didn't get a chance to talk to Sam bankman freed today if you had that opportunity what question would you like to ask him and what was left unanswered today although John Jay Ray was very upfront ah the one question I had one of the questions I had for him was whether he had consulted uh with uh experts or attorneys who could advise him on where he might flee and avoid U.S extradition I think we saw that answer this morning and the answer was no he had had not consulted or he had not taken their advice um I am uh so the other question I was going to ask him is that he uh in an interview he did in November said that he gave tens of millions of dollars to dark money Republican operations and of course he's also made uh openly to some democratic operations uh using usually against friends of mine in primaries and uh I would have asked him to identify which dark Market which dark money Republican operations he gave to because the Democratic operations that he gave to our own matter public record does Congress have a lot of looking in the mirror to do given that he appeared to buy an awful lot of influence there on Capitol Hill we've got a a flawed system of government where members of Congress seek campaign contributions and deal with lobbyists and there's no pack here in Washington on the other side there's not a pack here that is dedicated to making sure that our tax laws can be enforced there's not a a lobbyist paid by any organization that's trying to make sure that the U.S dollar Remains the preeminent dual current site currency and Reserve currency so um we do not have a perfect system of government we have a system of government where people are raising money for political campaigns and it sometimes that's counterbalanced because you have people on both sides with lobbyists impacts but in this case all the money is all the power all the lobbyists are the crypto billionaire Bros uh that uh um literally make money by making money so Congressman you want regulation you just don't you want a specific type of Regulation even extremely critical of those on the other side of the aisle that have been critical of the SEC and the potential role in regulation if you could design it what do you want and how confident are you that we are going to get regulation in a very timely manner we're not going to get what I want which is a Prohibition on Americans buying crypto well then what's more realistic I guess what is something that you think both sides of the aisle could agree on the most realistic is that congress not legislate at all because as I said uh all the money and power is on the side of dismantling the system in which we can collect taxes and enforce our sanctions laws the SEC has most of the authority it needs under present statute and were we to try to pass a statute it's more likely that we would make it worse that we would uh reduce regulation keep in mind Sam bankman freed was here often in his shorts lobbying passing out money uh for the purpose of getting the SEC completely out of crypto and a lot of all of my colleagues have trashed sandbagment free we shouldn't trash bankman freed and then passes bill so the most important thing is to let the SEC do their job and to encourage them to do their job now if we could pass legislation that said all of crypto was a security rather than most of crypto qualifying under a 1940s case that defines what a security is that would be a step forward but with no lobbyists no money no packs I it is uh unlikely that we're going to be able to pass good legislation let's just hope we don't pass that legislation all right Congressman Bradshaw I mean we really appreciate you taking the time to join us here at Yahoo finance we look forward to having you back thanks so much for taking the time this afternoon thank you

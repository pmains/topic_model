are you wanting to hear from the president I think we have to put it in context for generations America has led the world bin leader in innovation in jobs and healthcare science technology but lately it seems that we've been more polarized we've seen us divided as a nation not talking to each other not dealing with some of these issues things that have caused our employment situation to stagnate where we have more part-time jobs that are generated them then real job so I can go on with that but so tonight what the message that I'm looking I want to hear him talk about three key points is this the best economy we can have in America is this the new norm where we have ninety-seven percent of the all the jobs created last year were part-time job is this is this the best we can do as it relates to health care I want to hear now as we've seen how the rollout was a failure we've seen people with her increased premiums we uh we've seen people millions of people lose their health insurance is this the best health care we can provide in America and thirdly I think it comes down to is is this the best we can have for our situation for our children grandchildren when we're borrowing money today to pay for it and we're passing that on to them this spending has to come under control and and so we're looking at ways that where we can deal with that how how how can we get this under control so that our economy is in general grows in a way that we inspire people we emerge again the national or the world leader people look to America to where that's going to be so this speech tonight is is going to be on I'm hoping he focuses back on the jobs the health care and and and we and we wanted we want to talk about some of these all these men in the spending control I don't want to see as divided any longer this has not been productive the idea that I can the president kenny executive orders and go around Congress this document the Constitution says there is a role for Congress and I think it's very important that we adhere to the Constitution so tonight's message on those three topics I think are going to be paramount how he addresses and convinces the American public that we're all this is going to be the best we can be the where we emerge again we continue to be that leader in the world that shining city the people look towards for leadership and tonight he'll have a chance to articulate those points on all those three and perhaps many many more but i think it is this the best we can be thank you

thank you madam chair uh dr abernathy am i saying that right yes sir okay um we we all know that the precision medicines uh are typically incredibly expensive can you speak to why these drugs have such a high price tag thank you for your question sir while i'm not an expert in drug pricing or a cost i think that one of the critical issues as we think about personalized health care and precision medicine is that there's important investment in biology in clinical development in moving through the regulatory expectations and also importance of ultimately developing interventions that are oftentimes for smaller and smaller populations which may ultimately get reflected um in the context of price but practically speaking i hope towards a landscape where innovation across this space is going to increase the availability of precision medicine for all thank you i agree with that too and your testimony you had highlighted that your company has payment structures that are based on patients outcomes can you speak of the importance of this innovative payment structure that you guys have um i'm not specifically sure exactly which payment structures to which uh you're referring i think one of the things that i've thought a lot about and been considering in the future is the availability of data and the same data sets and processes that we use for clinical trials and clinical studies the ability to interrelate patient treatment and outcome to help for inform for example outcomes-based pricing in the future where we can interrelate the performance of an intervention to then the ability to think about how to pay for value across time right i believe in your in your in your written testimony you said that um you've only been able to use these payment structures in limited circumstances am i am i correct on that i think this this was more generally from a policy perspective the ability to to use these kinds of interventions rather than specifically for our company well you know i i'm part of the innovation caucus and uh and co-chair that and we're always looking for ways to incentivize the medical industry to look at new directions new ways instead of us just trying to to fit everything in the same donut that we've always done business in let's figure out a way to go around that and um and the payment structure is one of them you know there's there there's in anything we do in life be it get an attorney um or or call a a service company the payment is based upon the the outcome in most cases it's based upon did you complete the job or did you not did it work did the product you installed didn't work it's anything with our mechanics that worked on our vehicles and uh and if we can look at a new payment model uh and have uh and tie it to the patient's outcomes there that's something for us to look into and as we're looking through innovation i think we gotta look at the payment structure too and so uh as we move forward hope we can have more of these conversations madam chair with that i yield back and thank you for having this hearing

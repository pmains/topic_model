vice-president pence led the transition well interesting all right Jim Acosta over at the White House thanks very much let's get some more on all of this with the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee congressman Adam Smith congressman thanks so much for joining us thanks well so you heard the White House press secretary Sean Spicer today say you know who's responsible for this this parent failure the Obama administration because back in 2016 they renewed Michael Flynn's security clearances your reaction you know that's a common refrain everything is President Obama's fault I guess they got used to it during the eight years and now they're not used to actually governing and whatever may have happened back then there are two big issues number one what Michael Flynn did is apparently in clear violation of the law when you are a retired officer you are not allowed to take money from foreign governments that's very clear and was made clear to him he did that and then second I think all congressman Cummings and congressman Chaffetz are both looking for are those vetting documents to find out did the Michael Flynn lie about it when he was vetted now you know whether or not President Obama should have cleared him back in 2016 they probably didn't know about this stuff now we do know in the documents that are being asked for you know it's pretty simple they had a point where like the White House makes the point to Sean Spicer look at 2015 he went to Moscow he was seen at that of with Putin @rt Russian television event he was paid for that and then in 2016 the Obama administration went ahead and renewed his Clarence's billion is quite possibly Obama Bob the Obama administration was wrong about that but the Trump administration actually hired him to be the national security adviser based on that same information so you know whatever clearance they may have given Michael Flynn the Trump administration really upped the ante by making him the national security adviser and now they won't give us the vetting documents to see what was said or not said when a lieutenant general retires from the US Army that lieutenant general keeps his or her security clearances automatically right I believe so yes unlike the bus so those are the rules but it's better I've got a smart rule that somebody like that should be able to keep their security clearances I guess they have to get it renewed every few years but some people are wondering why do they automatically get to keep those security clearances that's something that we definitely should look at I think off the top it's something that you look at certainly as you know you know like you said it's reviewed and vetted later on but I certainly think that is a policy that we should should re-examine the other point that Sean splicer makes and you're the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee is that there was really no need for the Trump administration after January 20th to run re run a background check on Michael Flynn because he once was the the head of the defense intelligence agency at the Pentagon he had those high-level security clearances yeah like we just pointed out in the back and forth about whether or not retired officers should automatically have this you have to constantly check and you vet everybody I mean look we've had a ton of people through many administrations who have been appointed to cabinet positions in high positions who had been in very important positions before that and all of a sudden stuff came out that you hadn't found before this is at a whole another level that's why you need to redo we tell us why the average American who is watching right now should care if Michael Flynn was paid forty or forty-five thousand dollars for a speech in Moscow or a half a million dollars from various Turkish elements and he didn't register as a foreign agent for Turkey only after he was fired by the way does be retroactive Lee registered with the Justice Department as a foreign aid tell our viewers why the average person out there should care no two quick things first of all there are a lot of other things going on in the world right now that are more important than whether or not Michael Flynn individually broke the law I think as a rule of law matter it's important that we investigate it as it is important we would investigate all potential crimes of this level but I will certainly say to the American people North Korea Russia a whole lot of things are more important but and this is the second thing is Michael Flynn's connection to the whole question of the Russian influence over our election and whether or not people in the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians in that effort that is being actively investigated by the FBI it's being actively investigated by the Senate Intelligence Committee that's why they should care is this is tied back in to what the Russians were doing here in the US and I might also add what the Russians are doing globally and a lot of different eliezer relatives any evidence you've seen serious evidence they're doing it in France right now in advance of their presidential election I have not seen serious evidence of that I have heard it alleged I personally haven't read up on it but I have seen very legitimate evidence that they were involved in the brexit vote that they were involved in the Fayette and the failed referendum in Italy which led to the fall of that government and that they've been involved in other elections in Eastern Europe um what we did learn today the inspector general at the Department of Defense is now open has that opened up a new investigation into Michael Flynn how he got those security clearances and all of that like he might be able to tell us more about that that's the bottom line why we should care lawyers have suggested he'd like immunity in exchange for that testimony would you accept that's not Michael I'm not I am not a prosecutor on that level I don't know what the balancing act would be on whether or not to grant immunity I certainly would like to hear Michael Flynn's testimony to hear more about what he knows about all the issues we just discussed yeah sure would be fascinated democratic congressman your colleague Elijah Cummings he goes one step further and he says he believes the White House is covering up his words covering up for Flynn do you believe the White House is covering up for flood I don't have enough evidence to make that serious of a charge at this point I believe in being somewhat cautious about making very very serious charges like that I do think it would look better for the White House and for all involved but they would simply turn over the vetting documents he says that the cover-up is he makes that accusation because the White House has not handed over all those documents to his committee that's why he's saying Congress are standby I want to get your thoughts on this tension

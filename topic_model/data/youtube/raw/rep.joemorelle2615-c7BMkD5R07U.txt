it's hard to find words to describe the despair we feel in the wake of the recent series of senseless mass shootings in buffalo uvalde tulsa and two too many neighborhoods across our country for the sake of the victims their families and all americans we cannot rest until we put an end to this vicious cycle there have been more than 200 mass shootings already in 2022 that's more shootings than there have been days of the year and according to a recent analysis published in the new england journal of medicine firearm deaths have now replaced motor vehicle accidents as the leading cause of death for children in this country i know the insurmountable pain of losing a child all too well but losing a child to something entirely avoidable that's a uniquely devastating kind of tragedy june is gun violence awareness month but we are already painfully brutally aware what we need now is action that's why this week we are passing legislation to strengthen red flag laws raise the age for semi-automatic gun purchases ban bump stocks and high-capacity magazines and promote safe storage of firearms this builds on the action we've already taken to enact universal background checks and marks a critical step forward in keeping dangerous weapons out of the wrong hands in the midst of so much pain and suffering it's astonishing that there are those who still refuse to act if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not willing to be part of the solution then please please please stand aside so you're not part of the problem it doesn't stop here i'll continue pushing to ban assault weapons combat drug trafficking gun trafficking so we can put a stop to this devastating and maddening cycle of violence because the absolute worst thing we can do is nothing at all

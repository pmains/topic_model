well you want to talk about jobs i want to talk about courage you have had courage to do something on medicare that nobody else has had courage to do it seems in the Democratic Party and that is put it out there front and center and just admit the truth which is Medicare as a matter of math is going to go bankrupt unless Washington get serious and unless Democrats and Republicans put aside petty differences and start working together Joe there are a lot of members of Congress that are trying to be bipartisan frankly doesn't get a lot of press and I want to just say I appreciate the fact that you all want on once in a while talk about cooperation rather than conflict my background is working with seniors that's what I did I ran a legal aid program I was a public member of the nursing home bored and this is not about ideology this is about what's really happening out there you talked to seniors they can't get a doctor to see them they make half a dozen calls if they have high blood pressure they have a heart condition nobody else seems so what the Congress has got to do now is sort of put aside the fighting and say this isn't about ideology we've got to fix a problem and I'm going to work with anybody will be part of that and you've caught a lot of grief in your own democratic caucus for working with the Republicans haven't you there's been some sniping particularly among staff people but you talk to somebody like Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer said Ron Wyden is an important part of our caucus and making making important points this just can't afford to wait there's never an ideal time to bring up an issue like like this people say that the compromise is a bad thing I've heard Chuck talk about polling and that kind of kind of thing the fact is what the country is really unhappy about is when politics comes before doing what doing one that's right that's what we've got to do it's so write it so reflects the no labels community while we've seen such a push behind Americans want this sort of action and God bless you for for doing what everybody else with most Americans think is so obvious we know what the problems are we know we have to do we know that we haven't changed these entitlements in 15 years and yet age age life expectancy is 15 years greater it's obvious we can means test we can we can adjust the age requirements and so appreciate what you're doing senator can you reform Medicare without death panels and I say this and I'm being sarcastic about the death panels that but these panels that basically say hey guess what and 85 years old there's certain things certain tests you're not going to get any more Medicare might not cover certain things which of course got turned into death panels and became politically toxic can you reform Medicare without it of course you can the fact is people are already looking at end of life alternatives particularly hospice we got a new program 75% of Medicare goes for chronic disease heart stroke and diabetes if you take care of those people at home according to the VA will save about thirty percent on their cares so the fact is there are ways in which to contain these costs and I voted against the early Ryan proposal I thought it was a voucher program right I'm a progressive a Democrat but if somebody is going to say we're going to make sure the traditional Medicare keeps its purchasing power we're not going to have a voucher which is really coupon care but we're going to try approaches that give private alternatives and traditional Medicare that keeps up with health care costs I think we can turn this around Chuck I remember the president in 2010 end of 2010 was stealing obviously very poorly in the polls and then he struck that deal that extended the bush tax cuts and also extended unemployment his numbers went up not because of the specifics of that deal just because he was cooperating with the Republicans Republicans were cooperating with him we were talking last segment about how it had helped Mitt Romney if just one time you said you know what I think the president's right on that foreign policy but you just put your finger on the and there on the reason why you're not seeing any more of it you know the president mmm my belt is it and how doesn't it helps the political cap doesn't it help mit romney if mitt romney once in a while says you know what the president's right on on this china issue and i'm gonna i'm gonna just sit back and let the commander in china they always have to be at odds i doin mark aren't you finding independence are hungry well for the two parties to work together well what you see is you see the negatives for the two parties going down and Republicans are in worse shape than the Democrats but it's not like the Democrats are you mean Megan but the negatives are going up well no but they're they're favorable ratings are going are going are both parties they don't recognize I mean they recognize that they want to race to the box can you tell us the status of this and what they I look I'm like I'm encouraged more and more people are coming up to me whether it's a senior citizen center of airport they know we have to do this Medicare is the ballgame in terms of the federal budget and I think one of the big challenges in something you can help with is that all these members of Congress come to Washington and they sign these pledges they've signed a pledge about the budget about it health care about taxes I don't sign these pledges know before but if there was a pledge that I was going to sign I'd sign a pledge to put problem solving in the country's interest before any of these special interest or caucus kind of drills and you can ask people come on your show if they do that so chuck was just talking about how the party's favorability numbers are collapsing Oregon has always been seen as a independent state do you think a third party candidate could win out in Oregon well first of all I think people who have independent ideas can win under any kind of circumstance but I'll tell you I went through a campaign in 2010 and I told the people of Oregon that I was going to approach problem solving and putting the country's interests first I came up with a democratic chair and a Republican chair in each of Oregon's 36 counties and I said if you send me back to Washington that's what I'm going to focus on and frankly it works one of the first fights that we want at the beginning of this Congress senator Jerry Moran a Republican from Kansas and I teamed up we won this site to to make sure that the internet stayed free and open you wouldn't turn websites into web cops not only does it work substantively I think voters are looking for it all right we're good Senator Ron Wyden it's great to have you on the show how sharp

German thank you again mr. secretary for appearing before us I want to build off a little bit of it mr. with the gentleman move the microphone up thank you the whole did I guess the I want to build off what Doyle and and green both talked about with metal and also your through CCS the backs of the backdrop my question is going to have to do with that there there folks that will contend and may be justifiably that some of climate change involves co2 emissions not going to disagree there is climate change it's question I think is how much is man-made you with me on and you could have how much of it is man-made so I just just looking at a chart that we've put together yeah because the very boy is the amount produced by man and in this chart you see that the almost seventy percent comes from fossil fuels of the energy produced now the second chart shows that the second chart shows that very little is being spent in research in fossil fuels and if that indeed is the problem is fossil fuels is the problem I don't understand why there's a disconnect between that and the research with that because you can look at it the the research dollars only around eighteen percent but more specifically for nettle the fossil energy research has been cut by over fifteen percent and importantly the comment that was raised over there the carbon capture one of the keys to the future of using fossil fuels and under some of the regulations that are being issued by the EPA they've cut the cut the research money in carbon capture by sixteen percent they've cut they on carbon storage by twenty six percent if we're serious about trying to include fossil fuels in our energy matrix I think someone's being disingenuous about their interest in all of the above and rather that there isn't there truly is this war on coal so is this are we you think that president is deliberately trying to discredit or diminish the use of coal in America again in terms of the terms of the rd numbers for example again I respectfully feel that this does not give the full picture I mean the this administration is unprecedented in its in its its investments in coal and put the CCS in particular CC us with six billion dollars why do we see cuts of 40 and forty-seven percent six now six billion dollars in CC us and right now an active loan program solicitation of eight billion dollars for fossil fuels generally I can't get into the specifics of some of the initial proposals it's a rolling it'll be more proposals for secretary there's cold you can appreciate we have that five minute drill we have to get that we have limited ability to ask enough questions here but the of my focus again is over nettle is providing increased research dollars into nettle and I think it sends a message to the laboratories both in Pennsylvania and West Virginia that we're serious about them whether that's a chemical loop whether it whether that's a fracking techniques and all the things that have been developed at nettle that they'll continue that they can count on it that their employment is secure I think it also sends a message if we put their proper amount of money in nettle we're sending a strong message the coal miners all across America and the coal fields that their jobs are secure that there is a future for coal mining and and and it just eliminates the uncertainty I'm I use that backdrop is for nettle but but also if we continue this attack on coal and fossil fuels and not put the money into the research if we decarbonize America do you really think the health of the world will improve that much if America alone by itself we're did not burn fossil fuels do you think the health of the world would be better but first let me say I will go back and look at the nettle program specifically number two dimensions mentioned earlier things like methane hydrates I think we tripled which will be in a nettle interest third on the last question we all recognize that obviously the United States alone cannot change the trajectory but what we do is very very important and and I think and the president feels the other other nation will show leadership hear it mr. secretary the other nations aren't following us Germany is building more coal fire power houses so my message is until we get a global a unanimous effort to try to do this why do we continue to attack our coal industry and and diminish it and cause uncertainty with it I'm past my time I'm sorry and again I would just say the back we're making unprecedented investments in coal a huge in scale gentleman's time has expired at this time we recognize the gentleman from New York mr. Engel for five minutes well thank you very much

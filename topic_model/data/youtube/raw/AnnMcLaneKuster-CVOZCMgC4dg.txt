two years ago again the first big speech in my life since I ran for Student Council the Contra high school 40 years ago for all the years that I was working from progress in this great state I was always the one knocking on doors and waving sons in the crowd not the one standing at the podium but in 2010 I stood at this podium and I said that we needed a new approach in Washington and luckily you agree we got house but closest only hit up close enough in hand grenades and horseshoes my mother would soon many truth is we were right instead of more bickering over the debt ceiling and congressional quit dragging we must invest in our communities and create good jobs right here at home and instead of creating more tax loopholes for those big oil and gas companies we need tax fairness for the folks right here in this road in the middle cross all across the state broadly to get access to reproductive rights I mean seriously family planning you want to talk about that i thought that wisdom and marriage equality we need federal laws that protect our civil rights that we've fought hard to win here and it is crystal clear down Congress is broken and we bought a new approach in Washington it's going to take a new congressman or as pure land i would say to new Congress women that the answer is ready for this new approach in Congress many of you know I work hard on the campaign trail 130 house parties last time around you were in the midst of 30 and 30 right now and in every house party across this district I see and I feel and I hear energy and optimism again they've been missing for a couple of years once again we are fired up not bad for the night again and once again we are standing up to move our country together we are standing up to create good jobs in her ear leads to protect Medicare and Social Security to invest in the education in technologies of our future and to demand parents from Wall Street once again together we are standing up for equal rights civil right marriage equality and never compromising a woman's right to choose you for a country that is safe and free at the same time because I truly believe we can have home and once again together we are standing up for a government that supports a decency the responsibility and the generosity of each and every one of you in this room and people all across this great granite state of New Hampshire and if you believe in these values I want to be your congresswoman and I'm asking you to stand with me in this election join our team and together we can finally bring a new approach to Congress you

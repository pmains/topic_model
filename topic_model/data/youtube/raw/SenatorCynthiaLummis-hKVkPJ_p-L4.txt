[Music] welcome back to Yahoo finance I'm Jennifer Sean Berger FTX says bankruptcy has rocked the crypto world and renewed calls for legislation to regulate the space Senator Cynthia Lamas along with Senator Kirsten gillibrand put forth legislation back in June to regulate crypto Senator Lomas has said that market manipulation and protection of customer assets are just a few of the major issues that have been involved with ftx's bankruptcy and she joins me now to talk about this Senator Lem is welcome back to the program it's great to have you it's nice to be with you thank you Senator we're just learning uh this morning that there could be more than a million creditors involved in this case at the same time a reported snapshot of ftx's balance sheet shows the day before it filed for bankruptcy it held just 900 million in liquid assets versus 9 billion in liabilities at the same time there are reports that now former CEO Sam bankman freed uh knew about customer assets that were being shuffled to shore up alameda's position Senator to what extent do you think this was a Ponzi scheme what has all of the visual indications of being like a Ponzi scheme certainly when you're taking customer assets out of FTX sending them over to shore up Alameda that is commingling assets that belong to your customers and that you are accustoming for them and taking them and using them for your own purposes borrowing from Peter to pay Paul and so there are incidents or in disha of some Ponzi scheme-like behavior and so I'm sure we'll see the Department of Justice the SEC and other regulate Regulators uh looking into this you along with senator gillibrand you know earlier this year would ftx's bankruptcy had happen if your legislation had been in place how could your legislation have protected against the scenario yeah ftx's bankruptcy would not have happened if the one is killer brand bill was in place because we disallow the co-mingling of customer assets with non-customer assets we would require that there be um separation and segregation of customer assets from non-customer assets we would require more consumer protections more disclosure the fact that there were over 130 companies involved with the FTX orbit and the fact that they created their own cryptocurrency or stable coin uh ftt and then put it over in Alameda bought their own asset ftt thereby creating a market for their own asset that other people bought and then they pulled the rug out from under them uh by taking their money out it was clearly activity that is within the regulatory parameters of lorimus Chiller brand that would have been illegal and they would have been regulated by the SEC requiring consumer protections and disclosures that do not now exist Senator has this episode the bankruptcy itself in the events leading up to it caused you to rethink any portions of the bill do you think you need to go and tighten and toughen any areas of this will definitely be reviewing the bill under the lands of the FTX bankruptcy to see that we have adequately protected uh consumer assets during a bankruptcy a protected consumer assets from being co-mingled and making sure that our definitions are sufficiently tight so definitely we're going to continue to comb through the bill but we do think that our bill being the most comprehensive bill out there and the one that is very neutral when it comes to not favoring one cryptocurrency company over another allows for responsible Innovation at the same time it provides consumer protections and SCC disclosure of assets that fall under the category of a security and Senator should be clear your legislation does um mandate Capital requirements it would deal with risk management controls right there was a lot of Leverage that was undertaken in this case it would include all of those correct that's correct it looks like the FTX was in the range of 101 to one uh in terms of their uh ratios that they were using to leverage and clearly protecting consumer assets was not their highest priority in fact it may have been their lowest priority so our bail would require those kinds of safeguards in that uh custody assets consumer assets would have 100 backing do you think that this case has increased the urgency for Congress to consider crypto legislation uh what are you hearing from colleagues now uh could your bill now uh be reconsidered through committees almost immediately would have to be broken up uh what is your sense there well I do think that uh now that the bankruptcy has already happened a better thing to do is evaluate legislation based on what has happened make sure that we're comfortable that it has closed potential gaps that allowed FDX to behave in this manner and that we probably go forward with the bill in 2023. so I don't think we need to be using some sort of a nature reaction do it immediately during the enslamed up session that just began this week I think we have time to move in a very careful and deliberative manner in 2023 and at that time break up so mama's still the Granville which is currently in one piece in the Senate finance committee and then we can but it's subject to being broken up and so we can send some parts of it to the AG committee some parts to the Banking Committee the other parts to the intelligence committee and make sure that we're covering all of the bases associated with not only this bankruptcy but the ability to protect consumers going forward while at the same time allowing Innovation to occur in this country Senator since it will take some time to examine and go through this process take a careful approach as you say should the SEC start um increasing some of the regulations using the authorities it already has for instance should it now mandate that crypto exchanges uh register with the agency should traditional broker dealer rules that would separate customer assets out and not have allowed those customer assets to be used Alameda research in this case should the SEC pursue that right now in the absence of legislation and given that it could take time for legislation to be put in place now I have no doubt that the SEC has already begun investigating these matters uh it takes quite a while to build a case at the SEC for a complicated organization like FTX I have no doubt that that's already begun and it also looks like FDX was violating existing laws so um it the SEC I'm sure is making the effort to Camp right now to address these issues uh while we will be working with the SEC and the commodity Futures Trading commission uh to get this legislation uh not only prepared for uh prime time uh in January of 2023 but bring our colleagues into the discussion and the FTX bankruptcy has certainly given rise to the priority and the importance of having responsible regulation of digital assets Center alamas will have to leave the conversation there but we so appreciate your Insight and we will be following your legislation closely we hope to talk with you again soon

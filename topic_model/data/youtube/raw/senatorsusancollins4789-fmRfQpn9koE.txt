mr president today senator nelson and i rise to re-introduce the retirement security act this is legislation that we first introduced last year that would encourage more small employers to offer retirement plans that would provide incentives for employees to save more for retirement and would ensure that low and middle-income taxpayers are able to claim tax benefits for retirement savings that are already authorized in law our bill is the product of the work that senator nelson and i did together on the special committee on aging in the fall of 2013 the committee conducted a hearing on retirement security where we heard from witnesses that far too many american seniors have real reason to fear that they will outlive their savings

to our special guest tonight Ron joined exclusively by South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham senator Graham welcome back to the show sir let me just ask you you know that Senator Rand Paul is very much against this NSA he is saying it's a violation of personal liberty it's a violation of the Fourth Amendment he said big brother is spying on you or watching you why is your response to what Senator Paul is saying well the Fourth Amendment protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures and how does it do that you have to get a warrant no content no phone call of yours or mine can be monitored by our government unless a federal judge authorizes the content to be monitored and the government would have to prove to the federal judge that the other person on the person on the other end the line is a terrorist so we do have a warrant requirement and this is not an unreasonable search and seizure and by the way we're at war and we need to find out what these guys are up to because if you don't preempt them we're going to pay a heavy price so I'm very comfortable the legal basis of this program all right you support the program yes the point about Senator Rand Paul is getting a lot of ink about this as you know it has a lot of supporters on this point what you're saying is he's wrong because he's left out the FISA warrant program is that basically the essence of your disagreement with poll yes an unreasonable search and seizure is prohibited by the Fourth Amendment and your warrant is that the check and balance to everyone who's listening the government cannot monitor the content of your phone call unless a federal judge's authorizes it in the the people who are tracking the terrorists have to prove a connection between your phone call your phone number and a known terrorist his phone number and I think most Americans want us to try to figure out who the terrorists are talking to throughout the world and like Anwar Awlaki was talking to major son remember that guy major a son you can killed 19 people at Fort Hood yep he was corresponding with Anwar Awlaki an American citizen al-qaeda leader in Yemen through email and we missed that so I would tell Senator Paul that I do respect civil liberties we do have checks and balances but I believe we're at war and it's a good thing to be trying to find out what terrorists are up to in other they're talking to us I don't want to be difficult about this but I'm sure you mentioned before hood we missed that we also missed the Boston Marathon yes we did now it's on Bob so Center skeptics of this story skeptics of the NSA are questioning you know clapper and the NSA are saying that it stopped dozens of terrorist attacks and of course the second problem with that is clapper himself looks like you lied in front of a congressional committee that were people just don't seem to truck or let me say some people many people don't seem to trust this story senator Graham well the the Major Hasan and Anwar Awlaki was a communication through an email conversation and believe it or not under this program a known terrorist like Anwar Awlaki because he's an American citizen we can't monitor his email I want to fix that but the Boston situation wasn't about the the phone surveillance program failing it was by the it was a failure of DHS the homeland security folks not to notify the FBI in the CIA that this guy had gone back to Dagestan to the tears safe haven our system failed to talk to each other so we need to up our game and if we took this system out of play and it may have been to store it already if we lose the ability to monitor terrorist activity phone calls and emails we got a warrant requirement protecting us but if we do away with this then we're pretty much blind because we don't capture people anymore Larry we don't gather intelligence we read them their Miranda rights so to my critics what would you do now make sure America can protect ourselves against terrorists are trying to kill us all I think it's all digital I think it's all digital at your right I think as long as it's monitored properly senator as long as we have trust in the people running it trust Trust is a commodity in short supply with this administration I think instead something you're dead right yes I don't trust them on Benghazi I think what they told us about being gay he was completely fabricated politically I don't trust them about the IRS being limited to Cincinnati but here's where i tell you i like the program and trust because you got federal courts overseeing the program all right I get that I get that and thank you I want to move on to another controversy the immigration reform bill they're going to be amendments and debates Republican Party is also split on this but it's also split with the Democrats let me just ask you this is the basic argument right now Democrats want legalization as soon as possible but Republicans are saying no it has to be border security as soon as possible border security first and then legalization is that the big debate yeah yeah yeah that's really the big debate and the gang of eight came up with a compromise that says goes is following before you can become get on the pathway to citizenship we have to have Eve arif I up and running to control jobs you know we've got 11 million illegal immigrants we're not being overrun by Canadians Larry they come and go home these people come from poor areas that try to get jobs so II verify has to be up and running before you can get on a path to citizenship so substantial completion of the border plan we're coming up here and entry exit controls those things have to be done before you can get on a pathway to citizenship once you get on a pathway to citizenship you have to pass to English exams pay a fine pay taxes and get in the back of the line of the country where you came from so it's an accommodation of border security and a pathway to citizenship linked together all right you took a whack at Senator John Cornyn fellow Republican he seems to want 10,000 more border agents you estimated that would cost 20 billion dollars and you said because you're not a bashful senator you said we just can't afford that during the sequester now is that going to be a debate inside the GOP am I looking at a border security debate inside the Republican Party well i think in i respect senator Cornyn he's trying to improve border security but here's one thing I want out of this bill I want to be deaf as deficit-neutral don't you don't why don't want any more government programs that we borrow from our kids and grandkids and to pay for so right now i believe the bill is paid for if you want to add more border security fine let's find a way to pay for it and if you want to add a new trigger that you can adjust a citizenship until ex has done our Democratic colleagues have to be convinced that Republicans can't manipulate X and this achievable there's a lot of distrust I would never grant legalization first and hope the FLC I would give me more guest workers and a bigger legal immigration program and then border security and they're not going to give us border security and hope we deal with pathway to citizenship later they're all together so if senator Cornyn wants more border security count me in but it's got to be paid for and if you want some new trigger there's got to be something that's not politically manipulated that really holds the Lebanon hostage it sounds like this whole issue is very far from being resolved and yeah as you know it's gonna I'm hopeful it's going to be tough in the house let me ask you one more if I'm not mistaken you're in a White House meeting yesterday with the chief of staff and the OMB director some of the reports senator Graham said basically nothing happened is that true well I think we're trying to trying to define the problem here's a challenge for you layering and I really respect you greatly why don't you sit down with your staff and come up with a number of what the deficit will be in 30 years if we continue to collect revenue at an average base and spend money at average space the 80 million baby boomers are retiring at $10,000 a 10,000 a day in 30 years 80 million are going to be in retirement what does that do the deficit please come up with a number if you could over the next 30 years and see how much we owe at the end of that 30-year period it will blow your mind it's going to be about I know that numbers going to be around 50 trillion dollars if i'm not mistaken and if i'm wrong i'm too low but i guess are you all as far apart as these reports indicate now the debt ceiling is not coming into play until I don't know october november but is anything possibly going to happen between now and then for me to raise the debt ceiling the bar a bunch more money we're already 17 trillion dollars in debt and climbing I want to fix the reason we're so much in debt that's entitlement reform we're going to have to adjust the age of retirement from Medicare to harmonize it with Social Security adjust inflation rate inflation calculations because we're we're over pay and we're going to means test benefits people like you and I are going to have to pay more and take a little less out to get this program in a good spot what do we have to do as Republicans flatten the tax code take some money out of the tax code that goes to de DIC the temp shins and deductions pay down some debt and lower rates that's the grand bargain I think that's the best way to raise the debt ceiling address why you're in debt and I'm somewhat optimistic but if we fail on immigration there's no chance of a big budget deal if we pass immigration reform maybe the Congress can do two things at once and go to the budget senator you passed tax first one and i will give you a three to four percent economic growth rate instead of this anemic two percent yeah that's ad right it is that's not important to this yes you're dead right as always I gotta get out of here anything South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham thank you sir that

first Madam Secretary let me compliment you on your recent attention to the Caribbean we chaired an oversight hearing on the Caribbean being the third border and I know that I got reports back from Governor fortu√±o and representative pair Lucy that did a great job going over there and I certainly appreciate that I also chaired a hearing just recently on the use of drones now as you know I comes from Cuellar and I have been strong advocates for the use of DHS drones down on the border there's another issue with respect to drones being used throughout the United States and the interior and I bring this up because the GAO four years ago said that the tsa under DHS had a role to play with respect to security assessments in a national policy and then less than a year ago we had a man who used this or try it attempted to use this drum but was thwarted by the FBI an attempt to blow up the Pentagon in the United States Capitol I have to tell you I was surprised that the response from your department was that you had no role with respect to these drones and that you were not going to send witnesses to testify at that hearing so I just want to register my disappointment I personally think that DHS does have a role in fact every member are sitting on the subcommittee both Republican and Democrat agreed with that assessment and in fact the witnesses it's rare that you have a privacy expert and a law enforcement acts are agreeing on the same issue and that was that DHS has a role through the office of privacy and also through science and technology and other departments within DHS to deal with this issue can you explain me why this is not giving in any attention well I think and and I can't speak to exactly how the the role was expressed last week but here's what's going on yeah you're right we yes you're right we use the drones on the border extensively with respect to the regulation of drone use in interior the United States which is a relatively new phenomenon and I think this was the focus of the committee the regulatory authorities with the FAA in part because it's an air traffic control issue but we are working and we'll be working with the FAA to make sure that Homeland Security equities are are protected and with respect to science and technology that Directorate we do have a funded project I think it's in California looking at drones that could be utilized to give us situational awareness in a large public safety or disasters such as a forest fire and how they could better give us better information x 1 but I appreciate that comment I hope that you you know the ranking member is prepared to offer legislation with me I prefer to see this happen administrative Lee and by either executive order within your department to coordinate with the Justice Department and the FAA I do think FAA controls the safety of the airways but that doesn't really focus on security / saying I think that is a appropriate role for the Department

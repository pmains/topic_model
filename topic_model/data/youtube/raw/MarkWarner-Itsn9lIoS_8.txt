hi Senator Mark Warner here on day eight of the impeachment trial we've heard the opening arguments from the president's counsel and from the house managers we've started now the first couple of hours of questioning from the Senators now the Senators don't actually ask the questions they submit the questions to the Chief Justice probably minimizes the number of senators then asking two longer questions also the Chief Justice is pretty good about making sure that the folks who answer go no more than five minutes the house managers have been spreading the answers around the president's councils have been pretty much keeping - mr. Philbin who frankly is probably one of the presidents more effective advocates answering most of the questions I'm still thinking through which question I want to ask there's two or three that come to mind I still got a question of you know there were 12 plus either Trump appointees or career foreign service officers who literally put their careers on the line to raise concerns about the July 25th call and what led up to that call and afterwards were some of them they've even threatened to quit because they thought the president's actions were so outrageous I'd love to hear you know why that isn't a really relevant fact I still haven't heard as well an answer to why John Bolton shouldn't testify or for that matter why Mick Mulvaney if he could come in and defend the president why he wouldn't testify and I've still got a big question the house managers raised the point that President Trump or his agent Rudy Giuliani when they continued to raise the so-called CrowdStrike or debunked theory that Ukraine rather than Russia intervened in 2016 the house manager said that was actually advancing Russian propaganda I'd like to hear a little more from house managers why that's played in to the hands of Vladimir Putin we're gonna go a number of hours tonight and then probably another eight hours tomorrow then we'll get to the actual debate about whether we have witnesses are not so late night tonight late night tomorrow night and then we'll get to the debate about witnesses on Friday so stay tuned more to come

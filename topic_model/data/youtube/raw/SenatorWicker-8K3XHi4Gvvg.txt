after two years in office it's clear to most Americans that President Biden is failing the American people take for example the economy at the start of his term America was poised to Roar back to life after two tough years of the pandemic but this President decided to double down on the coveted policies he passed a 1.9 trillion dollar tax and spending spree all without a single Republican vote economists even in his own party warned it would be like pouring gasoline on the economy and that's exactly what happened now the American people are watching the economy burn the cost of living is up 13.5 percent across the board wage gains have been erased for 21 straight months families are right to be angry and the American dream is slipping Out Of Reach for many President Biden also promised he would be the adult in the room but his leadership has been sorely lacking we're now facing the worst border crisis in history under his watch there have been nearly 5 million illegal border crossings there's no control our border patrol is overwhelmed and has no support from this Administration and traffickers and cartels are spreading deadly drugs in our community it is the cartels who are controlling the border now from the Mexican side and who can forget President Biden's failing foreign policy he is the president of too little too late just last week he led a Chinese spa balloon travel across the entire continental United States before contesting its presence it was an astounding display of incompetence Americans want to see a strong commander-in-chief they want a leader who takes responsibility this State of the Union Address is an opportunity for the president to speak with clarity about our problems but I will not hold my breath I expect we will get more of the same all talk and very little action however I am encouraged by what's to come this year Republicans have a new majority in the House of Representatives together we will hold this Administration accountable and get our nation back on track will fight to unleash American energy production slash burdensome regulations and our dependence on our adversaries and protect our border we'll combat the liberal woke agenda in our schools and in the military and we'll commit to rebuilding our national security by embracing Ronald Reagan's philosophy of peace through strength I'm confident we will continue to work together in the best interest of the American people and to strengthen our Union further thank you

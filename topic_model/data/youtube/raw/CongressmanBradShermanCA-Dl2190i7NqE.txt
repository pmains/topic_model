  MR. SHERMAN: MADAM SPEAKER, THE  PRIME MINISTER OF PAKISTAN CAME  TO WASHINGTON THIS WEEKEND, AND  AS CHAIR OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS  SUBCOMMITTEE ON ASIA, IT'S   APPROPRIATE THAT I COMMENT UPON  WHAT HAS OCCURRED SO FAR IN THE  BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS AND I  LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING THE  PRIME MINISTER LATER TODAY.  WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE IS THE  APPROACH TAKEN BY THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION.  FIRST IS TO AFGHANISTAN. THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE  AFGHAN PEOPLE ARE CRITICAL TO  OUR SUCCESS IN WHAT HAS BEEN   OUR LONGEST WAR. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS   HAVE WORKED TO GET THE HEARTS  AND MINDS OF THE AFGHAN PEOPLE   ON OUR SIDE, BUILDING SCHOOLS  AND HOSPITALS UNDER VERY   DANGEROUS CONDITIONS, AND NOW  THE PRESIDENT TAKES THIS   HIGH-PROFILE OPPORTUNITY AS AN   OPPORTUNITY TO SAY YOU THAT,   WELL, HE MIGHT KILL 10 MILLION   AFGHANS OR WAS THINKING ABOUT  IT.  OR RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT   WOULD USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO   DESTROY AFGHANISTAN. THIS DOES UNTOLD HARM TO OUR   EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN TO WIN  THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE  AFGHAN PEOPLE. WHAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE   DONE IS TALK ABOUT THE DURAN   LINE AND HOW AFGHANISTAN SHOULD  ACCEPT THIS BORDER BETWEEN   AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN, A  BORDER AFGHANISTAN DISPUTES AND  THE WHOLE WORLD ACCEPTS. AS TO KASHMIR, IT'S NOT  SURPRISING THAT THE PRIME  MINISTER OF PAKISTAN WANTS   AMERICA TO ARBITRATE OR  MEDIATE. THAT HAS BEEN THE POSITION OF  PAKISTAN FOR DECADES.  BUT THEN, THE PRESIDENT SAYS,  YOU KNOW, IN OSAKA LAST MONTH,   PRIME MINISTER MODI ASKED THE  UNITED STATES TO ARBITRATE OR  MEDIATE THE KASHMIR DISPUTE. THAT IS UTTERLY PREPOSTEROUS.  AND IT IS EMBARRASSING THAT WE   HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WOULDN'T  REALIZE HOW PREPOSTEROUS THAT  STATEMENT IS AND, OF COURSE,   THE RECORD HAS BEEN SET  STRAIGHT BY PRIME MINISTER   MODI.  THIRD IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT  DIDN'T SAY.  HE DIDN'T MAKE A MAJOR ISSUE   OVER DR. AFRIDI. THE DOCTOR THAT WAS CRITICAL IN  HELPING US FIND AND KILL OSAMA   BIN LADEN. BIN LADEN WAS HIDING A MILE  AWAY FROM THE MILITARY ACADEMY   OF THE PAKISTANI ARMY, THEIR   WEST POINT.  WE HAVE NOT DEMANDED THAT THE  PAKISTANIS WHO HELPED OSAMA BIN  LADEN BE PUT IN JAIL, BUT WE DO  INSIST THAT THE ONE PAKISTANI  THAT HELPED US FIND BIN LADEN  BE RELEASED FROM PAKISTANI   JAIL.  THE PRESIDENT BARELY RAISED THE  ISSUE. IN FACT, DIDN'T VOLUNTARILY  RAISE IT AT ALL. THIS IS NOT JUST A HUMANITARIAN  CONCERN. IT IS ALSO A STRATEGIC AND   NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN,   BECAUSE WHO WILL HELP US FIGHT   TERRORISM IF WE LEAVE DR.  AFRIDI BEHIND? IN A NEWS INTERVIEW, PRIME   MINISTER KAHN SUGGESTED THERE  MIGHT BE A TRADE WHERE AFRIDI  WAS RELEASED AND A DOCTOR WAS  RELEASED BY THE UNITED STATES. NO FRIENDLY COUNTRY WOULD  DEMAND WE RELEASE A TERRORIST  IN ORDER FOR THEM TO RELEASE A   HERO, BUT WE HAVE TO BE  PRACTICAL AND WE HAVE TO GET   DR. AFRIDI RELEASED. FINALLY, THE PRESIDENT FAILED  TO MENTION WITH THE PRIME  MINISTER OF PAKISTAN THE   SITUATION AS TO HUMAN RIGHTS.  HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE   BEEN FORCIBLY DISAPPEARED BY   PAKISTANI AUTHORITIES. THE PRIME EXAMPLE OF THAT IS A   17-YEAR-OLD BOY, AKIB. HE WAS ABDUCTED 14 MONTHS AGO  IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND STILL  MISSING. IT'S TIME THE FOREIGN MINISTER   OF PAKISTAN PROVIDE INFORMATION  ABOUT HIM. WHERE IS HE? PRODUCE HIM IN COURT OR RELEASE  HIM. WHAT IS HIS FATE?  AND, OF COURSE, WE NEED  INFORMATION ABOUT HUNDREDS OF  OTHERS WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED,   INCLUDING MERTAZA, SHAKID,   AYUB, AND INSAF. AND FINALLY, I WANT TO MENTION   DR. LAGARI, A FRIEND OF MINE   WHO WAS SHOT DEAD IN 2015 WHILE  WORKING WITH THE UNITED PARTY,   WHICH HE WAS ONE OF THE  LEADERS. PAKISTAN HAS NOT ADEQUATELY  INVESTIGATED THAT BRUTAL   MURDER, AND IT IS TIME FOR   PAKISTAN TO DO SO. FINALLY, WE FOCUS ON THE ISSUE   OF FORCED CONVERSIONS IN SIND. GIRLS FORCED TO MARRY MEN MANY   DECADES THEIR SENIOR.  THE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT NEEDS   TO STOP THIS PERNICIOUS  PRACTICE.  THEY NEED TO DO MORE.  SO THAT IS WHY NINE OF MY  COLLEAGUES JOIN WITH ME IN   SENDING A LETTER TO THE  PRESIDENT, URGING A FOCUS ON   THE HUMAN RIGHTS IN SYND

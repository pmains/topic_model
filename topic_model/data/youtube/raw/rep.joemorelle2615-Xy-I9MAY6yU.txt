good afternoon we're going to wait just a uh a few seconds for uh people to be able to uh to join in so if everyone can uh just be uh patient for just a minute or so and then uh i'll get the high sign that we can begin but uh really grateful everybody has uh joined us and particularly grateful for all the people on our panel and of course my colleagues in in congress for joining us this morning and you can joe you can tell me when we get to a critical mass here yeah we're at i feel like i should be able to juggle or something in the uh keep people's attention but unfortunately i don't have any skills in that regard um but i am happy to see spring has come to washington not so much in rochester new york where i'm from but uh but it's definitely springtime here good so i think we have uh enough people in the uh in the space so we're gonna begin so good afternoon and thank you all for tuning in today for what we hope is the first of many conversations about the optics and photonics industry and i am thrilled to be joined by some incredibly talented individuals who are not only well-versed in optics and photonics but share the common goal of ensuring our nation remains a global leader in light based technology innovation the bipartisan bicameral caucus we are announcing today is a result of a multi-year effort and i'm so grateful to my colleagues industry experts and local advocates who helped make this a reality as a congressional caucus we will work in a bipartisan manner to increase awareness of how optics and photonics improves the everyday lives of americans and work to maintain the united states position as a leader in global innovation my hometown of rochester new york has deep connections to the optics and photonics industry and i'm proud of the far-reaching benefits and opportunities the industry has afforded our region in my community alone there are thousands of workers across dozens of companies developing cutting edge cutting-edge state-of-the-art products in fact a lens designed by a company in my region just landed on mars as part of the perseverance rover we're very very excited and congratulations to all the folks that worked on this project but the applications of this technology go far beyond space travel they benefit americans every single day light-based innovation is already improving the way we communicate energizing our grids helping how we administer health care in our country and even enhancing our national security this industry has been a foundation for success in the past and quite literally lights the way for our future our world is shifting to a knowledge-based economy that rewards those nations who invest in innovation and are at the forefront of emerging technologies and the reward for what our nation needs most right now a boost in our economy and the creation of stable high-paying jobs so promoting optics and photonics is so much more than holding up the cutting edge products as business makes it's also about the hope and opportunity the industry inspires in our students and workers when i came to congress just a couple of years ago i knew that my community was not the only optics and photonics hub in the nation but i was surprised by the general lack of knowledge or siloed knowledge of the capabilities of light based technologies and that's why we're here today my colleagues in the house and senate share the knowledge of what this industry can offer and so we have come together to educate our colleagues create opportunities to connect with constituents and policy experts and to collaborate to ensure the united states remains a leader in optics and photonics for light years to come and with that i am pleased to introduce our next speaker a fellow member of the house the my fellow house co-chair someone who has devoted his life to the service of our country congressman brian mast of florida's 18th congressional district congressman hey thanks for that warm handoff and uh you know thank you everybody uh for letting me be a part of this congressman brian mast here um so for everybody involved in putting together today's optics and photonics caucus launch event um this is something that that representative morelli and myself uh we've been working on this for months here in the house you know really beyond that and i couldn't be more excited to join you all virtually for today's launch and the excitement comes from this there is sexy science out there and this is sexy science this is something that that excites people that you know you think of the various industries out there in the places that people want to go to work it's because of the innovation that they see going on in various places that say you know i want to pursue you know stem i want to get wise in this i want to get a degree in that and i want to go out there and i want to develop these things we've all heard you know emotion creates emotion well innovation creates more innovation there's no doubt in my mind that the optics in the photonics industry it's proving to play a more critical role in our nation's economy with its technology spanning a number of different sectors and we can look at what's going on right in our own backyards the energy industry solar moving moving photons in our phones instead of moving electrons through our through our iphones or android whatever it is that you choose to use uh you know people that are flying jumbo jets out there and being able to have them them operate in in a partially automated fashion because of the technology that's on those or the the cameras that are in our our vehicles that'll allow us to look in different directions or allow our vehicles to move more safely within one another without our our active use of a steering wheel to do these things virtual and augmented reality and the list can go on and on of like i said what i'd call some some pretty sexy science out there that excites people to get involved with in my own community my own backyard south florida we have uh indian river state college that was really the impetus for me getting involved in the optics and photonics caucus and starting to look in this because of what they're doing at that school and looking to advance high-paying jobs and looking to prepare workers for the future a future in this type of industry with great partnerships with colleges like that and with industry and that's why i believe it's so important for congress to support the optics and photonics industry and and invest in the growth of this industry it ultimately means expanding our nation's manufacturing output improving our national security all of these things that my colleagues has spoken about enhancing what we do with medical technology our computing capabilities that is what we can do with our advancement in this so i i think we can all agree more than ever we need new discovery we need new innovation and we know that it's just over the the horizon for us it's it's just over a bit of study a bit of research a bit of looking into it and the possibilities that that come with using what we see here it's exciting to me and i know it's exciting to a lot of others as well so as the co-chair of this caucus i just want to say that i couldn't be to be more excited um to help pave the way for america to be a leader in this field let's get to work i'm still searching around for the mute button after all this time you know you think you'd get used to it but i uh i do want to uh thank congressman mass not only for his leadership but you can see the passion that he brings to this and you know so many of us here in washington are looking for opportunities where we can find common ground and i certainly think uh this work together which i'm really looking forward to is a place where we'll really find common ground about moving forward uh and having a sense of national purpose around innovation so thanks for uh your leadership and for being here senior senator from arizona senator cinema unfortunately had a last-minute unavoidable conflict and so she's unable to join us this morning but she sends her best and passed along that she is thrilled uh to uh to participate in this bipartisan effort and uh and bring folks together around this innovation obviously she is um someone in the state that is doing a lot of great work here and she's obviously interested in boosting arizona's economy by helping arizona universities and businesses continue uh innovation in this space so i understand that uh senator daines is uh going to be joining us in a short while so uh i'll come back to uh introducing him but uh for now let me go to our other panelists i'd like to introduce dr bruce tromberg who is a leading researcher in the field of biophotonics and the director of the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering uh which is a mouthful nib ib within the national institute of health he is currently helping to lead the institute's 500 million dollar rapid acceleration of diagnostics innovation initiative to increase testing capacity and performance for the covet 19 pandemic doctor i can't thank you enough for being here and with that let me turn it over to you thank you congressman morelli and uh co-chairs congressman mast senators cinema and danes and my colleagues on the panel um it's truly an honor to participate in the optics and photonics caucus today um as congressman morelli said i'm the director of the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering or nibib at the nih we're the only nih institute dedicated exclusively to the development commercialization and clinical translation of engineering physical science and computational technologies in biology and medicine nabib was established by an act of congress 20 years ago and since then our bioengineering community has grown enormously in size and impact importantly when you look at many of the innovations we support what you'll find under the hood are advanced optics and photonics technologies powering cutting-edge methods discoveries and devices in biology and medicine this is the field of biophotonics a 70 billion dollar per year industry that spans from microscopes to endoscopes wearable sensors to surgical lasers prior to joining nih in january 2019 i spent about 30 years pioneering the development of biophotonics technologies as a professor of biomedical engineering and surgery and director of the beckmann laser institute and medical clinic at the university of california irvine just 13 months after joining nih i like many of you became intensely focused on the fast-moving cobit 19 crisis and began to work on ways nibid could help we launched a bold new program rad x rapid acceleration of diagnostics only five days after nih received generous support from the fourth congressional supplement our audacious goal was to drive an unprecedented expansion of covid testing technologies from concept to manufacturing a cycle that normally requires five to six years and do this within five to six months i knew that we had game changing optics and photonics technologies that were ready to jump from research labs to the marketplace but these methods needed to be combined with molecular assays and undergo intensive de-risking and validation prior to investment to do that we built radxx around a shark tank-like review process and our national point of care technology research network in just three months radex received more than 700 applications from companies and academic groups around the world only five months after launch radx supported companies who are obtaining regulatory approval and moving to market as of today we've invested more than 520 million dollars in 27 companies for manufacturing expansion these organizations produced 94 million new coveted tests just between september and december 2020 and more than 2.5 million tests per day are projected by march 2021. most of these are accessible technologies for screening and surveillance in point-of-care and at-home settings virtually all of these platforms both nucleic acid and rapid antigen tests depend on optics and photonics technologies to reveal the presence of an invisible virus one example is the first rapid home test to receive fda over-the-counter eua clearance this device made by illume packs in quantum dot reporters integrated optoelectronics miniature optics a solid-state source and detector and syncs via bluetooth with a smartphone this is a brief snapshot of how advances in biophotonics and new partnerships between government academia and the private sector are dramatically changing our world it's exciting to be part of this growing community of innovators working together to achieve our vision engineering the future of health for all americans thank you for your time and i look forward to the opportunity to answer questions thank you dr tromberg that's uh i'm not sure i understood everything you said but um clearly fascinating and uh so grateful for all the work that you're doing uh next i'm pleased to introduce our honorary co-chair who was the first member to commit to joining me in this endeavor over a year ago senator steve daines of montana uh the senator as i'm sure you all know his extensive public and private sector experience i'm delighted to have his partnership i understand he ran over from one meeting so i hope you've had a chance to catch your breath but with that let me introduce you senator danes hey thanks congressman well it's great we've officially launched the optics and photons caucus i guess it's only fitting that we're doing this virtually because the thing with the information the video more and what we're doing is being beamed directly to you by the innovation that comes from optics and photonics so as it should be i really want to thank you congressman morelli uh for your leadership and uh thank you as well as my fellow co-chair center cinema and uh and then as well as congressman mast for joining in leading this joint effort you know this growing field of optics and photonics is going to help support and create better paying jobs across the country it's a really important we think about the innovation ecosystem we're seeing developing around the world in places like china we've got to be able to go faster in order we can globally compete and continue to win in this really important sector this is really i think in many ways vital to the future of our economy this is the cutting edge technology that will improve the lives of the american people and we'll continue to maintain our nation's role as a leader in global early tech innovation and i'll tell you what you may not think about montana maybe is your number one place for photonics and optics innovation we tell you that we're leaving the charge out there my hometown of bozeman because people love the the fish and the hunt and the ski we can attract and retain some of the best talent in the world right there and we've got a great cluster of companies they're right on the cutting edge uh leading this innovation job in fact i'm gonna be visiting one of them on friday when i'm back home in montana so bottom line is this it's going to help us improve our defense capabilities communications energy healthcare precision agriculture manufacturing transportation it's a great list and i'm just honored to be a part of helping anyway facilitate lead and support uh this critical industry so look forward to work with you all thanks much back to you congressman morelli thank you so much senator and i think uh there's a lot of places around this country and get in involved in innovation and they may not be top of mind in terms of how we think about it but that's one of the things that we're all going to work to change is people's perceptions of of where centers of innovation are they're all over this country so i'm grateful for your leadership and for your help with this i'm now pleased excuse me to turn it over to ms adele radcliffe who's the director of industrial base analysis and sustainment ibas program within the department of defense office of industrial policy and her role as director she works to enable a modern industrial base that integrates traditional and emerging sectors to respond it will to national security requirements and challenges and i've had the privilege of working with ms radcliff on a number of projects including one near and dear to my heart in rochester new york so uh with that um uh director radcliffe thank you thanks congressman it's good to be here with you today uh thanks a lot for congressman master your sponsorship of the congress as well and senators as well thanks a lot to the national photonics initiative for the support of this effort i always enjoy my time in rochester getting to know the rich history of the optics community and the current industry members um it's that that time there that's really it you know uh solidified the my interest in understanding the importance of this critical technology i look forward to our ability to see each other again in person and congressman mass to get down to your indian river area as well you know it seems like uh when precision optics first started in the department of defense it was wedded to kind of boutique status whether that was you know for night vision goggles for on the night but as many of you've already noted on the on the front end of the conversation here it's broadly proliferated technology now uh it's in every weapon system that we have many of those uh manufacturers sit up there in that rochester area it just and it seems like that the commercial industry has an equally insatiable appetite for the technology as well whether it's uh helping to advance industry 4.0 for our small and medium manufacturers to help them be globally competitive uh medical devices that allow us to see where we previously were not detectable through otherwise intrusive uh technologies and methods uh the new um our cell phone that allows for uh you know uh facial scanning for my past codes and awesome selfie photos when i'm on vacation the applications of that drones and self-driving vehicles the applications of precision optics and that intersection of photonics for that data movement of that high end of data is endless opportunities but for the united states to fully harness the opportunity of the technology the technology and reap the dividends of the prosperity and the promise of it whether it's to hold the capabilities that we have in rochester and indian river and other areas and build back our industrial capabilities and capacities in this key technology and other technologies that we need for national security and economic growth we've got to have a skilled workforce that is rightly sized and that workforce has been under attack and manufacturing for decades and now with a surging focus on manufacturing we see fierce competition for that labor at a time when the career in technical education hasn't been valued we see a fierce competition for that for that space and we've got to begin to address this and to respond to that need and begin to catalyze things the the eye bass program that i run uh within the department of defense launched the national imperative for industrial skills and this was to work with defense communities to begin to regrow our necessary skills for national security we want to be able to promote the prestige of those workers coming into this exciting technology front accelerate them through their development pipelines and elevate them to world-class standards and to do that we want to in doing so we can now regrow our necessary skills like five axis or precision optics technicians needed for today and tomorrow um i'm excited about the opportunity of our soon to be awarded precision optics consortium and one of the first efforts we'll take on in that is this key issue of workforce for the technicians related to precision optics we'll look to expand on the efforts there at monroe community college that alexis i'm sure is going to talk about next and cascade those to other areas in our country so that our workforce becomes the competitive advantage for the united states in this technology and a global disruptor for us and so with that i look forward to working with you congressmans and senators on this important topic and others in the in the caucus and i'll turn it back over to you congressman morelli thank you very much thank you director at cliff uh for your incredible leadership in the space and we are all looking forward to to working with you in the years ahead next is my pleasure to introduce dr alexis vogt who is the endowed chair and professor of optics at monroe community college in my hometown of rochester new york uh they are and she is a leading educator in the field of optics and photonics and in addition to her work as an educator in this space she is also focused on growing mcc's optics and photonics program the only two year degree program uh training technicians for precision optics industry so we're delighted to have you and take it away dr vogt thank you congressman morelli and co-chairs congressman mast senator daines and senator cinema for your vision in establishing the optics and photonics caucus and thank you to the national photonics initiative for supporting the effort i'm thrilled there's a forward thinking group focused upon our industry on capitol hill our industry is responsible for remarkable innovations which improve our lives every day from personal safety with backup cameras and sensors in our cars to defense superiority and national security efforts to smartphones that soon will only need to be charged once a month as congressman morelli said i'm the professor and chair of optics at monroe community college here in rochester new york where we train precision optics and photonics technicians but before turning my passion to educating optics technicians i worked in the optics industry that currently supports one out of 14 households in monroe county where rochester is located our regional optics cluster is 168 years old and began when bausch lomb began their work in rochester in 1853 today the area is home to more than 120 optics photonics and imaging companies of all shapes and sizes these companies generate over three billion dollars in annual sales and provide meaningful employment for 17 000 people and their products and services are deemed essential to the medical aerospace semiconductor and defense industries it should come as no surprise that rochester is also known as the nation's center for optics education our region is responsible for having educated half of the optics phds currently working across the nation i'm proud to be one of them my alma mater the institute of optics at the university of rochester is the nation's longest standing program for studying optics rochester is also home to the center for imaging science and the future photon initiative at the rochester institute of technology and home to monroe community college where for 40 years we have been the only college in the world awarding associate degrees in precision optics over the past five years mcc's optics program has been supported by 1.7 million dollars from industry partners a 550 000 grant from the national science foundation and most recently a 4.4 million dollar grant from the department of defense office of naval research the finger lakes region of new york state where mcc resides has an estimated annual demand for more than 550 optics technicians our enrollment increased by 72 in the fall to an all-time high but that is not enough to fill even our local workforce need let alone the entire country much work remains both regionally and nationally we look forward to working with the optics and photonics clusters in arizona florida montana and all across the country to share our innovative training programs including our precision optics apprenticeship program and share our best practices for expanded enrollment retention and graduation of underrepresented populations as well as our strong alliances with the optics network pre-collegiate educators and industry partners our industry has well-paying in-demand jobs that are ensuring technological superiority for the department of defense and revolutionizing our world thank you very much thank you doctor for your uh leadership and expertise uh and uh thank you for being here today uh before we go on to our next uh item which is a uh a great video uh that was put together by nist but before i do that i would be remiss and i'm sure uh my colleague congressman mast will join me in thanking our staff who put this together i i know that i could not have done any of this without joe stiles on my staff who many of you interacted with and she just did a great job and libby tidwell in uh congressman mass office i know he would want to uh join me in thanking them for their uh um great contributions to uh to putting this together and obviously uh as well for uh the members of senator cinema and senator dane's staff with that we are also grateful to the national institute of standards and technology for contributing to this event today with technology demonstrations in this brief video zeesman ahmed a research chemist with nist shares two examples of how photonics is being used today to develop practical and potentially life-saving technology in the fields of health and infrastructure with that let's play the video have you ever wondered if it's possible to continuously measure someone's blood pressure or to continuously monitor the health of physical infrastructure in your hometown well thanks to embedded photonics technology that dream is closer to being a reality than ever before in the two videos you're going to see we show you how using photonics technology we can measure certain changes in the shape of an object due to mechanical forces nist scientists affectionately refer to this machine as the crushinator its job is to apply pressure to things in a controlled way this squishy pad of silicone being tested here is part of a new device that could help doctors monitor their patients blood pressure the silicone acts like the soft tissue in your wrist and the crushinator mimics the pressure of blood pumping through an artery thin optical fibers measure subtle changes in the pressure as it goes up and down in real time researchers are currently using this work to build a physical model of a human arm complete with a fake artery running through the silicone the model arm could then be used to design a new kind of blood pressure monitor that people could wear on their wrists like a watch in the second example where used distant engineers were interested in alternative ways for them to assess the mechanical properties of the concrete they've created in these examples what we're showing is that it's possible using embedded photonics technology to for engineers to have real-time information that tells them the quality of concrete they're creating and hopefully learn to adjust the recipe they're using to create the product that they desire hopefully eliminating waste or at least reducing it and then over the long term they can use the same sensors to monitor the health of the infrastructure they have created do do [Music] these are just two examples of how we're using photonics to solve real world problems at the national institute of standards and technology we are working on a host of other on-chips photonic technologies that can serve as sensors and standards these sensors and standards hopefully will put measurement standards directly into the hands of the users saving them not only money and time but hopefully spurring new innovations in both science and manufacturing that will help the us economy grow thank you uh so much that was fascinating see sean and the folks at nist we uh so much appreciate that um i do want to now close out our event with uh q a and i'm pleased to be joined by a dear friend long time friend we've worked together in rochester ed white who's the chairman of the national photonics initiative ed is a long time champion of optics and photonics research and a leader in this field and community and he even will indulge me occasionally when we're sitting together in the airport on a conversation about quantum physics so he's tried to educate me although i'm largely ineducable unfortunately but thank you to those who submitted questions in advance and we will start uh with those the ones that were uh submitted and hopefully get to a couple live questions as well as we have time before the uh we finish our time here today so um let me begin with a question that we received from ohio um and the question is what opportunities are there for significant uh involvement and this relates to the members of congress and the main goal of the caucus as i said is how members better understand the industry uh how well established it already is rather than thinking of it as uh science fiction or in the future it's it's science fact that's happening today um as well as the developments and potential for future success and growth so constituent engagement with members is critical to growing uh support and interest we know that so all of you who are on uh this uh and hear this message that are participating today the more that you talk to your members of congress your members of the united states senate and encourage them to uh to participate and really get involved with this that will really help us in our our goals and a part of the caucus moving forward will be briefings and events for members and their staff which is critical and these types of events will succeed when experts join the conversation and we'll look to industry for input and for their participation as we host events and briefings that video is a great example of knowing how we apply photonics and and optics uh to the incredible work that's uh that's being done and what the future brings so with that let me ask the next question my friend ed uh what do you see as the biggest barrier to the growth of optics and photonics technology uh in in the united states uh thank you congressman morelli and before i answer the question i just wanted to add my thanks to you and to the co-chairs congressman mast senators danes and cinema for sponsoring this caucus and leading and this this caucus we believe is going to be very effective in educating uh the congress members on the power and the capabilities of the important technologies in optics so thank you very much um relative to the question increasing the amount of technology in the us can be uh that can be deployed into the mainstream applications requires really a broad portfolio a broad r d portfolio it it also requires mainstream um talent and sufficient talent that can investigate develop and prove out the technological uh concepts you know funding research at academic institutions startups small and medium-sized companies large companies national labs is essential to increasing the r d portfolio we also as was said in the opening remarks we also must develop educational programs and training at all levels to ensure that the talent to advance important technologies and translate these technologies into products that improve our security our health and our overall quality of life so it distills down to um a resource portfolio that's well funded and talent um that's uh educated and trained that's a uh a great answer and obviously you're in a position to uh to know what uh what those uh barriers are uh i do have an email from participant from connecticut how will congress support optics development to position the united states as the leading country to commercialize optical based products and obviously this caucus will work to show i hope how historical historic investments in life-based technologies have led to great benefits in society and that future investment is critical to ensuring that america leads innovation on the global states once more and what we know is in recent years the amount of investment uh by federal research and federal research and development has continued to decline um we're at the lowest point since 1955 56 as a percentage of investment as a percentage of gdp uh and we're very concerned that global competitors are beginning to invest far more as a percentage of gdp than the united states is so i'm hopeful that this caucus the conversation not only about what we've done to date but what the what promise the future holds uh will help uh encourage members of congress to continue to invest more and more in this space and i want to make sure that they continue to invest in innovation generally but but more narrowly uh in optics and in photonics so we have another uh question and ed feel free to jump in on this from massachusetts how will congress support and focus on small tech businesses for high growth markets such as the new space economy and obviously you know i just answered as i did the previous question we want to see our local community succeed so business is large and small broad federal investment in r d can lead the way to a major shift in our nation's innovation capabilities but targeted efforts are uh key as well and i don't know ed if you wanted to add anything or any of the other panelists when i had anything on this i i would answer it in a very uh similar way congressman morelli new space is a great example of an area where optics and photonics technologies can play a large and important role you know companies of all sizes can contribute to the space ambitions of the government and private companies through imaging uh positioning communication computation and measurement in fact private interest into space can provide a great boost to in market for optics and photonics technologies so this is a really exciting area where i you know companies and small and large can play a large role and i hate to call on anybody but i i wonder director ed cliff do you have any additional thoughts on this uh as well in terms of the the size of companies and how we make sure everyone participates in this space yeah i think you and ed hit on it right that we have to have a coordinated approach on investment starting with that early research then we have to move into applied technology you know helping to bridge across from the art of possible into the art of practical we have to have that investment in manufacturing scale up in this country with that coordinated effort on workforce that we talked about then we have to help create the aggregated demand signal for how this technology can be used so that our investors here in the united states will invest in our companies and you know to help advance them and preserve and protect them for our use very good and i don't know if doctors uh tromberg or vote have anything additional you want to say in this space or just generally sure i i think this is really the backbone of the whole innovation entrepreneurial structure in the biomedical engineering and community which we really drew upon to be able to accomplish the the radix initiative so we've not only been able to support and sustain and grow that we've been able to take concepts all the way to manufacturing expansion which is something that nih typically has not done but we've done this in record time to meet an urgent national need so i think at the foundation if we don't have those small systems innovation entrepreneurial systems we'll never be able to exercise our muscle to be able to solve really hard complex problems quickly right and here's a question from virginia as a whole community in optics and photonics where do you see all optical trans transistor based processors in two to three decades and and probably if you can answer this question about what happens in two or three decades you might be in the wrong business well i'm i'm assuming that question is asking do i see all optical central processors um in the next 20 to 30 years as opposed to simply integrated with some electronic piece of an integrated circuit yeah yes and um uh you're right if i could predict the future like this um i would probably i'm probably in the wrong job um and it's difficult to to make a really accurate prediction but we can kind of use the recent past to kind of look forward to towards the future you know the the the field i work in is integrated photonics and the organization that i work for is aim photonics and many of you know that integrated photonics uses semiconductor fabrication pro and packaging processes to produce photonic integrated circuits this means we get the benefits of semiconductor fabrication you know we get the benefits of semiconductor fabrication in the uh optics and photonics um fields you know in the last five years uh integrated photonics has come so far and is much more accessible to research and product developers aim photonics along with a few other companies and institutes really have played a key role in increasing accessibility of this technology so improved accessibility at affordable prices has and will continue to propel advances in central processing design and efficiency and it seems like it's a safe bet although don't take my word and take it to the bank but it seems like it's a safe bet to look forward to having all optical processors in 20 to 30 years i mean we're accelerating the technology we're moving faster and as we continue to invest in these technologies we're going to make progress and otherwise if we don't we could find ourselves as customers to other countries and we certainly want to be in the lead in this area so i'm just making a note of what you said just uh 20 or 30 years from now i'll come back down yeah we'll come back and have coffee and talk about it uh yeah we will indeed so this question was directed to me but i'm going to punt on it are we adequately anticipating our workforce needs for this industry i'm going to call on if i can uh dr uh vote and also uh uh director radcliffe and and certainly dr tromberg and that if you have uh comments to make to it as well but are we adequately anticipating our workforce needs in this industry sure i would start by saying that in just in our area of rochester new york region we're looking at a need for 550 optics technicians every single year and we certainly can't support that ourselves that's just in the small finger lakes region of new york that does not include across the entire country and even around the world but we need thousands of jobs every single year in this industry because it's the industry that's driving our future and it's the direction that we're heading to this is how we're revolutionizing our world but if we don't have the staff the workforce to do the work of the technician so the technician by definition is the person who uses their hands to manufacture to test all the products and all of the innovation it's the person who typically has the bachelor's the masters of the phd who sits in front of the computer and is innovating for the future if we don't have technicians then the people who are designated to be the innovators have to do the work of the technician this is where we really far behind fall behind in other countries so this need in our nation is tremendous to have more technicians and it comes down to things like protecting our national security very good director radcliffe yeah i agree with alexis i think we are we have a good handle and are starting to define better that the requirements the demand side signal of what we need in terms of workforce whether it's precision optics technicians or some of the other more traditional based skilled technicians like cnc five axis what we don't have a good handle on is how do we close the gap between the erosion of that workforce development pipeline over decades of not valuing manufacturing in this country and we have to rethink how we're going to close that gap and and accelerate training programs compress their their time scale so that we um can flush them out quicker for industry we also have to expand our recruitment pipeline we have a whole generation here that has an opportunity to get interested in manufacturing and exciting uh efforts like precision optics and photonics where you have to be able to recruit those people into this sector versus letting them go to other sectors um we have some work on our hands but i think that um we understand that demand signal and now we can work backwards into that solution space with people like monroe that's great uh dr tromberg did you have anything to add on that uh question i i think the answers were right on spot on target and um we they're just tremendous opportunities in big need yeah um so uh and i got this in this selected this question just because it's about quantum and i always like to ask you questions about it since i you know in in another life i was a physicist just not in this life um but what role does optics and photonics play in the emerging technology areas such as quantum and again feel free others to join in well optics and photonics technologies are really important to many emerging technologies in some cases optics and photonics technologies are the enabling technology in other cases they're the primary technology you know regardless of the role enabling or primary optics and photonics are crucial in in in the field of quantum or quantum information science which includes quantum computing quantum sensing quantum communications optics and photonics is both an enabling and a primary technology for example quantum computing you know there are a few ways to build a quantum computer and people are doing it in companies are doing it in the us we can build a quantum computer that's photon based we can use trapped ions we can go super conducting and those are just three approaches that are uh aggressively being pursued today um all of these approaches use optics and photonics for the photon based um computers optics and photonics technologies are paramount by providing the qubits for the comp for the computer much like how transistors are the basis of a typical computer now for trapped ion computers lasers and modulators are the workhorses with lasers providing the means to induce you know cubic coupling for super conducting computers optics and photonics provides the means for input and output to the cryogenic environment that these computers operate in so quantum comm and one other point quantum communications is an emerging field in which optics and photonics is without a doubt the primary technology so optics and photonics technologies play a role in quantum information science in a very large way and whether it's computing communications or sensing this is the technology that's very important and i'm certainly happy to ask if that any panelists want to add to uh to that um i would i would just add that in in the biomedical area which uh as you know um healthcare is about 20 percent of the gdp and these are it really is a tremendous communication and informatics problem um and uh these advances will play a critical role in helping introduce efficiencies and accelerate knowledge that will save lives and help patients it's it's a long haul but it's important for us to be involved in this as soon as possible and i suspect that 20 percent of gdp number is only scheduled to rise as uh people in uh the baby boomer generation the significant numbers uh begin to age into uh not only early retirement but as they you know his lifespan continues that's going to be a big cohort of the population and there as you get older obviously we know you use more of the health care dollars so that's going to become more and more important i do have a question from florida how can undergraduate and graduate students get involved with promoting our advancements and academic levels of congress again you know from my perspective engagement with your members i often find when we're talking about some of these spaces and some of these technological advances that members of congress because they're dealing with so many different issues uh really don't have a current understanding of what's going on in this space so i would just encourage people to engage contact your member of congress and their district offices certainly talk to the staff because this staff really helps i think distill down what the agenda is going to be and what things members of congress need to really pay attention to so that would be uh really important um i had a question from montana i'm sorry that senator danes uh isn't uh with us i'm sure he'd want to answer but what photonics technologies do you consider strategic with international competition so again not just as it relates to montana but across the country what photonics technologies do you consider strategic with international uh competition uh ed do you want to take a first whack at that sure um well one of the ways to to look at this question is to look at a committee a government committee called syphia cyphus is the committee on foreign investment in the united states and the the u.s government defines critical technologies as areas as technologies controlled through u.s export so many of these technology areas are photonic technologies or at least enabled by photonic technologies you know some of the examples of photonic technologies that are considered critical by the us government include a wide array of lasers including those used for industrial manufacturing as and directed energy weapons also sensing technology including infrared sensors used for night vision technology and sensing instruments used in space you know many photonic materials are also seen as critical you know the new materials that are coming out for modulators in integrated photonics although we're early on and they haven't been necessarily designated but those are critical materials as new technologies emerge there will likely be additions to the list of critical technologies as as defined by the us government but this list can be used as a proxy for strategic technologies that we want to always be in a leadership role on we being the u.s any panelists want to uh add any thoughts to that question let me uh let me there's a question from new york which is similar to it in the sense that it asks do you see the united states as the current leader in this technology area of photonics and optics what countries are our biggest competitors and again uh ed if you want to start but i'd be happy to hear from everyone on what they see as the current leaders and and whether we're a current leader and who the competitors are in this space um well the us is leading in many optics and photonics technologies um that are important to national security and economic growth for sure but not every important technology while time passes other parts of the world are catching up and they're catching up quickly and and they might be behind now but they're but they're gaining and they're gaining on the us for example in the area of high intensity lasers the us has been a global leader in this technology for decades but recent investments by countries in europe and in china combined with an aging infrastructure in the u.s opens the door for us to lose that lead if we don't act and in important technologies where the u.s is losing ground or not leading investments in r d need to be increased so collaboration between government and industry academic organizations and public-private partnerships can be encouraged as a way to maintain and improve our position as a as a global leader um you know there are there's a lot of research a lot of development a lot of progress made outside of the u.s and we've got to run hard and fast to stay ahead in the race so it's not only where we are obviously but it's the trajectory of where we're going how in terms of the the biospace uh dr tronberg how do we how do we stack up relative to other countries there and where is our competition well i think it it follows the same general pattern and actually you've alluded to this in in terms of the fraction that we spend of gdp uh on on research and other countries have really noted our remarkable success and imitated what we used to do and have created national initiatives and of course structures in other countries are more top down so there are a number of biophotonics initiatives that have been led by several other countries around the world we haven't really put together i mean we have our national photonics initiative which is spectacular and the caucus and hopefully this can be a driver to create a more integrated and intensive approach for funding of these essential technologies and uh i would be curious uh uh director radcliffe do you have a perspective in terms of in the national security space how we rank and where we where we are relative to that yeah not necessarily in a one-through end priority but i was going to build off of ed's comment about accessibility and adoption yeah which you need both of those to help create a strong healthy ecosystem in any country if you want to lead if you look at the adoption side of where integrated photonics and not precision optics can you know are being adopted the industry 4.0 sector the united states small and medium manufacturers largely are lagging behind other countries that have a strong manufacturing focus and that strikes at the heart of global competitiveness and strategic need if we want to remain at the forefront of a strong manufacturing industrial base helping our smaller media manufacturers begin to adopt industry 4.0 which utilizes now these sensors and capabilities of photonics and integrated photonics and precision optics would help helps to maintain our echo vibrant ecosystem here um and congressman raleigh if i could add just one additional um uh point is that um if we look across the u.s um we we really are fortunate to have you know a significant base of companies that produce the lens systems the prism systems the precision assembly systems that enable great technology to be developed great new products to be launched and we want to continue to keep on looking at those in addition to the emerging technology so you know we couldn't be as successful as a country as we are without the technologies that exist today and are the workhorses um for a lot of the things we do you know behind me is um the a mars rover it's not the it's not the current one but it's curiosity but uh you know kodak had uh imagers on that rover and i heard you say in your introduction that um there's at least one company from rochester that has lenses um that are enabling the the uh the imaging systems on on the current rover so i just wanted to put in a pitch for the current technologies that exist today because clearly we couldn't we couldn't survive without them yeah no question um there's also a question uh from massachusetts what was is the importance of having government representation from four leading photonics industry regions and states when putting together the leadership of this caucus we thought it was really important um if you're going to have people out who are disciples of this the best place to go is where there is already an active uh successful cluster and so we're able to give testimony to our colleagues about the importance of this uh space in our local regions and that's why it was so important so um and it was kind of a natural in some respects i mean uh representative mast uh in florida there's significant uh optics and uh and photonics uh cluster certainly in arizona uh and uh uh well i'm sorry that senator cinema wasn't here to be able to give testimony to it she's clearly excited about it and talked about it in her comments and um senator daines as well who said people might not um appreciate uh and or think of montana as as a hotbed of innovation but they certainly are in this space so we thought there's nothing that um would work better than to have those of us who are already uh experiencing the growth in the sector um to be able to uh to do that and to uh really get a get a you know a way to get our staffs and people working together to try to promote this among other members um and with that as is often the case in the united states house of representatives all of a sudden a vote will pop up that you need to stop everything else that you're doing and get to the floor and as uh as fate would have it uh that's exactly what's happened here but uh so let me uh again thank uh our panelists i'm really so excited i think i hope this was informative to people and you've all had a chance to see now people who are experts in the field and really can talk about the importance of continuing to invest in this so i do want to thank uh dr bruce stromberg from nbib nibib you call it nabib or something is there a way to say that acronym or do you do the initials i don't know government is always interesting for acronyms i i usually say the engineering institute at nih okay i'm not sure that's a whole lot better but okay let me copy that but but dr uh thank you so much for what you do uh dr vogt thank you for all you do at mcc and and uh being out there as uh someone really talking about workforce needs and of course uh uh director adele radcliff who has been a leader in the space and continues to guard our economic and national security interests uh in your work so thank you and of course ed white thank you hopefully you won't be trapped in an airport anytime soon with me trying to describe uh quantum physics to me but uh you're a great friend and i appreciate your leadership in the space as well and with that i look forward to uh hopefully a a a long and continued engagement on this subject and thank you all for being here and thanks for everybody who joined us uh this afternoon thank you bye

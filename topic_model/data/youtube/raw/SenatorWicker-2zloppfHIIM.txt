and joining me now is Mississippi Senator Roger wicker he is the ranking Republican on the Senate armed services committee here's a quote from the state department they said that there are there were multiple antennas likely capable of collecting and geo-locating Communications so we started off the week with a lot of questions I know that you got some answers but it feels to me like those have raised additional questions where do you think we are right now well where we are right now is the president of the United States our commander-in-chief has just told the world this was not a major breach as you can see from previous people who've been on your channel this morning Democrat and Republican to a person we think this was a major breach and and I was very interested in what Ms Dalton was just saying uh in the run-up to this interview and and that is uh it was so much better that we didn't shoot it down in Alaska and that we waited until it got to South Carolina where the waters are better that raises the question would they do this again if that was such a wise decision with the decision of this Administration be to allow this surveillance balloon to go all over Alaska then into uh the airspace of our Ally and then enter in in the Northwest Rockies and and Traverse some of the most sensitive areas of the United States and only then we'll shoot it down is that that the signal that the administration is sending and and that those were some of the questions that were raised and frankly left completely unanswered in the classified briefing the senate had yesterday here's some other reaction from Senators after take you know after they had that briefing here's some takeaways listen here there's nothing in there that I learned that would have said that we shouldn't have shot it down when it was over Alaska everything I learned today confirms that the administration made the right decision as an Alaskan I am so angry I want to use other words but I'm not going to miss rarely it's rare that you get bipartisan consensus I know that Senator Murphy just said he thinks that they did the right thing and and you could listen to all of this evidence and perhaps come to that conclusion but there was a little detail that we learned from Brian Yannis that apparently some of the material that they have collected from the spycraft is English English writing you're on armed services what does that tell you if anything and the one thing about this that bothers me Dana is that things are told to us that they say are classified and then an hour or two later it becomes convenient to the administration to just release this to the American people which is what happened on that particular incident it raises the another question which we can get into later is uh why do they clap uh so many things that a few moments later there with everybody knowing but yes it is highly likely that some parts of this spy balloon and and the apparatus that goes with it were manufactured actually in the United States and this is something that I dealt with as chairman of the Commerce Committee and and Senator Reid and the SAS committee and I will be working on this in in the future we're trying to shut down Huawei it's harder to do but so many of the things that the Chinese have available to them are not subject to the correct export protocols and and frankly there's no reason why the Chinese Communist Party led by Xi Jinping who wants to dominate the Pacific should have anything made in the United States of America or anything with the English language on it all right well more questions we'll no doubt continue from this but I know that you're on top of it trying to get some answers Senator wicker thank you have a good weekend a lot more answers thank you so much

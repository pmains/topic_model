good afternoon welcome to ktoe's talk of the town this is the second chance we've had to talk with republican congressional candidate jim hagerdorn he is running in the first district and running might be uh literally what you're doing jim good to see you again thank you pete it's great to be here you tell me off air you're putting on 6 000 miles a month the crisscrossing the the first district which is really quite a large district area wise huge district across the state from wisconsin to south dakota and then iowa up about 80 miles here wonderful part of the state ag based of course mayo clinic so a lot going on here in southern minnesota and in what you just said interesting how diverse the district is in terms of agriculture big business when you talk about mayo when you talk about some of the ag businesses in mankato and in fairmont for example um so it's really quite an interesting and diverse district not as uh monochromatic as some people might might think well that's exactly right agriculture is the backbone of our economy here in southern minnesota and you know where i grew up on a farm there near truman and live in the in the blue earth area and and i got to tell you that's still what's on people's minds the people that live in rural minnesota are so dependent on agriculture we must make sure that we we sustain the family farming and our way of life now let me ask you we're this is running in early mid mid march uh and interesting time because you still have the endorsing convention coming up uh so today as we talk are we talking jim hagerdorn running against a couple of other republican candidates who also want the nomination or are we talking about you running against income and democrat tim walsh the way we've worked this campaign is we're trying to run a general election campaign pre-nomination and we do have a district convention coming up in albert lee on the fifth of april and we look forward to that but no i have two republican competitors and one democrat opponent tim walls has been my opponent from the beginning and that's where we're fixated on his record of big government is undermining and hurting this country it's hurting the people here in southern minnesota these big government ideas like obamacare cap and trade all the regulations dodd-frank driving up people's costs hurting people's disposable income and that's the message we're taking to the people i i want to ask you uh now you say about disposable income minnesota has been a little bit has performed better than the nation as a whole in terms of income and employment uh you still think that's that is an issue oh it's a huge issue and just look what happened this last year with obamacare implementation we had people i i stood in front of tim walsh's district office and brought constituents of his who had had their prices dramatically increased both premiums and deductibles other people got their their insurance canceled outright and had to go find other insurance that cost them more that's disposable income that's been eaten into look at the energy situation when tim walls became a congressman in 2006 and then and then president obama came into office the price of gasoline was down there under two bucks now it's been up there at a 350 four dollar range for most of that time think of the money that people could have had if they could have saved a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars a year over the last four or five or six years since congressman walls has been in office that's you know that's that's money out of their pocket that they could have used for other things and they got no added value out of that to be a contrarian here on the price of gas uh it was down to uh buck 99 i think is when we bottomed out but that also corresponded to a incredible recession and as we recover from that wouldn't you expect gas prices to increase along with some other prices i understand that but i think it's these policies these anti-fossil fuel policies coming out of washington coming out of the epa the politics of global warming that congressman walls is tied to and you know that's that's going to put upward pressure on the price of energy not downward pressure we put out a press release and we worked very hard in this campaign to talk about the energy issue and i think we need drilling on on public lands we need more oil and gas drilling we need to sustain the coal industry not bankrupt it like the congressman is with his epa regulations that he supports he just voted on that last week and we need renewables and everything else but that puts downward pressure on the price of energy instead of this inflationary thing that's coming out of washington drilling on public lands i heard that phrase in there for example in yellowstone uh where there was probably some oil underneath there uh would you drill in yellowstone i think i think we'll stick let's start with alaska let's start with alaska which is very oil rich and uh oil and gas rich and we we can be energy independent in this country if we'll just go out and get the resources that god gave us we could be energy independent within six or seven to ten years and you know the united states has more fossil fuel energy resources than any other country on earth we just need new leadership in washington to go out there and get it and do it in a safe way you you mentioned global warming which has become kind of a touchstone uh issue um where do you put yourself are you a global warming denier is that is that where you are on the spectrum or i'm i'm an american realist and i believe that we shouldn't transform the united states economy over uh concepts that maybe 50 or 100 years from now we can make some sort of marginal change to me that this is an open-ended question but i just believe that at this point in time let's let's put it this way the politics of global warming that the congressman supports is going to make no no real change to the climate or anything else and of course they change the argument every time they want the bottom line is that his policies are costing us jobs costing us manufacturing driving up people's costs and for again no added value people are still getting the same mileage uh for the price of gasoline whether it's two bucks or four bucks or whatever and we need to start getting back to an energy independent united states the uh issue of energy independence with what's happened up in north dakota we do have we have decreased our imports into this country so we've moved somewhat toward uh a more balanced situation at least that's true but all that's on pretty much private lands and the federal government is standing in the way of doing what's on public lands and uh you know one thing that brings up in in north dakota with the boom up there it's great but we need more pipeline we need infrastructure to be able to use these resources properly more infrastructure more pipelines more distribution points more refineries and i think we've seen some of the problems in the propane industry recently where we don't have the pipelines in place we don't have the distribution points and other things and it led to short spot shortages it led to bottlenecks and it's driven up the price in people it's really hurt them in in terms of getting more refineries as i understand it that's just there's there's a reluctance on the part of the uh oil industry to build more refineries is that because of the regulations is that because of lack of incentives what what's your opinion on and why they're reluctant to build those it's very costly to go through the regulatory process and it's and it's frustrating to do that and what you see is mostly they take the refineries that are in play and they try to keep expanding and making them bigger because they've already got the permission to build at that at that location so now i i think we need more sensible regulatory policies out of washington in my estimation the epa under president obama is out of control it's tim walls favorite agency it's driving up people's costs it's limiting uh manufacturing and everything it's hurting the country and i believe actually the congress should take back its regulatory authority from the epa and start issuing those regulations themselves that would be a first step in my book would you clarify that a little bit congress issuing environmental protection regulations i mean doesn't that get to be really i mean you might have something totally different in california from what you have in minnesota which might be totally different from what you have in kansas well that's true i think most of these things should be sent back to the states and let them let them handle it but in the case of what i'm talking about we'd make a full circle the congress created the epa the congress gave away its regulatory authority to the agency and i think they're so out of control that the congress should bring it back and actually make an example out of them is that they're not going to let them for instance continue to regulate clean air statutes decades later and come up with ideas that we should bankrupt the coal industry i mean it's it's just ridiculous all right i want to move on because there are other uh issues that i do want to talk about you mentioned uh and i know this is a major issue that republicans are running on the affordable care act or obamacare as you prefer to call it um what bothers me is that there the emphasis on is on repeal and just to talk about one issue in particular uh coverage for children up to age 26 was a quite a boon uh it actually affected me personally i had a daughter who was on it until she was 26 when she couldn't get insurance or was very prohibitive for her to get insurance do you repeal everything i don't hear anything that we're going to replace it with to uh for example the pre-existing condition that affects so many people in this country ties them to a job that they currently have seems to be suppressing economic mobility sure well you can go back to when i announced for congress and then the three or four actually about five press releases i put on out on the affordable care act obamacare and we always talk about private sector free market reforms and uh yeah i agree with you that sometimes that gets lost but um we had some good ideas even 10 12 years ago and i can't totally blame the democrats for passing obamacare the republicans had control of the house the senate and the white house and we left a void we didn't do our job and that's what teaches me when you go to washington you stand for principle you fight for what you believe and then you do the people's business and you let them decide whether you should stay or go after that but as far as reforms in in the healthcare area yeah i believe in in competition across state lines i believe in having private sector pools for people that have pre-existing conditions so they don't go broke if there's any subsidy at all from the government it would be there to keep the private sector in business in order to make that happen we need expanded use of health savings accounts so people can hold their own money so they would do their own shopping for for doctors and hospital visits and then they'd be able to move towards catastrophic coverage we need things like i think we need tort reform to try to keep again downward pressure on the cost of medicine those are those oh and lastly i think this is really important tying the tax benefits to individuals so people have portable benefits and they can go from job to job and keep their health care or keep it in times of unemployment or other you know other ways when they're not not working what about the earned income tax credit that seems to have been a a boon to uh uh working poor people uh some republicans seem to uh like that idea and maybe focusing uh in that area where do you stand on that the earned income had tax credit i believe was something put together even under the reagan administration or at least certainly expanded there there are some um good ideas or reasons for it but i think it's been misused and and become a crutch it's almost become a welfare payment i don't mean that in a derogatory way i think just people be come to depend on depend on it and uh i think you know we need reforms and all all sorts of entitlements but you're bringing up a good point i believe in massive tax reform we have to have broad-based tax reform where we get back to people holding their own money uh and so they can spend it the way they think rather than the way the bureaucrats and politicians do in washington that's part of my ideas of taking the power from washington bringing it back to the states and the people i know that's not exactly what we're talking about here with the earned on income tax credit but across the board we have to have new ideas and new thinking as far as entitlement programs and how we help families transition from being dependent on government to being dependent on themselves personal responsibility we're talking with jim hager and if you're just joining us uh and we're about two thirds of the way through our interview jim is from southern minnesota of course his father was a uh congressman uh in the 1970s uh and uh he is running for the republican nomination to to run against tim walls um so you're as you as you uh go after uh tim walls a democrat uh i'm hearing you say uh you attack him on on health care you attack him on uh what you perceive as is over regulation by the environmental protocol environmental protection agency getting back to agriculture he's been on the agriculture committee but you don't think he's done an effective job there well i'm giving i'll give him his credit for voting for the farm bill being on the committee certainly uh he's the congressman so he has some advantages there but i think to be a friend of the farmer it has to go beyond that there are lots of things that are happening that are driving up farmers costs harassing them hurting hurting the farmer obamacare obviously is that we have these epa regulations we have things like dodd-frank which is obamacare for banks and it's it's limiting capital to ag people ag-based uh people in that industry especially young farmers and so i i don't think that you can be for these big government programs that are going you know there's another cap and trade tim walls voted for that that would slap a five percent tax on the average farm operation that's not being pro farmer and so when we get past the farm bill we get past some of these uh these these types of things we end up in a position where where congressman walls and i have a very stark contrast in regard to dodd-frank and the banking regulations uh i want to get a little more on your take on that because there was so much anger at the big banks after the great recession um where they got a lot of the blame for uh uh causing that uh with their um you know questionable investments and amounted to billions and billions did dodd-frank in your opinion uh not target the big banks enough and too much targeting the small community banks how do you how do you look at that in the end the regulations that are being placed on the financial industry out of washington are hurting the the smaller banks the regional and the rural banks and we've been told here that if if you have a smaller bank of 350 million or less you're probably going to be eating up or go out of business they can't afford the regulations that the big big banks game and you know look too big to fail in my estimation we that was a mistake now we've made the big banks too too big to fail and we've we've made the problem worse so would you like to go after the big banks and break them up maybe uh so first thing the first thing i like to do is have policies that that allow the smaller banks to function and thrive and grow and then i think the first step to that is is repeal of dodd-frank uh you know there were lots of reasons that dodd-frank was was bad policy and we're seeing it play out here in southern minnesota okay so um what other uh we've got uh the uh healthcare uh epa regulation uh um the um uh banking reform that you think uh kind of targeted the wrong people any other uh points that you want to get across today well the congressman's the most liberal fellow that's ever talking about jim walsh yeah he's the most liberal congressman in the history of southern minnesota and he's voted for all the big government things uh you know there are other areas that we talk we don't talk about much but even on firearms he says he's a friend of the gun owner but hey after the connecticut shootings tim walsh chastised the nra for saying that we should have people in the schools who would be armed and trained to maybe prevent such things or to cut them short and then he said he was open to the obama biden feinstein pelosi gun control bill and i said just for being open to gun control we should be open to kicking him out of office so you know we we pretty much disagree on most everything when he when tim walsh came into office in 2006 he had good intentions and he said some things that i agreed with the republicans in washington had spent too much money the republicans were not doing their job on immigration but since then the record is the congressman and and this big obama walls type liberalism has run up a debt of you know eight nine trillion dollars since then so i mean he's part of the problem and yet he still blames the republicans at least i'm i'm honest enough to blow both they blame both sides when they screw up uh we mentioned this in our our first conversation that we had on this program uh talk of the town here and this is uh we're just about at the end here jim but um if uh if you do not get the endorsement of the republican party do you take it to uh a primary oh no no i i trust the the activists and the people that do the work in the party to make the decision i've always been part of that process something i respect and so we're just happy to be running we're having a lot of fun taking our message directly directly to the people and pete it's always a pleasure to see you jim hagerdorn is with us today on ktoe's talk of the town he's running for congress in the first district of minnesota that is today's edition of talk of the town

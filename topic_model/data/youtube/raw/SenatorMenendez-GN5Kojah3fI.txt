[Music] this hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will come to order assistant secretary Don freed Ambassador reeker thank you for appearing before us today to talk about United States policy and the caucuses I would just simply note uh that our Republican colleagues are having a caucus or the ranking member is attending and hopefully he will be able to be here later and he has given his consent for us to proceed so the absence of members on the other side is not an indication of their lack of interest in this they're very interested but they have a caucus this region is an ancient Crossroads with deep geopolitical importance as a bridge between the west and the Heart of Asia too often dictators with Imperial aspirations have victimized those living in the South caucuses from russian-backed aggression in abkhazia or south of Seda to Turkish supported azerbaijani aggression against Armenia and their disregard for human life has been clear in 2020 azerbaijan's War uprooted close to 100 000 Armenians from their homes in nagano-karaba 6 500 people died today Armenians in nagano-karabala land they know as artsoc still face an acute humanitarian crisis including threats of ethnic cleansing and chronic shortages of water energy health care and food that's why I've pushed for more humanitarian assistance to help the victims both in armenium and nagorno-karaba because the U.S humanitarian response has been in my view insufficient so today I want to hear from you about what more we can do and could be helping these affected areas but incredibly it's not just that the United States is failing to meet these humanitarian needs we're still sending security assistance to Azerbaijan how on Earth can the United States justify sending any kind of support security or otherwise to a regime in Baku it's inexcusable I personally think it's morally repugnant and it makes a mockery of the freedom support Act section 907 of this act is meant to ban security assistance to Azerbaijan until Azerbaijan is quote taking demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and other offensive uses of force against Armenia and nagana Karma and yet the Department of State has waived section 907 over and over again it requested six hundred thousand for fiscal year 22 to provide Azerbaijan with International military Education and Training a program meant to quote provide a professional military education to countries selected by the Secretary of State suffice you to say that I'm strongly opposed to having any Aid go to a fighting force known for war crimes and aggression against a neighbor State and the Department greenlit Security assistance to the regime in Baku just months before it invaded Armenia in September months before a video called azerbaijani forces killing unarmed Armenian soldiers in Cold Blood months before reports surface of azerbaijani soldiers sexually assaulting and mutilating an Armenian female Soldier the GAO report I commissioned to get to the bottom of this found both the Department of State and Department of Defense failed to meet statutory reporting requirements to Congress on this issue I'd like you to explain why it simply makes no sense to say that the United States assistance and training has not impacted azerbaijan's military balance with Armenia so I want you to give us all the details Congress has asked for so we can assess any assistance the U.S provides to Baku and finally I want to be clear I still have hopes for a lasting peace in the region I know secretary blinken hosted Armenian and azerbaijani foreign ministers here in Washington last week I welcome senior uh senior level U.S engagement in this region the lack of attention to the caucuses over successive Administration has only benefited Russia's interests so I appreciate this new approach but I hope to hear from you about what more we could be doing for peace in the caucuses and specifically following the recent attack on Armenia I also remain skeptical that authoritarians in Baku or Moscow or turkey for that matter will agree to let the Armenian people choose their own destiny and it's not just Armenia but Georgia as well this is a nation with so much potential and yet today we see intimidation of Independent Media arrests of opposition leaders and continued efforts to block the very Democratic reforms Georgia needs to advance on its Euro Atlantic path the United States must remain engaged to support the Democratic development of Georgia during these tenuous period and I look forward to hearing from the witnesses about these efforts the people of this region don't want to live under the threat of violence they don't want autocratic rule imposed on them by the barrel of a gun no one wants to live that way not you not me not the Armenian people not the people of nagano-karaba they deserve to live in peace they deserve freedom and security and that means ensuring that a peace deal does not lead to ethnic cleansing for The Armenian people of nagano-karabah it means tackling the needs of the humanitarian crisis there it means holding a accountable those who order and carry out the violence who's seen in this region so I look forward to hearing from you today about where things stand with the administration's efforts to help facilitate a peace process and address these issues one Senator Richard rise

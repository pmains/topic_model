thank you and first of all me just say you Thank You chair and the ranking member for holding this hearing really appreciate that so let me start with Equifax and some of the concerns I have I'm from Nevada there's about 3 million people there and of the three million people 1.3 million were impacted by this breach in fact it received over four dozen letters let me just give you an example of one of them I have a woman in Karlin Shu who wrote no citizen has a say in the reporting practices of businesses to credit bureaus I did not choose Equifax to store my information nor did my husband or any of our children yet it is there and clearly Equifax did not do enough to protect our information so a couple of questions to start with and I want to drill down into the data that is collected because I think part of this is the data collection and we should be looking at that Equifax my understanding of the breach of the 145 million consumers the the data that was collected was names of those consumers Social Security numbers addresses birth dates driver's license numbers and credit card information is that true yes or no and in some cases yes some cases no what other data do you collect on consumers besides the the data that I just identified we have the pieces of the and there was affected only included most of the data included social security numbers name date of birth and address that's it what other data do you collect other than what I just yeah we have a so I'm gonna ask for the record we'll submit that if Equifax could provide me with that question that would be very helpful because I'm curious does Yahoo collect driver's license numbers not to my knowledge okay so I think that's helpful in this discussion because to me the the data breach that happened at Equifax is egregious it happens all the time we're all getting pinged government's getting pained companies are getting pained we've heard heard it I think from what I've heard from miss Mayer cybersecurity is a global challenge we're always all getting pinged it is incumbent upon all of us including the private sector to not only have the top line security sophisticated security always evolving with it always ensuring that you're protecting that data and when you fail to do that then yes you should be held accountable and the enforcement should be swift and consumers should be notified and there should be restitution for those consumers but we haven't had the discussion on the data to me that's what this is about because quite frankly even those individuals that you work with now and those consumers that had credit locks and credit freezes their data was still breached correct right so it doesn't matter because that's what they're gonna go after is that so so social security number and I see mr. Wilkinson you're nodding yes isn't that correct yes so shouldn't consumers be the ones to say I want to opt-in or opt-out when it comes to the data that I am sharing with you don't you agree well this is part of the conch the way the economy works I mean when you when you when the consumer goes and the consumer doesn't have a choice sir the consumer does not have a choice on the data that you're collecting that's what I hear from my consumers that's what I hear all the time I know it and quite frankly the credit reports that I get as a consumer do not tell me all the data that you're collecting on me isn't that true the credit report collection the trade lines that we have them do that's true isn't it and then let me just say I was Attorney General for eight years of state of Nevada identity theft in the state of Nevada and across this country is through the roof and everyday dealt with somebody whose identity was stolen and what is so egregious about what you have done is now for the rest of their lives the woman in Carlin and all of the people that I hear from Nevada of the 1.3 million people whose identities were stolen they are going to have to clear their record for the rest of their lives and what does that mean that means that somebody's gonna buy a boat in their name a house in their name people gonna commit crimes in their name and believe me as a prosecutor I've seen it so they're spending the rest of their lives clearing their record and their good name and that's why this is so egregious and I think you have an obligation not only to look at the data that you're collecting but make sure you're protecting it and if there is a breach you're doing everything you can to remediate bring restitution to those individuals whose whose information is stolen so let me talk to you because I've got a short period of time mr. Wilkinson you talked about the data and so security numbers and the idea that now we have to look at a different way of identifying the PII I'm very curious if you have anything specific on what we should be doing when we're looking at that data and PII that is shared and collected well the first thing to know it has been noted a few times which is in the case of these breaches in the case of this most recent breach 145 million items of personal information was leaked when you combine this with other breaches that occurred and you know there's a list of breaches that we could cite we're getting very close to all of the personal information in the United States has already been breached in some way so of course the question applies which is what are we trying to protect at this point in the case of some of the financial card breaches like the target breach from several years ago or three years ago that we actually testified my company testified on behalf of the requester appear at that time I think there's a good point to compare and contrast between what's happened with some of those breaches and in this case and that is the financial payment system is reasonably resilient in that case despite the fact that it was it was a burden for consumers the ability for consumers to have a new card reissued have that fraud remediated and be back in business the ability to do commerce is relatively well known and relatively resilient in addition the liability largely fell to the financial institutions the issuers of those financial cards credit cards debit cards so I think looking to some examples like what we see in financial payments ecosystem is an example of a more resilient system than we have in in this form of identity today but our identities are out there so I continue to reinforce that our position is that we would we believe that a more resilient identity framework needs to needs to be brought forward there's several examples I cited and I'm running out of time and I know my time is up but let me just say this I agree with your identities are out there some of us are it's too late but to our kids it's not too late and we've got to look to the future and protecting their information as well so it is something that to me we it's not static we've got to continue to figure out how we address this issue if we're going to talk about digital identities or the government coming up with something different but I do agree with you that there should be that public-private partnership we've got to figure this out for the benefit of those people that we're taking their data and they have no choice they have no choice that that companies are taking their personal information they're monetizing it and then they get stuck for the rest of their lives dealing with the results of a breach so thank you

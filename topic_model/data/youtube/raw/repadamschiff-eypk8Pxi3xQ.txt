joining us now is someone who has been Nancy Pelosi's leadership firsthand who has seen it and been there California congressman Adam Schiff chair of the house intelligence committee Congressman it is good to have you thank you for being here tonight please do most of his talking because I am really having a hard time but let me first start um you had a front row seat to the Pelosi era and I wonder from someone high up in leadership what did it look like from the front row what was it like to be a democratic caucus member under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi I think all of us working with her working around her had the sense uh that we are working with the greatest speaker the country's probably ever had uh someone of immense Talent some of someone of historic proportion uh what she was able to do with the slimmest of margins was only possible because she she combined so many different skills she knows the members supremely well she knows what they want conversely she knows what they actually need she knows their districts she understands the legislative issues she's a brilliant tactician she knows how to work the members on both sides of the Capitol she knows how to leverage uh even being in the minority uh and she got so much when we were in the minority often to the the anxiety of the Republican majority that they were outplayed by Speaker Pelosi now you might find that somebody who has some of those skills you you rarely find in a generation anyone who has all of them and you have never found I think of History someone who had them in such great abundance so all of us around her recognize that we were in the presence of greatness you know I will say as someone who's had the privilege of interviewing her before you always knew that you had limited time because she had an extraordinary calendar and it wasn't just you know legislative meetings these were constituent funerals or baby showers I mean this is someone who really understood the poly part of politics the humanity she was there at critical moments in her constituents lives and I think that that's part of the speakership that it hasn't been reported on as much the degree to which it was really on the road doing the damn thing all the time but she also had the ability to be firm right I mean I think that's the other part she was unstinting when she didn't like something that one of her own caucus members had presented this is one a a mom who was unafraid to um I won't say spare she didn't spare the raw I don't want to bring but you know she was tough right did you did you ever were you ever a victim of that toughness oh I saw her toughness all the time um and I remember I could tell you a funny story when my daughter was I think only about three or four years old uh I took her to the Capitol and at that time Nancy Pelosi was our Whip and I introduced her to Nancy Pelosi and I said to my daughter Alexa this is Nancy Pelosi she's our whip if you don't do what she wants she has a whip and and Nancy got down on her knees at the level of my daughter and said no tell her that don't tell her that and she took my daughter's hands and said it's a candy whip it's a candy Whip and I I and I thought to myself it is not a candy wheel um she could be really tough as Donald Trump found out as anyone who's ever tried to Cross or found out uh and and most importantly she is and and has been utterly tenacious uh in defending our democracy at its most vulnerable hour and and tenacious and defending her constituents in California and people all around the country and particularly children who are her real love and passion Congressman you know as as Nancy Pelosi exits the her leadership role she's staying in Congress but as Kevin McCarthy appears poised to take up the gavel and Republicans are going to be in control of Congress and they've outlined their priorities and I would put that in quotes their priorities is largely um you know the fabrication of conspiracy theories what do you how are you thinking about the next two years ahead what can Democrats do how should house Democrats be thinking of their power in this moment well you know one of the reasons I was really hoping one of the many reasons I was hoping that uh speaker Pelosi would stay on as our leader is it would have been the greatest mismatch in talent and intellect and history uh Nancy Pelosi versus Kevin McCarthy um look you know it's important for the country that the work the business of the country get done in the next two years uh President Biden I think made a very gracious statement uh to Kevin McCarthy urging that we work productively they don't seem interested in that now as you said you know Kevin McCarthy has promised the Marjory Taylor greens of the world that no he's going to pursue these q a crazy conspiracy theories investigate Nancy Pelosi for what uh for having a an insurrections crowd hunted to try to kill her but you know sadly it will be uh for Kevin McCarthy uh the lowest common denominator of their caucus he is a very weak leader in in every sense of that term meaning he doesn't have a stronghold in his caucus he doesn't have a a really he doesn't have an ideology except his own advancement and that's not much of of a kind of cohesion to hold together his caucus so um you know sadly I think it's going to be Chaos on their side of the aisle and it's a tragedy for the country because you know we need to deal with inflation we deal to deal with with changing climate we need to deal with health care and so many other issues and we need need a functional government congressman Adam Schiff of California thank you for making the time and sharing with us my now favorite Nancy Pelosi line about a candy whip Congressman thanks for your time thanks for joining us tonight

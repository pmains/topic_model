with nancy i'll turn it over to you thank you thank you congressman and charlie i'll reiterate the same the same message i want to thank you for your leadership in the bipartisan nature of this bill this is not the first time that charlie and i have worked together on legislation we've done it uh multiple times now this year and it's a rare sighting in congress especially when we're just so divided and our nation is divided and this is one small way that we can make a big difference in bringing people together and i'll tell you my office has received calls from both progressives on the on the west coast and conservatives on the east coast about this issue and they're all in agreement that this is something that they care about it's an issue that many americans care about and this is not a republican or democrat issue this is an american issue this is a human rights issue and i want to thank britney spears too for her courage when she had her hearing and got to the microphone and told her story this is a woman who's been working almost every year that she's been in a conservatorship and the abuses that she detailed within her conservatorship and there have been abuses in these situations long before she ever topped the charts but what she had an opportunity to do is bring to light to shine a light on those abuses with everyday americans and her situation is a nightmare and if it can happen to britney spears it can happen to anyone in this country there are approximately 1.3 million people in conservatorships we know that on the onset they're meant to be to do uh to do good and not do harm but in some cases like in her case and many others across the country abuses do happen the system is not perfect and this is one small step in the right to in the right direction to work together and to do a better job for those individuals and conservatorships and one of the the stories that i heard when she was detailing the horrors of her conservatorship and i'm a young uh i'm a mom of two young kids i'm a single mom but the iud they made her place inside her body that's a human rights abuse those are things that we see going on in communist china those are not things we should be seeing here in the united states and to allow individuals who are in abusive conservatorships what they believe to be abusive to allow them the right simply the right to petition the court and petition a judge to have an individual who is in charge of their conservatorship a public guardian um to that has absolutely no conflict of interest financial or otherwise to give them that basic right to give them that opportunity to improve their situation and and she's just one of countless others that are in this system and that are long forgotten and we don't want to forget these individuals they are humans they have rights just like everybody else and really that's something today what this is all about and i want to thank uh congressman chris for his for his leadership once again and working together at a time when so few people really do and i'm uh it's just tremendous to be a partist and then for the individuals who are making statements today after us i want to thank you too for your for your courage to come out publicly and tell your stories and your experiences to educate all of us on what's really truly going on in conservatorships in the united states thank you

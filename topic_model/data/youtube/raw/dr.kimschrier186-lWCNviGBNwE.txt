I'm Kim Schrier and I approve this message. This is Matt Larkin, and he opposes the right
to choose even in cases of rape or incest. "I don't believe in the exceptions for rape
and incest or things like that." Larkin even wants to ban abortion nationally,
overturning protections here in Washington State. "I can see a strong conservative Congress
putting forward that vote to ban it nationally." An extreme ban on abortion. That's what Matt Larkin supports. And that's why we can't send him to Congress.

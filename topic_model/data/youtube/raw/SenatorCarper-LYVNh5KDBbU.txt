mr. president the fact we recognize please let me just start off by saying to senator Feinstein six years ago you along with the susan collins and joe lieberman jay rockefeller others really started leading the effort to put in place comprehensive cybersecurity legislation and offered the first comprehensive bill especially dealing with information sharing we had vocht in that late 2012 came up short and started all over again and the the last Congress be shown great leadership right from the start and I just want to thank you and I want to thank you been joined by Senator burr on the the floor the manager of the manipulated chair of the committee I want to thank you for for cooperating with with us and with with others to make sure that we have not just a good bill but a really good bill that addresses I think effectively one of the greatest challenges that we face today in this and his country virus the I've heard senator Feinstein see this time again I'll just say it today I've companies don't want to share information with a federal gum but they don't have to it's an elective in some cases they can form their own groups and then we call my socks but they've informed their own groups and share information with one another they don't have to share information on attacks with with the federal government that can share it with other peers if they they wish to the but if they do share with the federal government with a couple narrow exceptions we ask that it be shared with the Department of Homeland Security why the Department of Homeland Security because the Department of Homeland Security is set up in large part to provide a privacy scrub they have will have next month the ability when these threat indicators come through reported by other businesses across the country come through the portal at DHS DHS has the ability in real time in real time to be able to scrub that information to remove from it personally identifiable information that should not be shared with other federal agencies and like that bingo we're off to the races it is a smart compromise and so when I'm really pleased and grateful for the ability to work it out with senators burst into Feinstein and their staff want to thank the staffs well they're both their staffs and ours as well the other other preachers we literally took legislation out of the Department of Homeland Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and it's been appended I think it's final two of the managers amendment i think the entire title to the managers amendment is legislation that Senator Johnson and I and others worked on we are grateful for that one piece of it is something called Einstein not to be confused with the renowned scientist Albert Einstein but we have something called Einstein one Einstein to and Einstein three what do they mean and what this legislation does is it means that we're going to use these tools we'd continue update and modernize these tools to number one record intrusions number to be able to detect bad stuff coming coming through into the federal government and number three blackett block it and that we're going to make sure that it's not just something that powers that work on a piece of paper but that they are actually actually we require the federal agencies a hundred percent of the federal agencies not fifty percent not twenty-five percent a hundred percent of the federal agencies to use these who's new these new tools we've also included that legislation some legislation that Senator Johnson I worked on that it would make better ensure that we use tools including in encryption and and double double the number of well like processes that we have available to us to to better protect our information and the the last thing that i would that would mention senator collins who used to be a leader on was our chair of the Homeland Security Committee for a number of years she had a number of our colleagues including senator Mikulski I think senator McCaskill others have worked on legislation that we add to all of what we reported out of the committee and together it is a very robust defender of of our dot gov domain and can be used to help those outside the federal government as as well I want to go back to the last Congress Tom Coburn who's since left us he and I work together to do three things to really strengthen the Department of Homeland Security to do which job as a kid going up mr. president I remember seeing like ads in our like a magazine about some guy at the beach cartoons so I'm glad to beach kicking sand on a smaller guy and the smaller guy in this case would have been Department of Homeland Security with respect their ability to really provide robust defense against cyber attacks and and if I could use that cartoon is in analogy five six years ago the Department of Homeland Security was 98-pound weakling and it is no weakling anymore it is no weakling anymore legislation dr. cold and I authored passed here in the Congress to one say the cyber ops center third partner home security is real we're standing up we're making it real and robust number to the federal information security management acted for years was just a paperwork exercising and not it was like once in a year check to make sure that that our cyber defenses were secure we're transferring that into a 24-7 robust round-the-clock op operation by modifying legislation improving legislation called fisma and we also in that same legislation make it clear what OMB job is we make clear what the job of the Department of Homeland Security is and finally for years the department homeland security's hide cyber warriors train cyber wars and just when they get to be really good they get hard away they get hard way because they can't play they can't retain them couldn't pay them can provide retainment retain retention bonuses couldn't provide hiring bonuses we need to make sure we got some of the best cyber wars in the world working in the department of homeland security and now DHS has that authority and they were able to hire those are those people put all this together folks and what we've done is we have moved them needle with a passage of this legislation we will move the needle and we need to do that it's going to be some discussion later on on amendments there's a couple of them that are for me especially troubling senator Feinstein has mentioned a couple I suspect senator burr as well and we'll look at them as we go go through but a couple of them are really a set this legislation back and I'll be very strong in in opposing them having said that we've heard the old saying I'm tired of hearing it try to say it but don't let the perfect be the enemy they're good this isn't just good legislation this is really good legislation and it's gotten better at every step of the way and we've gotten better because of the willingness of our ranking Amendment our chairman of the Intel committee to collaborate to collaborate mr. president I'd say the two seeds are working here communicate compromise and collaborate we should work out finish off these amendments today and pass this bill thanks so much

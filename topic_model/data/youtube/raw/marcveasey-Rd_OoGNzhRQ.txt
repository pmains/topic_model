Thank You chairman rush for holding this hearing and I'd like to think the witness is also for being here I think this has been a really fascinating discussion as we talk about ways we can reduce emissions in the power sector as you know the power sector is responsible for about 20 percent of our nation's energy use and greenhouse gas emissions and if we are going to make meaningful progress on tackling climate change we must of course work to reduce these emissions through cleaner energy and we should also look at barriers to clean energy deployment as part of the deregulation in my home state of Texas many consumers since the early 2000s have had the ability to decide who they buy electricity from allowing consumer choice has not only created some of the lowest retail prices in the nation of eleven point five cents compared to the nation average of about twelve point five percent it has also allowed for consumers to seek out cleaner sources of energy of course this change alone this this change along with other market improvements in Texas has allowed renewable energy to also rapidly grow and has seen the state decarbonize faster than any other state in the Union according to recently release data from the US Energy Information Administration Texas is the leader in electric sector decarbonisation and 2013 we closed about a third of our coal plants in the state of Texas at the same time Texas led the nation and adding renewable power capacity specifically Texas leads the nation in wind generation capacity with nearly 25 gigawatts which is more than a quarter of the nation's total Texas still added more wind and renewable generation than any other state last year in fact Texas has enough wind capacity to ranked number-five globally if we were a country and some people do think the were country and if and and the other thing too that I think is always fascinating that I like to brag about up here is that if we compare the energy mix of the grid in Texas to that of the European Union that Texas actually produces more renewable energy on our grid than they do in the you so furthermore the state indicates another 21 gigawatts of solar projects and 30 gigawatts of wind projects are in the pipeline and so my question today is for Miss Palmer of resources for the future can you speak to the benefits of a competitive market like ikot provides in terms of reducing barriers for renewable energies to compete on the grid certainly congressman so I think you identified some of them in your opening remarks about the ability for people to select the their energy supplier not solely based on price but also based on these other attributes and I believe a lot of the clean energy development that's happening as mr. Dennis referred to is actually coming from those sorts of opportunities particularly large companies are interested in in doing this and the their ability to do so in a sort of integrated or way where they're pointing to the actual sources in their local area is enhanced and actually made possible by having more competitive markets so I think it's not going to answer the the problems that we have but it's certainly going to provide another Avenue by which clean energy development can be encouraged thank you very much I'd like to now turn to Jeff Denis of advanced energy economy in your testimony you mentioned that federal leadership and wholesale electricity markets provide a near and long-term opportunity to lower consumer costs expand consumer access to advanced energy and reduce emissions specifically what role does Congress have to make sure consumers in any state have a choice and access to cleaner sources of energy well Congress's role certainly in in overseeing the regulation of the wholesale markets is critically important to make sure that all resources that are technically capable of providing services are allowed to do so and that those market barriers are reduced I think Congress certainly has a role in looking at how competition in those markets gives consumers across the board the opportunity to make the choices we just talked about to choose advanced energy particularly now that advanced energy is not only a great choice for folks who have sustainability goals and other things but is also the least cost resource on the grid thank you very much appreciate the panel for being here today mr. chairman I yield back

the numbers are startling here and I was just watching the county announce that there are 6,000 confirmed cases of corona virus right here in Nassau County I think it's a if we relate you to states we'd be number three at this point next to New York City for the areas that have it and as a result we are seeing a strain on our local medical services a strain that is requiring some additional help and getting ahead of this continually that's something we've tried to do here in the town of hempstead and that's why we are now jointly calling on our US senators to declare and deploy a National Disaster medical system right here in the town of hempstead by declaring a National Disaster medical system through the support of our US senators they can deploy teams to this region to set up tents and facilities to as deal and help those individuals who have non coronavirus related injuries or problems what does that burden do it takes it out of the hospital and puts them in two different field tents that is what is taking place in New York City and that is what we need out here in Long Island but we need the support of our US senators to help get that done and help get that mechanism in place and this is not the first time this has taken place after superstorm sandy right here in Long Island they did such a deployment and again it helped to alleviate the burden that was being placed on our hospitals and we all see the reports on TV you know you see the lines at some of these hospitals you see this tree of ambulances going in and I know firsthand that there are many first responders who have indicated to us that this is now having effect on the services they are able to deliver to some of the residents with there's some of our hospitals you know there's people waiting a couple hours to try to get into triage and it's not the fault of our medical professionals they are doing the very best that they can they are providing every resource that they possibly can but we're hoping that the US Department of Health and Human Services if deployed can set up this d-mat team and really kind of take the stress off of our hospitals and dr. Z you know what if you're a resident or your neighbor who's suffering something that has nothing to do with the coronavirus you could be transported to this location and be treated even though we are holding our own for now it's time to call in reinforcements we do not want to get behind we are seeing this clear increasing need for medical resources for facilities for personnel and that is what the National Disaster medical system could do for us here I do serve as a member of that of that service of MD MS I was in a d-- match here in Long Island after Hurricane sandy and I have served in other locations after disasters and the resources that that they bring from Health and Human Services help augment and supplement the system help the system work better make sure that the system is getting what it needs and so it's a proactive step I asserted 22 years as a first responder in the Port Authority Police Department prior service with the NYPD right now what we're dealing with is we're dealing with a stretch of our manpower first responders are stretching to the max our hospital capacities need to be increased because the curve is still ahead of us so I joined my colleagues and calling on the federal government to help us with this capacity and to help us with the resources that we need all your levels of government are working together and at this point that's what we're reaching out to our federal representatives we need them to help have this deployed in this area by having the National Disaster medical system placed here it will get ahead of this you know you have to really think of it that everything is funneling down into one hospital every case of coronavirus every injury everything else by having these alternatives set up and we're willing to you know what help with the the federal level and find locations here in the town of hempstead areas to do it we can alleviate that congestion we can alleviate that burden that is happening to our hospitals are tremendous first responders our medics our nurses and all them and it's about being proactive that is going to help flatten this curve

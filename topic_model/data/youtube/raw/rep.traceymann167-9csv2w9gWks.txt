. MADAM SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY TO  RECOGNIZE A GREAT KANSAN, DALE  MOORE, AND TO CONGRATULATE HIM  ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM A CAREER  OF DEDICATED SERVICE TO FARMERS, RANCHERS, AND AGRICULTURE  PRODUCERS. DALE GREW UP ON A LIVESTOCK,  HAY, AND GRAIN FARM IN COPELAND, KANSAS, WHICH LIES IN MY  DISTRICT, THE BIG FIRST OF  KANSAS. HE WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY,  WORKED FOR KANSAS PORK PRODUCERS COUNCIL, AND SENATOR PAT  ROBERTS. IN 2001, PRESIDENT BUSH  APPOINTED DALE TO SERVE AS THE  CHIEF OF STAFF AT USDA. AFTER WHICH HE SERVED AS  LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE  HOUSE AG COMMITTEE. MOST RECENTLY, DALE HAS BEEN  SERVING AS EXECUTIVE VICE  PRESIDENT AT THE AMERICAN FARM  BUREAU FEDERATION, WHICH HIS  PRESENCE WILL BE DEEPLY MISSED. DALE HAS TIRELESSLY ADVOCATED  FOR AGRICULTURE FOR MORE THAN 40 YEARS AND HE NEVER FORGOT HIS  SELFLESS KANSAS ROOTS OR THE  VALUES HE LEARNED THERE -- HARD  WORK, OTHERS BEFORE SELF, AND  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. I AM GRATEFUL FOR DALE'S  LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE AND I  OFFER HIM, HIS WIFE, FAITH, AND  THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY MY BEST  WISHES AS THEY BEGIN THIS NEW  ADVENTURE. CONGRATULA

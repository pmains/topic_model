the people don't give a damn about who gets the credit who wins who loses they just want the roads fixed they want the schools to work and it is another funny thing whenever reporters come up here to talk to me from anywhere south of kittery all they want to talk about is who are you going to caucus with that's I had a reporter from The Boston Globe we sat at lunch at Becky's diner he asked the question five times I kept answering and it kept saying you know I guess I'm I don't haven't decided he said well have you decided and is it a secret or you know I said no I'll decide when I get down there if I don't have to i'm not going to but he just kept on and on with this and finally I said look I've been at this now for six weeks I've been all over Maine I've shaken a lot of hands not a single person for man has ever come up to me and said who you're going to coffee but but here's the this is I am this is too good to be making this up and I don't have the imagination here's the capper we got up from lunch at beckys we were walking out a guy walked in perfect stranger I've never seen him before in my life he yelled at me across becky's he said hey Angus I don't care who your caucusing with I'm with you all the way

thank you Mr chairman and ranking member for having this important here and thank you all for your expertise and and sharing it with us um I am the one person at the end of the table who's just lived the long siphiest nightmare in Grand Forks North Dakota and I cannot tell you how disappointing it was and quite frankly how consequential it was forsyphus after not just the 45-day review but then another 20 days added to get further information all of which sends signals of course that were missed by local leaders unfortunately but um only to conclude clumsily non-jurisdiction over an agribusiness 12 miles from a ISR military base and a Leo you know low Earth orbiting satellite ground station um it was because the outcome of that was the completion of a sale that should never have taken place now that sale should never have been begun by local leaders and they should have you know listened to a lot of people including me prior to the Air Force finally correcting cypheus's error and stating emphatically in in a letter this poses a significant risk to the Ground Force Air Force Base so I'm with all of my colleagues who have said that the secretary of agriculture should be a permanent member of cypheus if if food supply chain isn't critical supply chain nothing is um you know food's so darn important maybe should be a member of The Joint Chiefs of Staff but we won't that's another committee I'm on um so anyway we're deeply disappointed and I hope we can and I think we do have strong bipartisan support for strengthening agriculture's role on cypheus that said I want to actually talk about something else for for a little bit and that's the role of domestic energy production and Export as a means to Bringing Global price down I long for the day when the WTI is the is the global index and I think we should do that and I think we can do that by flooding the market with American oil for example and gas and and selling it to our friends and Frenemies alike that will bring down price for all of us that said one of the means that I that I'm interested in that I've been working on is uh a carbon border adjustment mechanism that recognizes the high price that we uh that our carbon intensive companies already pay for a higher environmental standard as well as other high standards like labor and workplace standards and and joining forces with our friends that have similar standards and instead of punishing ourselves punishing uh and manipulating hopefully the behavior of the polluters which just also happened to be our adversaries in most cases um I favor a much simpler approach than a lot of others because I'm a simple guy and I can understand simple things but I might just be interested in each video I'd start with you Mr Wolf since you've sort of managed some of these tariffs I call this a pollution tariff um what your thoughts are and the possibility of of some sort of a pollution Terror for a sea bam that recognizes our high cost of production uh apologies it's not an issue I focused on or thought about it all right um I think it's an interesting issue um it does strike me that you're going to have to then start thinking about how to come up with a price for carbon and that's been a as we all know that's a it's a dicey issue it's hard to do and um and we're not there yet so in order to have some sort of a border adjustment mechanism I think you're gonna have to figure out how to find a price for carbon what what about what Europe has done to this point I wish they would have I wish we could have caught up or they we could have done it in sync with each other um you know clearly price of carbon sends off all kinds of red flags especially in my energy producing oil gas coal powered state of North Dakota where but but this is again where I think can we find something that doesn't punish our own clean producers um but changes behavior and Mr Singh thoughts on the possibility Senator yeah I think there are two approaches out there one is do you set the the Tariff by your cost of Regulatory Compliance that that tends to be the European approach the one that I think has more appeal is how much have you actually done to reduce your emissions as a country that's what matters right right and so depending on how much progress you've made in reducing what actually impacts the environment that determines the degree to which you impose a border adjustment tax so I think that that's a tool I think you're right Senator this is a tool that we need to think about and refine to my mind the latter approach is the way forward thank you excellent thank you

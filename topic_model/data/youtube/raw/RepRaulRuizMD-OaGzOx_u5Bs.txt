you know congressman Raul Ruiz a democrat from california congressman healthcare premiums they're not affordable right now that has been a massive complaint we've heard for months now a previous assessment of the GOP health care plan said that premiums would originally go up 15 to 20 percent eventually they'll become 10 percent lower that sounds like a positive assuming it's true you might not expect Republican plan but that that's a great assumption you know Trump care one with terrible Trump care 2.0 is even worse premiums deductibles will all go up the bottom line is that what we care about is the out-of-pocket cost for the American people the patient's premiums can go down but deductibles will go up so you get bamboozled by getting a lower premium but a higher deduct on top of that Trump Care 2.0 is going to take away all those guaranteed benefits of being covered for emergency care mental health maternity care and pharmaceutical drug prices therefore that moment when you need your insurance you're going to be left alone to pay for it so that's absolutely false that premiums or out-of-pocket costs will come down because out-of-pocket cost is going to go up well knew yourself for an emergency room doctor but last month he wrote an op-ed in Holland Sentinel when you wrote quote the Republicans aren't interested in improving the ACA they'd rather attack it for political gain you went on to say this is what's discussed voters about Washington so that's a criticism of what Republicans are doing but day in and day out we hear more complaints just yesterday Aetna dropped out of the state of Virginia because they said they're losing so much money one of Democrats done so far to help improve this bill and work with Republicans well the health insurance market has been destabilized because Republicans have avoided the risk-reducing program that helped health insurance to have a good combination of high risk low risk people the administration has decreased their outreach efforts leaving only the really sick in the insurance market of course the Republicans want to make it work so that then they can use that to scare people and say see the Affordable Care is not working what we need to do is come together to re-evaluate those risk mitigation pools which will incentivize health insurance markets to come in and we also have to have a public option with Medicare as the public option these are simple solutions that we can get together and do right now we are a member of Congress are you making efforts to come together absolutely I'm making efforts I'm trying to I'll pick up the phone I'll call anybody who wants to listen the problem is that they're there making these changes without calling or discussing with Democrats behind closed doors and without the information that we need to truly analyze whether this is good or bad listen listen I let's not kid ourselves this bill is worse than a sham this is worse than a sugar pill this is downright ugly this is poison this is going to allow private health insurance company to drop people with pre-existing illnesses with diabetes asthma any other condition that they have and say now we can drop you because you can go to the high-risk hole the high-risk pool is a high-cost pool meaning that they're not going to get the coverage and the guarantees of coverage that they want they're going to have to pay a hell of a lot more money and they're not going to be able to afford it then was it a mistake in retrospect for Democrats to rush the Affordable Care Act in Congress it's such a massive undertaking and clearly it needs improvements given where we are now the fact that you're looking at this repeal and replace and saying it's a sham it's worse than a sugar pill should this has been handled differently and by the last administration you know first of all I wasn't here during that time when the Affordable Care Act was done but if you can review what happened it's the debates on the Affordable Care Act lasted about a year with 80 meetings throughout multiple committee committees this this bill hasn't even been evaluated by the CBO the stakeholders haven't been at the table there's been no no dialogue with Republicans and Democrats what we need to do moving forward is this let's stop the ideological hyper partisanship and let's come in - pragmatic solutions to figure out what we can do together I'm willing I'm willing to sit down I wanted to figure out how can we reduce cost out of pocket for patients for care and for medicine and that's not what this bill does this bill is going to increase costs for everybody they're going to pay more with less coverage while giving six hundred billion dollars tax cuts to the wealthiest BAM is absolutely not fair I got to leave it there yes no the Republicans get the votes today I say no all right then thanks for joining me when we come

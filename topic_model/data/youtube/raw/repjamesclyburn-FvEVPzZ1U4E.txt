mr speaker i come to the floor today to discuss some other theories and to really honor this month black history month with first an announcement last year the governor of kentucky wrote the president president biden asking him to promote colonel charles young to brigadier general now charles young is not a name that most people in the country probably recognize he's a buffalo soldier he's a third african american to graduate from west point uh and stories are legendary as to what he went through he was born a son of slaves back in eighteen in kentucky but he rose and went into the military at the urgent of his father and performed heroically however for obvious reasons he was stuck at lieutenant colonel and never got the promotions he deserved so posthumously the defense department last week upon the request of the governor of kentucky and i was pleased to write a letter to the president in support of that request last week he was promoted to general and i thank the defense department for repairing that fault now mr speaker black history month started out back in 1926. uh it started by carter g woodson dr carter j woodson and the association uh for the study of negro life and history now dr woodson is known by most of us as the father of black history he has some strong feelings about the contributions that african-americans were making to this great country that were going untold and intentionally ignored so he and the association lobbied a week to focus the country's attention on the contributions of black americans he was successful and as i said in 1926 the week was established now back in the 60s many campuses college and university campuses had a lot of activity going on those campuses and i'm very familiar with some of them but one of the things that came up was this focus on the contributions of african-americans and so a movement started on these campuses they they decided in fact quite frankly i believe it was kent uh university was the first university decided that it would just celebrate and focus on african american history for the entire month of february that the week was not enough now we hear a lot of stories about february being the shortest month of the year and why that was set aside for the study of black history well the fact of the matter is the number of days in the month had nothing to do with it it was all about two days in the month of february when the agreement was made to celebrate black history carter g woodson and the association picked february for because february 12th was the birthday of abraham lincoln february 14th the birthday of frederick douglass so to embrace both those birthdays they picked a week in february that would embrace the two that's how it got to be february and then of course with the agitation on the college campuses uh they ask that or they just started a tradition of just celebrating the whole month and of course uh in 19 uh i believe it was uh in 69 that activity took place up at kent in 1976 president gerald ford decided to officially recognize the month of february as black history month that's how we got to this point and every president since has followed suit now today the teaching of black history has taken on a new meaning in this polarized country that we're currently experiencing education week the publication education week reports that since january 2021 13 months in the last 13 months 14 states led by republicans through black history month as i just indicated was established officially by republican president gerald ford but we have become so polarized and we have so politicized what is not a political issue that in the last 13 months 14 states led by republican governors florida georgia alabama south carolina virginia tennessee utah oklahoma texas iowa new hampshire north dakota montana and idaho have all imposed restrictions or bans on teaching about racial issues and legislation is currently pending in another 23 states these states claim to be protecting the k-12 students from being taught critical race theory or as we've seen in some publications things that make white children uncomfortable i would like to remind all of us especially my friends on the other side of the aisle that theory is part of higher education experience and is not part of any curriculum in k through 12. instead these students or being taught facts what we call i call critical race facts now all of us are aware of the contributions of people like rosa parks martin luther king jr harriet tubman and none of us seem to be uncomfortable with knowing about these people but mr speaker there are a lot of other people of color who have made significant contributions to the growth and development of this great country that have been intentionally left out of our history books and for some strange reason people seem to feel that students will be uncomfortable learning about those contributions it is important to the full development of all children to be taught exactly what this country is all about let me offer a few examples of what i am talking about here in fact i often in fact i opened up black history month this year speaking to students over at gonzaga high school and in that speech as i have done on this floor i looked at up at the lights and i talked to those students a little bit about the person that history records as responsible for the light bulb thomas edison nobody argues with that we are very comfortable with knowing that reading about that in the history books and studying about thomas evans that many of us call the greatest inventor of all times but the fact of the matter is that thomas edison did invent the light bulb but a very critical unknown fact to most people is that he could not get the light bulb to work he could get it to come on but he couldn't get it to stay on it was not until someone told thomas edison about an african-american a young man the son of former slaves his parents had escaped from slavery and was living up in massachusetts a young man totally different from thomas edison louis latimer thomas essen was formed that you know this light bulb that you've got here that you can't get to stay on this guy up there in massachusetts might be able to solve your problem if you can just step outside of your comfort zone no it may be uncomfortable but if you can step outside of your comfort zone and go up there and sit down with louis vladimir because this man has invented a filament that can might make your light bulb work thomas edison decided to do that he wanted to like the world he was having problems he for some reason he could not get it done so he went up to massachusetts and he sat down with louis latimer and sure enough louis vladimir's filament when put inside of thomas edison's light bulb it worked and together they lit the world it should not be uncomfortable for people to know about louis latimer what is that that's not critical race theory that is a critical racial fact that ought to be known by all children and adults and whether it's wrong with teaching that in the classrooms for some strange reason a lot of people seem to feel that would be uncomfortable for children to learn there are many other examples like that i think today of another one the steam engine nobody will argue about how important the steam engine was and still lives to the industrial revolution and if you ask people most people from the books they have learned who invented the stem engine they will tell you thomas savory and they would be correct but when thomas savory invented the steam engine that it would overheat and they would have to cut the engine off and sometimes in order for they keep from cutting it off they would employ a person they call an oiler and that person's job was to uh pull oil on this engine so it would keep running they would not have to uh shut it down and it was a very dangerous job some lost their limbs carrying out their duties but there was a guy working in a similar situation who who came up with an automatic oil pan he designed a way for the engine to self-lubricate so you would not have to turn it off and lose production so you will not have to employ a person who could lose a limb that man name was elijah mccoy also according to my research a son of slaves he was a prolific inventor this was just one of the things that he invented in fact elijah mccoy genius was so well thought of and highly respected and he had invented so many things to make life better to make production more profitable to make this country a better place and out of respect for his genius the stories are told that whenever anybody came up with some gadget or something to make it life easier the question was asked often is this a real mccoy it's very comfortable for people uh to even today use that phrase ask that question is that the real mccoy or you the real mccoy why would it be so uncomfortable for children in the classroom to know that that iconic phrase came about as a result of the significant contribution to the human spirit to the greatness of america by an african-american name elijah mccoy why is that to be uncomfortable there's nothing that should be uncomfortable about that i um also think today about another african-american garrity morgan now all of us uh marvel at the gas mask i remember as a child the first time i saw one and experimented with how it worked i had no idea of the origin of it at the time in fact if i were to read the books that were published i still would not have know known the real origin because in the books they will tell you that john holding a scottish inventor who came to this country and supposedly during world war one invented the first gas mass but the critical fact is world war one started in 1914 ended in 1918. but in 1911 or thereabouts a man named gary morgan also from kentucky who he was born to a mother who is native american and a father who was african-american he was also a former slave morgan in 1914 at the beginning of world war one invented the gas mask and that gas mask was used in 1916 in new york city to save the lives of over 500 people caught in some kind of an accident now if you look at the calendar this was done before john haldon whatever contraption he may have developed now the story of gary morgan is kind of interesting and a little bit maybe to some i know to me is uncomfortable to think about uh because gary morgan experienced a lot of difficulty trying to sell his gas mask and the only reason people wanted did they use it uh for a big event in cleveland ohio people wanted the gas mask but they wouldn't buy it from him because of his color so gary morgan hired a white actor to pose as the inventor and he went along with the inventor and he put the gas mask the hood on to demonstrate it and of course to hide who he really was that's how he was able to sell his gas masks as effective as it was as good of an invention that it was they would not buy from him simply because of his skin color now that might have disappointed him and it certainly should have but he didn't let that deter him he went on with other inventions and some know that it is gary morgan that is credited with being the inventor of the traffic light so these inventions that made life easier for people made industrial plants more productive made our streets safer made our existence much more pleasant and much more conducive to reading to getting around all by african americans what is uncomfortable about teaching this in our classrooms what is so bad about children knowing this why shouldn't the descendants and there are some of all three of these people why shouldn't there descendants be made to feel proud of the contributions of the great great great maybe more great grandfather or great uncle or ed why would anybody be uncomfortable with that but that's not the only field this is you know i often talk about charles drew you know when i was growing up polio visited my neighborhood twice leaving one of my playmates dead and another one crippled for life and the wrong came jonah salk and albert sabin two men who happened to have been born white two men who had a certain genius who did significant research because of their genius and because of their great research they were able to unlock some secrets and uh together they virtually eliminated polio from the face of the earth there's no nothing uncomfortable about talking about that and people learning about that so why would it be uncomfortable for the guy who was able to unlock some secrets of the blood cells charles drew an african-american born right here in washington dc who because of his research he was able to figure out how to store blood save it until it was needed blood spoils once you leave the human body charles drew opened up some secrets to figure out how to store blood and save it until it was needed now he has a pretty interest the history also uh charles drew uh hit up the blood black went off to uh europe to hit up the blood back his genius was recognized but it's kind of interesting because he resigned from the job why because they insisted that the blood coming from black people had to be stored separately from the blood coming from white people sounds a little bit silly today but that's what they did soldiers dying on the battlefield because of the loss of blood and you got to take the time to find where really matt this is a a black soldier so we got to find some blood from a black person and scientifically it's been proven forever that there ain't no difference in the blood and today we don't separate the blood anymore because we learned better and we got a little sin in the neighborhood i grew up in when a person learns better a person will do better well i'm hoping that we'll take a little time to learn better about the history of african americans and maybe if we did we'll do better now i um don't want to leave you today without bringing up another incident because i this is one that bugs me a little bit i i keep some busts around my home and of course i got one of charles drew matthew henson but i also have one of daniel hale williams who few people know daniel hale williams was an african-american but if you look in the books and they ask the question who is the father of open heart surgery you will get the name of dr c walton lehi who was white and he is credited in all the books of performing the first open heart surgery and he just passed away in 1999. his surgery was performed in 1952 but that's not the real history why would it be uncomfortable for you know for you to know that daniel hale williams who was a doctor who found the provident hospital up in chicago who one day back in 1893. someone came to that hospital with a stab wound into the chest the guy happened to have been white but daniel hale williams a black guy perform open heart surgery saved the man's life and he lived 20 years afterwards textbooks don't record that they decided to wait almost 100 years to give somebody else credit and that's what has happened and that's why we look at this week now i think that carter woodson was very concerned about what seemed to be going on today people leaving out facts ignoring facts lowering their level of respect for people i can't tell you how many times i've been engaged in conversation with people who out of their ignorance say things that they really believe that indicate that there can be found those significant contributions to this great country from people of color i've had it set to me and reason for that it's not their fault they believe that because that's what they have seen in the books or have not seen and if we teach these facts then i think black history would take on a new meaning in black history month would not be so uncomfortable for anybody to celebrate next month we will celebrate women's history month simply because so many of the contributions of women have been left out and ignored so we take the month of march to focus on those things and that is what why it's so important for us

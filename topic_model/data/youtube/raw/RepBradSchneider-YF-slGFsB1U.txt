Mr. Speaker, there’s no question we need
to reform our outdated, overly complex tax code. That’s something we all agree on. We need to encourage growth and support our
middle class. But the Republican decision to approach taxes
in an exclusively partisan and fiscally irresponsible way is not the way to go. I’m deeply concerned with the partisan plan
rolled out by the Republican leadership, in no small part because it saddles future generations
with trillions more in debt, just to pay for tax cuts for some of the most fortunate Americans. Furthermore, restricting provisions relied
upon countless middle class families, including the state and local tax (SALT) deduction and
property tax deductions, hurts working families. This is particularly true in states like Illinois,
where one in every three filers depends on the SALT deduction. In the days ahead, I hope my Republican colleagues
will open the tax reform discussion to bipartisan engagement. I remain ready and willing to sit down and
work across the aisle to achieve responsible tax reform that will grow our economy and
secure our future.

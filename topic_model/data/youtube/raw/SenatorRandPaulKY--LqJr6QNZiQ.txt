joining us now with more is the man himself it's also a medical doctor kentucky senator rand paul you've been right about this guy from the beginning i'll be honest i tried to give him the benefit of the doubt there were a lot of things a lot of people got wrong in the beginning i thought i never thought it was nefarious but we now know on january 31st that dr pouchy was told it looks like gain of function uh manipulation of this virus the genome of this virus he was told that that happens to be also the day that donald trump put in place the travel ban that's xenophobic and hysteria and 10 days after the first identified case in this country so you've been right the whole time senator and unfortunately you've been right you know there's been no more prominent uh scientist in favor of gain of function research than dr fauci he still hasn't backed off of that position he believes that it's okay to take animal viruses make them into super viruses to infect humans even if a pandemic should occur he says oh the research is worth it but you know there's a host of other scientists in this field and they say it's not worth it at all that we haven't learned anything all we've done is put ourselves at risk but even after all of this evidence points towards the wuhan lab this last week in committee dr fauci said that he still trusts the chinese scientists and the thing is is that's a very naive notion that's how we got here but there are worse viruses this is a bad one this has about a one percent mortality three and a half million people have died but they've been experimenting with some viruses that have 15 mortality that would mean 50 million deaths right now so this this kind of research needs not to be funded by the u.s taxpayer and so i had an amendment this week that passed actually unanimously saying no more funds for this wuhan lab so we'll see what dr fauci has to say but he doesn't really have the judgment to be in the position he's in senator i hear the money that he is saying it was far much far much more in terms of the actual dollar amount do we have any idea how much money american taxpayer money went to fund this wuhan virology lab and their gainer research function work there's a lot of pools of money there's a group called eco health alliance this peter zonk he's got a hundred million dollars over the last several years now not all of it's gone to wuhan but they say as much as three to four million may have but there's lots of pots of money there's defense money there's secret money there's money we don't even know about because it's classified but this research is being done in the united states as well it's very very dangerous and i want scientists that are not partisan to come to washington so i sent a letter today to the head of my committee in homeland security and also the health committee to say we need to have a hearing with impartial scientists who are are on the other side of dr fauci who believe that it's incredibly dangerous but you know what the other danger is i've had five death threats just for being outspoken on it this week i've had five death threats i don't know what the world is coming to you can't ask honest difficult questions that in the end have turned and proved out that dr falchi was not being honest with us but as a repercussion my family had white powders into our house and five death threats phoned in by the way been there sorry to hear that it's not fun i know it's happened to me it's happened to many other people in the public eye and it's it's it gets scary at times uh and i hope you're getting the proper security and i hope our government is providing it to protect any politician any elected official this is not democrat or republican let me let me ask you this did dr fauci lie before your committee absolutely he still says no money went for gain and function research one of the papers that he sent in the emails that have come out he labels the paper as gain of function and that was at the wuhan institute at the end of that paper the bat scientist dr she she thanks dr fauci's organization the niaid which is part of nih and she actually lists the serial number for the money she got from the u.s so he needs to be asked difficult questions we need to have other scientists there he hides behind the veil of oh i'm the only smart person in the room no one else can understand this but many other phd scientists in this field completely disagree with him and don't think it's worth risking a pandemic they don't think we should be doing research and they haven't seen any benefits of it either i i think i recall that a gentleman by the name of roger stone um was charged with lying to congress known as a process crime usually tells somebody have your client report at this location at this time and that's the way it usually was handled uh but he had almost 30 guys in tactical gear frogmen and fake news cnn cameras pre-dawn raid guns drawn the line of congress is that a crime it absolutely is a crime it's punishable up to five years in prison the thing is is no one's going to you know dr fauci is going to work around his words he's being very careful with his words it sounded like he was saying no money went to nih but he was specifically no money went to the wuhan institute but he was being more precise and saying no gain of function money went but i think that's verifiably false also but it's going to come down to an opinion he's going to say it wasn't gain of function many other scientists are already and have been saying for almost a year now that it all was gain of function but he's not being uh truthful he's not being completely forthcoming he's shading the meaning of truth he's parsing his words a real problem exactly and there's one other example there's one other example i want to bring up right now india is struggling under this they have a billion people 300 000 people there getting it they're having about four thousand deaths dr fauci refuses to tell people that you get immunity after you've had the disease this would allow the vaccine in india to be targeted to those who have not been sick but because dr fauci says everyone's the same and everyone should get the vaccine without thinking about it there's not enough vaccine to go around in india so there are profound public health implications of dr fauci denying natural immunity from the disease in doing so i think it's leading to a great deal of deaths around the world that could be prevented and i believe you were the first senator to go public and say you contracted covid you have natural immunity you've made the choice as your own doctor not to get the vaccine in light of the natural immunity t-cell immunity stuff i don't know about but i think people uh need to pay very close attention because what's happened here and by the way even therapeutics that were advised to dr fauci he ignored those emails it's too long to read but great work senator thank you for being with us we appreciate it

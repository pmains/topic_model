one year ago today 22,000 people headed out to have a fun night and celebrate their love for country music with friends and family in my hometown of Las Vegas what started as a beautiful weekend was instead met with terror when a senseless act of violence cut 58 precious innocent lives short at the route 91 harvest music festival on that night tens of thousands of lives were forever changed as Nevadans in the entire country learned of the news like me they were left shocked and devastated but you know moments after bullets rained down heroes arose mr. Rogers had a timeless quote he would say look for the helpers you will always find people who are helping and there were helpers like Jonathan who despite having a gunshot wound in his neck save the lives of 30 people by leading them out of the venue he later said I decided I'm not going to leave anyone behind there was a former Marine who turned a truck into a makeshift ambulance and drove more than two dozen people to the hospital and there were first responders doctors nurses across our Valley who stayed long past their shifts to save lives and comfort the wounded and of course our police and firefighters who reacted with selflessness by running into the bullets to save lives before dawn had even broken October 2nd people in Las Vegas were standing in lines stretched around blocks just to give blood and do what they could do to help in the days that followed our community's compassionate response showed the world who we are as Las Vegas we showed the world that we are resilient we showed the world that we are Vegas strong in the midst of such horror I will be forever proud of my community and continue to be amazed by its strength and spirit that is helping us heal and move forth but now it is past time Congress came together so no community is ever left with the devastation Las Vegas felt we have to come together to prevent the senseless mass murders it's been an entire year and Congress fails to take meaningful action to address the gun violence epidemic plaguing this country we should all be able to agree that gun should not be available to people who are mentally ill have a history of violence or are a suspected terrorist we should all be able to agree that everyone who buys a gun should undergo a background check and lastly we should all be able to agree there is no reason for a bump stock which made the shooting all the more lethal to be in our communities you don't need a bump stock to hunt unless you're hunting people we can take smart sensible steps to keep Americans safe we can work together to make America safer let's not ignore the lives of those killed and wounded that night or the families whose hearts will never be fully healed Las Vegas responded to the worst tragedy our city has ever seen with unprecedented bravery selflessness and compassionate Congress let's once and for all follow their example and get something done in honor of the loved ones who are still with us and the family and friends we cannot afford to lose let's come together and pass common-sense gun violence reforms [Music]

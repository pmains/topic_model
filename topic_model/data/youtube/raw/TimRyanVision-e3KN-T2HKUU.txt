Tim Ryan of ohio congressman great to have you on this weekend you said if John McCain were in charge we'd be in seven different Wars yet we don't get an attitude from the Republicans right now that they're going to do whatever it takes to to get after Isis because President Obama seems to be connected to it what do you make all of this well it really is stunning I guess the old phrase that politics stops at the water's edge has been gone for a while especially during this administration ad but I think the reality of it is you know you have people here will jump at any opportunity to want to send boots on the ground to some hot spot around the globe but the president wants to deal with something and they're upset that he doesn't that he doesn't deal with it quick enough and let me just reiterate what senator boxer said don't we all want a president who thinks and is thoughtful about putting together a strategy and the tactics that will be needed in order to address an issue or do we want him operating from you know the reptilian part of his brain where it's just constant reaction and we have a thoughtful president who's putting it together and the Republicans clearly are going to fight him at every turn so the president is working on a coalition he's done some diplomacy he's been cautious and patient would you support him if he were to ask for troops on the ground and he you know who knows where this is all going to go but if Isis is as strong as some people say they are and as connected as they are as resourceful as they are isn't it going to be somewhat of a sell job to the American people that we could do this without boots on the ground where are we on that well it's going to be a heck of a sell job to the American people and to me quite frankly I am not supportive of boots on the ground I think that the the Kurds are there there are other entities there that we can train we can supply with air support I think we do have to take the lead here I think we do have to have a role here I think we do have to be supportive we do have to supply and train on the ground but American boots should not be on the ground in this situation at I just don't think it he was the president be clear about that tomorrow night I would love for him to be clear about it who knows and we're going to get a briefing tomorrow here in the House of Representatives we're going to hear the president speak as well and we'll have more information then but at this point you know Isis is a threat you've got to be honest about it it is and we've got to deal with it and American government should take the lead on it but I do not think that is on the ground it's ultimately the players in that region who need to learn how to fight because this threat is not going to go away we need to train them and they need to fight their own battles but America should be there to support them congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio good to have you with us I appreciate your tips so much you bet remember to answer

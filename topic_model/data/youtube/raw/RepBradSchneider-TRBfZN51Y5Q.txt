Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to rise today
to honor two remarkable constituents and their extraordinary achievement that should stand
as a model for us all Last month, Beatrice and Fred Sorkin of Lincolnshire,
IL celebrated their 77th wedding anniversary. Seventy-seven years of love, family, and commitment. Bea and Fred met as teenagers in Brooklyn,
New York. Fred was a sheet metal worker by trade and
in 1950 started his own business that he ran for over 40 years. Bea worked in a bank – she began selling
savings bonds and rose to become a bank teller and eventually assistant vice president. Their family has been blessed with two children:
Rae and Herbert, their spouses: Michael and Gloria, four grandchildren: Jeffrey, Andrew,
Alyse, and Sharon; and now seven great-grandchildren. According to the data collected by the Worldwide
Marriage Encounter organization, Bea and Fred are the longest married couple in Illinois. Bea and Fred Sorkin’s enduring lifelong
connection is an inspiring example for us all. On behalf of Illinois’s Tenth District,
it’s my privilege to congratulate Bea and Fred on your 77 years of marriage. I wish you and your family many more years
of health and happiness together.

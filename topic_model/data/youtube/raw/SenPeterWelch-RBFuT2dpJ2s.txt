the gentleman yields back uh the chair now recognizes one of the authors of hr3 the gentleman from vermont mr welch is now recognized for five minutes uh thank you madam chair uh mr or mr gonzalez uh you have a business model as does all of pharma that starts with patent protection provided by the federal government is that correct that is correct and that is supposed to be a limited time uh and you do everything in your power to extend it beyond the original grant is that correct we develop innovation if we believe that innovation is meaningful and worthy enough we well the answer to that is yes right you did a memo when you were executive vice president that was about 10 years ago a little less talking about quote product enhancements and those included things like changing the size of the needle correct that is correct and you do constant analysis internally within the company uh to anticipate uh uh competition that may uh result in lower prices uh or price competition correct so what i'd say we do is we constantly look for ways that we can innovate a product to be able to protect and grow its position by making it a better product for patients and what that means is extending patent protection and maintaining pricing power through the monopoly that a patent confers is that correct yes it can result in that yes all right and when biosimilar competition was introduced in europe the price of your product a humera went down by 80 percent is that correct the average reduction in revenue is about 50 48 i believe is the last number the point here is competition works correct that is correct and your you when your pay executive pay is related and has been for a period of time to increasing revenues and hitting revenue targets is that correct we will set a plan for what we believe our revenues uh are going to be in the following year right and that is one sentence and revenue is affected by the amount you sell in the price at which you sell it correct it's affected by that and then the cost that you obviously incur in the business such as increases in r d let's just go through this immediately after that incentive plan came into effect uh the there were three uh major price increases about 30 percent in one year for humera that is that correct those that's according to the documents you provided this committee if i look at abdi's price from 2017 forward our net price was negative uh your 2013 is when this went into effect your rec your the records you provided to this committee indicate that the compensation of the top executives increased and by the way your income last year or your compensation was but 24 million dollars that is correct and between 2013 and 2020 it was uh 170 million dollars i would have to add it but let's well it's a big number and the compensation for all of the top executives was about 400 and what 80 million dollars is that correct probably averaged about 60 million dollars a year for the top five executives all right so the bottom line here is that you had a system within abbv where executive compensation was tied to the hitting revenue targets revenue targets were enhanced by increasing prices and in sales correct no congressman i don't agree with that if you go if you want to talk about a period of 2013 forward then what i would tell you is net price for avd 2013 forward but let me play my time and the way you were able to do that is one uh reaching agreements with competitors that they didn't bring their product out number two shadow pricing with uh amgen with respect to their product imbrell uh number three uh patent thickets uh filing for over 150 patents here when you only did for six uh in uh europe uh and in in so-called enhancements which were things that made virtually no difference to the patient other than that they had to pay more to get a smaller needle so the business model here starts with the government providing a patent the government providing payers through medicare and medicaid and then what i can see rampant abuse on the part of your company to essentially extend that monopoly pricing power and abuse it at the expense of patients it's got to end it's got to end i yield back

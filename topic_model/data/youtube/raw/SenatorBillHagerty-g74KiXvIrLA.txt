mr president on behalf of senator scott of south carolina and myself i'd like to submit a question to the desk senator tennessee shall submit it thank you the question is for council for the former president from senators haggerty and scott of south carolina clerical i read the question given that more than 200 people have been charged for their conduct at the capitol on january 6 that our justice system is working to hold the appropriate persons accountable and that president trump is no longer in office isn't this simply a political show trial that is designed designed to discredit president trump and his policies and shame the 74 million americans who voted for him thank you senators for those that question uh that's precisely what the 45th president believes this gathering is about we believe in law and order and trust that the federal authorities that are conducting investigations and prosecutions in against the criminals that invaded this building will continue their work and be as aggressive and thorough as we know them to always be and that they will continue to identify those that entered the inner sanctum of our government and uh desecrated it the 45th president no longer holds office there is no sanction available under the constitution in our view for him to be removed from office that he no longer holds the only logical conclusion is that the purpose of this gathering is to embarrass the 45th president of the united states and in some way try to create an opportunity for senators to suggest that he should not be permitted to hold office in the future or at the very least publicize this throughout the land to try to damage his ability to run for office when and if he is acquitted and at the same time tell the 40 74 million people who voted for them that their choice was the wrong choice i believe that that this is a divisive way of going about handling impeachment and it denigrates the the great solemnity that should attach to such proceedings i yield the remainder of my time mr president

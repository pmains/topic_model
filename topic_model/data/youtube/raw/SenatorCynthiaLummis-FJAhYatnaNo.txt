thank you mr chairman and i want to say how nice it is to see my former colleague from the house jim matheson great to see you um and thank you uh for holding this hearing today and ranking member capito thank you for doing this as well one area that i hope to find agreement on this subject is uh unleashing nuclear energy in america and so my first question uh is for mr mabus um in your testimony you advocate for prohibiting oil and gas imports from russia as a means to cut off russian revenues and isn't the same true restricting russian uranium which also provides direct revenues to the russian government i think cutting off all russian energy revenues is incredibly important and coming from the navy where we have used nuclear for propulsion from the mid 50s to today with safely with no accidents i do think that nuclear um particularly some of the new technologies of small modular reactors need to be a part of the mix thank you um and and i would note um the the last uh questioner mentioned how uh incentives were needed tax incentives uh i would argue that regulatory relief uh is the more uh important place to look especially when it comes to rare earth minerals and uh uranium these are the products that are held up and stymied in the united states including in my home state of wyoming because the it's the regulatory burden and the length of time and the cost to get through all those regulatory hurdles that snuffs out the financial capability and wherewithal for these companies to move forward and develop these rare earth minerals and uranium in the united states so let's let's address the regulatory side of it uh as well miss agama my colleague here from north dakota and naibal city on the banking committee we're aware that the federal reserve nominee that was rejected on a bipartisan basis was advocating uh limiting credit access to energy companies and and her writings were genuinely hostile uh to the energy industry so in light of the fact that this became an issue that uh ultimately uh caused her to uh not be accepted do you think it's appropriate for the sec to be issuing a climate proposal sec simply doesn't have the authority to regulate climate change i mean congress hasn't even passed a law why should a an agency just assume that assume that regulatory power and you know we'll note that esg as a black rock has asserted because of its market power its esg portfolio demands are really driving the market in that direction anyway government doesn't need to do that um again miss sagama could you expand on the greenhouse gas reduction efforts and outcomes by the oil and gas industry that you detail in testimony well i'd like to highlight the fact that in the electricity sector fuel switching to natural gas has reduced more greenhouse gas emissions than wind and solar combined we've reduced about 3.5 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2.1 billion by renewables and we did that without incentives we did that without subsidies we did that through market investment from private sector investment and just increased use of natural gas or increased production of natural gas natural gas especially in this country is so incredibly clean that i'm actually surprised that climate advocates don't highlight the benefits of natural gas in their agendas because climate change is climate-based and and globally based i would argue that the cost and benefits associated with helping countries like india with their greenhouse gas emissions by helping them switch to natural gas or lng would globally be enormous so much bigger than what we could produce here in the united states in terms of greenhouse gas reductions my gosh helping india do the same thing with the same amount of money that takes us to get little tiny incremental benefits if we would help them with that amount of money we could have huge huge incremental benefits for the global climate excuse me my time has run out i yield that

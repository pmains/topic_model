one observation that a colleague of mine Amy Walter made this morning on Meet the Press was that part of the explanation here may not just be that there are all these women candidates but also that many of you have many of the women running are new to politics you are first-time candidates what has made you want to step into the political realm considering some of the toxicity of the debate I think I think I'm on solid ground to say that you know people on both sides of the aisle agree that this is a pretty toxic environment right now I would agree with you completely and that's actually exactly why I'm running because that toxicity is not helping anyone it's not serving anyone and I have served this country as you mentioned I'm a former CIA officer and I served under a Republican administration a democratic administration and for me my service was about ensuring that we were keeping this country safe from a terrorist threat and working to inform our policymakers on the President and so for me it is about service and it's about changing the conversation that's happening in Washington because we are not going to move this country forward we are not going to be able to create impactful legislation that that really affects people's lives if we are constantly fighting and prioritizing our political ideology over over anything else and so I do think that a major motivator for those of us who are first-time candidates is to be a part of just changing the conversation completely bringing civility back to the discourse that's happening in Washington and ensuring that we're working on behalf of the the people for me in Virginia seventh District but but overall the people across this country Abigail's Bamberger thank you much very much for your time tonight really appreciate it we will be watching your primary coming up in a couple of weeks and the general election thank you Thank You Casey

i've been in touch with your department for months on behalf of a gentleman by the name of cody blint in mississippi he's an agricultural pilot in mississippi and cody received his first dose of the pfizer vaccine on february the 1st 2021 and immediately began experiencing very adverse side effects such as headaches vision and hearing issues dizziness loss of balance and a lot of pain due to these serious health issues he has not been able to fly as an ag pilot since receiving the coveted vaccine shot rendering cody unable to provide for his family as an ag pilot in mississippi for more than a year mr flynn has been painstakingly going through the countermeasures injury compensation program seeking compensation he may be entitled to based on his experience and i've worked with him to try to navigate this process and i've been stunned not only by your agency's lack of urgency and refusing such claims many claims but also the lack of the transparency in that process and i certainly still advocate for the vaccine and i myself receive the vaccine and i encourage others to speak to their doctors about receiving it however as with any new medical product some people are just they will have side effects the cicp exists for that very reason and i'm very concerned about the amount of time it takes your agency to process claims and the lack of clarity given to those folks who were adversely affected can you tell me what you're going to do to address the thousands of claims currently in backlog at hhs and what are you doing to improve the transparency of the cicp process so that americans like mr flint are properly compensated in a reasonable time period senator you've asked a very important question not just to mr flint but to so many americans who did what they should which is to get vaccinated we're finding that there are a number of americans who are suffering from what we're calling today long covet and we are doing everything we can to make sure we provide them with the uh support that they need to get through this who knows how long it may be we're doing research on this as well i will say this transparency is important accountability is important and we want to make sure that those who really do have a medical issue to report are the ones who are receiving the assistance we as you're aware in some cases some of the coveted money has been used fraudulently by many we want to make sure that no one's trying to game the system to get relief for something that doesn't exist that way we can reserve the funds that we have for people like mr flint and provide him with some help and so why don't we do this i'm more than willing to have my team reach out to you and we can see about mr flint and where he is in his process because we have heard this story on many occasions we know that millions have been saved because of the vaccine but we also know that many people are still suffering so we look forward to working with you yeah he's totally lost his income and the financial burden is just unbelievable but the frustration of trying to just get some answers of when something could be done for him for this compensation has been very great thank you for your help thank you for answering my questions thank you

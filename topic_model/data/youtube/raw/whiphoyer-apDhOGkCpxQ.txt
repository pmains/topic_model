probably in the democratic caucuses there wilt but also his longevity here and history provides a very good context or we're headed and with that I'll make the statement without objection any written statements you have will be made part of the record and with that in the story we welcome you here to the subcommittee and look forward to hearing your testimony you were able to get that I'm sure wouldn't want to miss that an opening about I miss mr. Bern and miss Newhouse and mr. Cheney's Bobby here as well somewhere any event miss chairman when Republicans banned congressionally directed spending in 2011 that did so by changing their conference rules as you know not by altering the rules of the house I'm curious whether it is the subcommittee's intention therefore to explore whether to recommend a change to the Republican Conference rules or to the house rules themselves no matter what the Congress does on earmarks it ought to be done in a bipartisan way I think all of us agree on that I've long been as the press knows my my constituents know a proponent of congressionally directed spending for reasons I will get to shortly we call that earmarks for lack of a better term however it is clear in the past the system was abused when Democrats took the majority in 2007 as you know we engaged in a serious earmark reform process that introduced transparency and accountability we changed the rules so that the public could see every item of congressionally directed spending who the sponsor was and whether it had been dropped into a bill in conference without prior consideration which was I think what you mentioned mr. chairman more will be required every member requesting an earmark to certify that he or she had no financial in in the request later we made the system even more transparent by requiring all members to post earmark requests and justifications on their websites when they asked for them now all of us understand if we had earmarks you would want to get some earmarks and you wouldn't get all of them so that wasn't going to be some controversies why did you get one and not the other but we thought it essential that the public have a full clear transparent understanding of who was asking what they were asking for we introduced new restrictions blocking earmarks benefiting for-profit entities as opposed to public entities as a matter of fact I was the majority leader at this point time and a number of these proposals were put forward by mr. Obi and myself and Miss Walter was very helpful in that effort we engaged I believe in a very successful reform of the earmark process that addressed the problems of the past and many made it much easier to gain the system when Republicans came into the majority in 20 2011 however there was an eagerness to win a victory in my opinion in the realm of congressional reform what was chosen in my view was not reformed but it eliminated earmarks altogether and that of course was the low-hanging fruit now just as we saw the consequences of an unchecked system in the past we've now seen also the unintended consequences of eliminating congressionally directed spending altogether the chairman mentioned one of those consequences is that now frankly if you have a need in your district and we ought to know our districts better than anybody else and certainly better than anybody else in the bureaucracy or the administration we have to go hat in hand to the administration a co-equal branch of the government has to go hat and in the Constitution has been pointed out in article 9 I mean article 1 section 9 paragraph 7 gives us that responsibility and duty and does not give that to the administration so we've seen the consequence of an unchecked system but we've also seen a consequence of a system which precludes even transparently the pursuit of us adding funding for our districts which we think are important for our districts from a public perspective again we eliminated private sector which we think is appropriate president Trump in my opinion wasn't wrong when he said that earmarks used to help bring both parties together to reach compromise on legislation but more than that they recognize that members of Congress individually as I have just said know their districts better than anyone at the federal agencies and better than the appropriations committee as a whole the Houston Chronicle pointed out this in an editorial last Friday when it lamented the difficulties the city's representatives have had trying to get specific appropriations for flood cleanup and rebuilding efforts I quote from the Houston Chronicle without the ability to write line-item expenditures our local delegation and city advocates have been forced to craft legislative language that they hope will instruct executive agencies to prioritize Houston flood infrastructure in other words doing indirectly what we say you cannot do directly that becomes then therefore less transparent less open and less available for the public review but without specific directed spending it is ultimately up to the executive branch which everybody has noted in Washington to decide which projects at funding let me suggest that also has another perverse it estranges us further from our districts and therefore undermines the confidence the American people have is in that we are paying attention to them - ace - a bridge need to a street need to a dredging need to a sewer correction need whatever that need may be if the public doesn't think that they're represented in Congress to whom they send a lot of money to Washington cannot apply any of that money to needs that they see immediately in their district that in my opinion undermines the sense that democracy works for them we've seen unintended shift in decision-making away from the legislative branch to the executive one that is contrary in my opinion to article 1 of the Constitution which clearly invest sus with that responsibility and that authority so I believe that we should take action to reinstate the use of the authority given to Congress under article 1 section 9 Clause 7 - direct spending in the way the Congress deems appropriate now let me repeat that the Congress deems appropriate if you make these transparent then it will be the Congress and the American public who will consider this not just an individual and this will have to therefore be approved not just by the individual that asks for such directed spending but by the Congress itself by the representative the American people and they will judge the merits of these programs which i think is ultimately the protection the public needs and wants our reforms are it should be noted still the rules of the house reforms are talked about in terms of transparency of being put on your website put it on the committee's website when they give it approval to an earmark so that the public at each stage of the process and other members will have the opportunity to know what is being asked for and what is being approved I thank the Chairman and ranking member for this opportunity to testify today and I look forward to answering the subcommittee's questions let me end the what I've told a number of people on both sides of the aisle if a proposal moves forward like Wes it is my intention to recommend to my members that it be supported thank you thank you and therefore I think one of the things is that you brought out and I just have a it was I was sitting here thinking about it I was writing a question and this is an issue that affects both our Republic

the person who prosecuted Cohen Jeff Berman the man bar fired last week it's not just a pattern that's emerging here it's an assault on our nation's judicial system and our justice system but according to Barr in an interview on Thursday it's all just business as usual how do you answer a voter who sees a pattern here of continually upholding the personal interests of the president well I'd say that there is no such pattern well that clears that up days a lot mr. Barr joining me now is congresswoman Madeline Dean of Pennsylvania and she is a Democratic member of the judiciary and Financial Services committee's former US Attorney Joyce Vance Paul Butler MSNBC legal analyst and a former federal prosecutor and former US Attorney and Barbara McQueen thank you all for being here and I'm gonna go to you first congresswoman what do you make of William bars very succinct defense of his behavior well it just doesn't hold any water we've seen from the moment he auditioned for the position of attorney general that he was auditioning for one for the President and sadly in every action he has taken he has used his office in the mighty power of the Attorney General to be a political arm a fixer if you will for the president I had the privilege of being in both the hearings with mr. szalinski mr. Ayers mr. Elias with judiciary but then also interestingly Secretary SEC chairman Clayton in front of financial services what you see is attorney general Barr not acting independently not acting as an attorney he misrepresents before the American people chronically on behalf of the President and then tries to instill fear in others who won't do so I mean I guess the question then is what can the public do about it here's just a list of what dot Barr has done that we know of misleading the preview of the Mullah report remember he put out that fake version of it that made it sound like it exonerated Trump the lower sentencing recommendations for stone move to drop the prosecution persecutors of Michael Flynn said the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign which is a lie and tried to remove a prosecutor Behrman and i wonder congresswoman if you feel that it is at this point still possible to impeach him because that is a sanction that is available to Congress under law and I mean a peach bar in my mind and I understand that in plain sight Attorney General bar has done over run over impeachable acts in terms of process and whether we will go there I don't know but he is scheduled to come before us July the 28th recognize this is the first Attorney General not to come before Congress chronically not to come before Congress I want to add to that terrible list that you just showed which debuted with his four-page misrepresentation of the Muller report which he allowed to stand out there for one month saying no collusion no obstruction none of that was true that Mister is a misrepresentation teed us off to the misrepresentation he would go through powerfully now and dangerously now is what he is doing to undermine our upcoming election with voter suppression with tear gassing peaceful protesters think of what he's doing in terms of saying undermining the confidence of our elections for example with mail-in ballots which by the way the president took advantage of in the primary election he's signalling special treatment when you say we'll make sure we get charges dismissed against you Michael Flynn when the very thing that was being investigated and he pled guilty to had to do with the interference in our elections in 2016 he is a master of disinformation and I want to say as an attorney I practiced as an attorney I'm a recovering attorney now the thing you are taught is the you are a servant of the court you're not the servant of the President and a misrepresentation before the court which in this case is the court of public opinion is something you must immediately correct in in word after word after deed this attorney general misrepresents facts and the law before the american people on behalf of a president he's a simple fixer he has no credibility he needs Jukka yeah I think that here's a quite a bit of agreement on that and to the point that you just made congresswoman for ways William bar the Washington Post writes is already subverting the twenty twenty elections safeguarding a vote be the top read in an or for a normal attorney general it's the opposite down he's already looking for ways to undermine the election in order to keep the band he clearly considers to be King in place let's go to Barbara barbecue enjoys co-wrote a piece that was in New York Magazine on Thursday talking about the ways in which bar is eroding the rule of laws and don't let him get away with it don't let him get away with it implies there's something that public can do to stop him what can be done to stop him other than getting rid of Donald Trump well I think the Senate has demonstrated their reluctance to impeach William Barr even if the hollar to remove him even if the house were to impeach him but I think it is the court of public opinion is the congresswoman said which could create sufficient pressure to cause William Barr to resign we saw this in 2007 you may recall the Attorney General then was Alberto Gonzales and it became disclosed that he was behind an effort to remove US attorneys for political reasons if they weren't sufficiently quote loyal Bushies and they were also hiring people at the Department of Justice based on their responses to questions about their political activity and affiliations and beliefs once that became known publicly there was public pressure that drove him out of office what William Bar has done is so much worse than them that episode but I think we need to continue to push the this narrative this accurate telling of all of the things that William bar has done in an effort to create sufficient public pressure to force him to resign let's play one more piece of another clip mr. Solinsky who again is a prosecutor currently in the Maryland US Attorney's Office and this was his testimony on Wednesday that the acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia was receiving heavy pressure from the highest levels of the Department of Justice and that his instructions to us were based on political considerations and I was told that the acting US Attorney was giving stone a break because he was afraid the United States Joyce you know I think to a lot of people this activity sounds a lot like Nixon's second Attorney General who ended up going to jail you know the it's hard to believe that what Barr is doing is legal it could he face criminal sanctions for obstruction of justice you know interfering in cases could that happen to him after Donald Trump is gone so I think congresswoman Dean hits the nail on the head when she says Barr is acting like the president's fixer there's certainly more than enough information in the public domain for Congress to investigate and engage in oversight and we don't know what kind of evidence frankly that that might turn up Joyce oh I don't think we can take anything off the table I don't think right now there's something out there that just cries out for prosecution but there's certainly a lot of smoke and you know I'm old enough to remember a time when Eric Holder in an interview was asked whether he would continue on as Barack Obama's Attorney General and he just sort of quipped off the cuff that he was still the president's wingman and he took a lot of criticism for that comment he continues to be criticized for that comment bill Barr has gone gone so far beyond jokingly aligning himself with the president he has done nothing but act as the president's fixer at every step along the way to the detriment of the American people there has to be accountability for that whether it comes in a political forum or some other forum yeah let me explain another piece of testimony now this was mr. Ayer attempting to testify and really Louie Gohmert of Texas this is the collusion to the corruption because the the Republican Party is backing this to the hilt that's let's play that this is mr. Ayer trying to testify for his own role in the events in Lafayette Park come quickly to mine snow does his practice of regularly shrouding himself in the rhetoric and trappings of the rule of law even as he desecrates and undermines the institutions that make it possible you know Paul if the party of the president is colluding essentially with the corrupt behavior of the Attorney General it leaves the public very little recourse and I think that is what is so frustrating and enraging about what Farr is doing it appears that he is getting away with it first the problem was only that our wasn't acting like he's represented the United States or rather he was pumped fixer and personal defense attorney button al joyed things have gone from bad to worse because our is actively undermining the entrance of the United States he's working against the inches of our democracy remember the lower report was about influence of Russia in our election about how Russia tried to steal the election Barr is covering up and protecting everyone who was implicated in that investigation again he's not working for the United States he's working against the interest of our country let's play a little bit of a reminder because you know there were a lot of people who understood what Barr was probably going to be I mean he was called the cover-up general back by William Safire not a liberal a conservative commentator back in the late 80s when he came in he had a back-and-forth with Senator Kamala Harris and this is May of 2019 this want you guys to refresh your memory by listening to this has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone yes or no please sir the President or anybody else seems you would remember something like that and be able to tell us they have not asked me to open an investigation but perhaps they've suggested I don't know I wouldn't say suggested I don't know inferred you don't know okay a battle of synonyms congresswoman did he lie to Congress in your view sure he couldn't be forthright that's why he stumbled over his words and I thought the senator did a fine job of revealing exactly who he is let's remember this is also the Attorney General who participated in the removal of five inspectors general folks who were looking into or holding this administration accountable simple oversight that is a part of the echo equal branches of government you know the Attorney General bar is really a reflection of Donald Trump and Donald Trump is a reflection of crassness and cruelty disrespect you played that clip with representative Gohmert tapping the table the crassness the disrespect that we see on the other side of the aisle as they carry the water of a president who was unworthy of that we have a president who is undermining the rule of law is breaking the law daily with the aid and abetting of an Attorney General and those he's put around him and think of the time that he's doing this the Attorney General with the president is trying to tear down the ACA we're in the midst of a kovat pandemic 125,000 people have lost their lives and between disinformation and trying to steal health health care from people when they're already fearful for their health and their livelihoods there is a crassness and a cruelty that's why people are in the street it is about civil rights it's about humanity it's about basic decency and the rule of law and I I have optimism in these very dark days that we will see brighter days ahead and mr. Barr will get his due and hopefully the president would be roundly turned away this election cycle I'm gonna come back to you congressman just a little but I want to go really quickly to our attorneys and ask each of you very quickly as a round or as a rapid fire is what we we saw from William Bar when he was questioned by Kamala Harris perjury or contempt of Congress in your view and I'll start with Barbara well we have to know the facts it's very difficult to prove perjury you have to prove that he then in there knew what he was saying was false but I think with further investigation the case could be made Joyce I agree with barb this turns on what conversations Barr had with people inside of the White House or perhaps with people at DOJ on this same timeline if he in any way had the suggestion planted that he should open investigations and we know that he did by the way in his early days as Attorney General he began to revisit all of these key steps in the Moller report investigations so if there's evidence that he lied in response to Kamala Harris he could open himself up to prosecution and Michael Cohen testified that Donald Trump just let you know what he wants he doesn't have to explicitly tell you what to do there's a mob vibe to the way that he communicates with people what he wants and William Barr wrote a memo saying buddy I'm gonna do what you want I'm gonna give you what you need whatever you need just hire me it doesn't seem to me that much of a stretch to say that the collusion is sort of on the table that he was coming in to go after the president's enemies and to protect the president's friends from going to prison or to lighten their sentences or to give them a break it's clear that's all that he thinks his job is he doesn't do any other job so the question is could he then be held accountable for lying to the United States Congress in this case - the senator - senator Kahn Alerus you know Trump has talked about how he wanted his own personal fixture Trump used to be represented by Roy Cohn and now from has his own mob lawyer and William Barr who lies about everything Barr lies about big things like when he'd mischaracterize the mother report and when he claimed that the Obama administration was spying on the Trump campaign and he was about relatively small matters like when he claimed that the US attorneys Berman resigned when Berman didn't had to push back and say no you fired me and so I don't think that we should believe anything this Attorney General says and the trust the the Congress including the Senate has to take that seriously our Attorney General is undermining the rule of law yeah I mean there's a word for that is corrupt right that there's there is a word for what he is displaying here I want to come back to you congressman because we had a breaking news story this morning that I want to get your reaction to the New York Times is reporting that the Kremlin that the government of Russia was paying bounties for the harming the killing of US troops in Afghanistan and that some of those bounties may have been collected we know 20 US troops were killed in 2019 in Afghanistan and some of them may have resulted in bounties being paid by Russia by the Kremlin to Taliban forces Donald Trump knew about that he knew about that at least in March but probably earlier than March he might have known about it while he was being impeached he's done nothing about it he has had communications with Vladimir Putin at least we know on July On June 1st to talk about bringing him back into the g7 we don't know that he's done anything about it but the likelihood he's done nothing as a member of Congress what do you make of this information I did read some of that breaking late last night in early this morning it is chilling it is sickening it is and it's shocking but maybe it shouldn't be this is how rotten to the core this president is he doesn't seem to have any compassion or understanding he doesn't seem to really love this country he doesn't seem to really understand our Constitution he certainly Curry's favor with our enemies and disrespects and disregards our allies and our friends it is sickening it is chilling that we ask people to serve they stand up so nobly to serve and it's possible that Russia was doing something in putting bounties or have our soldiers and that this president would do nothing but notice with attorney general bars help he's done nothing about Russian interference in a 2016 election it's just sickening stays on brand well you know maybe we should be not so surprised because the president also sides with the part in the civil war the side of the civil war that was killing Union US troops the he sides of that side as well so it is a it is a strange strange presidency congressman Madeline Dean thank you so much for being

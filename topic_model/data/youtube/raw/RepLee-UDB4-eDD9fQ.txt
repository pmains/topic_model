any further amendments easily before I get to my amendment I want to associate myself with remarks of our ranking member and just say that this pattern of denigrating women by the commander in chief Donald Thompson is really a despicable message to my three granddaughters to all girls and all women and really should be condemned let me offer my amendment now this is quite a day this is a Lee amendment number one it's straightforward Rick will report the amendment an amendment offered by mr. e at the end of the bill insert the following section the authorization for use of military force consider done the gentleman was recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chan this amendment would repeal the overly broad this is the 2001 authorization to use military force after a period of eight months after the enactment of this act giving the administration and Congress sufficient time to decide what measures should replace it this is not only timely mr. chairman it is really necessary now in September 14 2001 I did not vote for this authorization because I knew then that it would provide a blank check to wage war anywhere any time for any length by any president in the last 16 years it has become increasingly clear that this AUMF has essentially provided the president any president since then all of our presidents the authority to wage war in perpetuity in fact the Congressional Research Service has found that the 2001 AUMF has been used more than 37 times in 14 countries to justify military action and other activities including warrantless surveillance and wiretapping indefinite detention practices at Gitmo targeted killing operations using lethal drones and the open-ended expansion of military operations abroad in addition to these activities this AUMF has reported we been invoked to deploy troops in Syria Afghanistan Yemen Djibouti Kenya Ethiopia Eritrea and Somalia right now we know that any president can unilaterally wage war under this outdated 2001 authorization the last two presidents have bombed the Middle East in Africa and President Trump of course is following down a similar path the administration has lost has authorized and launched air strikes against Syria sent more troops to fight Isis and now wants to send thousands of additional United States troops to Afghanistan and I know that while we may not share a common position on replacement of the 2000 AUMF many of us do agree that it's overly broad in this Authority is a major and concerning deterioration really of congressional oversight and war-making Authority and I think many of us can also agree that a robust debate and vote is necessary long overdue and must take place let me be clear with the 2001 AUMF still on the book in its current form any administration can rely on this blank check to wage endless war so I ask for an aye vote thank you Miss Lee for your comments Miss Granger Chairman I rise in opposition to the amendment at the authorization for use of military force called a a EMF which is amendment attempts to repeal it's better known as the 9/11 AUMF it's necessary for the Department of Defense to fight the global war on terrorism u.s. military forces are conducting campaigns against al Qaeda and al Qaeda affiliated forces worldwide using DISA thority we've agreed to this amendment would kill the 9/11 AUMF on a specific date following the enactment of this act and applies to all such actions being carried out on or before that date the amendment is a deal-breaker and would tie the hands of the u.s. to act unilaterally are with partner nations with regard to al Qaeda and al Qaeda affiliate terrorism let me be clear about what this amendment does it cripples our ability to conduct counterterrorism operations against terrorists who pose a threat to the United States persons and interest the amendment it tends to put in place a major policy change that is not belong in this bill my in my judgment the amendment dangerously and erroneously assumes that the terrorist threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates has ended the terrorist threat today is no less real and in many ways more daunting than it was when the Congress overwhelmingly gave the president the authority to protect us against those that want to do us harm while some would argue that core al Qaeda is weakened as events in Yemen Iraq and Syria have shown its affiliates and new terrorist groups continue to maintain strength this amendment would effectively eliminate the presence ability to address that threat our other emerging threats from al Qaeda affiliate or like-minded groups in North Africa the Horn of Africa and elsewhere therefore I strongly urge rejection of this amendment thank you Miss Granger mr. Visclosky name is Sherman I rise in a strong support of the gentlewoman's amendment first of all we are not determining policy under the amendment we are suggesting eight months after the enactment of this bill policy should be determined and there is nothing to prohibit to this institution from beginning that debate on July 11th when we returned from the holiday weekend it does nothing until a new policy is put in place so we in no way or  the ability of our military to deal with threats we face the world has changed and administrations have changed we are now under the third administration and we have switched parties since we had the original authorization we are now in the 8th Congress with switching of control of political parties since that determination was made we are asking members of the military to potentially give their lives for this nation we should give them some of our time to meet our constitutional responsibilities and to develop a current policy for their sacrifice Thank You mr. McClosky any when further comments of mr. Cole thank you very much mr. chairman I want to rise and support my friends amendment and I couldn't agree more with the ranking member and the subcommittees point of view on this this is something where Congress has collectively avoided taking responsibility for years the Constitution is awfully clear as my friend points out about where war-making authority resides it resides in this body and we've had leadership honestly on both sides that have put off this debate again and again and again as a matter of fact when the secretary appeared before our subcommittee I asked him would it help you to have a new authorization let me make it very clear I would support that authorization I'm very much in favor of taking the war to Isis and he said yes it would it's something that would help us a lot so if we're going to send people to war we owe them the support of the Congress of the United States the visible support and for those that have a different opinion that is fair enough that's what we're supposed to do is debate these things we're at war against an enemy that did not exist in a place that we did not expect possibly be stretched to cover this is just beyond belief to me so I think my general friend was lying often disagree but always enjoy working with when we have the opportunity to do it because I think she has raised an important point I think she's done it repeatedly and effectively and I think the Congress ought to listen to what she has to say and we ought to debate this issue and provide the authority I would hope with the Congress of the United States for what we're doing or if that's the wrong thing and the majority has a different point of view that would be the appropriate thing but it's not fair to ask her men and women to fight and not have the full support of the Congress of the United States behind them so with that I yield back call any further discussions I mean just briefly I Ryan rise in support of the gentlelady's amendment here those of us who live and associate myself with mr. Cole's remarks the fact that the men and women who serve us when we travel and we go in the Persian Gulf and far-flung places around the world they need to know that we have had the discussion we vetted all our interests we've had the debate and we're behind them we're behind what they're doing so I want to thank the gentlelady thank mr. Cole for speaking up and support this mmm Thank You mr. Ryan any further discussion mr. Stewart recognized I would read thank you I feel like my world is rocked because I see these two that have very different opinions and and yet I agree with you and as a former military officer I have on my father's wings he served in as a pilot in air force role or to five of my six brothers served in the military they have the courage to go out and fight these wars and they notice that we don't have the courage to debate this and to give them the authority to go do this and I know that for my friends who are in the military now they notice that Congress doesn't have the guts to stand up and have this debate and give them the authority that they're continuing every day and putting their their lives and their well-being in the sacrifice of their families and for every soldier over there there's someone back home who loves them who is sacrificing just as well they notice that Congress doesn't have the courage to have this debate I support I support the intent of the amendment I hope Congress will have the courage to do that I've been seeing that for several years now yield back thank you for Stuart any further discussion sure I got a limb just very briefly I just want to rise in the other fort didn't want to rise in support as well too I think that we've seen a disproportionate sacrifice with the military community who is going over and over again and I believe that we owe them the debate whatever side you come come on or come down on I think that we do owe them at a debate because the American people should have a debate on this via the representatives to decide what we're going to do so I just very briefly thank you finally Thank You mr. Taylor miss Lee uh mr. Ruppersberger men this morning I was going to vote no but we're debating right now and when two respected members of the military stand up and make a comment I'm listening barber lady you and I I love you I love the fact you you are in a position to take a lot of positions that I don't take but that's what we need but I'm going to be with you on this and I and your tenacity has come through and and I think right now that this is what's important for America and and that we need to move forward on this so we're going on with a vote yes thank you you're making converts all over the place miss Lee let's just be bipartisan messages and you you have been incredibly insisted and persevered on this issue for a number of years I think we recognize you and obviously the you have allies in the room and we share your your concern anyone else recognize that miss leader close Thank You mr. chairman appreciate your remarks and those remarks of all of those who have spoken on behalf of this resolution this should be bipartisan this is about our country this is about our troops this is about Congress and our constitutional responsibility to do our job and I remember and many were here many were not here those horrific days after 9/11 this resolution came before the Congress three days September 14th it was overly broad it was 60 words and I think at this point 16 years later given the nature of the threats we face that we should in a bipartisan way support my amendment thank you thank you Miss Lee the question is on the Lee amendment all those in favor say aye all those opposed say nay o been in the chair the eyes have it thank you Miss Lee our further amendment any further amendments

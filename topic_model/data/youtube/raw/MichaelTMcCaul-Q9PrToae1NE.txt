mr i want to start with you because you you know head of the nctc uh you are really the expert uh at connecting the dodds and you it did performed a masterful job while you were there you and i have worked with joint terrorism task forces they have an enormous challenge an enormous amount of data that comes through and many of which if you miss one thread of evidence you can be held accountable by members of congress like myself at a later hearing but these emails the 18 emails that took place when we were briefed by senior intelligence officials and they wouldn't give us the content they would just simply say the only word i can use is downplay the significance of these emails finally when the good work of the webster report revealed these emails publicly we all had a chance to actually read the content and the one that i described in my opening statement on may the 31st of 2009 major hassan he almost seems to be telegraphing exactly what he's getting ready to do almost asking for for permission for milwaukee in yemen is it okay for a suicide bomber to kill soldiers and innocent civilians yeah in the cause to protect our fellow brothers you know you and i have worked in law enforcement this was one of 18. the other one you know here's keeping me under rolodex you know to me this is a huge flag it was a big deal in san diego the san diego joint terrorism task force thought wow there's something there's something wrong going on here uh we need to start let's send a lead to wfo let's have them investigate the response from wfo is astounding that well we don't really see a terrorist threat here and they basically shut down this investigation until five months later uh when major assign kills 13 people 12 soldiers there is a department of defense official on the joint terrorism task force and yet that official didn't contact fort hood maybe it's the legal restrictions that you're talking about so we need to change that there are so many flags not only between the fbi two offices and i really commend the san diego office for their courage and bravery of trying to get to the bottom of this i fought the wfo office for not following up on this uh and in the military the way they pass this guy along knowing he's proselytizing radical islam you know with business card soldier of allah he's enraging his colleagues what do they do they just sort of they don't want to deal with the problem they went pass them along promote them send them down to fort hood so that so many flags in this case how could the dots were identified but they weren't shared how did this happen um well congressman i will say that i agree with you that it did not take long from my perspective to know that this is an act of terrorism in fact national counterterrorism center within a week of the event entered this into its uh worldwide database of terrorist events um based on preliminary reports and that was a not a conclusive legal judgment but certainly all the indications were that this was terrorism um i think in terms of the information that was not shared you had a breakdown along so many different angles san diego team i think did do a very good job and i would defer to mr winter of course who knows these details better than i but they were not even aware of all the emails they were not aware of the department of defense information wfo was not aware much of that it was handed to an officer who frankly from an outsider's perspective i think didn't have a really strong understanding of the signs of radicalization the two points i would make quickly in defense of how this evolved is one we do have to put ourselves back in 2009 to recall who anwar awlaki was then versus who he is perceived to be today and in 2011 2012 we understood him to be an operational leader in a way that in 2009 we did not that's not an excuse but it is some color the second piece is from my perspective congressman um idea that people would not go talk to him i do not understand and i do believe that if that information were shared with a broader group who understood radicalization there would have been increased pressure from headquarters to make that happen and that would have led to i believe a better outcome i can agree with you more i talked to the commanding officer at fort hood and when you'd like to have known this yeah i know i understand fights are complicated i understand you know you don't want to shake down somebody and you want to they could have at least watched him put him under some sort of surveillance and just maybe that would have stopped you know what would happen my time is let me i do want to go to mr winter um 18 emails wfo only has two emails some technology breakdown occurs where they're not even aware they can't even access they don't even know how to access to to get these remaining emails and i'd have to say yeah mr lighter i mean you as a former justice department official like myself this may 20 or third or may 31st email if you read this would that concern you congressman i look at one email and i look at the body of the emails and to me they are clear indicators of an individual who's been radicalized whether or not he has been mobilized to take action that's a hard call but when he's asking permission to to perform a suicide bombing mission against soldiers and civilians at a dinner to protect his fellows as i said that's why congressman yeah i would want somebody to go out and interview this guy who's clearly been radical and i think that's what should happen in this case mr winter what what happened here the decisions made endeavor based on a cascading set of circumstances your microphone yeah sorry i'm sorry is that better yeah it is the decisions made at wfo were the result of truly a cascading set of circumstances san diego set this lead based on the first two emails that were acquired from hassan to awlaki there was no fbi policy on the assignment of these types of leads or on taking action on these types of leaves the supervisor in wfo waited 50 days after the arrival of the lead to read it and to assign it he assigned it to a dcis agent who is a task force officer that agent waited 90 days from then to read it and to act on it under informal fbi practice agents had 90 days to work on leads either to elevate them into an investigation or to close them down so this agent read that lead and acted on it on the last day under that fbi practice and indeed conducted this assessment in four hours on that day so it was rushed there was that pressure that was created by their workload and these late assignments he consulted u.s army electronic personnel files on major hassan that was the entirety of what he as a dcis agent could have access to from the jttf that meant he received a brief and highly misleading set of personnel records that indicated that major hassan had a secure security clearance he had been promoted to major only 10 days earlier and his supervisors praised him thoroughly the only negative in those 80 some pages i believe was that he had failed his pt test but president i think he praised his research on islam in the military now hassan had used his real name in communicating with awlaki so had not tried to render himself anonymous the dcis agent concluded based on that that this was part of hassan's research on islam in the military and that the army approved of it at the same time there was no fbi policy on what's called a baseline collection plan that policy was instituted in september 2009 after this investigation but before the fort hood shootings that created a minimum of what agents are meant to collect when conducting an assessment if that plan had been in effect then this agent would have been required to consult the dws edms system which is the computer database on which all of the messages from hassan to awlaki and vice versa were stored thus he would have known of that and he had been required to search it but he'd not been trained on that database he didn't even know it existed so what he believed after searching fbi databases was that there were only two emails that they were sent in december 2008 in january 2009 which was five months prior and that awlaki had not responded based on that he concluded and his supervisor concluded that hassan was not involved in quote terrorist activities now did that resolve the question of whether or not hassan was a threat we didn't believe so we felt that this decision-making process was flawed and that they should have considered and conducted an interview of hassan based solely on the information they had at that time but i'm not defending the decision i'm explaining it you can understand how reasonably these men could have been led down this path by the combination of all these circumstances some of which were self-imposed others which were the result of a lack of policy others a result of an inability to gain access to those records that walter reed for example had i think those problems need to be fixed but i will ask you this question do you believe i i believe that gross errors were made in this matter that resulted in 13 people being killed 12 soldiers should anybody be held accountable within the federal government on our review we were specifically asked by director miller to assess whether any disciplinary action should be taken against any of the personnel involved although we found that mistakes were made we found that these individuals acted with good intent they acted mostly reasonably under the circumstances and that they were not individually responsible for some of the decisions that occurred because of the lack of policy direction for example one of the reasons we advocated the seven policies that we recommended was that if those policies had been placed had been in place and similar procedures then actions like this would violate them and individuals would be directly responsible and subject to is it your understanding these policies are in place now almost all of the policies are in place they're not uh some of them are being coordinated into a single policy the command and control hierarchy for example and my times camera running short but on the senate report they indicate the san diego office calls wfo and the response back is look we don't want to damage his stellar career and um something to the effect of this is a politically sensitive matter that was not cooperated by the wfo office is that correct that's correct but according to san diego that conversation well the first part that you discussed is is corroborated that wfo advised san diego twice that they did not believe an interview of hassan was appropriate because it would damage him in terms of his position in the military the chain of command would not take it lightly i do think that the american people and the families and the victims deserve that somebody in this government be held accountable for what happened professor i want to ask you real briefly with my limited time left you spoke very eloquently of your experience of a fear of speaking out within the department of defense you know we we have this uh individual that various of his colleagues are seeing these warning signs popping up they call him a ticking time bomb he's proselytizing radical islam talking about osama bin laden having business cards to say soldier of allah i mean so many indicators are there and that no one wants to speak out there's a fear of retribution within the the army and he's just sort of passed along is this a case where uh political correctness was more important or overshadowed national security it sure sounds like that uh if you can hear me it sure sounds like that uh thank you it sure sounds like that uh congressman um and frankly i think it would be fair to ask if political correctness also uh crept into the fbi for example we've spent the last several minutes uh talking about how somebody at the san diego office of the fbi uh had a troubling lead passed it on to the washington field office after which it went nowhere and one of the questions i have as i'm listening to these other testimonies is why did the san diego officer not uh stand up when it became clear to him or her that that an obviously unsettling lead was not going to be acted upon now one can argue that well it's obvious why people don't stand up in general because doing so invites complication in your life and life is complicated enough thank you very much um but this is where i believe we can actually learn something about and a mechanism that the department of state has put into place and that is a mechanism called the descent channel and it was actually introduced just after the vietnam war whereby um foreign policy officers when they see that the chain of command is going to be resisting uh their descent with group think with the subtle consensus that has been accepted for too long within the cozy confines of of of that department they can actually uh use this descent channel to explain why somebody higher up needs to hear a counter argument and they do not have to get permission uh from their higher-ups in order to be heard through this channel um i don't think that that exists either at the department of defense or at the fbi but it's something well worth investigating whether it works as it did by the way uh in the um lead up to the yugoslav to the balkan genocide and it was one could argue that that was the reason because at the time secretary of state eagleburger heard a dissenting voice through that channel and realized that the united states must intervene it was through that that i think we can learn a little bit more about how descent can be institutionalized so that it is constructive rather than chaotic thank you excellent point chair now recognizes the ranking member thank you mr chairman and

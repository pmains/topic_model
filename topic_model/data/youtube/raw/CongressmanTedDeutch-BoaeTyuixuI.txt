  SITUATION ROOM. ERIN BURNETT OUT FRONT STARTS  RIGHT NOW. >>> OUT FRONT NEXT, BREAKING  NEWS. A STRIKING BLOW TO PRESIDENT  TRUMP. FEDERAL JUDGE RULING CONGRESS  HAS A RIGHT TO THE PRESIDENT'S  FINANCIAL RECORDS. IT IS A DECISION TONIGHT WITH  MAJOR IMPLICATIONS. >>> ALSO BREAKING THIS HOUR, THE PRESIDENT DENYING DEMOCRATS  THEIR STAR WITNESS, BLOCKING THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON  McGAHN FROM TESTIFYING IN THE  MORNING. >>> PLUS THE FIGHT FOR 2020. BERNIE SANDERS DEEP IN TRUMP  COUNTRY. DOES HE THINK HE CAN WIN ANYBODY OVER? LET'S GO OUT FRONT. >>> AND GOOD EVENING. I'M ERIN BURNETT. OUT FRONT TONIGHT THE BREAKING  NEWS. A MAJOR BLOW TONIGHT TO  PRESIDENT TRUMP. DEMOCRATS COULD BE ABOUT TO GET  WHAT MANY BELIEVE IS THE HOLY  GRAIL. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FINANCES. A FEDERAL JUDGE AS ORDERED, THIS RULING, 41-PAGE RULING. AN ACCOUNTING FIRM TO HAND OVER  TRUMP'S FINANCIAL RECORDS WENT  ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2011. THIS IS DEVASTATING SETBACK FOR  THE PRESIDENT WHO'S DOING  EVERYTHING HE CAN TO STOP  CONGRESS FROM GETTING  INFORMATION TO FIGHT EVERY  SINGLE SUBPOENA. >> AS FAR AS THE FINANCIALS ARE  CONCERNED WE THINK IT'S THE  WRONG -- IT'S TOTALLY THE WRONG  DECISION. >> SO THE JUDGE LAYS IT OUT  HERE, 41 PAGES. HE'S IN FAVOR OF THE HOUSE  OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE'S ARGUMENT. THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THEY  REQUESTED DOCUMENTS FROM TRUMP  AND HELP STRENGTHEN ETHICS AND  DISCLOSURE LAWS AND ENSURE THE  PRESIDENT IS NOT VIOLATING THE  CONSTITUTION. SO THE JUDGE WRITES IN PART,  THESE ARE FACIALLY VALID  LEGISLATIVE PURPOSES. FROM THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE  WHICH OF COURSE HAS INCREDIBLY  BROAD POWERS TO LOOK AT WHATEVER THE HECK THEY WANT TO LOOK AT. AND THESE WORDS RE KEY BECAUSE  TEAM TRUMP AND HIS STAUNCHEST  DEFENDERS ON CAPITOL HILL  CONSISTENTLY ARGUED THE  PRESIDENT HAS EVERY RIGHT TO  DEFY CONGRESS BECAUSE THERE'S NO LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE. >> WHAT IS THE LEGITIMATE  LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE? >> THE PRESIDENT'S ABSOLUTELY  RIGHT TO BE FIGHTING THIS. THIS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE REQUEST AND HAS NO LEGAL LEGISLATIVE  PURPOSE. >> I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM. I'M NOT GOING TO REQUEST THEM. SUPPOSED TO SERVE A LEGISLATING  PURPOSE. >> THE TREASURY SECRETARY WHEN  IT COMES TO THE TAX RETURNS HAS  REPEATEDLY PUT OUT THE STATEMENT THERE'S NO VALID LEGISLATIVE  PURPOSE. BUT YOU HEARD WHAT THE JUDGE  SAID. THE PRESIDENT'S NUMBER ONE  DEFENSE ACCORDING TO THIS JUDGE  DOESN'T FLY. THE RULING THEREFORE COULD MOST  LIKELY BE RULED AS PRES  DEPENDENT FOR OTHER JUDGES WHO  WILL REEL ON SUBPOENA AFTER  SUBPOENA INCLUDING THE ONE FOR  TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS WHICH IS  HEADED TO COURT NOW. ALL RIGHT, KATELYN, WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT JUST BEFORE HE GOT  READY TO BOARD MARINE ONE AND  COMING TO WHERE YOU ARE. WHAT'S HIS NEXT MOVE? >> Reporter: WELL, HE'S  CONFIRMED THEY ARE GOING TO  APPEAL THIS DECISION. NOW, THAT IS GOING TO MAKE THIS  LIKELY THE NEXT STEP IN A VERY  LENGTHY LEGAL PROCESS BECAUSE  YOU'LL REMEMBER BEFORE THE  PRESIDENT SUED THIS FIRM TO STOP THEM FROM RELEASING THIS  INFORMATION, AND JUST THERE ON  THE LAWN YOU MISSED WHAT  HAPPENED TODAY. IT'S CRAZY BECAUSE HE SAID THERE WAS THIS JUDGE APPOINTED BY  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. AND HE FRAMED IT AS DEMOCRATS  JUST TRYING TO GET A REDO. BUT, ERIN, WHILE THIS IS LIKELY  TO TURN INTO A VERY LENGTHY  LEGAL BATTLE MAKE NO MISTAKE. THIS IS A TEST OF WHAT HIS  INTENT WAS TO DO AND HIS  ADMINISTRATION'S STRATEGY WAS,  WHICH WAS TO STONE WALL CONGRESS ON ALL THEIR SUBPOENA BANS. THIS JUDGE RULING TODAY SAYING  ESSENTIALLY THEY DO HAVE  LEGITIMATE LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE  THE REASON WHY THEY WANT THE  FINANCIAL RECORDS THAT COULD  HELP DEMOCRATS AS THEY TRY TO  GET MORE INFORMATION FROM THIS  ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THIS IS  RELATED TO FINANCIAL RECORDS  BEFORE HE WAS EVEN IN OFFICE. SO THIS COULD LIKELY HELP THEM. WHILE THIS IS GOING TO DRAG OUT  FOR A WHILE LIKELY, IT IS GOING  TO POTENTIALLY GIVE FAUD DOOR  THOSE OTHER DEMOCRATS AND MAYBE  THOSE OTHER JUDGES AS THEY ARE  MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE' STRATEGY TO TOTALLY STONE WALL HOUSE DEMOCRATS AS THEY  ATTEMPT TO DO OVERSIGHT OF THE  ADMINISTRATION. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, KATELYN. AND I WANT TO GO NOW TO THE  FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY  FOR THE FORMER DISTRICT OF  DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, APRIL  RYAN, AND THE FORMER  INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER FOR  ASSOCIATES PRESS AND AUTHOR OF  TRUMP, RUSSIA, A DEFINITIVE  HISTORY. THANK TUESDAY ALL. 41 PAGES, AND THE JUDGE, YOU  KNOW, TOOK HIS TIME, LAID THIS  OUT. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THE RULING? >> IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. IT'S A VERY THOROUGH OPINION  THAT LAYS OUT IN DETAIL WHY IT  IS THAT HE'S NOT -- WHY THIS  JUDGE IS NOT GOING TO INTERFERE  WITH CONGRESS' RIGHT TO CONDUCT  OVERSIGHT. HE EXPLAINS THAT CONGRESS HAS  VERY BROAD AUTHORITY. THERE ONLY HAS TO BE SOME  FACIALALLY LEGITIMATE  LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE. THE JUDGE ISN'T GOING TO DIG IN  AND SAY, WOULD I DO IT  DIFFERENTLY IF I WAS CONGRESS. AS LONG AS IT'S IN THE GENERAL  BALLPARK OF CONGRESSIONAL  AUTHORITY THE SUBPOENA IS GOING  TO BE ENFORCED AND VERY  SIGNIFICANT, THE JUDGE DID NOT  AGREE TO STAY THIS DECISION, TO  HOLD OFF ON ENFORCING IT UNTIL  AN APPEAL CAN BE DONE. UNLESS THE APPEALS COURT OR THE  SUPREME COURT STAYS THIS ORDER  THAT SUBPOENA HAS TO BE COMPLIED WITH BY THE ACCOUNTING FIRM  RIGHT AWAY. THAT'S RIGHT, THE ONLY DELAY  WILL BE THAT IT TAKES A FEW DAYS FOR THE ACCOUNTING FIRM TO PULL  TOGETHER THE DOCUMENTS AND MAKE  A PRODUCTION, BUT THE COURT  WON'T DELAY IT. THIS SUBPOENA IS LIVE, ACTIVE,  BINDING ON THE ACCOUNTING FIRM. >> APRIL, THAT IS BIG BLOW TO  THIS PRESIDENT. >> YES, IT'S A BIG BLOW. IT'S SUCH A BLOW THAT  CONGRESSMAN ELIJAH CUMMINGS, THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT AND REFORM, TOLD ME BY PHONE JUST  BEFORE WE WENT ON-AIR THIS IS  MAJOR, MAJOR VICTORY. HE SAID IT TWICE. MAJOR VICTORY, TWICE. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO  FIGHT LIKE HELL TO MAKE SURE  THAT THE GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT  REFORM COMMITTEE DOES NOT GET  WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DEEMED TO GET, HIS TAXES. HE'S GOING TO TAKE IT AS FAR AS  GOING AGAINST -- WE'VE SEEN IT. HE'S ALREADY DISPARAGING THE  CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE WHO IS A  BLACK JUDGE WHO HAS SIDED IN  FAVOR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP ON  OCCASION. HE'S ALSO -- IF THAT DOESN'T  WORK HE'S GOING TO GO TO THE  D.C. COURT OF APPEALS. IF THAT DOESN'T WORK HE'S GOING  TO GO AS FAR AS THE SUPERIOR  COURT, THE SUPREME COURT. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO MAKE  SURE THAT THESE TAXES WILL NOT  BE REVEALED. WHY? BECAUSE THESE TAXES HAVE  TENTACLES. IT COULD SHOW WHAT HE DOES AND  DOES NOT HAVE. IT COULD ALSO GO INTO COMPANIES  WE DID NOT KNOW OR COUNTRIES  THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN IN  QUESTION OF BEFORE. SO THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO  FIGHT. >> SO IF HE'S GOING TO FIGHT,  BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S IN  HERE BECAUSE THEY'VE REQUESTED,  RIGHT, INFORMATION FROM BACK TO  2011 FROM THE PRESIDENT'S  ACCOUNTING FIRM PERSONAL AND  BUSINESS INFORMATION. IT'S VERY EXPLICIT HERE IN THE  RULING BEING CLEAR THE SUBPOENA  INCLUDES BOTH AND BOTH ARE BEING UP HELD PERSONALLY AS WELL AS  ASSOCIATED BUSINESSES AND  ENTITIES DATING BACK TO 2011. HOW MUCH COULD BE IN HERE, SETH? >> COULD BE A LOT. LET'S BACK UP. THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE IS  BECAUSE OF MICHAEL COHEN'S  TESTIMONY. YOU KNOW, HE BROUGHT STATEMENTS  TO CONGRESS SHOWING THAT -- YOU  KNOW, SHOWING THAT TRUMP  REGULARLY INFLATED HIS ASSETS  AND DEFLATED THEM TO SUIT HIS  PURPOSES. THAT'S GROUND FOR CRIMINAL  INVESTIGATION, AND THAT'S THE  LINE CONGRESS IS PURSUING HERE. ANOTHER POINT THIS IS DIFFERENT  THAN GETTING TAX INFORMATION. TAX INFORMATION IS NOT GOING TO  BE MADE PUBLIC. THAT'S GOT TO BE KEPT, YOU KNOW, BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. THERE'S NO PRIVILEGES FOR  ACCOUNTING INFORMATION. THIS CAN BE DISCLOSED TO THE  PUBLIC. AND LET'S NOT FORGET ACCOUNTING  INFORMATION IS WHAT PUT PAUL  MANAFORT IN PRISON WHERE HE IS  RIGHT NOW. SO THERE'S A LOT OF CRIMINAL  INVESTIGATION THAT COULD COME  OUT OF THIS, AND THAT'S WHY  TRUMP IS FIGHTING SO HARD. >> AND THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING  IF WHAT MICHAEL COHEN SAID IS  TRUE, AND HE DID BRING SOME  PAGES FROM THE ACCOUNTING FIRM  TO SAY IF THE PRESIDENT WANTED  TO BUY AN NFL FRANCHISE, HE LIED ABOUT HIS NET WORTH. WHEN HE WANTED TO DO OTHER THING HEEZ LIED ABOUT HIS NET WORTH,  ACCORDING TO COHEN. BUT YOU'RE MAKING THE POINT  THOSE THINGS WOULD BE CRIMINAL. >> RIGHT. LYING ON A BANK STATEMENT IS A  CRIMINAL OFFENSE. LYING ON FINANCIAL FORMS AND  FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORMS WOULD BE GROUNDS FOR A CRIMINAL  INVESTIGATION. THERE'S A LOT THAT COULD COME  OUT OF THIS. AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE  DANGER THAT PAUL MANAFORT FOUND  HIMSELF IN. THEY DRAGGED HIS ACCOUNTANT INTO COURT, AND SHE WAS -- THEY  PRODUCED HER NOTES. AND IF TRUMP IS DIRECTING HIS  ACCOUNTANTS TO LIE, YOU KNOW,  THAT COULD COME OUT AND THAT  COULD -- THAT'S A BIG BLOW. >> SO HERE THE STAKES ARE  INCREDIBLY HIGH. >> YES, THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH BECAUSE THIS IS USEFUL  INFORMATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT'S FINANCES. AND IT MAY NOT HAVE EVEN BEEN  SOMETHING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF  THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION OR NOT ENTIRELY. >> RIGHT, THIS IS THE RED LINE  HE SAID YOU DON'T CROSS. IN TERMS OF APRIL SAYING HE'S  GOING TO FIGHT IT AND YOU'RE  SAYING IT'S A LIVE SUBPOENA. IF IT DOESN'T GET OVERRULED THE  NEXT SEVEN DAYS THEY HAVE TO  HAND IT OVER, BUT LET'S SAY IT  DOES HYPOTHETICALLY JUST TO PLAY THE APPEALS PROCESS OUT, HOW  LONG DOES IT TAKE BEFORE WE  KNOW? >> IF IT GETS STAYED BY THE  COURT OF APPEALS BY THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WHICH WOULD BE THE  NEXT COURT UP IN THE CHAIN, THAT APPEALS PROCESS EVEN IF  EXPEDITED WOULD TAKE SEVERAL  MONTHS TO GO FORWARD, AND THESE  CASES ARE NOT FREQUENTLY  LITIGATED BECAUSE USUALLY THEY  ARE RESOLVED BY COMPROMISE  BETWEEN THE RECIPIENT OF THE  SUBPOENA AND THE CONGRESSIONAL  COMMITTEE. BUT WHEN THEY HAVE GONE TO THE  SUPREME COURT THE SUPREME COURT  HAS GENERALLY RULED IN FAVOR OF  CONGRESS. SO THERE IS BROAD AUTHORITY FOR  CONGRESS TO ACT.  AND PRECEDENT. SO APRIL, ON THIS POICHBLT THE  PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WEIGHING IN,  HE'S OBVIOUSLY MAKING THIS  PERSONAL AND DISPARAGING THE  JUDGE. HERE HE IS. >> AS FAR AS THE FINANCIALS ARE  CONCERNED WE THINK IT'S THE --  IT'S TOTALLY THE WRONG DECISION  BY OBVIOUSLY AN OBAMA APPOINTED  JUDGE. >> ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S MAKING IT  ABOUT OBAMA, RIGHT. WE ALL KNOW, APRIL, HE'S DONE  THIS A LOT WHEN HE CRITICIZES  OBAMA JUDGES. BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S  IMPORTANT TO NOTE LATE LAST YEAR CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS  ISSUED A RARE REBUKE WHAT THE  PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO DO ON  THIS FRONT. SAYING WE DON'T HAVE OBAMA  JUDGES, BUSH JUDGES OR CLINTON  JUDGES. WHAT WE HAVE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY GROUP OF DEDICATED JUDGES DOING  THEIR LEVEL BEST TO DO EQUAL  RIGHT TO THOSE APPEARING BEFORE  THEM. HE THINKS THIS ARGUMENT WORKS  FOR HIM POLITICALLY. >> AND LET'S GO BACK. REMEMBER HE WENT AGAINST THE  LATINO JUDGE BECAUSE OF HIS  ETHNICITY. THIS PRESIDENT DOES THINGS LIKE  THIS. HE WANTS TO GO AFTER THIS JUDGE  AND SAY OBAMA, BUT THERE'S ALSO  CODE WITH THIS. THIS JUDGE IS A BLACK MAN AS  WELL SO LET'S SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT WILL  GO AFTER MINORITIES IN A MOMENTS NOTICE, BUT THIS JUDGE ALSO HAS  SIDED WITH THIS PRESIDENT. HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OBAMA  APPOINTED JUDGE BUT HE HAS HAD  THOUGHTFUL RULINGS ON THE SIDE  OF THIS PRESIDENT. AND IF THE PRESIDENT IS USING  THE FACT THIS IS ABOUT THE  PRESIDENCY, NO IT'S NOT. HE DOESN'T HAVE A GROUND TO  STAND ON WITH THAT. THIS IS ABOUT HIS PERSONAL  FINANCES. OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES  AND PRESIDENTS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY GIVEN THEIR FINANCES, YOU KNOW,  SO PEOPLE CAN PERUSE. IT'S NOT A LAW AS OF YET, BUT HE IS TRYING TO FIGHT THIS ANY WAY  HE CAN. AND BY GOING AFTER THE JUDGE HE  CAN'T STAND ON THIS GROUND. THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA, WE THE  PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE WANT TO SEE HIS TAX AND HIS FINANCIAL  INFORMATION. >> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. >>> AND NEXT BREAKING NEWS,  PRESIDENT TRUMP BLOCKING FORMER  WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, THE STAR  WITNESS, FROM TESTIFYING. DEFYING YET ANOTHER SUBPOENA  TONIGHT. >>> PLUS A REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSMAN DOUBLING DOWN ON HIS CALLS TO IMPEACH PRESIDENT  TRUMP. SO WILL THIS MOVE THE NEEDLE  WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRATS  ACTUALLY LAUNCHING SUCH  PROCEEDINGS? >>> AND THE FIGHT FOR 2020. TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST  ARRIVING IN THE OFFICIAL STATE  OF PENNSYLVANIA. HIS OWN INTERNAL POLLING NOW  SHOWS HIM TRAILING DEMOCRATS.  There are a lot of snack bars  out there.  What makes a KIND bar
 so special?  Maybe it's the whole nuts
 and real fruit.  Maybe it's the drizzle
 of dark chocolate.  Maybe it's because
 it's tasty and alhethy.  Well, there's only
 one way to find out.  Do the KIND thing. -We bought a house
in a neighborhood with a lot of other
young couples. Then we noticed
something...strange. Oh, could you, uh,
make me a burger? -Poof -- you're a burger. [ Laughter ] -Everyone acts like
their parents. -You have a tattoo.
-Yes. -Fun. Do you not work? -So, what kind of mower
you got, Seth? -I don't know.
Some kid comes over. We pay him to do it. -But it's not all bad. Someone even showed us
how we can save money by bundling home and auto
with Progressive.  Progressive can't protect you
 from becoming your parents.  But we can protect
 your home and auto. You try hard, you eat right... mostly. You make time. w..hen you can. But sometimes life gets in the

 Aussie Rules. >>> TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP  BLOCKING FORMER WHITE HOUSE  COUNSEL DON McGAHN FROM  TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS  TOMORROW MORNING. ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE THE FORMER COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT  CANNOT BE FORCED TO GIVE SUCH  TESTIMONY AND MR. MAC BEGAN HAS  BEEN DRIRECTED TO ACT  ACCORDINGLY. DIRECTED NOT TO COOPERATE. THIS IS HUGE MOVE BY THE  PRESIDENT TO DENY DEMOCRATS'  STAR WITNESS INTO WHETHER THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  OBSTRUCKED JUSTICE. THE WHITE HOUSE GOES ONTO SAY,  QUOTE, THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT LIKE THE CONCLUSION OF THE MUELLER  INVESTIGATION. NO COLLUSION, NO CONSPIRACY AND  NO OBSTRUCTION. OF COURSE THAT WASN'T THE  CONCLUSION, RIGHT? NO OBSTRUCTION. MUELLER DID NOT CLEAR THE  PRESIDENT OF OBSTRUCTION, RIGHT, EXPLICITLY SAYING HE WAS NOT  EXONERATED. MORE THAN 500 FEDERAL  PROSECUTORS HAVE SIGNED A  STATEMENT TO SAY THEY THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CLEAR THEY THOUGHT THE  PRESIDENT WOULD BE CHARGED WITH  OBSTRUCTION IF HE WEREN'T  PRESIDENT, MEANING IMPEACHABLE  CRIME. MUELLER'S REPORT OF COURSE  LEAVES IT UNDECIDED WHETHER OR  NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP OBSTRUCTED  JUSTICE. SO NOW IT'S LEFT TO CONGRESS,  RIGHT, FOR CONGRESS TO LOOK INTO THAT. TRUMP OF COURSE DOES NOT WANT  CONGRESS TO DO THAT. WHY? REMEMBER McGAHN WAS ONE OF  MUELLER'S KEY EYEWITNESSES. HE'S CRUCI TALO THIS IF YOU'RE  GOING TO LOOK INTO THE QUESTION. HE WAS INTERVIEWED FOR MORE THAN 30 HOURS. HE'S MENTIONED IN THE REPORT  MORE THAN 500 TIMES, MORE THAN  ANY OTHER WITNESS. EVAN PEREZ IS OUT FRONT. OBVIOUSLY NO ONE IS MORE  IMPORTANT THAN DON McGAHN. OTHERS CRUCIAL BUT DON McGAN AT  THE HEART OF THE QUESTION OF  OBSTRUCTION. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, DO THEY  STAND ON SOLID FOOTING? >> WELL, THEY STAND ON THE  FOOTING THEY'VE BEEN STANDING ON FOR 50 YEARS, ERIN. THEY'RE CITING ALL OF THESE  RULINGS FROM THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL THAT SAY THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE  PRESIDENT -- CAN YOU HEAR ME? >> YES, I CAN. >> OKAY, SO THEY'RE CITING ALL  OF THIS -- THESE RULINGS FROM  THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL THAT SAY THAT IF YOU'RE A CLOSE  ADVISOR OF THE PRESIDENT THAT  YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOW UP FOR  THIS, THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO  SUBMIT YOURSELF TO QUESTIONS  FROM MEMBERS OF CONGRESS  CERTAINLY BECAUSE OF THE  EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE AND THE IDEA THAT THIS IS A CLOSE, CLOSE  ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT, DON  McGAHN OF COURSE IS A LAWYER WHO WAS WORKING FOR THE OFFICE OF  THE PRESIDENCY. THE QUESTION IS, ERIN, WHEN THIS GOES TO A COURT AND THERE'S NO  DOUBT THIS IS GOING TO GO BEFORE A COURT. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK  BACK AND WE'RE GOING TO LOOK  BACK ESPECIALLY AT THE BUSH  ADMINISTRATION AND HERIOT MYERS  WHO SIMILARLY REFUSED TO SHOW UP FOR A SUBPOENA, AND IN THE END  YEARS LATER AFTER COURTS RULED  THAT SHE HAD TO ANSWER SOME  QUESTIONS, IN THE END THEY MADE  A DEAL AND SHE WAS ABLE TO  ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS. AGAIN, IT MAY TAKE YEARS BUT  THAT'S WHERE I BELIEVE THIS WILL END UP GOING. >> OF COURSE THAT DOES GIVE A  PRECEDENT -- WE'LL SEE WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE TIMING HERE BUT  OBVIOUSLY THAT IS CRUCIAL. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU OBVIOUSLY  ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS HERE FROM MICHAEL COHEN. WE'VE GOT NEWLY RELEASED  TRANSCRIPTS THAT SHOW THAT COHEN TESTIFIED, RIGHT, UNDER OATH. THAT THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL  ATTORNEY, JAY SEKULOW, KNEW HE  WAS ABOUT TO LIE TO CONGRESS  ABOUT THE TRUMP TOWER  DISCUSSIONS IN MOSKOW, RIGHT,  THAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY THOSE  DISCUSSIONS ENDED MONTHS EARLIER THAN THEY DID. JAY SEKULOW, OF COURSE, THE ONE  WHO APPARENTLY GAVE HIM THIS  DIRECTION. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT THAT JAY  SEKULOW, THE PRESIDENT'S  PERSONAL ATTORNEY IS IMPLICATED  IN THIS NOW? >> WELL, LOOK, IT'S A BIG DEAL  FOR THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER  PERSONAL LAWYER TO BE  ESSENTIALLY ACCUSING THE  PRESIDENT'S CURRENT PERSONAL  ATTORNEY OF WRONGDOING HERE. AND THE QUESTION IS WHOSE WORD  ARE YOU GOING TO BELIEVE? ACCORDING TO MICHAEL COHEN'S  TESTIMONY HE SAYS THAT SEKULOW  KNEW THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS  FALSE BUT THAT HE WAS DIRECTED  TO ESSENTIALLY AT THE DIRECTION  OF THE PRESINTDE, BY THE WAY, TO ESSENTIALLY MAKE THOSE FALSE  STATEMENTS. NOW, IF YOU TALK TO THE WHITE  HOUSE THEY SAY THAT THE REASON  WHY EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW,  COALESCED AROUND THE IDEA  EVERYTHING ENDED IN JANUARY OF  2016 IS BECAUSE ALL OF THE  E-MAILS, ALL OF THE  DOCUMENTATION ENDED THERE. WE DID GET A STATEMENT FROM  SEKULOW'S ATTORNEY AND IT SAYS  IN PART MICHAEL COHEN'S ALLEGED  STATEMENTS ARE MORE OF THE SAME  FROM HIM. ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE SAYING THIS  GUY'S A LIAR, DON'T BELIEVE  ANYTHING HE SAYS. >> EVAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> THANKS. >>> OUT FRONT TONIGHT DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN TED DEUTSCH. CONGRESSMAN, THANKS FOR YOUR  TIME. I WANT TO START WITH THE NEW  REPORTING TONIGHT. FORMER TRUMP FIXER MICHAEL COHEN APPARENTLY TOLD THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE -- WE'VE  GOT THE TRANSCRIPTS NOW -- THAT  JAY SEKULOW, THE PRESIDENT'S  ATTORNEY TOLD COHEN TO LIE, TO  PUT IN A STATEMENT TO CONGRESS  IF HE STOPPED NEGOTIATIONS TO  BUILD THAT TRUMP TOWER MOSKOW AT THE BEGINNING OF 2016. OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT'S FALSE. THEY CONTINUED WELL INTO THE  CAMPAIGN. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION? >> WELL, IF THAT'S -- IF THAT'S  TRUE OBVIOUSLY IT'S A VERY  DAMNING PIECE OF NEWS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, ERIN, IT'S  NOT TERRIBLY SURPRISING. THIS COMES ON THE SAME DAY THAT  A JUDGE SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT  CAN'T BLOCK THE RELEASE OF HIS  FINANCIAL RECORDS. THESE TWO STORIES GO TOGETHER. THE PRESIDENT CLEARLY DOESN'T  WANT CONGRESS INVESTIGATING  BASED ON THE OBSTRUCTION OF  JUSTICE ARGUMENTS SET FORTH IN  THE MUELLER REPORT. HE DOESN'T WANT CONGRESS  INVESTIGATING BASED ON THE  PERSONAL DEALINGS OF HIM AND HIS COMPANY AND HIS FAMILY. AND HE'S WILLING TO GO TO GREAT  LENGTHS, APPARENTLY, TO PREVENT  ANY OF THIS INFORMATION FROM  COMING OUT TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. >> YOU KNOW, TO THE EXTENT HERE  THAT HE'S NOW SAYING McGAHN  CAN'T APPEAR, RIGHT, AS FORMER  WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL -- CAN'T  APPEAR. THEY'RE SAYING HE HAS  CONSTITUTIONAL IMMUNITY. THE LEGAL OPINION FROM THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, OF COURSE,  THAT WENT TO YOUR COMMITTEE  CONGRESSMEN CAN'T  CONSTITUTIONALLY COMPEL SENIOR  ADVISERS TO TESTIFY ABOUT THEIR  OFFICIAL DUTIES. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE? >> WELL, I AM QUITE CERTAIN THAT IN ANY READING OF THE LAW AND OF WHAT DON McGAHN'S JOB WAS  OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE WAS NEVER PART OF HIS OFFICIAL DUTY. LET'S REMEMBER, ERIN, DON McGAHN FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT READ THE MUELLER REPORT HE'S THE PERSON  THAT THE PRESIDENT WENT TO AND  SAID FIRE MUELLER, GO GET  SESSIONS TO UN-RECUSE HIMSELF,  LIE TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE'S  MENTIONED, AND WE NEED THE  ABILITY TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM  HIM. BUT AGAIN THE ADMINISTRATION IS  USING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AS  ITS OWN LAWYERS AND IS COMING UP WITH THIS NOTION THAT YOU CAN'T  BE FORCED TO TESTIFY ON  SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR OFFICIAL DUTIES AND  EVERYTHING TO DO WITH TRYING TO  PURSUE JUSTICE UNDER LAW. >> I MEAN, I KNOW YOU'VE SEEN  YOUR FELLOW DEMOCRAT ON YOUR  COMMIT. HE'S NOW TAKING THAT STEP, AND  HE'S BEEN, YOU KNOW, VERY  CAREFUL ABOUT HIS WORDING. HE'S NOW SAYING IF McGAHN DOES  NOT SHOW UP TO TESTIFY YOU ALL  SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH  IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AND AN  INQUIRY. DO YOU AGREE? >> I AGREE WE CERTAINLY OUGHT TO SPEND JUST A MINUTE, ERIN, ON  REFLECTING ON WHAT IMPEACHMENT  IS. IT'S THE LAST OPPORTUNITY WE  HAVE CONSTITUTIONALLY TO -- TO  PROTECT THE SEPARATION OF POWERS IN OUR COUNTRY. AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT FIRST IS  MENTIONED MORE THAN A DOZEN  TIMES FOR POTENTIALLY  OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE AND WE NEED  TO INVESTIGATE, THEN HE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO OBSTRUCT CONGRESS  AND EVEN GOES TO COURT TO TRY TO OBSTRUCT US FROM DOING OUR JOB. THEN ANYTHING THAT WILL GIVE US  MORE TOOLS TO GET TO THE TRUTH  OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED, AND  CERTAINLY OUR ONLY CHOICE IS WE  CAN THROW UP OUR HANDS AND SAY  THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT, NO ONE  HAS AN INTEREST IN GETTING TO  THE TRUTH AND LET HIM CONTINUE  TO BLOCK IT, OR WE CAN LOOK AT  EVERY MEANS WE HAVE IN ORDER TO  GET TO THE TRUTH TO ENSURE NO  ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. >> IT IS IMPORTANT HERE AS THESE DEFYING -- THEY DEFY, RIGHT,  THEY DON'T SHOW UP, THEY DEFY  SUBPOENAS. YOUR CHAIRMAN JERRY NADLER SAID  IT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS,  YOU DO AGREE, SO WHAT DOES IT  TAKE FOR YOU AT THIS POINT FOR  YOU TO SAY LET'S DO IT, BECAUSE  AT LEAST YOU WOULD GET THE  INFORMATION THEY ARE DENYING YOU NOW. >> AND AS I SAID IT WOULD  PROVIDE TOOLS FOR US, MORE TOOLS FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD, AND I  THINK RECEIVE -- HAVE AN EASIER  TIME GETTING THIS INFORMATION  THAT WE NEED. LOOK, I'VE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR  ABOUT THIS, ERIN, I THINK WE  OUGHT TO -- INSTEAD OF DOING  THIS PIECEMEAL, WE OUGHT TO BE  RIGHT UP FRONT WITH ALL OF THE  PEOPLE WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM,  AND LET'S JUST PUT IT TO THE  ADMINISTRATION ONCE AND FOR ALL. INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THIS  PIECEMEAL TIME AND TIME AGAIN -- >> SO YOU SEE WHAT THEY SAY AND  THEN YOU IMPEACH, BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE YET? >> AND WHEN THEY SAY THE ANSWER  IS NO AS WE PREDICT THEY WILL,  IT WILL BE CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THEY HAVE ONE INTEREST,  AND THAT'S TO PREVENT THE TRUTH  FROM COMING OUT. THEN WE'LL SEE WHERE IT HAS TO  GO. >> THANK YOU, SIR. >> THANKS, ERIN, IT'S GOOD TO GE WITH YOU. >>> AND OUT FRONT NEXT PRESIDENT TRUMP LASHISH OUT AT A  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN WHO'S NOW CALLING FOR HIS IMPEACHMENT. >> HE'S BEEN AGAINST TRUMP FROM  THE BEGINNING. HE PROBABLY WANTS TO RUN FROM  SOME OTHER OFFFFICE. HE'S BEEN A LOSER FOR A LONG  TIME. >>> PLUS PRESIDENT TRUMP  SPEAKING IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE  JOE BIDEN IS CURRENTLY AHEAD IN  THE POLLS.

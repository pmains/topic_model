Mr Speaker I rise today to recognize national co-op month and the many coops of the big first District of Kansas with a history spanning back to the 18th century coops shaped the way American producers and consumers do business and in doing so these ventures have become an invaluable part of business in our own nation from a personal standpoint I remember my first adventure to a co-op as a 6 or 7 year old boy on a wheat farm in Kansas my uncle's would let me tag along riding in our 1952 Chevy truck and take that wheat to the Byrnes co-op and when I was there I got to take to taste my first Orange Crush pop and it was the biggest treat of the whole lot the whole harvest for me was getting to go to that co-op and get a little bottle of Pop over time though coops have grown for far beyond agriculture we now have coops across our district working in broadband our electric and gas service housing needs and so much more run by the people who own and use on these coops from Kansas to Kentucky from Alabama to Arkansas to Alaska these coops are voluntary and self-directed organizations the benefits are apparent take for example in KC one the fastest growing coops in my state which has donated more than five hundred thousand dollars to our local communities in the last five years the benefits of user-based economic control are going each year national co-op month brings to mind the hard work and dedication that goes into providing you and I with items and services that we take for granted every day going forward I urge my colleagues and fellow members to continue to work and support our farmers and ranchers our co-ops in their vital work for all America

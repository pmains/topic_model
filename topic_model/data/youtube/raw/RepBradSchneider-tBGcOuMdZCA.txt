Thank You mr. Speaker I rise to offer my bipartisan amendment to HR 1638 the Iranian leadership asks that transparency act I would like to thank my colleague from Texas judge Poe for joining me in this effort Iran is a bad and dangerous actor in a volatile region of the world which is why Congress has enacted sanctions in response to Tehran's dangerous ballistic missile program and support for terrorist proxy groups Hezbollah we must hold senior Iranian leadership accountable for their destabilizing actions in the region and around the world the legislation on the floor today is an effort to shine a light and focus our efforts on assets held by top Iranian officials including the supreme leader members of the Council of Guardians members of the Expediency Council and high-ranking military leaders specifically the bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress information on the assets held by seen Ian's senior Iranian leaders included in this report or recommendations on how to improve the effectiveness of US sanctions to prevent these assets and funding from being used by Iranian officials to further develop Iran's ballistic missile program my amendment simply but importantly expands this requirement to include Iran's human rights abuses we should be using every tool in our toolbox to make clear that Iran to Iran that its human rights abuses are unacceptable the human rights situation in Iran is appalling and abuse does permeate many aspects of Iranian society in Iran repression and persecution of members of different religious faiths including Sunni Muslims Christians and Baha'i is pervasive the State Department's international religious Religious Freedom report of 2016 cites at least 103 members of minority religious groups imprisoned for their religious activities since 1979 Iran has executed more than 200 Baha'i leaders and over the past 10 years has conducted more than 850 arbitrary arbitrary arrests of Baha'i individuals sexual orientation and gender identity are not protected categories from discrimination under Iranian law and same-sex acts are punishable by flogging and possibly even death arbitrary and unlawful killing killings are numerous the State Department's annual Human Rights report says the Iranian government announced 114 executions August of 2016 and the unofficial report suggests a total of 469 executions by the end of that year the UN puts this number even higher at 530 executions in 2016 freedom of speech is limited media censored and publications have been banned and closed by the government harassment and detainment of journalists continues and Iran citizens are not allowed to criticize the government supreme leader or official religion the electoral system in Iran is neither free nor fair in 2016 79 percent of the candidates running for the Assembly of Experts and 58 percent running for the Islamic consultive consultative assembly were disqualified by the Guardian Council and we cannot forget about the Americans and other foreigners that Iran has unjustly detained and continues to hold on fabricated charges including the following individuals who families member whose family members testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this year Bakr and Tsai Amick namazi Nizar czaka and of course Robert Levinson who has been held for more than 10 years these are just a handful of examples of egregious human rights abuses by the Iranian government this amendment helps ensure the funds held by senior Iranian leaders do not contribute to these human rights abuses and that US sanctions are best positioned to improve Iran's human rights situation I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important important amendment and with that I reserve the balance of my time gentleman reserves for what purpose does gentleman from Texas seek recognition Mr Speaker I claim time in opposition to the amendment although I'm not opposed without objection gentleman is recognized I thank the chair

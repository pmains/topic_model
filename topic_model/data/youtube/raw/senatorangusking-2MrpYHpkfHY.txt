Thank You mr. chairman I want to pick up from Senator sass and Senator Sullivan our entire defense Enterprise is designed for peace it's designed to preserve the peace and deter war history tells us that the surest way to war is to not be prepared John F Kennedy wrote his senior thesis at Harvard in 1940 called why England slept and it was an analysis of England's feckless non preparation during the 30s in the face of the German buildup of their war machine and how that in fact in effect encouraged Hitler to pursue his aggressive policies which led to the deaths of 55 million people over the course of the next five years we are either at war now or on the brink of war and the war is in cyber and it's a multi-front war and it's a complex war and as my colleagues have pointed out we don't have a strategy for dealing with that war and especially we don't have a strategy for deterring that war back when I was a kid the motto of the Strategic Air Command was pieces our profession because we had those airplanes and those bombs in order to preserve the peace to deter aggression and in fact the deterrence Theory kept us out of a nuclear war an unthinkable nuclear war for some 75 years my concern now is and I realized general NACA SONA you're the operational guy but we've got to confront this issue and this isn't a criticism of the current administration the prior administration did not confront it either and this has been pointed out repeatedly today we are under attack and our adversaries feel no consequences they fear no results they fear no response and until we deal with that we're going to continue to be under attack and what concerns me is that the tacks are going to escalate and that at the time we see a devastating attack on our financial system our energy system our electrical grid it's going to be then too late because we are going to be severely damaged in this country not only through cyber but the physical consequences will be catastrophic so I hope that when you are confirmed and I believe you will be that you will carry this message into the highest councils of the United States government in fact under an amendment passed to the National Defense Act in 2017 you're charged with a partial responsibility to report to the Secretary of Defense to develop just the kind of strategy and doctrine that we're talking about so I don't have the Secretary of Defense sitting where you are today I don't have the president sitting where you are today so you're bearing the brunt of this message but there it could not as Senator sass said there could not be important more important issue before this body and I hope that you will take upon yourself the responsibility not simply to be the the person who executes policy but the person who assists in the formation of policy and as a warrior you know best the power and importance of deterrence and that this is at the essence of our entire defense enterprise will you carry that message back with some passion general senator if confirmed I certainly will I believe that there can be no more important aspect of your job there are plenty of other aspects of the job and we've talked about them today when to split the two agencies when to change the to hat arrangement but I just I can't stress enough how important this is because as long as we maintain a strictly defensive posture we are inviting aggression and that aggression is going to continue we saw it in 2016 it's going to continue both in the realm of our democracy and our political system but it's also going to continue in other ways as well and so I deeply hope that you will make that make that part of your mission when you're confirmed one thing that I hope you will get back to us on and this is a different subject and this would be subsequent to your confirmation perhaps in the first six months or so is a an analysis or a report to us on the issues of recruitment and retention in both cyber command and NSA this is a an area where people are the most important asset and I fear that for a number of reasons whether it's the slowness of the clearance process whether it's the way the bureaucracy works we're not going to be able to retain and recruit and retain the crucial people that we need is that do you believe this is a part of what you're gonna pursue I shall senator if confirmed thank you and dr. Park I appreciate your work I'm overtime but I certainly believe we face serious proliferation risk particularly North Korea Iran Pakistan I think is of concern you're coming into this job at a crucial period and I delighted with your background in qualifications and hope you will pursue it relentlessly will this enter thank you doctor

well thank you to Senator Johnson and Peters for holding this important hearing and I want to thank the witnesses of course for being here today to talk about this incredibly important and extremely challenging issue and so the recent rise of extremism and domestic terrorism we know is a serious threat we've seen far too often across our nation from El Paso to Pittsburgh they said it from our houses of worship to our schools and it requires a concerted effort on the part of Congress and our state and local partners as I said in last week's Commerce Committee hearing on online extremism however we cannot ignore the fact that the absence of sensible common-sense gun safety measures like background checks is allowing hate-filled individuals who wish to commit acts of terror to access dangerous weapons far too easily I hope that alongside this important push for gun violence prevention today's hearing on this rapidly evolving homeland security threat helps us better tackle this nation's ongoing challenge with white supremacy anti-semitism and other hate-filled domestic terrorism but I'd like to turn to you OSI reform for a moment as we approach the two-year anniversary of the 1 October shooting in Las Vegas I represent Nevada I live in Henderson just not very far from where the shooting was as a matter of fact the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history we in Nevada are not only reminded of the pain our community felt but how the threat posed by mass violence is present now and we hope not but possibly in the future so despite this and despite the fact that Las Vegas had more visitors than any other year last year in history the Department of Homeland Security's principal program for funding urban security the Wasi grant does not take into account the unique challenges faced by a city like Las Vegas the UIC funding formula I want to explain this if you've ever been to Las Vegas we have a beautiful Las Vegas Strip great downtown area it treats those 30 major hotels casinos on the Las Vegas Strip as one one entity our airport of course right next to where the shooter was on 1 October another piece of critical infrastructure we have a vast convention a meeting space all of them soft targets although we only have about 3 million people in Las Vegas I mean in Nevada about 2 million in Las Vegas nearly 50 million people come there each year so between the strip and downtown Las Vegas a hundred over a hundred thousand hotel rooms critical infrastructure we have Hoover Dam Nellis Air Force Base just a few miles off the Las Vegas Strip major data storage centers are Nevada test and training range in our Nevada secure national security site so in statute you Wasi does not consider this so what I want to ask you is this and who ever like to take it please feel free how should we have reevaluate what constitutes a possible domestic terrorist target and how should we rethink our definition of critical infrastructure as the terrorism threat evolves and do we consider in Nevada that Nellis Air Force Base the training range the nuclear test site Hoover Dam and 50 million visitors are all within a small space how do we add that to the formula please senator if I may I'd like to maybe attempt to start to answer your question thank you for for outlining a number of those key issues I am I am very familiar with the UIC formula and I want to make two important points before I get to that that you accurately touched on in your statement as well two data points to share with you that over the past ten years firearms were used in 73 percent of domestic extremists related killings in the United States so in a major metro area like like Las Vegas or other parts of Nevada the the preferred weapon of choice to commit an attack is in fact without question of firearm and you also mentioned in your opening remarks you know addressing the hate and bias and anti-semitism and bigotry that is often the the underlying issue that drives many of these attacks it's it's so important for there to be increased training resources and engagement with state local and community-based partners to help address what is often the precursor to much larger incidents one of the things that that we've looked at very closely and that ADL is supporting is a current piece of legislation known as that no hate act I think this this does provide a significant increase in resources to state local and community-based organizations to incentivize the reporting and training and engagement on hate and bias motivated incidents I think as we start to think through making better risk-based decisions for resources having better data to drive that information is a key starting point so I'd offer that as something for you to consider we need risk predictive analytics would you say yes yes yes senator senator so when we're doing a risk-based assessment right we would usually do two types of assessment woman would be a vulnerability assessment which Las Vegas could be applied you know pretty consistently across a wide range and that's where you're looking at the potential targets but that would be matched with a threat assessment we didn't do this very well ten years ago so oftentimes I'd be on a Joint Terrorism Task Force training team bill and I work together on this we would go out to I'll give you an example Louisville Kentucky to talk to them about al-qaida and they would be like we have no interest in this right but we have other interests and other threats were interested in so along with just allocation in terms of resources I think is making a menu or options for how you allocate UIC funding for different things that are needed by those locations it isn't just an even map of the vulnerability assessment in Las Vegas is going to be wildly different from New York City just in terms of how it lays out as a city you think that categorizing the Las Vegas trip as one entity doesn't seem correct on its knees no no I I mean my vulnerability assessments would be based on the type of venues types of structures transportation nodes are extremely important but then on the threat assessment too it would be wildly different for Las Vegas than it would be possibly for New York City or Charlotte North Carolina or any of these locations so rather than making a very cookie cutter everybody gets the following I would like to see you hace allocation on both the vulnerability and threat assessments I'd be allocated in a way that makes sense for local jurisdictions and I think that's bringing in state and local partners we have fusion centers now which really under what tons of them right which understand these threats at a local level better New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security there I've worked with for about a decade and they've done a pretty good job of twisting that but they're you I see funding is coming out of New York City predominately right like that's how they're doing it and so there's constant battles about what to allocate on and oftentimes it's the federal government but pushing down this is what you need to focus on and state and local Sam but this is what my problem is so I would like to see better you know risk integration from state local up to the federal level I look forward to working on that our fusion Center brings together about 27 groups and that was the reason the October 1 tragedy wasn't worse than it was and so I look forward to working with you on reevaluating formulas in the future thank you

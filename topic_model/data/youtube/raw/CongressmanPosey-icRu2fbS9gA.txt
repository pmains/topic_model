thank you madam chair for holding this hearing on these important issues regarding the covet 19 vaccination campaign the vaccines are monumental achievement and the product of a massive government-wide effort to defeat this pandemic dr newsell you were part of the development of the protocols for the two vaccines that we're using today and i'm pleased to hear your testimony that operation warp speed played an important role in getting these vaccines developed tested and in use in less than a year you state that the closure of schools and lack of extracurricular activities is impacting the academic social and physical development of children with disproportionate impact on minorities persons of all ages are struggling with the effects of isolation extreme lifestyle changes and increased anxiety florida schools are open yet it's surprising that while the cdc says it's safe for schools to open we have states that are still locked down would you provide for the committee record studies documenting the harm to children resulting from school closures that you alluded to yes so um thank you for your your comments and again just to emphasize that the the damages in terms of the the pediatric population are disproportionate to minority communities so we as we're seeing in the adult population the minority and disadvantaged communities are more likely to get covet 19 and they're more likely to get severe disease from covid19 similarly the disadvantaged communities are less likely to have the tools whether it's the the computers the the think pads the um the mechanisms and the oversight for for virtual learning and so i can provide you references after the hearing but they are following falling more behind in their academics because of this disadvantage uh thank you thank you very much doctor and and each of the panelists can comment on this i'd appreciate it and it seems like there's so much to learn from our experience with this pandemic we need to better understand everything from the origins of the viruses uh and the development of the therapies and vaccines to the pandemic preparedness and collaborations between federal state and local governments and public health officials after 9 11 congress supported a commission to cut through the politics of finger pointing and focus on the facts last week i introduced legislation to do the same thing for covent uh do you think each of you that we could benefit from such a commission yeah thank you for the question i think in science have others have have suggested you know we have hypotheses we test the hypo hypotheses and we look to move forward at every step so i do believe that it's always helpful to evaluate what has happened whether it's an experiment or whether it's it's a program evaluate what went well evaluate uh what we we can do better in the future so yes i think i don't know exactly what type of of program or commission you're you're describing i think it would be useful for lessons learned oh thank you this is phil wong i mean certainly with most incidents we do after actions and hot washes and and uh find out lessons learned and what went right and what were wrong so that's always a best practice for um any event i believe thank you yes this is keith reed i would say that we have um we have learned a great deal and put into practice a lot of things we learned after for years of practice in emergency response based off of what you initially referenced occurred after after 9 11 and such those partnerships we've created have made a big difference in our ability to respond right now but there were things that did not go as planned there were uh things that we put into motion that certainly um was not the way we expected it to roll out so looking back on that and evaluating what worked and what did not would be incredibly value valuable i think it would help us move in ahead to ensure we are prepared for the next pandemic or other major emergency that comes down the pipe thank you and i would just add hopefully we can also learn from some of the behavioral and policy interventions how did we do at getting people to mask how did different kinds of lockdowns and and stay-at-home orders work and use the the 50 states and local jurisdictions as sort of case studies to see what was effective well i think the witnesses and see my time has expired and yield back here

hello warren democrats um let me start tonight with a very special thank you to sharon and tomorrow our two fabulous asl interpreters for this evening thank you both for being here um i wish we could all just be together in person we could be taking selfies and sharing stories and getting geared up for the fights ahead but we know that's just not possible right now so even so i am so honored to be here tonight with my friend my colleague my partner uh ed markey and that's for two reasons the first is to say thank you uh this is a time of tremendous crisis for our nation people are dying from covet 19 hundreds every single day our economy is being squeezed to the breaking point and people can no longer deny the evidence of profound racial injustice across this country and as if we didn't have all of that going on now the republicans are trying to steal another supreme court seat one that could undermine our values for generations to come this is tough it is really tough but leaders like ed and strong democrats like all of you don't give up you know what this fight is about and you stay in it um our job is to win up and down the ballot and that is just what warren democrats have done over the past few months we have been making spaces for new leaders and new voices in the fight for big structural change we've stood shoulder to shoulder with our friends and our allies seeing each other's fights as our own and no matter what we have faced we have persisted as of today we have endorsed and supported more than 120 candidates bold courageous leaders like sarah gideon taking on susan collins in maine jamie harrison taking on lindsey graham in south carolina and theresa greenfield taking on joni ernst in iowa and that is just a portion of just the senate list we're working on house seats and state house seats and state attorneys general we are going to continue to fight for progressives up and down the ballot and here's what i love about all of our hard work we're just getting started because we have a job to do in november beat donald trump but we got to go further joe biden and kamala harris need and deserve democrats up and down the ballot who will fight for the kind of change that touches people's lives there is just simply too much at stake pick any issue you care about and it is on the line in this election if it's dismantling systemic racism think about our choice donald trump stirs up as much racial hatred as he can joe biden has been clear that as president he will strengthen america's commitment to justice and he will lead the reforms to our criminal justice system if you worry about how student loan debt crushes opportunity donald trump keeps betsy devos in place and she is squeezing students dry joe is in the fight for student loan debt cancellation and tuition-free public college if you know the importance of appointing judges who are committed to justice republicans are trying to steal a second supreme court seat so that they can overturn the affordable care act and take away health care coverage for tens of millions of people and end protection for people with pre-existing conditions joe biden has promised to appoint u.s supreme court justices and federal judges who look like the rest of america who understand the importance of individual civil rights and civil liberties and who respect essential precedents like brown versus the board of education and roe versus wade and even with all of that said we still face an uphill battle and that is where you come in to make change we need to take action we need to keep working to build a grassroots electoral movement that can unite and excite democrats and excite americans to elect democrats up and down the ballot we need democrats who are not afraid to dig down deep and fight for what they believe in so today i'm asking all of you dig a little deeper because this is the moment we have been called to go to elizabethwarren.com and find more ways to get involved you know these fights are hard but you don't get what you don't fight for so i'm just delighted to be here with you today and i'm delighted to be here with my co-conspirator in the fight for big structural change ed markey ed how are you and susan doing you know we um here's the thing bruce and susan just have to accept the fact that there's some genetic malfunc malfunction that you and i have that we love this business and we are energized fighting donald trump every single day and and susan uh you know my wife my wife uh was the assistant surgeon general of the united states and when you're in bed in the morning and you say oh another trump tweet susan always says get up go and fight the republicans all day long you'll feel better so if you come home at night you've bought them all day and you feel better the next day you get up and you have the same exact cycle you have to go through you can't believe how bad he is so you and i we're just so lucky to have the partners uh that we have that that give us that extra push to go into fight every day and that's why it's so great to be on with all these wonderful people who are just as committed yep that's what this is about so tonight what what i thought we would do here ed is our supporters had some questions for us so the team has pulled the questions out and uh what do you say you want to do these i'm ready to go i'll do one you do one we'll get this done okay so i've got our first question here and i really love this this is from annabelle from california and she asked are you ready for this senator markey what do you think about renaming massachusetts to markey chooses you know i think my mother would like that but i actually feel that warren chucets has a better ring to it oh clever clever oh but really you have to admit we did have a lot of fun on primary day in massachusetts oh my goodness it was it was an amazing victory and you had my back throughout the the whole race and the whole warren universe uh was just uh at you know giving me the the win to go and to win that race because i ran on a progressive agenda i ran uh on all of the things screen new deal medicare for all racial justice as you're saying that have to be the structural reformations that we next january uh as soon as joe biden swung in that that becomes the agenda for the country so it was a great victory night but it was because the issues you know you actually have the charisma and that's what we're really putting really putting our shoulder to so let me ask a real question uh i don't thought that was pretty good uh daniel from new hampshire asks in order to save humanity from the worst effects of global climate change we need to adopt the green new deal or something like it so how do you convince enough people to bend the trajectory of our currently unsustainable ways that's an excellent question and from my perspective the green new deal is on the ballot on november 3rd the paris climate agreement is on the ballot on november 3rd uh and if we want to have fundamental change in um in the way in which we deal with the climate crisis beginning at noon on january 20th of 2021 uh as soon as joe biden and kamala harris are sworn in then we have to do everything we can for the next five weeks to win this election and from my perspective it's the moral economic environmental national security issue of our time and young people especially showed up in my race the sunrise movement young activists all across massachusetts and the country which came into my race and that was noted by all political commentators in america that young people showed up we think we might have doubled the under 35 turnout in massachusetts from 2018 that's how big the turnout was so from my perspective we know that we can change the world we know that if we just deal with this problem the way the oil gas and coal industry have done it for 100 years getting all the tax breaks they want but then calling it socialism for us well give us some of the socialism they've had for all those years and for win for solar all electric vehicles plug-in hybrids for battery storage technologies just get out of the way because we will bury the fossil fuel industry and if we show up on election day if we organize and then we get the credit for it there'll be a big iou on january 20th that we can cash in with the big structural changes that we need in our country so let's just go out there and do it the green new deal fundamental change it's all there for the taking but we have to earn it over the next five weeks yeah i i love the way you put that and the notion that we're in this fight and then we do have a big iou to collect as progressives and as people who care deeply about the climate crisis i'm so glad daniel asked about this you know i just want to say to you daniel i'll say this in front of ed we have such a terrific leader in ed markey he's helping lead the charge for the green new deal so that we can save our planet and transform our economy into one that works for everyone so i know that ed and i are going to keep pushing from the inside in washington but it really does take this outside push a big grassroots movement on the outside and that is exactly the kind of movement that the climate activists have built people are with us on this one more and more people are seeing the effects of record floods terrifying wildfires devastating hurricanes and this matters because when more people see what's broken then we have a better chance to change it and i know there are the republican climate deniers in washington they stick their heads in the sand they jam their fingers in their ears they ignore all the science they are bought and paid for by the fossil fuel industry but this november we really have the chance to just vote them out next january just like he had said we can start rooting corruption out of washington so that the fossil fuel giants don't get to call the shots anymore we can elect leaders who believe in science who will take bold action to solve the climate crisis who will help us do that while creating good union jobs and who are going to put environmental justice front and center i just i feel so optimistic that we put our shoulders to it over the next five weeks that after that we're gonna get this done so i love this excellent and you've got a question i have a question i have a question for you and this one comes from beth in ohio and here's what she asks she says my husband and i are both public school teachers i also have a good amount of student loan debt how can we make sure that we can continue the work we love but also provide for our two boys and not be saddled with debt or lose our jobs to privatization of education so first of all thank you beth for all of the work you and your husband do it is powerfully important you know when i was in second grade it was my public school teacher mrs lee who told me that someday i could be a teacher and it it changed my whole world i was able to live my dream and to become a public school teacher but that's because i grew up at a time when i could get a college degree for fifty dollars a semester and that's just not possible today so i think of this beth as we got to think about all the parts to it we need to tackle the student loan debt crisis head-on it's crushing millions of americans holding back our whole economy one of the best ways that our government can give meaningful relief to struggling americans right now is to cancel student loan debt i've got a plan for that with senator schumer for how the next president you're going to love this can use executive authority not have to go to congress use executive authority to get it done and like you said we also need to stop the privatization and the corruption of our public school system so top of the list let's get a new secretary of education starting in january betsy devos need not apply um that means keeping our public school dollars in public schools not forking them over to for-profit education companies so i'm going to stay in this fight with you and your husband and with all of the public school educators out there because i really believe when educators when students win and when students win our whole nation wins every kid in america should have access to a high quality public education no matter where they live no matter the color of their skin no matter how much money their parents make or what zip code they live in this is something we should guarantee for all of our children well you know i i was a commuter to boston college and a commuter to boston college law school and in the year in between i was a substitute teacher in the malden public school system for one year that's what i did i was a teacher and by the way that's a tough job no kidding it's a hard job and i did it for one year as a substitute teacher and i realized how how difficult it is how high the quality of teachers uh is and has to be uh in order to deal with all of the issues that get that get into a school system and uh and it's it's something that from my perspective i realize we have to ensure that the funding is there which is why it's a sin that mcconnell has refused to give us uh an ability to put one trillion dollars back into the local community so they have the money for the schools they have the money to pay for teachers salaries it's an absolute disgrace what he has been blocking us from doing but when i finished as a commuter at boston college in boston college law school i had a big knapsack of student debt on my back my father drove a truck for the hood milk company my i was born and then my twin brothers were born within 12 months my mother had three boys in one year and we're all going to college we're all going to law school together no spare cash so we had to all take out the student loans so i got elected to congress and i didn't pay back my student loans until my sixth year in the united states congress and what i had as student debt is just a fraction a fraction of what young people today have as student debt so that's why i support senator warren's uh student loan debt relief act which eliminates up to 50 000 of student debt for anyone with an income under 100 dollars and that bill senator warren's bill would provide relief to roughly 95 of all student loan borrowers and it would cancel the entire debt for 75 of borrowers that's the kind of thinking that we need in our country to just unleash all of this young talent to go out and do what they have to do without worrying about whether or not they can pay back uh their loans and therefore have to take a job they don't want to take no can't have the investment in a in the house uh in uh in anything that they might be uh otherwise interested in doing for themselves and their families so senator warren is the leader on this issue and once we win that's why we need you all out there to do the work that's going to be front burner issue in january yeah we got to do this one ed okay so now i've got a question here for from liz from illinois and she asks will you help address the issue of racism the protests and violence will not stop till it is addressed this is the perfect opportunity in time for great changes ed yeah well that is just a great question liz because let's be honest we have a racist who is the president of the united states of america and we also have a president who has been criminally negligent in the way in which he deals with the issues that have made it clear that racism is built structurally into every part of american society in fact he's trying to capitalize upon that racism as a way to drive up his vote so he can win on november 3rd so that's why we have to be out there organizing not agonizing uh for the final five weeks um and we just have to say look at racism is built into our educational system our health care system it's built into our transportation system it's built into our economic system and it's really built in to our criminal justice system we have five percent of the world's population we have 25 percent of the prisoners in the world not russia not china it's the united states of america we're five percent of the world's population one in three women behind bars in the world are behind bars in the united states not china not russia here in our country and so senator warren and i we've introduced legislation to uh to repeal qualified immunity uh so that uh we can get justice for those families if we just take the the judge floyd family we saw him murdered we have the film we can hear him begging that he cannot breathe crying out for his mother and now under the law that family can't sue that police officer even though he and he murdered george floyd so from my perspective from elizabeth's perspective it's time for us uh to put justice on the floor of the united states senate for a debate i like that every single aspect of these issues i think you're right on that exactly right ed we need big structural change to dismantle systemic racism and root out white supremacy you know as a nation as a society we have some serious soul-searching to do you rightly point out we've got racial disparities that persist in wealth education employment housing uh health care at a time when covered 19 is disproportionately killing black americans and when black businesses are going under you know sometimes it feels like this is how it always has been and how it always will be but we are not without hope the these injustices that we face are not inevitable they were created and facilitated through racist hateful bigoted public policies that means they can be addressed by different public policies brave inclusive moral public policies and the idea that communities of color alone are responsible for fighting against racism every single day is misguided and it has dangerous consequences so i want us to be thoughtful about the responsibility that i have that others have as white americans in this moment we need to ask ourselves what we are doing proactively every day to dismantle systemic racism in our communities in our workplaces in our circles of influence it is not enough to stand as an ally white americans must go further and be anti-racist to educate ourselves to donate to show up to protest to bear witness and to center black voices we we have to make real change in all right you got a question great answer yeah great answer and a question from paul from california if joe biden becomes president next year what do you see as the most effective means for citizens to engage uh to either keep or get him on board with a progressive agenda okay paul great question but first things first let's make sure we get joe biden and kamala harris into the white house next year that is the only way we're going to make any bold progressive reforms that we need in this country you know the good news is joe is a leader who listens he builds coalitions he hears multiple perspectives and his animating concern is to help the most people possible i see this as there is so much opportunity for progressive victories with joe biden and we've already seen that in areas like uh student loan debt where he is completely on board joe and kamala have already committed to strong progressive priorities they've committed to creating new union jobs and clean energy committed to increasing social security benefits uh committed to making our bankruptcy laws work for families instead of for the creditors who cheat them they've committed to making the wealthy pay their fair share committed to repairing racial inequities they have committed to fighting corruption in washington so we're going to fight from the heart to win in november and as progressives you asked how are we going to get things done remember we're fighting for the white house but we're also fighting for the senate and up and down the ticket we elect democrats up and down the ballot because that gives us much more leverage to push to enact bold progressive policies in cities in towns in states all across this country and to hold our leadership in dc accountable that's what we're going to do and uh and i agree with uh i agree with you elizabeth we we're at a moment here uh where if we take unapologetically progressive stances we drive it into this election day we show that they're winning issues that people respond to it that it drives up turnout especially amongst young people that we're going to be in a very strong position to ensure that we have a progressive agenda and joe biden has already made it very clear that that's going to be his goal uh but we need to make we need to make sure that it's reflected in the votes to turn out on election day because that will only reinforce the momentum that we need uh to make that progressive agenda the law in our country so i agree with you 100 good okay last question okay let's wrap it up with a good one here this is uh let's see who we've got here we've got eleanor from massachusetts and eleanor says i am so worried about this election and sometimes already feel defeated how do i stay positive and energized to make a difference before november well elena stay around young people that's what i just did in my race young people up they're activated young people are they're walking talking political antidepressants you know just figure out how to plug into this incredible network of young people who are organizing right now across the country online uh and uh and just stick with them because you'll feel that the future is actually gonna be better than the president or the past oh i like that that's my recommendation to you because that's what happened to me i got energized more every single day i got younger and younger i was like a political benjamin button in this race i got younger and younger uh the longer this race went on and you will be too so uh just find out where the websites are uh how you can plug in to the zoom events that are going on how you can be working with them to make the calls to to do all the work that's going to be necessary and you'll feel that you're part of something special that's going to be like 1932 that the big revolution is in place to leave that lays the predicate for the fundamental change the 1933 type changes which are going to happen next year so uh thank you let's and just get out there and um and get that work done so elizabeth what's your recommendation well i i'm glad eleanor asked and it's a great way for us to wrap this up you know i know these fights can be hard and we've been at a long time but i'm here today to remind everyone that this is a fight to put government on the side of the people we don't give in to fear and we don't back down we persist you know what keeps me going i'm inspired by all of the people like you who are in this fight every day i'm inspired by the people who showed up to do the zoom call because they care i'm inspired by all the people who are working as hard as they can to help elect joe biden and kamala harris who are helping elect democrats all across this country i am inspired by everyone who is making calls who is sending texts who's pitching in a few bucks to help in this dark chapter in our history we must remember that hope is not given to us it is created by us we are in a moment of crisis but we are also in a moment of change and in this election we do have a a choice we have a choice to choose hope over hate to choose compassion over cruelty to choose empathy over ego to choose facts over fear and we can't afford to miss it this is our chance this is our chance to build an america that works for everyone that's why we're in this fight ed i'm just so glad to have you as a partner in the senate i'm so glad to have you as a partner in these fights and i'm so glad to have you as a partner here tonight and thank you to everyone who joined us we're going to stay in this fight we're going to watch joe biden rock it tonight yes yes yes come on joe and we're going

we had a very productive meeting with the White House with nancy-ann DeParle you nor the president's advisor on health care where she walked through the president's proposal and members had opportunity to ask questions about it express some of their priorities public option public option public option absolutely public option welcome back to the edge show thanks for watching tonight the public option was a hot topic when House Democrats met again with the type White House staffers today nobody's a bigger champion of that then we are on the edge show but the Democrats folks you got it take this deal now you have to pass the health care reform bill which is the Senate bill over on the house side you know this just isn't a time to stand on on ideology at all it is a time to be pragmatic and deliver the mail to millions of Americans so they can get caught up so they could get some health insurance and we can save lives what's wrong with that now you can always make it better down the road this is the road we got to take but you can't let the Republicans and the health insurance companies win this round joining me now is congresswoman maxine waters of California who I want to talk about this as well is just back from Haiti but let's talk health care first if we can congresswoman the latest developments tonight we're hearing that the house leadership is saying that they can't change the abortion language and they're just going to have to do it and try to do it without the conservative Democrats of stupak crowd what can you tell us about that well I'm hearing the same thing as you know the house leadership had a session today where we went through the bill the Presidents Bill section by section members raised questions about all aspects of the bill there is some unreadiness in several ways but you know everybody is trying very hard to come together around a bill that you know we can we can live with as you know the public option is still up in the air there are people who would at least like to have an opportunity to vote on it by way of some amendment process I just can't tell you what's going to happen at this point except to say we're all trying okay I know you're trying hard what is what's your best instinct your gut feeling on the house passing the Senate bill taking what we have now labeled as the the leap of faith that the Senate will will take it and go back and do what they got to do to straighten this thing out do you think that Nancy Pelosi will round up the votes and do you think that house members 39 of them who voted no the first time there might be enough to take quote that leap of faith and to go with this president go with this bill and get it done what do you think as of today I don't think that could happen unfortunately I don't think based on what I saw in her today that there enough who are willing to take the leap of faith that's not to say that that won't change in coming days unfortunately it's taken us a long time to get to this point we can't rush it I know that I think the president said they would like to have it on the desk by the 18th I don't think that's going to happen and I think they should allow the time to be taken to work out these kinks and to work with members so that we can eventually get to the point where we will have a Senate bill that with some amendments that can be passed so no I don't think that the leap of faith could be realized today okay but again this is all about the Democrats yeah yeah it's all about the demo Republicans aren't going to be there it's all about the Democrats do absolutely that you're absolutely right we can't count on any Republicans not one this is all about Democrats and whether or not we can come together around and form a consensus of some kind even though we have differences and make it work and finally congressman congresswoman just back from Haiti I know you're concerned about debt relief what's your position on that what do we do for Haiti well I'm very happy we passed the debt relief bill off the floor I had worked out all of the differences between the Senate so it was one bill we sent it right up to the president so the president will be signing the debt relief bill in the next few days and that's going to help haiti a lot the money that they don't have to pay out in debt they can have to try and help do this redevelopment with I'm really concerned about Haiti I'm concerned not only about the rainy season in the Hurricanes these temporary caps are nothing but a formula for disaster I'm worried about the spread of disease it is a bad situation still in Haiti we've got a lot of work to do we need shelter very badly the tarps are the plastic that they're passing out to go over these lean tools won't do the job Haiti is in deep deep trouble congresswoman Maxine Waters thanks so much for being on tonight you're so welcome thank you appreciate your time

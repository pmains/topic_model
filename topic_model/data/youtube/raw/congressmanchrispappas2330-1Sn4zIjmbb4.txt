well good morning everyone it's great to see you thanks for spending some time with us here the topic today is uh the health and well-being of granite staters i think we all sense that there's some light at the end of the tunnel and we can't get there quickly enough um so we're really focused on what we can do here in washington to support efforts in new hampshire to support our workers who are on the front line and your feedback is really valuable to help us understand what we need to continue to advocate for as we move forward of course we just uh passed and saw signed into law the american rescue plan which is a significant piece of legislation it is big in scope um and so is this coveted crisis the crisis is touching every aspect of our lives of our economic life um of the you know health care needs of the people of new hampshire and so i think we've responded in a way that rises to the occasion there's significant support in the bill that's going to flow to new hampshire for state and local government that's really going to help our ongoing public health efforts and ensure that we can keep critical services in place in addition to that there's support for our school districts for vaccination to continue to support the ramp up that we've seen in new hampshire and to make sure we're doing all we can to keep people connected to their health care um at this moment as we're going through this health crisis what we don't want to have happen is individuals losing their health insurance because of a change in employment or not being able to afford coverage and that's one of the components of the american rescue plan that i think um hasn't gotten enough attention to date um there is support to make sure that during this open enrollment period right now for the aca that there are increased subsidies available for individuals this is going to really make a difference in lowering health care costs for the people of new hampshire we've called for this open enrollment period took a while to get it open the biden administration opened it up and it runs through may 15th and we encourage constituents to go to healthcare.gov and check out what their options are

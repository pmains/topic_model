now Senator John Hoeven Republican of North Dakota it was interesting senator that the republican response given by the new senator Joni Ernst Oh Iowa really had one hard specific which was a key stone is this going to be an iconic fight that will be waged for the next couple of years that I think your sides probably going to end up winning but why is it such an important issue to people not just the Republicans but some of the Democrats who are supporting what's the hard case for it that we haven't really heard it's about building an energy plan that makes us truly energy secure meaning we produce more energy here at all man working with Canada produce more oil and gas than we consume so we don't have to get it from OPEC and you see the benefit right now at the pump with lower gas prices huge benefit to consumers into our economy but it's also a national security issue we can't continue to rely on places in the Middle East like OPEC like Venezuela for our oil and gas I understand the argument but isn't it a pipeline through the United States not to the united states that it goes on to the world market it goes down to the Gulf and it goes to the world and we can bid for it at the world price but it isn't our oil it's the Canadian oil being sold to the world is not the case no if you look at the environmental impact statement prepared by the Obama administration the State Department indicates that the oil will be used here and in fact it goes to refineries in our country just on the Gulf Coast but also in Patoka Illinois and remember this isn't just about moving Canadian crude also moves domestic crude from states like mine north dakota and montana montana light sweet Bakken crude chris has got it senator do you have any concerns that the about the sort of sustainability of the oil boom in your state and in the tar sands if we continue see oil at this price the Saudis are basically telegraphed to global oil markets they are willing to deal with oil at this price where they're clearing a profit and they aren't in the tar sands very soon it's much harder in the Bakken Shale how long could North Dakota oil industry survive oil at this price so you're making a really important point here with that question opec right now is trying to shut us down they see us gaining energy English because they don't want that and so that's what they're doing is they're trying to undermine our domestic industry and our efforts with Canada so that they can reassert their market dominance and that's why it's so important that we continue to build an energy plan that allows us to produce more oil and gas as well as other kinds of energy including renewables but isn't it a problem senator if there's continued investment and they're willing to go at this price level for a very long period of time no if we build the right infrastructure and we have the right kind of a business environment we can compete and we can win this fight is this industrial is this a case of predatory price cutting by the Saudis yes that's exactly what it is they are undercutting so that they can try to reassert their market dominance so when we pay a little more in two bucks for regular right now in most pumps even in DC around DC that's really a function in entirely of the Saudis you're saying they're doing this as a favor to us on the surface so they can screw us in terms of energy independence I'm saying there's a number of aspects to it they certainly want to reduce that price too because they're they want to affect Iran Iran is a petrol dependent state also Russia which is supporting Iran but at the same time they know they've got to maintain their market share so that they can continue to set that price so it affects us as well and we're part of that strategy but we can continue to maintain and grow our industry if we do it right with the right infrastructure and the right kind of investment climate that also helps us invest in new technologies that produce better environmental stewardship including things like carbon capture and storage Senator John Hoeven Republican to North Dakota thanks for being with us tonight so it's actually been great to talk to you about that I used to appreciate it sir

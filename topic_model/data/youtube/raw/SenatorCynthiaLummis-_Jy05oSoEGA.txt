thank you madam chairman and welcome mr secretary it's nice to see you again i know that senator fisher senator capito senator lujan have already raised this issue but i'm going to raise it again because it makes you aware of just how significant it is in our states and that is retention of commercial air service in our small communities the largest regional airline in north america skywest recently announced it would be withdrawing from 29 markets due to a lack of pilots and of course what's unsurprising about this is that the most pull outs occur from some of the smallest markets in the country wyoming dodged a bullet on this one this time but it's only a matter of time because our communities are small and they're far apart so the economics are are are difficult for airlines so knowing those challenges and recognizing that in the west especially the rocky mountain west which is more sparsely populated that it's these are tough issues uh do you have any uh are what what are you noodling about on this within the the department so uh uh we've certainly recognized the importance of uh vas for so many communities let me mention two pieces that we're working on that that uh that touch on this uh one is as mentioned earlier to senator capito is that question of a pilot shortage and so making sure that we ensure a strong pipeline and you know support uh an aviation sector that is competitive in in retaining as well as cultivating talent is going to be important if uh if we're to prevent further cases where pilot shortage is cited as happened in the case of sky west as a rationale for withdrawing from eas the second those are our direct authority to uh to intervene in cases like this and that's what we're using in the case of skywest so uh proposals for replacement service are due next week on on the 11th of may and in the meantime we have that that holding action uh and then the third thing of course is just continued uh support in the form of funding for eas to make sure that it's able to robustly support the needs of communities where it is an economic lifeline in many cases and of course we we see that in particular in smaller and rural communities and on the essential air service side did you receive adequate funding in in the infrastructure bill does your current budget provide for adequate funding for eas so the budget request does include a an increase for the payments to air carriers account of 18.7 million dollars uh altogether uh in the the request it's a funding level of 450 million that's uh 368.7 out of the payments to air carriers appropriation and then the overflight fees supplement that uh that gets 81.2 overflight fees took a hit because of course there was so much reduced air traffic in the past a couple of years now we see that rebounding we think that will be helpful and and we do believe that the 450 million dollar request is robust to support eas thank you i i want to join with senator lujan who earlier invited you to his state you could you could hit wyoming colorado and new mexico uh right in a row [Laughter] and and get a sense of uh the unique needs of our states i know senator hickenlooper who's probably your next questioner would be delighted to host you as well we'd love to show you the unique needs of our states with regard to a variety of transportation issues because of our large size and population dispersion uh our transportation needs uh both in terms of highways and uh air service uh are different uh from what you're going to see east of uh the mississippi so by all means uh let's uh try to work with your staff to arrange for you to visit and get a sense of how truly different the rocky mountain west is when it comes to our our our special and unique needs and thank you mr secretary look forward to working with you thank you

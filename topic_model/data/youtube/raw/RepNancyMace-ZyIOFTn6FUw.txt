she is only halfway through her first year as congresswoman for south carolina's first congressional district and already nancy mace has faced some of the toughest ergo unpopular choices death threats and a nation racked with societal unrest she joins us now in studio it's so good to see you not virtually this time we're actually in studio um now some of the things that i've mentioned we'll get to that you've also got a few bills that we want to talk about but let's talk about your concealed weapons permit yeah so you felt the need to arm yourself yeah tell us more about this now and you know during my campaign i received threats as well and and everyone knows that y'all report on it too i had vandalism on my car on one of the days of my debates back in the fall and when december rolled around um the rhetoric had ratcheted up so much i was being threatened online on social media you know an individual wanted to shoot me threatened to shoot me and that's when in december i went and applied took all the classes got qualified on the range for my concealed weapons permit and it wasn't until this vandalism at my house that i really feel like the need to wake up and say you know it's time for me to start using this permit that i have do you feel safer do you feel safer now that i'm armed yeah i feel safer because i'm protecting myself and god forbid i don't ever want to have to use a firearm ever that's totally you know a last um last chance sort of situation however if i need to i can and for me as a mom it just it feels empowering i've also taught my kids about gun safety and i grew up around guns all of my life my first hunting trip with my dad was when i was five so what do you say to the people who want more gun control and who are opposed to the second amendment yeah well i mean everyone law-abiding citizens have the the constitutional right to defend themselves to be able to own a firearm any firearm they wanted to for folks that are proponents of gun control i would really ask you and ask them to really look under the hood look at the contributing factors to gun violence in this country and it's not law-abiding citizens who are following the law these are criminals and oftentimes there are people with very troubling mental health issues but at the same time we have laws put into place that have that are based in zero common sense so take for example a bill that i've worked on with congressman tom rice out of south carolina's 7th congressional district did you know that when you apply for a firearm and they do a background check if you're flagged and the fbi needs to do further research into your background they're only allowed to use a fax machine when communicating with state and local law enforcement and that seems so archaic it backs the machine what are those i forgot what effects machine i've seen one in 20 years i don't interested i don't even know how to use one i don't know anyone that has one i think they sell the paper rolls for them yeah i don't even but you know so our bill allows the fbi to communicate with state and local law enforcement with the phone with email online communication modernizing it but if you just sort of look under the hood there are some very common sense measures we can take that that would improve where we are particularly with background checks you had to realize though that you were inheriting some of this when you did uh take this office of course with the social unrest that we've been experiencing over the last year plus but i wanted to switch gears and talk about some of the unpopular choices yeah that i alluded to in the beginning and so one more recent one is the confederate statues right that you are a proponent of taking them down uh in the capitol yeah well we're not tearing anything down that's first off that's sort of a misnomer there but we are moving them particularly like the john c calhoun that's in the main rotunda of the capital will be moved elsewhere i represent a district that mother emanuel happened in this district and i don't believe the united states is a racist country i don't believe south carolina is a racist state and i want to be able to showcase and allow the capital to move on from our country's racist history there are many many great leaders that the state of south carolina could send to the capitol rotunda that wouldn't represent white supremacy john c calhoun was pro-slavery he was a big big proponent of it and said it was you know for the positive good of society to have slaves and we have so many better examples of great americans right here in south carolina we can send better statues the the part of the irony is too is is that you know and i've told folks like you know you want to ban critical race theory right on one hand and we're doing that but on the same hand you can't keep a statue that represents racism so you know the moral equivalent there we've got to be consistent in our ideology and we've got to move on from a racist history we want to make sure that we continue to teach our history but we have many better south carolinians that really express the values of our state and our nation that we could have there so you're not saying to erase history and that's critical race theory ideas fighting racism with racism so this is not this is not that no it's not that at all but but i mean you know we have better take joseph rainey for example he was the first black american elected to the u.s house of representatives he also happened to be from south carolina he actually represented south carolina's first congressional district uh he'd be a much better i think representation of our low country values of our south carolina values and that's really what it's all about at the end of the day um is ensuring that that whatever statute south china sends up there represents our values and we're not continuing um you know in the first congressional district in charleston itself so this is home to mother emanuel we've had a very troubling you know racist history in the last recent years walter scott was on rivers avenue in remount when that happened and most recently had jamal sutherland whose family were constituents and our constituents of mine today so i'm very cognizant of about what i have to do to represent everybody in our district i don't get to represent one side or the other i have to do my best job to represent everyone this is an excellent segue before we go to break real quick so you were one of seven republicans who refused to support your party's efforts to challenge the presidential election i have to ask you this before we go to commercial would you support donald trump should he run for president in 2024 well we're a long way away from that and we have a huge crop of potential candidates from our own ambassador nikki haley to ron desantis out of florida there have been rumors about tim scott too i mean we will have i believe a really amazing crop of candidates for 2024. all right that's a good note to end on we're going to be back in two minutes welcome back we're here with congresswoman nancy mace and i have to ask you what some of the challenges are as you move into the second half of the year when you're faced with the far left and we're talking about the infrastructure bill and some of these other things so what do you foresee are some of the challenges that you're working up against as we move into the next six months yeah i was really hoping and really believe that you know you could be nonpartisan on a transportation infrastructure committee what we've what i have learned in my first six months was which was a real eye-opener for me was that it is not nonpartisan at all it's been a very partisan experience which has been really disappointing for me um i think we will eventually get there but the last time we'd heard from the white house on a bipartisan infrastructure package 12 hours later they flip-flopped and then the next day and three days after that the information and the deal kept changing my biggest concern right now is we're we're back to just under one trillion dollar bipartisan package presented by the senate right now the biggest question that i have is how are we going to pay for it because there are rumors out there that the package pays for itself and that just simply isn't the case so i want to make sure coming out of the pandemic that any infrastructure package we put together that we're not going to have to raise taxes to do it okay perfect first of three bills let's talk about the whistle whistle blower legislation so so why is this a passion project for you i have learned that there are many whistleblowers within the federal government that want to come forward but the fear is that they'll be retaliated against for coming forward to to report waste to report fraud or abuse within the federal government and its agencies and so what we want to do what this bill does is is prevent that from happening we don't want whistleblowers to be retaliated against or investigated for being whistleblowers so we want to make sure that those individuals are protected now i have been approached by whistleblowers on fraudulent federal contracts i've been approached about kids and migrants at the border and the issues down there and there are so many issues that we could approach with it's really been surprising to me how many people want to come forward but are afraid to that's fascinating all right this is a big one the second one i want to talk about cyber attacks news just came out an enormous one out of russia purportedly um demanding 70 million dollars in bitcoin so here's another one where you want to control and you want to promote uh more tech savvy americans homegrown tech savvy americans so why do you think we're falling so far behind the rest of the world when it comes to cyberspace we don't have the talent right now i mean i mean truly we are not getting kids ready when they're in high school than for college for many of these jobs we have such a significant and severe need in cyber security today really is national security we saw that with colonial pipeline our gas prices went up and never went back down just last year in 2020 there were 11 federal agencies that were targeted by hackers aligned with russia and so we want to make sure with this particular cyber security legislation that we're protecting the data of americans within different federal agencies and we're going to do a study and if it works we will then scale up and do it across the federal government but also we've got to make sure that we support private industry i mean they're getting hit left and right we're seeing the bitcoin ransoms almost every week and it's increasing it's not going away and we also need to make sure and i hope that our educational institutions i know in the low country we're doing more about this but getting our students ready for many many job opportunities to help us fight cyber cyber attacks let me ask you this what are your feelings about banning ransom payments and there's a few states out there who who want to put an all-out ban or at least a partial ban on companies paying these ransoms it's kind of a catch-22 yeah if you do you get rid of them for a time but then you're also feeding into their operations yeah i would want it i would want to study it further and one of the problems that we're having right now is that in some cases i know this i've talked to private industry and private companies here in the low country that have been attacked as the federal government will sometimes sue the companies that did just that were just hacked and so but then they've got to go out and spend tens if not 50 50 million dollars right um beefing up their online security and we just got to make sure we're not hurting the very companies that need protection and then on the flip side there's also tax incentives so it's a very mixed message it's a very mixed message and so we want to make sure that we're supporting industry these attacks are not going away they're increasing we've got to make sure at the federal level and then at the you know within industry that we're giving everyone the resources and the ability to protect themselves let's talk about fairness and farming act we've got a lot of farmers here in south carolina so what does this bill propose to do this this bill will protect our small farmers so right now the check off program money is often spent from that program and given to big lobbying firms that protect big farming um a lot of small small farmers feel left behind and their values are not represented and they're they're they're an extinct breed really and we want to protect small farmers um and we want to make sure they are able to grow and not not close down and shut down they've been particularly hard hit during covet 19. got your hands full my goodness it's been a whirlwind so far this year and you've got six more months to go before december yeah congresswoman nancy mays thank you so much for joining us

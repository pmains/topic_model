senator kevin kramer of north dakota senator kramer welcome i just want to get your take on this uh pre-dawn raid in mar-a-lago is this a weaponization of the uh alleged uh legal beagles at the justice department of the fbi how do you see this senator well first of all i think that the department of justice is to be um feared by every american and have for a long time i think they the concentration of power that they have the power they have even over individual agencies through their you know so that this um bank of lawyers that once they take on a case the agency that they're taking it on for that they're supposed to be working for loses all control so i've i've thought the doj should be busted up a long long time ago but this raid particularly in the context of the times we're living in uh is very concerning and larry you know they could clear a lot of it up with just a lot more transparency i know that's not a new argument but show us the subpoena crying out loud it's not like this happens every day this does you know this requires a further explanation or else we're left to presume the worst well show us the warrant i mean no one can see the warrant and whether there's any fourth amendment uh implications here or i mean the silence is just deafening and i think that's adding to the problem but i mean isn't there a double standard as greg jarrett said a few moments ago i mean with respect to classified documents hillary clinton walked away with them james comey walked away with them and by the way the fbi had the hunter biden laptop for a long long time they didn't take any actions it seems like a double standard and it's really aimed at stopping trump isn't it it's they don't want to oh look just my view okay i don't want to get too crazy about this but i think all this stuff uh they don't want donald trump to run for president again well well and here's what's sort of crazy and i've often wondered about the motives of democrats when they do these things but it is very unlikely that anything that they could come up with would prevent donald trump from running or being president it looks to me like they're driving him right into the arms of the american people at which point all of this history that they're creating for themselves is not going to endear them any more to the to the future and former president if that's the case i i for life me don't understand their strategy other than their soul fueled by hatred that they can't even let a former president just enjoy his you know his status as a retired president let's uh turn to one of the worst bills i've ever seen and that's the schumer mansion reconciliation bill which i label as pathetic so let me ask you about the epa okay we talked a lot about it you and i were texting over the weekend i appreciated that how much new power and authority will the epa have in the war against fossil fuels well it's there's not a lot of quote authority per se but there's a lot of money and appropriations and and a lot of it the epa will oversee a lot of the department of energy will oversee and anytime that you have money you have power now what what we were talking about over the weekend sort of interesting because as you recall in last week when i was on with you and when andy wheeler was on with you we pointed to very specific appropriations that were designed to regulate the power sector for example in certain parts of the code which are absolutely contrary to what the west virginia versus epa ruling was ironically joe manchin authors a bill that tries to give the epa more power over west virginia that was all struck it was all stricken out so shelly more capital and i both had amendments to directly address this and before our amendments could even be voted on the parliamentarian ruled those those areas out of order so from an authority standpoint um i think you know some decent work was done but you just can't take 369 billion dollars and spread it over a few agencies and expect there not to be some you know some mischief that goes along with that money don't know if you saw the wall street journal editorial today on this but bjorn lomborg who's a very well regarded climate guy climate scientist he ran some numbers using the un uh climate model and all this money that's been plugged in uh in this terrible bill and said basically it will have no impact essentially will have no impact on global warming none nada now whatever four or five hundred billion dollars later nothing is changing except i would say the war against fossil fuels in the u.s continues and the epa is going to be a leader no question about seoul to to that point if the united states of america cease to exist tomorrow so there's no more coal no more you know traffic no jet airplanes no flagellating cattle i mean no none of this awful co2 going into the the into the air first of all the world would die of hunger but beyond that the temperature would make a difference of 0.3 percent forever 0.3 if we didn't even exist so the wall street journal editorial is absolutely right this larry we had a hearing last week in the banking committee that the democrats put up called the economic impact of climate change i changed it to the economic impact of climate change overreaction or climate hysteria the real damage to the economy is the response to climate change the reality is that the united states of america has been a leader in decarbonization as you know and the best way to decarbonize or at least to reduce carbon in the global global remember this is a global issue would be to to produce more american energy and and export more american energy because we do it so much cleaner and better than anyone else yeah i mean that was that was rick perry's thought i don't know several months ago on the show if we exported you know more and more and more lng exported american lng the cleanest in the world to china to india to africa we would do more to solve global warming instead of ending or destroying our fossil fuel industry i mean that was rich and wouldn't that yeah and wouldn't it be wonderful to have another area of trade surplus rather than be you know a trade deficit with china and other countries food is one of the areas where we have a surplus energy should be another one of those areas where we'd have a trade surplus that is good for the world and that's good for the united states and certainly good for the free world thank you senator kramer kevin kramer we appreciate it sir as always always my pleasure

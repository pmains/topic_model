we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw hey guys welcome back um this is going to be a really important podcast i think you guys are really going to enjoy this one i have with me joe jamaldi he is the president of the houston police officers union uh in 2019 he was elected as the vp of the fraternal order of police he was also at the nypd before coming to houston where all good people come uh and back in 2008 uh so what you came from new jersey right joe i did not come from new jersey that's right that's a dirty rumor that i thought you said i was trying to spread here all right where are you from uh born and raised in new york got a weird texas accent it's kind of a hybrid at this point is it oh yeah it's a little bit of a hybrid when i talk to folks from new york they say well now you got a little bit of both to go in there and of course i throw the y'all out there to make people feel more comfortable yeah yeah that's all you got to do yeah houston you know houston's a huge mix of people anyway um it's uh well hey welcome to the show um it's good to have you on we got some important topics to to hit uh so kind of want to make sure you get all your bio so you were at nypd then you came to houston pd and then you uh then you became the union head when did you become the head of the union here so i became the president about two and a half years ago after uh spending five years as the vice president but yeah i started my career in the nypd did three years there i was tired of living in a shoebox apartment you know the type that's so small when you open your bedroom door it hits your bed so finally i wanted something different for my life uh and moved down to houston it was the best decision i ever made better quality life cheaper living by choice i i love this city uh it's the type of place where you can literally come here with nothing as i did just a car full of clothes and as long as you're willing to work hard doesn't matter who your dad is who your mom is what connections you have as long as you're willing to work hard you can accomplish a lot it's america man yep um and america is going through a hard time right now and um and uh the police are at the center of this hard time uh police morale i'm sure is is low crime in america is is skyrocketing i think um just in houston you give me some numbers so i'm going to start out with a bunch of these numbers just to give everybody some context about about what we're going to be talking about we'll probably go back to some of these stats but here in houston murder is up 40 this year over last um that's 45 more people murdered than last aggravated assaults up uh 25 violent crime overall 10 percent um i'm sure it's still down since like the 90s you know we've had a huge decrease in crime maybe we should talk about why that is in a little bit it's also important to know okay officer involved shootings you sent me these numbers and these these are just all shootings that it doesn't distinguish between armed and unarmed people um 2017 15 2018 18 shootings 2019 21 uh 2020 just nine so far trending to still be under 20. so pretty consistently under 20 officer involved shootings in the city of houston and how many people do we have here like four million um okay there's an average two million documented um encounters between police and the public every year last year you guys got 276 complaints from citizens on our officers you know depending on how you look at that you could say that's a ton or very little but there's two million documented interactions and so you know you take it with what you will officer on officer internal affairs complaints over 850. so you guys are a bunch of tattletails but you complain on each other three to one over citizens i've heard that to be the case in a lot of precincts not just not just houston i keep hearing that um and so let's go through some more more numbers violence against police officers in 2019 nationwide we had 293 people or sorry officers people being officers shot roughly one every 29 hours that was over a 20 increase from 2018. in 2020 so far we've seen 144 officers shot um i don't know if that's changed since you sent me this email like just a few days ago but let's say it's a 144 on pace to be exactly basically as last year um so how is i mean how is morale in the police force right now well i can tell you right now this is no secret to anybody that's a police officer i've been one for 15 years this is the worst i've ever seen it morale is completely in the tank i'll give you some perspective last year law enforcement applications were down 63 percent in this country wow 63 what do you think those numbers are going to look like this year after we've had the wave of anti-police rhetoric that has gone on since the george floyd incident our officers are basically saying i'm looking for another job we actually had an officer on the skirmish line as soon as it was completed he went to a sergeant said i'm done he goes well no we still got a few more hours in your shift he goes no no you don't understand i'm done meaning i quit and he walked off the line uh those are the type of decisions that these folks are making i was going to call them kids because that's what they are they're in their early 20s they're racially diverse yeah what is the racial diversity of houston pd yeah so we're actually a majority minority department we're about 40 percent white 29 hispanic 21 black uh 78 asian and the rest is just a mix um but we reflect the community that we serve we look like our community and not every department's like that but most big city departments that you'll see are like that but we have these uh young officers that are the best trained that we've ever had the best educated that we've ever had the most diverse and they're the ones that are getting screened out on the front line and and getting the absolute worst of humanity thrown at them i mean they're screaming racial epitaphs at them they're calling them every name in the book and i'll be honest too our minority officers get it worse than our white officers yeah what is it like when a one of these white marxists um and there's a lot i don't know that we saw a whole lot of them here in houston this isn't like a antifa breeding ground thank goodness um but but you see it across the country do you hear from these bla i've seen pictures of a black officer trying to hold the line and these white people just screaming at him that he's a racist like what the heck is going on well it's completely ridiculous and then you hear folks from the tolerant left are calling everybody a racist and it's like you are the ones screaming in these officers faces who by the way are there to protect their right to protest the police they're out there putting their lives on the line to make sure that these folks can have a right to protest and then you're yelling every obscenity in the world at them it's completely ridiculous and one of the things i brought up and this wasn't just for these protests i've brought this up for mass protest or or any other protest everybody has their right to protest in this country it's it's a fundamental right that we have and we respect it and we support it where does it say that you get to scream in another human being's face and call them the worst names imaginable where does it say that you get to assault them where does it say that you get to throw a brick at them and we we need to get some sort of semblance of normalcy back to the country where yes you can protest but there's also a very firm line in the sand about what you can and cannot do to our police officers and the whole thing's gotten out of hand now they and it's obvious why morale is low and i'm always just i'm still curious about how minority police officers feel about all this because when they take off the uniform do they do they feel like there's something to this to this story that they're more likely to get pulled over even though they're not doing anything do they talk to you about that i mean is there is there some semblance of truth to it like what's the you know i think it depends on the individual officer and it's his or her own personal experiences but something i try to do to be a bit more empathetic to folks is when i see something that happens in our community or any other community where the suspect may be black i'll call black officers that i'm friends with and say what was your take on this and i think that can go really a long way when you talk about anything if you're willing to take yourself out of your shoes and put yourself into someone else's shoes and say do you really think that this was racially motivated do you think this was just a bad cop who would have done that whether the person was white black hispanic et cetera but i think it goes a long way to trying to put yourself in somebody else's shoes i mean and to that story which is you know because the argument is that that police target um minority communities the black community specifically and and then so the question is just is it true and um because they'll argue that you know proportionally speaking based on what their what their what their proportion is of the population you know police interactions with the black community are are far greater of course you know does that mean they're being targeted uh does that mean it's it's it's a racist issue or what else is going on here well let me give you a little statistical data first so there was a study done by university of maryland michigan state university where and this is academia talking this is not the police world talking back in 2015 where they studied every single fatal police shooting and what they found was that there was absolutely no racial bias in the shootings and that in over 99 of the cases the suspect was armed with a weapon when they were shot by the police yeah so what it was really but what the what it really drilled down on what was important for people to take from that study is they said wherever there is violent crime whatever the predominant race of that area is where there is the violent crime is who the police officers will end up shooting and if you really just break it down and think about it it makes complete sense violent communities that someone is using a gun in that community is more likely to be shot by a police officer so what we really need to talk about if we want to reduce officer-involved shootings is we need to reduce violence in our communities and that will yield less police-involved shootings but when you start talking about how are we going to reduce violence in our communities we need to start having a much bigger conversation about are there edu educational opportunities are there job opportunities right is there a path forward for people in those communities because without those things those are those are two solutions oriented well and it also then acknowledges that maybe the leaders of some of these areas a lot of these inner cities would have to acknowledge that what they've been doing over the last 30 40 50 years has been an abject failure and that there needs to be a rethinking about how they're handling things right i mean police follow follow criminal violence and um you were you've been at nypd they're a highly data-driven police force probably much more so than even when when you were back there i know just because i have friends who are up there um i don't before all this happened it didn't seem to me that houston had really bad relations with the community um it's not something i hear about as a representative um not not to say that there's not problems i just it's not something that's brought up to me often um you know what's your take and i would also add you know george floyd is from here we had a huge march and it was peaceful and and i think really well done so i mean we got to be doing something right in houston we had one bad night of protests where people really took advantage but other than that i mean we just have not seen what other cities have seen yeah i think we have a fantastic relationship with our community but that takes a lot of work you know we're out there yeah we're out there every single day building bridges with our community uh we're very involved in church i actually meet with a group of black preachers once a month to just kind of go over any issues that there may be in the community they can tell me about the things that they're seeing and of course the department is very engaged with the community we try to be out there as much as possible and we try to build those bridges is that what community nobody ever defines community policing is it just means talking to people right is that community policing community policing is talking to people figuring out what problems in the community that we can provide solutions to but i think really good community policing is just providing good service that's what it really boils down to um one of the things that harms us a bit is we're so understaffed we're anywhere from 12 to 1500 police officers short in the city of houston so i don't care how nice i am or how community oriented i am when your house gets broken into you're not happy that it took me four hours to get there so one of the things that we struggle with is we're so understaffed that we still try to provide that level of service or you know the 18 year old who gets in a car accident it's the worst day of their lives but it still takes us two hours to get there and that poor person's crying out there they want a police officer when they want him there but to your point about we go where the crime is and and i don't think that's acknowledged enough by folks right there's a 911 call like what are you are you supposed to ignore it exactly we're going there and we also do studies every single year to figure out where are our crime patterns where are all the calls coming from and that's where we will adjust our staffing accordingly to make sure that we have more officers in that area so no matter which neighborhood it is whether it's a black neighborhood hispanic neighbor why temperature mixed neighborhood whatever if that's where the crime is if that's where the calls are that's where you're going to see a high concentration of police officers and that's where you're going to see a high concentration of people stopped because we're attempting to be proactive about crime in your neighborhood so yes we may be doing more traffic stops or we may be stopping people that we believe we have reasonable suspicion to stop because we're trying to prevent crime but we have to have a conversation is that still what the community wants from us right and at some point as we move forward with this conversation the community and politicians are going to have to decide what do you want from police officers do you not want us enforcing drug crimes well then fine you'll have to change the law do you not want us to chase after people that have a gun well fine tell us now i'll tell you you're not going to like the results of that the crime in your neighborhood is going to go up as we do not enforce quality of life offenses and we're not enforcing drug laws but if that's what you want tell us and we will do it but this halfway of hey we kind of want you to enforce that stuff but we don't really like when it goes awry when when you are enforcing it that's not going to work and you're throwing us under the bus in the process yeah because when you hear when some people hear proactive policing they might hear targeting and you know i get that but also reactive policing just means responding to when things got really really bad when somebody's calling 911 and begging you to come save them i mean that's and that's that that and from what i've heard a lot of that results in an exhausted police force that's always running headfirst into a crazy situation that you know i think more people need to experience and i have a bit of experience with running into chaos maybe just a little bit yeah but nothing like police do frankly i mean you know overseas it's a little bit more clear-cut no no we deal with a lot of civilians too and you've got to treat them with respect and and so it does and especially in iraq afghanistan yeah you can't tell the difference between and you don't know when they're going to pull out an ak from from under what they're holding they look very peaceful and docile and then all of a sudden they don't and here's why it's harder for police i think because it's your own community and it's your own fellow americans and and your governing structures are much much stricter just um you know we we we care about civil rights in this country we we care about all these things and and and i think cops do you know the best that they can to to enforce that but it's just harder i think it's a harder job and you're also expected to do so many other jobs like a social worker because you know sorry i'm just gonna keep rambling first no no go ahead go ahead right now it's why it's so problematic to see shows like cops and uh live pd canceled because no forget about paw patrol they wanted to cancel paw patrol you should should cancel papa my daughters love paws i'm just kidding so i have never seen these shows as glamorizing police work though there's some other tv shows that maybe seem to glamorize police work but not these shows these are the ones that show you what you really deal with people are screaming at you like whoa what did i just walk into and i don't know i think regular people just need to experience that a little bit more see how difficult that situation doesn't excuse a lot of things certainly doesn't excuse the george floyd killing i think the reason that enraged so many people is because it was so obviously wrong and pretty sick but you know the question is is that is that normal and are we taking a contextual view of the whole thing yeah you know the george floyd obviously everybody agreed that was abhorrent and we all came out and and completely just said this is not what we do this is not what police orders do and the justice system is taking its course and and i expect that justice will be swift but you know canceled culture came for police officers and we had to cancel live pd and cops and what those shows really did was it gave every single citizen sitting at home on their couch a window into what we deal with every single day that because you know i think most most people when i tell you know when you talked about the statistics of hey we shot 21 people last year i think most people would think that number should be in the hundreds based on how much they hear about officer-involved shootings and a lot of the time it might just be mundane like you said you show up at a call and people are screaming in your face or you're trying to mitigate whatever situation is going on but the fact is the community and you know to an extent politicians have asked too much for police officers they want us to be social workers they want us to help raise kids they want us to do all these types of things and listen we'll take that burden if that's what you need us to do because we're police officers this is what we signed up for but now it's you're throwing us under the bus at every opportunity that you get you're not respecting the job that we do you're not respecting the challenges of the split second decisions that our officers need to make and if you want other people to handle some of this stuff we're happy to share the load so if you want social workers going out to mental health calls and homeless calls or mental health professionals we're supportive of that but what people want to do is well we need to take funding away from police officers in order to pay for that and that's just yeah when you go to community meetings is that really what people are asking for especially in high crime neighborhoods no not at all in the communities that i go to and the folks i speak with they don't want less police they want more police officers because they want to feel safe they want us to be able to get there quickly where is their voice in all of this i mean it's it's not fair to them you know because because i mean i bet you guys can track a certain no i've i've heard this in many cities there's basically like i've heard it from my nypd friends like there's about a thousand people in the entire city that keep committing crimes like that's it's not everybody you know it's a very small segment of the population so now you're gonna get me on my sole box okay you're absolutely right there is a very small percentage of people that is responsible for a large majority of the crime in our city but over the last few years we have decided to embrace a revolving door strategy thanks to our current d.a district attorney kim og and thanks to our current judges that are in power we've embraced bail reform which has essentially allowed people out over and over and over again i'm talking people that are out on eight felony bonds which means they've committed eight individual felonies and been continually let out we're talking about violent repeat gun-toting felons not not just some 18 year old with some weed in his pocket no and you know what we we actually support bail reform for things like that or the single mother who's driving the suspended license who's never been arrested before there's no reason why she should be held on a bond our old system was archaic it was draconian and it needed to be reformed but what did they do instead of taking a scalpel to it like they should have they took a sledgehammer because they saw their opportunity to completely deconstruct our criminal justice system and that's what they did and now we're reaping the consequences of that and we've seen crime go through the roof last year and this year we have all the numbers to approve it by every public safety metric standard this has been an unmitigated disaster and it's even funny because our county judge lena hidalgo said at the state of the county address in 2019 is that bail reform will make our communities safer now she was either woefully woefully unintelligent on the subject or she just lied and i don't know which one i'm not calling her a liar i'm just simply saying she was woefully ignorant on the topic and now our community is suffering there's a business right around the corner from here it's called blonde and biscotti coffee if you haven't tried it i recommend everybody go and try it yeah that's a small business they've been broken into four times in the last year geez four times and we're fairly certain it's the same guy because they've caught him a couple times while he's been doing it yeah how do i go out to a business and tell him hey we're really gonna help you out we're going to take a report and the guy that we catch a week later is going to get a pr bond he's going to write back out and do it again or what do i tell the folks about clayton brown who is the documented gang member who shot three different people including a 15 year old girl and the da's office cut him a deal and gave him deferred adjudication and dismissed two of his cases by the way he got back out and reoffended well and let's have a conversation about felons in possession of a firearm we can all agree convicted felons shouldn't have guns right that makes sense so why is it that we have nearly 350 people in harris county on deferred adjudication for felon in possession of a firearm while we are having a national discussion on guns in this country and talking about how we need more gun laws and we need to make sure that people can't get guns we're not even enforcing the laws that we have now the very violent vicious people that we are trying to keep guns out of their hands they're giving them a slap on the risk of probation and letting them right back out the door it's ridiculous and it's making our communities less safe but nobody wants to have this conversation i do um let's talk about guns real quick because i've talked a lot of hpd about this especially when the gun control debate was was really um front and center and i was like you know if we had universal background checks and people need to understand what universal means it's not background checks you always have to get a background check when you go buy a gun universal means but but what it is it is legal in texas if we're friends and we trust each other like you can you can sell me a gun that is legal that drives the left crazy they hate that um and i understand at first glance i kind of understand why but at second glance you're like wait a second that means i can't if especially in times like this where i i think the second amendment debate's over after everything that's happened for the last few weeks but but in times like this it's like yeah there's a lot of people that are like uh i don't have a gun and there's then i'm scared now because the crime is up and and people are you know i don't know there's riots and all this stuff uh can i i don't wanna can i can i borrow your gun no you can't it's well in texas you can yeah in california no in california nope you cannot you're a felon if you do that because they do have state universal background checks and so and and but a criminal of course is going to just be like yeah here's your gun and so my question hpd was was always where are criminals getting the guns are they is it is it through these sort of like second third hand dealers because they they do exist i'm not i want to acknowledge that they do exist and like these guys will buy guns they'll like rebuild them in cool ways and then they'll sell them to people it does happen um but is but are they selling the criminals and is that how criminals are getting them or are they breaking into places and getting them that way because i know of a gun store in spring that's been broken into a huge number of times yeah uh let me tell you no law that you could ever put in place is going to stop a criminal from getting a gun so let's just like establish that right out there unless you could snap your fingers and disappear yeah which is not realistic it's never going to happen here so so the reality is is that they're not buying them at gun shows okay they're not using the gun show loophole they're not buying them from friends they're stealing them from people they're breaking into people's cars and i think there was a story a while back about how burglary a motor vehicle was through the roof and people were specifically targeting people that were going to gun shows or that were going to the truck with the american flag on the back it's like that guy's got a yeah absolutely that guy's got a gun let me break in and steal it that's where they're getting it but i think if you ask a police officer how do you feel about gun laws especially here in houston what we will say is number one we respect everybody's right to have a gun we respect the second amendment but we can't even have a conversation about increasing gun laws or or making them more stringent if we're not even using the laws that we have now if we are not throwing the book at every single person that sticks a gun in someone's face and robs them in this city how can you legitimately have a conversation about having more laws or being stricter with different laws right you're not enforcing the ones you have now now if we were throwing the book at every single person that had a gun and every single per maybe we'd be willing to open that have that conversation but we're a pragmatic group of people we want to see that you're actually using the tools that you have in your toolbox before you want to know the tool i want to go back to what we actually put people in jail for for a minute because we talked about listen the the teenager with weed in his pocket and there's this the criminal justice supporters out there and and count me among them but count me among the common sense ones like because i don't want to see somebody go to jail either for for like these these these cases we're talking about like well you have some drugs on you you're not you know you know if you have 100 pounds and you're clearly intending to deal and sell the maybe that's different but just some drugs on you do i really think you should go to jail no i think that's a perfectly reasonable conversation to have the single mom who gets pulled over driving without a license like you know these are these are very reasonable reforms that we could make but the question is there's this notion out there that our that our jails are jam-packed with people who just got arrested on some minor drug charge is that really true no that's not the reality uh the jail is jam-packed with uh violent people that have actually had to do some jail time as a result it's not jam-packed with minor offenses they kind of move them through very very quickly they get pr bonds but let me tell you just a little deal we did a survey of our own members and we asked them would you prefer to not take someone to jail for marijuana and just cut him a ticket on the scene and let him go overwhelmingly our own people support that we support a more progressive policy than the current district attorney that is in harris county and what the current laws are here in texas because we understand if somebody's got a little bit of marijuana we don't want to take them no police officer wants to take anybody to jail for a little bit of marijuana yeah but we don't have the option to ignore it and i think that's often lost in this conversation we are just an arm in the executive branch we have to enforce the laws that are on the books we don't have the option to not enforce them and i'm sure somebody will come back at me and say well joe you all have discretion you're absolutely right we do have discretion but that discretion was taken away when you gave us all body cameras which we don't oppose body cameras we support them we think they're a great thing so but the minute that it's on body camera that someone searches someone's pocket and finds a bag of marijuana that's it that officer cannot ignore it if he does or she does they will be fired and it's also true because people will still look at jail statistics and and what they're in there for and they'll be like oh like minor drug possession but i've also you look at that a little bit further and it turns out that those are those are pleated down from like a violent offense this literally happens all the time uh you'll have someone who let's say gets arrested for aggravated robbery with a gun and then by the time that it gets to his deal that he cuts it was a minor assault charge so it happens all the time uh our justice system it's a very interesting animal because we demand transparency of our police officers which is a good thing but we don't demand the same transparency from our judges and our prosecutors and i've always wondered why why aren't these deals made out in the public so that people can see why don't you talk about these types of things and make sure people understand well yeah we did plea this down and the reason why there's no transparency is because they don't want you to know what they're doing yeah and the fact of the matter is they're giving away the farm over there on all these criminal justice deals yeah and the only the only accountability there is will we elect our judges in texas but um you know the reality is is it's difficult we have like 75 people on the ballot um and it's difficult for voters to actually go through okay what's your what's your qualifications to be a judge and you know what are you really gonna do are you gonna enforce the law because i still think the vast majority of people on all sides would basically agree with with what we're saying about what should be enforced what shouldn't what kind of reforms need to be made what shouldn't but it it unfortunately just gets totally lost in this conversation yeah i'm not even sure the general public knows everything that goes on in the criminal justice system i think if we grabbed five people off the street on the corner here and said hey if i put a gun in your face and i robbed you and a police officer arrested me how much time do you think i would get in jail and i think most would tell you i've had 20 25 years nothing deferred adjudication probation maybe six months maybe yeah the judge was having a bad day d.a was having a bad day but otherwise they're getting right back out and i don't think the public knows that we've tried to do it the best that we could to educate the public on what's really going on and i think we can all agree let's be soft on some minor crime that we can give people a second chance let's not ruin their lives because they had a suspended license or had one bag of weed let's work with those people but the violent gun-toting felons the gang members the shot callers the ones that are out there doing these violent crimes throw the book at them and you will actually see a difference in violent crime within our city because you're actually impacting the disrupting the criminal element let's think is it really what this is about is there's a there's a sentiment that you know especially the black community and other minority populations they just they have it worse they have their communities are crime ridden there's not enough investment there the jobs they they feel forgotten and i totally get that because i mean it's just true um but then we have to look at the reasons why and and i think i think what's obvious is again it's as obvious from their own community meetings they want more police because you can't have investment into a community until it's safe it's hard to have a good education when it's not safe and like in all the education studies i've seen there's there's a couple pretty prominent factors it's safety and two-parent households that create that that makes your education better period i mean it's it's it's not much more complicated than that you know we can throw money at it but the reality is and i know the way we do education funding in texas is it is spread around it's not just your property taxes you know you know um counties that get less property tax input well they get they get additional money from the state so it's spread more evenly and you know some of the worst schools in america have some of the highest spending per per capita per student so like there's more to the story you know and and but that just gets lost well i think you know what you've seen especially over the last few months but what you've seen over the last five to six years is that everybody has attempted to scapegoat the police as the you know the fault of all the ills of society if things are going bad in a community it must be because the police aren't doing enough or if they're over policing the community well they're just targeting minorities and everything has been heaped on us as if it's our fault for everything but we're not the ones that are responsible for failing schools we're not the ones that are responsible if there's no job opportunities we're simply there to try to provide the safest community that we can provide well while also trying to bridge the gap and build a relationship but to touch on your point about who exactly is going to want to have a business in seattle when this is all said and done yeah you know whenever they decide to tear down yeah whenever they decide to tear down chop or chas or whatever the hell they're calling it today and of course you know the the mayor decide enough is enough who are they sending in to clear it out they're going to send in the police officers the very police officers that they want to dis-fund and dismantle now they want them to go in and clean it up and take care of the situation and just watch how this is going to play out and you're going to think i'm clairvoyant when i say it these folks are going to videotape the officers coming in there and arresting them they're going to attack those police officers the police officers are going to have to use force to try to clear this area out as they're being attacked and then those police officers will be made out to be the bad guys how dare they do this to these people after it was the mayor that's ordering them in there after it was the mayor and that legislative over there you know their council that decided to let the zone be taken over and now you're going to ask the police officers to clean it up and then you're going to hold this responsible if something goes wrong it's completely ridiculous they're setting us up for failure and so let's let's talk about holding the right police officers accountable i mentioned numbers in in the early earlier on in this episode of how many complaints are actually leveled against you it was like less than 300 and about three times as many complaints are from fellow cops what what happens to those complaints um there's lots of in your head of a union there's also a lot of talk about oh unions are protecting bad cops what i've heard from a lot of cops is that can be true it's usually not um you know a conversation worth having but what's your take on it yeah so two million citizen contacts we average that about every single year we only had 276 citizens complain on us last year 276 and as i told you over 850 three to one uh officer on officer and that could be something as minor as they can go to training or something as serious as excessive force i will tell you this there has been a lot of false narratives spread about police unions over the last couple weeks let's start with this one there is for whatever reason people believe that we can somehow protect our officers from criminal prosecution there is absolutely nothing in our contract whatsoever that says we are protected from a d.a who wants to file charges on us who demands a statement from police officers there's nothing this is just a made-up thing there's a made-up talking point that they continue to to expound over and over again let me tell you what our contract does do what kind of protections it has for our officers we all know that our officers are going to be tried in the court of public opinion that's just the way it is it's not going to change whether you are pro police or anti-police we can all agree they are going to be tried in the court of public opinion and officers are and will continue to be fired when it is politically expedient for that police chief or that mayor or that council or whoever that's going to happen all our contract does is say they get one appeal to an arbitrator that is binding so what when you're really talking about oh these these protections are all they're going to do is protect bad cops no it gives a cop who has decided to put their life on the line and go out and protect their community one shot at an appeal when they are disciplined or when they're fired and i believe that any reasonable person who would sit down and have this conversation with me would say okay i think that's fair considering the climate we're in but i'll do you one better if you were a young person right now in your early twenties who just got out of college or you just got out of the military you're gonna look at police departments and say am i gonna get a fair shake if things go bad even though i followed training policy and the law am i still going to be fired and i think most people who are looking at that right now educated people are saying i'm not going to get a fair shake so i'm going to go to a department that at least has an appeal process that i have the right to appeal i mean it's fundamental fairness that this country was built on that you at least get to appeal a decision made by a politician in a hasty situation so that's really what we do and another thing too this is such a uh i know it's a talking point and it's a cliche but it's the truth nobody hates a bad cop more than a good cop because we are suffering for the actions of that idiot in minneapolis we're suffering we've had 30 officers shot since that incident took place we've had thousands assaulted we've had dozens run over including we had an officer right here that was run over by a car uh she got thrown seven feet she showed up to work the next day though because that's kind of commitment she has but another officer was hit with a brick in the face he took one day off of work and he got back out on the skirmish line once again that's the kind of commitment that our officers have but we're paying the price in violence against our officers and in officer deaths as a result of the actions of this guy in minneapolis so believe me nobody wants to have bad cops around yeah no and i believe that is it possible that like unions and other cities just do things differently i mean is this i mean because i've heard all the major cities are generally you know i think pretty well accounted for um is do you hear of other places that just aren't need better training need better resources what is it you know i'll tell you this we can certainly have the training conversation and we're never going to be opposed to more training because we know that it's going to make better police stars it's going to cause better outcomes but you know we've already had the escalation training here for a for a while but we'll continue to do that and i think other major cities we're on the ball we we are getting the the the training that we need but you know if you want to nationalize a training standard on de-escalation so be it nationalized use of four standards no problem what what you want to ban chokeholds fine we understand we haven't had chokeholds here in 40 years in houston we understand i was going to ask about that as a guy who kind of has some fighting background and like you know we train all the time to to subdue people as well um again very very we're not trying to arrest people in the seal teams so it's a little different um it's like a different environment yeah it's just it's it's just different which is why you know i said your job is is frankly harder um but i but i always want them like wow you know in a bad fight it's i don't like the idea of of getting that one tool taken away from me but it sounds like it sounds like many major police forces here la i think nypd like i'm not sure um but i know la and i know here because you just told me i've not had chokeholds forever yeah and you seem to be doing fine it's been banned for quite some time uh we could always still use it and still can in a lethal force encounter the the fight for your life that you okay describe okay can still be used but listen we're listening to the community i think nationwide you know as i'm the national vice president of the fop we're listening to people we we want to make changes that people want to see that don't put undue risk on our police officers right and i think that's a a reform that we could all get behind and say okay you know we hear you we don't want to have a bad outcome where someone uses a chokehold where maybe they shouldn't have and it was borderline so we don't want to have that bad outcome but as we move forward we have to we can't push the success over the horizon to where we can't ever reach it and i think what you're seeing now is a lot of people that are very far left trying to push this narrative of an officer should never use force and there should never be a police shooting but that's not the reality of our job and i think you can certainly attest to this impossible the the amount of force that we use is consistent with what we are getting from that suspect and in 99.99 of the cases the force used by the officer is only because that suspect was using force or that suspect was doing something to the officer and until we start having a conversation we can reform police officers all you want but until we start talking about the behavior on the other side and really saying it's not appropriate you cannot do that you can't fight with a police officer when they're putting you under arrest you can't shoot a taser at them you can't throw a brick at them all these other things until those conversations start happening and i'm not sure if we're ever going to have those conversations the way we're going but we have to take into account the actions of the suspect in any use and force encounter with our police officers and um another solution being thrown out there reform is is reform to qualified immunity and um so you've got a lot of thoughts on that i'll just let you take it from there because i don't want to butcher even explaining qualified immunity i i think the the layman's term or the layman's explanation of qualified immunity is basically it allows police officers to be sued personally as opposed to suing the city for infringing under civil rights it's the conversation's much more complicated than that so i'll let you take it yeah let me let me just kind of give you some statistics on qualified immunity first because there's a lot of talk about it right now the last 200 cases that have been held in lower courts on whether or not an officer should receive qualified immunity the officer has only received it 57 of the time so this blanket statement that no matter what an officer is going to get qualified immunity is not true whatsoever um in fact in egregious cases such as former officer chauvin he's not going to get qualified immunity and any officer that is outside their policy training and the law is not going to receive qualified immunity the last five cases that have gone to the supreme court where they made a decision about whether or not someone would receive qualified immunity has been an eight to one vote and a nine to zero vote so there hasn't been a a huge push uh prior to this about qualified immunity and what police officers really want to know is if i'm within policy training in the law that i'm not going to be sued civilly and i think that's a completely reasonable standard to have and there's now talk of hey let's just do away with qualified immunity what does that look like if you just do away with qualified immunity number one any police officer that can retire is going to retire any police any person that was thinking about becoming a police officer is not going to do it and all of those who are in the field still and who still want to stick around i can assure you they won't be doing a thing out on the street they will not want to be involved in any use of force encounter they won't want to put anybody in jail because what's going to happen as soon as that person gets out of jail they're going to sue that police officer whether they had a reason to or not they're simply going to go after their pockets and the unintended consequences too is you're going to see many more lawsuits against the city and against the department and against the county or whoever your employer is the state because as much as people want to sue the police officer they want to get to those deep pockets so you're going to see a bunch more lawsuits if you were to do away with qualified immunity it's not the devil in the room that everybody thinks it is it's simply protection for a police officer when they're within policy training in a law they're making split second decisions life and death decisions and if they followed what they've always been trained then they shouldn't be held civilly accountable for their actions is there is there a way to reform the way it is because the argument i hear from the libertarian side um this because this is kind of an interesting i wouldn't somewhat bipartisan meaning libertarians are big in favor of getting rid of qualified immunity and the left is in favor of getting rid of it but is there is there common sense reforms because the way they explain it and i'll probably screw this up you've been trying to explain it correctly but essentially there has to be they claim that that for an officer to be held accountable because of a qualified immunity you basically have to prove that this exact situation was found to be illegal in the same jurisdiction and that seems kind of weird that doesn't seem right so is is that a area for reform or is that a is that even true what's what's your take i don't think it's as true as as they say it is such as that the exact same situation where we see qualified immunity not being came into play is if you are outside you're training policy in the law then chances are you're not going to receive qualified immunity and as i said earlier under the scenario that you just brought up that libertarians are pushing then why aren't officers getting qualified immunity 99 of the time yeah because it's so specific as you said to that exact case that exact set of circumstances so that may be their perception of it but that is not the reality of how it's applied to the law because the last 200 cases about a little over half have received qualified immunity yeah so what about some other ones like uh no knock warrants what explain explain what the what those legally actually mean because i wonder if a lot of people i think there's two different scenarios here that need to be talked about one one scenario is you bust through the door and you yell police police okay so you've announced your presence so you're not knocking you're but you are announcing your presence and then there's another scenario where you don't announce your presence and i can see how that could be pretty problematic so is that what they're like what exactly are some of these reform-minded people talking about yeah so i think the perception of a no-knock warrant is you see a group of guys all dressed in black with them you know with the the big hammer on the door and they hit it and you go right in that's not really what happens in one of these no knock warrants what they normally do is they knock on the door announce police police police then they hit the door so it's that everybody in the house knows these are police officers that are coming in and of course they're dressed in the uniform so everybody can see so on the issue of no knock warrants here's my thing you have to have oversight over them and you have to make sure that they're only used in the extreme cases that they need to be used for i would advise people don't take it completely out of the police officer's toolbox highly restricted and something that they did here in houston is basically only the chief of police can authorize the no knock because we had an issue with absolutely especially in texas because if you get the wrong and we had this problem a couple got killed and it was it was the wrong house and um they got killed because they defended themselves and they didn't realize it was police and so it's again is the problem really the the fact that they busted down the door the problem is they didn't announce they were police and so in houston we've made reforms to deal with that kind of thing reforms i would just caution people don't take it out completely out of the toolbox but just highly restrict it and just say only the highest level i mean heck if you want the mayor to make the decision whoever you know whoever you want to put in charge of it don't allow it to just be someone lower down the totem pole somebody that needs to understand the risk yeah and we also need to understand is it that imperative to hit that door to stop whatever's on the other side yeah we have to make sure that's a tactical discussion about exactly and it's but is there any scenario where we shouldn't we shouldn't announce that police police police like that it should be silent and see that that i can get behind because i don't see any scenario where it's a good idea to to not announce that it's cops coming in yeah i mean listen at some point they're gonna have to know who's coming through the door uh so yeah we need to announce ourselves so that they know hey these are police officers that are coming in um and some people may still decide to shoot it out even when they know they're police officers right um but that's the reality but it's more likely that they're not mistaken identities at that point um and that makes sense because there is a tactical consideration for being able to go straight through a door um you know whether it's preservation of evidence or whether it's just avoiding a a barricaded shooter and a long time shootout well you don't want to get that time the guy for that guy to go post up in the back bedroom where he's got his arsenal you know the idea is all these things you can catch them by surprise but i think we also have to analyze whatever evidence is on the other side of the door is it worth the risk not just the risk to the person that's in the house but the rest of the police officers that are taking the door or is it maybe better that you know we stop that guy down the road somewhere else we get a search warrant for the house or do something different what about the national registry that's being talked about that one seems to be bipartisan just ensuring that that the bad cops aren't rehired i guess the question there is have you defined bad cops i guess if they're fired from one precinct i don't know like what what do you think about that yeah so i i don't have a problem with with the you know national registry so of problem cops the interesting thing about this is when this first thing got kicked off you had the major city chiefs who who are chief is actually the head of chief acevedo they decided that they were going to blame all the ills of law enforcement on police unions and they put out a statement and if only we didn't have these unions we would be able to take care of all the problems in law enforcement and i literally laughed out loud at the statement because police because police unions we don't do background checks on people we don't hire people we don't train them we don't set policy we don't discipline and we don't fire people that's all under control of police chiefs so if we have a problem with what we call gypsy police officers that are getting i just made air quotes while i'm on a radio interview i don't know why i did that it's a podcast not a radio sorry sorry podcast i'm showing my age now um but if you're gonna blame anybody for gypsy cops yeah it's the chiefs fault because they keep hiring people that they know have been fired from other places so i think as long as there's a due process for that officer so if they were fired and they can actually appeal their um inclusion on that list i think that's completely fair and you just say i'm sorry you know you you've been fired from two departments you're not going to get hired by a third it it's weird like the the legislation in congress that we'll be voting on this week i mean we can't vote for it because it goes too far but it was actually it was not as bad as i thought it would be um you know i think one of the problems with their national registry idea is that even basically it says even if the claims were unsubstantiated or not proven then it still counts and it's like well that's not fair you know i mean and how many that brings me to a different question about you know you reach you got 276 complaints how many of those really resulted in any kind of punishment or were they unsubstantiated what kind of complaints are these like what are we how do we delve into that yeah i mean it all depends on the on the individual complaint obviously but there are numerous sustained complaints on our police officers just for it could be even minor stuff for more serious stuff i i mean i'll tell you that our officers sometimes feel like they get you know in trouble too much because you know what they'll do in these investigations and it's just so funny to be talking about this with with regular people is let's say the complaint is for excessive force they'll go in there and they'll find that there is no excessive force then we have this thing called conduct not alleged and they'll go back and they'll look at that entire officer's call and if you're not aware we have a set of general orders that are about you know 900 pages long that our officers have to abide by and you can't go one shift without breaking a general order it's just not possible but they'll go back in that body camera and they'll find that you know he didn't complete the report the right way or he didn't click his seat belt until after he pulled out of the parking lot or he didn't turn on his body camera until he was already getting out of the car and he should have turned it on while he was still in the car and our officers will get suspended by it for that so even though the excessive force complaint was completely unfounded and they didn't do it they're still going to get in trouble for something else so i literally laugh when people say well you can't police your own and y'all just look out for one another i'm like are you kidding we literally have people whose job it is to watch a video and every minute of it to see if you've committed a policy violation and then sustain discipline on you but to your point about the uh sustained complaints yeah i think that ha that could only be fair that it has to be sustained i mean would we expect anyone to carry on their record you know when they've been uh when they beat a case in trial and the judge orders expungement we say well no absolutely not you need to keep that on your record it's ridiculous yeah it is speaking of things that are ridiculous um i remember you came out pretty hard against our county judge when um she tried to enforce masks or let's call him face coverings um here in harris county uh i also came out pretty hard against it um not because i'm against wearing face coverings i my campaign bought 50 000 of them and we handed them out to the community um you know they they play a role they play a role the science is debatable but whatever they they play a role let's go with it yeah um but it's it's quite another thing to say that if you don't play that role you're going to get a thousand dollar fine or i think 180 days in jail potentially and um your point was that how can you put us in that position to enforce such a nonsensical thing yeah so let me first say we want everybody to wear a mask i wear a mask when i'm out okay everybody wear the mask but it was completely ridiculous for her to tell our officers that you are now going to have to enforce this draconian law she literally wanted police officers going out on the streets and stopping people that didn't have mass on to give them a thousand dollar fine they wanted us questioning parents that were you know walking with their kids at the park and ask is your child over 11 years old how come they don't have a mask on we work so hard to build trust with our community to build the bridge that everybody wants us to build and you want to tear it down in an instant for this nonsensical law if you want people to wear mass here's an idea instead have a public relations campaign which by the way the mayor ended up doing after the fact having a public relations campaign having social media commercials done on the importance of wearing the mask treat people like adults instead of saying hey we're going to hammer you with this so what i told our officers is listen we have to enforce laws that are lawful and legal and the attorney general was saying hey these are actually a lawful uh legal action that she's given you fine and we have discretion discretion discretion you see someone not wearing a mask either give them a wash mask or just give them a wave and say hey you might want to put a mask on i was not going to have our officers be put in that position and imagine a scenario like this where we're talking about relations between police officers in the black community and the brown community that our officers are now going into that community and stopping every 17 year old that doesn't have a mask on does that is that really going to look good for us no absolutely not and i wasn't going to have our officers be put in that position yeah no and then now they've changed it to let's go after small businesses and they've taken away liquor licenses and all these things and it's like last time i checked yeah is it crowded are the people in there putting themselves at risk yeah but they're putting themselves at risk this is a choice and i don't know how we how we forgot about basic civics lessons in america when talking about lockdowns and restrictions you know and and making things illegal that were that were not only legal five minutes ago but but encouraged right because that's just what living is is to to go out and live and and you know there's we totally forgot about the issues of personal responsibility and and basic freedom to engage in risk the way you see fit and then like it continues to baffle me oh isn't this great though while these small businesses that are being strangled already from everything that has gone on with the coven 19 pandemic now we're threatening them with fines if they let people in that don't have a mask on and now you're putting the business owner in a bad position who has to then tell people you can't come inside this whole thing has just gotten so ridiculous but you touched on it at what point do we just say you're responsible for yourself you don't feel comfortable going out to the store well then order groceries to your store i mean we're living in 2020 where you can literally get anything delivered to your door nowadays and it's just gotten to a point nobody is responsible for their own actions and we're seeing that right now with everything that's going on as i talked about earlier we talk about the suspect's actions in case nobody's responsible for their actions anymore it's the police's fault it's somebody else's fault it everybody needs to wake up a little bit because i it's my feeling that this country is just it's turning upside down we're toppling statues of george washington we're toppling statues of teddy roosevelt for god's sakes everybody needs to take a breath and understand you are responsible for your own actions up to a certain point police officers are going to do the best job that they possibly can do but at some point this needs to stop we need to have a civil and reasonable conversation about the issues that our country is experiencing right now because it's out of control it needs to have stopped a long time ago um a lot of us have been pointing this out this sort of uh now we're getting on a totally different topic outside policing that's right that's right the cultural topics but um you know personal responsibility and accountability and this this notion that you own your own destiny is crucial to a free society the society falls apart without it i and i fundamentally believe that and it's why i'm a conservative front to to the core because we stand up for certain cultural values that we have to defend and personal responsibility is one of those if you remove that well you're telling somebody that somebody else is responsible for them for the good and the bad and that makes them a victim it makes them it makes them somebody who doesn't control their own destiny and that's not a good place to be psychologically i think it leads to a lot of the anger and i think it leads to a lot of the the desire to kind of overthrow you know symbols that have been labeled wrongly as oppressive or evil symbols like george washington and you want to have a reasonable conversation about confederate monuments and whether those should be i guess placed in positions of prominence i i'll have that conversation um you know last time i checked i'm part of the union okay the american flag and the republican party is the party of the union and so you're not gonna get me to get to like lose a lot of sleep over confederate statues the problem is we always knew it wouldn't end there and you know warned this because this this was really never about the confederate statues it was never about actual offensive symbols that really make your heart hurt it was never about that maybe for some people it was and you know we should grant them some empathy and again i i totally understand the black community when they're like this confederate symbol means something to me i i get that that's a different conversation but the marxists have totally revolutionized and they're using that grievance to to now tear down everything that is american because fundamentally they want a revolution people need to understand i think what's really going on there we know another thing too when you mention about personal responsibility if you're not held accountable for your actions the first time you do something what are you going to do you can do it again and do it again we're seeing that all over the country right now and rising crime yeah of course so when you're looking at some of these protesters they're testing the boundaries hey that's exactly what they're doing they're continuing to push the envelope and the more that cities back off and the more the communities say well yeah you can destroy that because you need to be provided a certain amount of space to blow off steam or whatever you want to say i mean for god's sakes an editor at a philadelphia newspaper got fired because he said buildings matter too meaning we can't allow our communities to be burnt down they fired him they ran them all for saying that it's it's completely ridiculous because if you allow people to continue to do this they're only going to become more emboldened and whatever the next issue is you know fill in the blank right now it's it's police issues police brutality next month it'll be something else in the month after and until we get past the election it'll continue to be a different issue but they'll continue to get more violent they will escalate and it's no different than the individual criminal that i say you need to throw the book at if you have protesters that turn into rioters you need to throw the book at them it's not what happened here in houston they let about 600 people go that have been arrested by our officers who are engaged in some of the violent protests what kind of lesson have you taught them i can do it again and i can do even worse because there was no consequences and until we start to embrace the rule of law again in this country it's gonna get worse folks and i don't know how much clearer i need to be if you don't tell people that what they're doing is wrong and there is no penalty they will continue to push the envelope and eventually they're going to come for you and your family yeah and they already have in many cases and um we got to stand up for it i mean i i keep talking about this on social media hold the line like enough is enough it it it has to be done and we got to petition our mayors and our governors who actually have the power to take action because i feel a little bit helpless i'm a representative in congress i don't have executive authority um i can only speak out and people have people's and i know there's a ton of silent majority you don't have to go wave a sign but you can call your you can call your mayor's office and you can call your governor's office and ask them to to do something about this um because i know you're thinking it now you're out there thinking it and i know that the silent majority supports police officers they love respect and they appreciate them our police officers are telling us on the street they haven't paid for a meal in weeks because when they go to a nice place to sit down and have lunch the community's stepping up and buying it for them and we appreciate it and we love you all but you know the congressman's right that keeps them send an email give a phone call something to say do not tolerate this lawlessness in our community do not allow it to take hold because once it does they're not going to stop and what greater example do you need than what's going on in seattle right now where they took over a portion of the city and then there's people getting murdered inside of there there's been two murders there in the last couple days that's not all assaults raised of course i mean everything's going on and they won't even allow police officers to go imagine you're a business owner in that area or you own a piece of property or you come for god forbid just your apartment building happen to be in that area and now you don't get any services from police officers because these folks have just decided to take over and they don't have the political wherewithal to stand up to them and say no we're not going to allow this it's it's got to stop it's got to stop and um that's probably a good place to to end right there that was phenomenal actually but i wanted to ask you about um broken window policing that's a that's a tactic that that that i've heard a lot about seems like again a very simple idea basically if you want to clean up a block first thing you do is you send in city services take out the trash make sure the graffiti is cleaned up off the walls make sure the light bulbs work and the street lamps the basics right and and then like engage that way and that has huge effects apparently is that something we do in houston do we have enough resources to do it so i don't think that we do broken windows theory as much as we probably used to do um but we know that broken windows works it's extremely successful in new york uh during the 90s and early 2000s but in order to do that you need to make sure that the community is going to support what your plan is because a part of broken windows is not just cleaning up that neighborhood replacing the light bulbs and windows and covering up graffiti it means enforcing quality of life offenses almost to a point of zero tolerance where if you're call it peeing in public well guess what you're getting a ticket or you're going to jail you know you're called publicly intoxicated you're going to jail your club being a squeegee men when you're not supposed to which is what they did in new york because they were harassing these poor people at red lights well then you're getting a ticket and when you don't pay that ticket you're going to jail for the warrant it will clean up a community and you will see crime will go down because people realize crime is not going to be allowed here in this community i i can't do crime here i need to go somewhere else but you need to have the courage to want to do that and you also have to have the community support because you can't have a community member calling every time that somebody gets arrested on the block because that's what you asked for you wanted us to come in and you wanted to clean this up everybody wants police officers in their neighborhood to clean things up until it turns out that their cousin gets arrested for having a bag of marijuana on them yeah and that's the honest conversation we have to have it's it's um it's like what happened in atlanta with um you know the it was the man was i forget the name um it was his car was stopped in a wendy's drive-through he was he was drunk and passed out and the cops were called and like do you want the cops not to be called what's the choice there well yeah yeah i mean you call us out to the scene which they were called out to now it's it's a driving while intoxicated so as i brought up in another podcast with you if we're called out there and that person is dwi that officer does not have the ability to look the other way they have a body camera on they will be fired if they do this so we heard afterwards some people said well why didn't they just let him walk off or why didn't they give him an uber ride well first of all if you want us to give uber rides to people that are dwi go ahead and put a line item in the budget and say that's what you want us to do and we will do it we will send them off on an uber ride instead of taking them to jail but the officer does not have that option they don't have the discretion to look the other way so you've put us in this position where you've called us out there we have to enforce the law so our officers have to arrest that person that person made a conscious decision to fight those police officers to then run from them after he stole their taser and then point the taser and shoot it at the officer and then he was shot at some point we need to have a conversation number one that that shooting was justified by that officer but number two we have to have a conversation about that suspect's actions led to what occurred at the end of that yeah and if we don't want it to lead to that we have to change the law absolutely if you don't want us to do anything about it well then just tell us tell the police officers what you want we are an arm of the executive branch we do not create laws all we do is enforce the ones that are on the books and our discretion has been removed by the advent of body cameras which we support but it does remove our discretion [Music] that's a fascinating discussion i think we learned a lot from that um joe thank you so much for uh being on the podcast wow thanks for having me on i appreciate it

IS WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON IS GETTING DEMAND DOWN TO A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL SO THAT IT IS BETTER WITH THE MAN. >> THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR, SENATOR OSSOFF, ON BEHALF OF THE CHAIR. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR TILLIS, MR. CHAIRMAN, WELCOME BACK. LET ME STATE AT THE OUTSET THAT YOU HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING JOB AT COMPLEX TIMES. AND, MUCH OF WHAT YOU ARE RESPONDING TO AND ADAPTING TO IS BEYOND YOUR CONTROL. YOU ARE SUCCESS IS THE COUNTRY'S SUCCESS TO A SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS. IT IS THE WORLD'S SUCCESS. I FERVENTLY HOPE FOR YOUR SUCCESS AND APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS. I WOULD LIKE TO SPECIFY, IF YOU CAN, WHAT TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS YOU BELIEVE ARE MOST SENSITIVE AT THE MOMENT TO THE CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY. WHAT FORMS OF CONSUMPTION YOU EXPECT TO BE MOST SENSITIVE TO IT AND, THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU ANTICIPATE THAT SOME OF THE EFFECTS YOU HOPE TO HAVE ON AGGREGATE DEMAND THROUGH THE INCREASING RATES ARE TRANSMITTED VIA FINANCIAL MARKETS AND IF SO, HOW? >> I GUESS I WOULD SAY THREE BASIC CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH OUR TOOLS WORK, THE FIRST WOULD-BE INTEREST SENSITIVE SPENDING, DURABLES INCLUDING CARS AND THINGS LIKE, THAT DURABLE GOODS AND HOUSING, FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN RATES GO UP THE SPENDING ON THOSE PURCHASES, WHICH TEND TO BE FINANCED WITH THAT WILL BE RESTRAINED, THAT IS ONE MAJOR CHANNEL, THEY SECOND IS ASSET PRICES GENERALLY ACROSS THE ECONOMY WHEN INTEREST RATES GO UP. IT RAISES THE COST UPHOLDING ASSETS. IT CAN CAUSE ASSETS, BROADLY, ACROSS THE ECONOMY TO MODERATE THEIR GROWTH OR DECLINE IN VALUE. THAT HAS AN EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY ON OFFENSE SPENDING ON EVERYTHING THEY THIRD CHANTAL IS REALLY THE EXCHANGE RATE, WHICH YOU CAN THINK OF AS ANOTHER ASSET PRICE, THAT ALSO HAS THE EFFECT OF PRESSING DOWN ON INFLATION. WE LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE, STARTING WITH THE FIRST ONE WHERE YOU CAN SEE WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET, THE HOUSING MARKET IS THE CLASSIC PART OF THE ECONOMY THAT IS VERY SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATES. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE MODERATION IN HOUSING DEMAND, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE DECLINING OR SLOWER INCREASES IN HOUSING PRICES. THESE ARE THE THREE MAIN CHANNELS I WOULD POINT TO. >> LET ME ASK IN TERMS OF ASSET PRICES AND HOW FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE RESPONDING TO THE FEDS STANCE, I HAVE CONSISTENTLY ASKED YOU AND SECRETARY YELLEN WHEN YOU APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TO TALK ABOUT SYSTEMIC RISKS AND THE RISKS TO FINANCIAL STABILITY. RISK OF FINANCIAL CONTAGION, WHERE YOU ARE MOVING SWIFTLY AND MARKETS ARE VOLATILE THERE ARE PERHAPS INSTITUTIONAL TRADES THAT COULD RAPIDLY UNWIND, EXOTIC FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT NO LONGER FUNCTION WELL WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE TO BE PART OF A CAPITAL MARKETS THAT PRESENT THE GREATEST RISK TO FINANCIAL STABILITY AS THE FED TAKES THE AGGRESSIVE ACTION YOU ARE TAKING? >> I WOULD START BY SAYING THE BANKING SYSTEM IS VERY STRONG, WELL CAPITALIZED, HIGHLY LIQUID, DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB OF UNDERSTANDING THE RISKS IT RUNS. AND, MANAGING THEM THAN BEFORE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS. THAT IS A REFLECTION OF THE WORK REGULATORS DID AND THE BANKS DID, THAT PART OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS CRITICALLY VERY STRONG AND WE SAW THAT THROUGH THE PANDEMIC, WE SEE IT NOW. ,,, >> YOU REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT MONEY MARKETS? >> THAT IS DIFFERENT, MONEY MARKETS ARE PART OF THE ECONOMY WHERE IT HAS BECOME A LIQUID BECAUSE OF THE ASSETS THAT THEY WERE INVESTED IN NOT TURNED INTO CASH QUICKLY TO FUND DEPOSITORS WANTING TO TAKE THEIR MONEY BACK. WE STEPPED BACK AND HAD TO PROVIDE THAT LIQUIDITY FOR THE SECOND TIME, THERE ARE REFORMS GOING ON WHICH SHOULD ADDRESS THAT AND THERE IS THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED. THAT SHOULD HELP ON THAT FRONT I WAS THINKING MORE OF THE TREASURY MARKET WHICH BECAME ILLIQUID AT THE VERY BEGINNING WHEN PEOPLE WANTED NOTHING BUT CASH, NOTHING BUT CASH AND CASH ALIKE THINGS THE TREASURY MARKET HAS BEEN FUNCTIONING ALL THROUGH THIS PERIOD WHEN WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE STANCE OF MONETARY POLICY, MARKETS HAVE BEEN FUNCTIONING REASONABLY WELL. >> MY TIME IS RUNNING SHORT, I APPRECIATE, THAT WE WILL FOLLOW UP TO TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT MY FINANCIAL RISK, WITH MY REMAINING FEW SECONDS LET ME ASK YOU THIS HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE SHARE OF RESPONSIBILITY, IF YOU WILL, ON THE SUPPLY SIDE VERSUS THE DEMAND SIDE FOR THE ELEVATED PRICE LEVELS OVER THE LAST YEAR? TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU BELIEVE THEY SUPPLY CURVE BEING DEEPER THAN EXPECTED. THEY INCREASED DURABLE GOODS, DEMANDS, THE CONSUMER GOODS HAVING A GREATER THAN EXPECTED EFFECT ON PRICES. RIGHT NOW, IS THE PRINCIPAL DRIVER OF THE INCREASE IN THE PRICE LEVEL ELEVATED CONSUMER DEMAND ELEVATED DEMAND? OR IS SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS? I KNOW WE ARE FACING BOTH BUT I AM ASKING YOU TO ALLOCATE AS YOU CAN SUM SHARE TO EACH PHENOMENON >> YES, I WOULD JUST SAY IT IS CLEAR THAT BOTH FACTORS ARE PRINCIPALLY AT WORK YOU COULD NOT GET THIS KIND OF HIGH INFLATION WITHOUT STRONG DEMAND. YOU CERTAINLY COULD NOT GET IT WITHOUT THIS KIND OF SUPPLY ISSUES WE HAVE HAD IN THE

of course you know Washington DC is like at a standstill seems like so we got our Congress melting going oh well we're gonna find out we got our congressmen on the fall on a common congressman bill hides a good how you doing today congressman hey we're doing all right okay so it is what is happening in Washington DC well yeah we are on my way back there tomorrow morning and obviously we've been dealing with the prof the board cut at peace but that has been put in place and we're now moving on some other nine clinics and more important issues which are how are we going to spend the money that got that is that's the budget debate that we're going through right now and that's really going to s tends to take up a lot of our supreme time usually is because the budget process of course we've got some pretty serious things happening will proceed as well when you look at North Korea and Iran and them coming together sharing from college and some other things that just a little scary on international Wow well do you think this sequester theme is going to be permanent do you think there would be a budget put together that would change staying what do you think is going to happen yeah in fact that's what we did last year is be put forth a puzzle it's called a continuing resolution what that continuing resolution does it allows government spend money for the remainder of the gear and it will reorder things so it's not not just a transport it allowed our vincent and president all of us have little more discretion as to what are some really good programs that need to be preserved and maybe don't need to see as much of a hit and another programs like a even in the defense of our programs that the defense department and said we we don't think this is a worthwhile program to put forward but you know continue to be funded and we think we ought to eliminate the program so and at the end of the day fall we want to make it smarter smarter in our spending some more efficient murdered on your great be glad hey Congress behind and go web this exploit our listeners what a sequester of government is that one more time can you explain to our listeners where the sequester of government is yep so one of these is that deals with Medicare Social Security all that and all the other stuff that fun percent of Agriculture the purpose of transportation NASA you know Homeland Security those kinds of things that is all experiencing estas to support that is what the sequester or term regular you know those of us that want to speak English not always guys andy says words sequester means just a possible board cut that is the place and so all of the different surfaces are feeling a bit of that pinch outside of the Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid programs for the poor are they've been affected depending on which which department and which for example side hug is going to be some sort of trim pack now the question is how to prioritize them and there's there's some there's some reports that came out last public feeds from the topi inspector general each of these are somebody though then make sure that we're spending money way that it should be don't that work please finally it there's not any raised thought at that kinda and they've identified about 65 building now you can remember this sighs so they've identified series where if we if we get spark in Washington please just stop those recommendations and take care of that if that means that anybody who is getting touched by it won't be touched quite as detail but ultimately at the end of a fall we need to make sure that these are programs really truly helping people and if they are doing that we need to try to preserve them and make sure that that thank you to help not then then we need to look at the highest how we change our modifiable maybe how do you feel about the White House canceling the tours the tours of the White House unfortunately I think more about political show that you know these are selfish to first pretty clearly the idea here is they want to ramp up the public 15 so that the school kids from Michigan or Illinois or wherever else that are coming out with Washington DC on spring break suddenly our are interesting aren't able to go into quite humble that is not that that is not fair of our spending problem it's in a lot of other things they are saying any wine seems to me that that is that is one of those there's there's really no need shut down lighthouse for two pretty like that there's so many other places there we go and really sight of our office one last question I know you got to go to the last question offshore bank accounts are hearing a lot of conversation about offshore banking accounts costing our government of billion billion billions of dollars you think that's going to be talks including to the budget how we can close those gaps yeah there is a beka Student Finance Committee and that is definitely a discussion of how are we going to pitch for that people aren't turning to avoid obligations that there's a specific set some of those things are legal some of those things are not illegal some of them you kind of look at them go mad it doesn't smell now like it looks like somebody you may not be technical drinking football but it looks like for trying to avoid something and we need that's where all right I know you got to go congressman out let's talk real song as we go let me get this bill paint this paint solid and hope it gets on past you see any hope in the next couple days or is going to drive home for a while you know well you know the the budget process itself takes a little while this continuing resolution hopefully cap it or come up to the bill that's a little different and then we go into conference and cash out those get it okay make sure you have a good day congressman thank you so much as well thanks for having me on thank you all right bye there you go he's our representative in Washington DC congressman bill hi Dada that's talking about sequester going on in Washington DC they counselor to rob you can go to the white house now mmm just like that I heard that wasn't costing too much money but that's been the White House chose to do that

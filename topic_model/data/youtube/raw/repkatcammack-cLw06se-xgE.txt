I'll now go to the birthday girl who turned a year older today uh Miss cat came back from Florida happy birthday and you're recognized for five minutes thank you well I can't think of a better place to spend my birthday than Midland Texas I love it no thank you um and thank you for everybody for showing up today thank you to all my colleagues everybody and the witnesses for appearing before us and as the loan representative from Florida and the gator Nation uh Dan hell is listening to Buddy Carter talk about another National Championship that is hell um we're gonna get you though for Texas welcome to the SEC uh thank you to my friend August uh and fellow Congressional baseball teammate I'm not sure if you all know he was our MVP last year I trucked a guy at home plate and you still got MVP I don't know how that happens but uh in addition to having great States Texas and Florida great constituents uh wonderful Industries we also share something else in common uh we are both taking all of Representative Peter's constituents from California um no seriously thank you for being here it does it means a lot seriously we do appreciate you being here and you know a couple of weeks careful you know how they vote I think we're getting the good ones see we people have have Personalities in Washington we all aren't like doorknobs um so a couple weeks ago uh chairwoman Rogers she hosted a full committee uh hearing on energy dominance and concerns within the industry and one of the things that stood out that was that every single one of the witnesses Republicans and Democrats were in favor of domestic production and we recognized that as Americans we can do a better cheaper safer efficiently and cleaner than anywhere else in the world that is an American idea not a partisan one something that else that stood out was the recognition that we are an energy economy and it is not only the thing that powers our everyday lives from our schools to our businesses and everything in between but our domestic energy economy is the foundation for the American dream one of our Witnesses Miss Donna Jackson she made a comment that really stuck with me she said that because of high energy costs at home when they turn on the lights when they fill up at the gas station and basically everything else that folks weren't living paycheck to paycheck anymore they were living paycheck to Wednesday and borrowing the rest to get by that really stuck with me as somebody who was raised by a single mom on a cattle ranch my family we were commercial sandblasters and I just I had never heard anyone say anything beyond paycheck to paycheck because I know what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck heck I remember what it was like filling up my gas tank when I was homeless with pocket change that really stuck with me the impacts that the regulatory regime has had in the last two years on our producers and so I think it's incumbent upon us here today as representatives of the people's house that we do the most important thing which is get the hell out of your way we need to get government out of the way because I believe that our producers can do it better than anywhere else and so that's going to be our goal is to help get out of the way now maybe because it's gonna be my birthday maybe it's because I'm sleep deprived I'm feeling a little froggy uh but I'm going to ask my first question to you madam mayor the energy Department of energy is proposing new energy conservation standards for new household gas and electric cooking devices this move comes shortly after the consumer product safety commission suggested that they should ban gas stoves under the pretext of reducing indoor air pollution now I personally see this as President Biden's rushed to Green agenda to phase out oil and gas and Electrify everything should gas stoves be phased out and how will this impact cost to Consumers absolutely they should not be phased out if if only for the fact that they cook better as a person who loves to cook um that I prefer to cook on a gas stove no I I think that this is something that is um a little bit of posturing on their part I don't believe that it is a needle mover in terms of consumption in our in our nation and so I think that it's posturing but I do believe that it is it is symptomatic of the lack of understanding of how energy actually works and how our grid works exactly in the United States yeah my husband who is the Avid Chef in our family when he cooks at the firehouse he loves a good gas stove so this this really got him riled up but uh um I'll move on because I only have 22 seconds uh I'm the author of The Rains act which would reign in the regulatory environment across the board any major rule or regulation that had 100 million dollar impact or more would come back to congressman an up or down vote Mr Pruitt I've got seven seconds give me the number one regulation that you want taken off the books NEPA easy done all these times expired she yields back and um I gave you eight seconds because it's your birthday

thank you very much mr. chairman ranking member and members of the committee the Business Council for sustainable energy is a coalition of companies and trade associations representing the energy efficiency natural gas and renewable energy sectors on behalf of the council I would like to express our appreciation for the steps Congress has taken to enact the tax cuts and Jobs Act the bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 of note the bipartisan Budget Act included the extension of a number of clean energy tax measures that the Coalition has long supported we thank you very much and while these actions have been very positive for many of our industry members I need to highlight that there are still some technologies from industry sectors that are now at an even larger competitive disadvantage tax extent and tax incentives in the energy sector should be structured such that the benefits are provided to all qualifying technologies in accordance with their energy environmental and other public benefits additionally it is important that tax policies are established over a sufficient duration to provide investors with the confidence they need to proceed with major investments the recent market dynamism in the u.s. energy sector is partly credit credited to tax policy frameworks that have benefits some but not all clean energy technologies importantly the bipartisan Budget Act provided a long-term extension for the non solar investment tax credit technologies which include fuel cells combined heat and power small wind and geothermal the council commends the committee for this action however other technologies have not benefited from the same long term tax policies in the renewable energy sector these technologies include biomass geothermal landfill gas waste to energy hydropower marine and hydrokinetic while these technologies provide valuable renewable energy 24/7 they also take longer to reach construction consequently these non wind PTC section 45 technologies cannot take advantage of the tax credits that are only extended for a few weeks or a year at a time this uncertainty has created adverse market conditions it is more difficult for projects of expired technologies to secure financing the cuz banks value the security of investing in projects with a long term tax credit it also can be difficult for new and existing projects have expired technologies to secure Power Purchase Agreements this is because the extended technologies can offer better value representative Stefanik has introduced HR for 137 the renewable electricity tax credit equalization Act which would address this inequity I'm pleased to associate myself and the coalition with the Alliance to save energy z' remarks on energy efficiency we strongly support modifications and extension to 179 D 25 C 45 L in the transportation sector 30 B fuel cell electric vehicle credit and the 30 C alternative fuel vehicle infrastructure credit should also be considered and then finally energy storage should receive consideration the energy storage incentive and deployment Act HR 4 649 should be considered by this committee thank you very much

recognized for five minutes Thank You chairman my first question is will be for miss Hugh seek and then I want to ask you other three the exact same questions I'm going to be a chance to prepare I'm not the second question is going to be as how's the tax cuts and jobs acts going over in your community what is it done to to unleash this economy if you can give me some examples my first question for Miss Husing been part of a bank board for 15 years and over and over I saw the great things that that the small business loans did specifically what is this bill done to improve that process how is it going to help your customers well first and foremost the SBA and specifically the 7a program is a great program and it's an opportunity if you can't do the loan conventionally how do we get our client to a yes and that's that's what we look to do a small business is 85 percent of our lending but when you take a look at some of the the processes we've had some clients that when there's several a number of years ago the SBA ran out of funds and we were getting ready to settle we were waiting for the SBA approval we are a non preferred lender so that we submit our applications to the SBA and wait for the approval to come back and we were sitting there with that particular client we couldn't get them over the finish line and you know with that unnecessary or that weight that you could never give them at specific time line we've also had another client at that same time frame was looking for a loan and it was to be able to support additional inventory connected with an additional contract which again these type of things would help that if that situation will make it more efficient I think it will make it more efficient but also that if the SBA runs out of funds they would have the ability to have that that additional 15% to be able to extend that got it okay miss miss Blankenship how is the tax cuts and jobs acts impacting Texas I'm not sure if that mics on sorry and cancer question the tax cut is has has had a positive effect on to the Texas economy on our small businesses I see a lot of encouragement a lot of future planning and they they seemed to be willing to leverage those additional dollars saved by their tax savings which in turn helps the community so we're very excited to see that and you hope this 7a is just one more step - and the second those dreams-come-true live this American Dream exactly miss McDonald were you from remind me San Antonio San Antonio another Texas County how was the Jax cuts bill working down there it's going very well we had a record year in lending last year particularly towards the end of the year you know typically in november/december lending slows down we had record months in fact I got an email the other just right after Christmas that said we had over 1,800 loan applications in one day and so that that's pretty incredible especially on a skeletal staff at Christmastime but and from the from the small business perspective we are seeing an increase in those applications and in fact we are hiring an additional business loan officer to keep up with the demand so maybe this law we're working on the dovetail right into those 1500 so what you said 1800 application loan applications these were for consumer loans ok mr. wilkison how do your customers your clients women impacted by this tax cuts bill well I represent the lender so I'm not dealing directly with our small business customers but as I mentioned our loan volume is is up 18% year-to-date so so something good is happening but I didn't want to respond to your earlier question how does this bill help small businesses and it's more from a programmatic perspective we want this program to be a program of integrity it's working great right now we want it to continue to work great we are ahead of this curve we want to make sure SP he's got the tools and resources to keep the lenders between the lines so we're we're not responding to any kind of problem right now but we're gonna make sure this program is here for the long haul for borrowers for many years to come ok mr. Souki I've had a chance to respond to my tax cuts question I thought we'd get back to you you better story to tell as well for the tax cuts you know we're exploring several different ways of where not only how do we help more small businesses we have not finalized on any specifics of what we will do as an organization at this point our board is still finalizing that but we see great opportunities within our marketplace there's a lot of small business optimism and more interest in starting businesses and expanding buying more capital outlays those type of things I think I would just close as I finished up my town halls this week going to every county over and over the economy is improving and I people ask me why and see if you agree with this act number one is we've cut back on regulations and I think number two is the consumer confidence is incredible out there and then lastly is this tax reform is there any other big picture out there that you think is added to the the sudden not necessarily sudden but the great economy we're experiencing to your point I believe all those things and those reasons and compass the reason why there is small business optimism and as they are the job creators as we're looking forward as you mentioned as far as some relief of regulatory burden you know as community bankers we're looking for some of that relief as well of the additional amount of regulation and burdensome that you know over the past eight to ten years community banks have really been burdened with a Jeffrey I went over I apologize sure that's okay James times expired just

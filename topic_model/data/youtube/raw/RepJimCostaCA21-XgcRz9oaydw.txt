thank you very much chairman for holding this area I think the subcommittee up is doing a good service for our efforts as relates to the bureau and reclamation projects around the country and the need to provide the support for the maintenance as well as other costs that are involved with the infrastructure I think my previous colleague put the finger on it in terms of the monies that traditionally have been provided for this purpose and the accounting function area that they do today where these months and my money's in my view should be going for the maintenance and for the costs of rehabilitation efforts and because of the accounting purpose for the budget the monies are being diverted so I concur with my colleague on that although I would say as it relates to the deficit the agreement that's been reached that I think was a factor of other issues and I won't talk about the two trillion dollar tax deficit that has been created as a result of another measure we passed a year ago having said that the revenues that come in from some of these projects for example the Friant water users pay for a project not out of the general fund but there's we're sort of a project that was authorized by Congress a lot of these projects get paid for those monies go back to for their original purpose for the outline construction right to the best of my knowledge it rolls back in it depends on what the authorization says right and it's different with every different project correct we don't know we do not have a lot of organic language right but the point is is is that in many of these projects have been paid for right as a result of those mechanisms I would say I don't have the facts in front of me but I'd say that's probably a fair statement that it's used as a revolving fund and it stays within the project use well it seems to me that and I think there's precedent I know you don't make the decisions but in the in the sense we're contra Costa Water District paid for their their facility to transfer water the the facility was turned over in terms of title and deed to the local water district is that not true I don't know the specifics on that one but if it was a title transfer not just a transfer work where we own so I'm assuming you mean it they took title of right okay I don't have this but there is precedent that you're aware of that yeah that's happened yeah because I think will you try to pursue well congressman Cox and I and I think some of our other colleagues have an interest as relates to the Friant current canal I mean what that does is allows the local water district to pay for some of the maintenance costs because they own it they can borrow against it and and it's a much smarter way to continue to do rehab and maintenance for the San Luis reservoir otherwise known as the bf system in my district there is a authorization to provide dam safety modification and other improvement the the funding to your knowledge is that there I don't know that that's on the operational side so I but it's been authorized no you know I'm assuming it has been authorized okay and could not these funds that are being diverted for the purpose of covering our deficit be used for the maintenance for the earthquake safety and possibly to enlarge the capacity of that reservoir if Congress so chooses to do that I'm sure we would then be willing to do it so do you make an evaluation or is that in another department as to how all these projects are weighted in terms of the criteria for rehabilitation and maintenance as the chairman said whether it be for dam safety are for other purposes for which these projects were intended so we work every year we look at our deferred maintenance whether it's modifications to dams due to safety issues or it's a rewind of generators at our of our power plants or new skaters so you have a power plant there you have five pumps and the Jones pumping plant and and I've been told that in terms of the need to update those generators your deferred maintenance is is behind the timeline how do you prioritize those we normally prioritize them on our is base basis and I don't have the details but our asset management office they work with the technical service center my time is expired but mr. chairman I'd seems to me it would be important for this subcommittee get some handle on how the maintenance and deferral is program and have a list of projects not just in California which interest you and I but have a list of projects throughout the country because clearly you know we know what's kind of in our areas in our regions but I don't know what the sense of prioritization that you have here and as we're looking to try to deal with scarce funding wherever it may be before the bureau we'd like to be able to weigh in and try to protect those funds that's efficient and would be willing to provide that data

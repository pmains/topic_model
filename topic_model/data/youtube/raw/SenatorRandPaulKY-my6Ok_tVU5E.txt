joining us tonight is Senator Rand Paul senator good to have you with us I want to compliment you for proceeding to help try to reform this FISA process but first if I may your reaction to those names from the Obama White House the Obama administration seeking the unmasking of General Flint I think it's startling it's troubling that the vice president would unmask a political rival you know we've had accusations in the past year you may recall of people saying oh you're using government to go after a political rival well this sounds exactly like this with proof essentially when you unmask someone you're illegally listening you're illegally having a wiretap on their conversation so we may have a justification to listen to the foreign target but when a foreign target is talking to an innocent American and the normal course of business you're not supposed to unmask the American unless you have probable cause that they're involved in some sort of crime in this case there was never an allegation of that so all of these unmasked errs I think it's sort of current it's it's this excitement by the Obama people to say what can we do to try to damage the incoming administration so this is a great abuse of power but it's what I've been talking about in general about FISA thises intended to go after spies foreigners and terrorists it should not be used to go after political opponents and that's what they did they weaponized FISA to go after president Trump so my amendment tomorrow says you can't use the FISA Court to go after campaigns or Americans you go to a regular court and as you know you can get a warrant to listen to an American if you think they're doing something nefarious you just go to a judge and a lot of times it's granted but then the person is notified at some point and can contest the warrants and there's actually adversarial process with lawyers on both sides that doesn't happen in FISA and I'm fine for foreigners to be advisor but I think American campaigns should not be investigated by a secret court if there's any confusion amongst the agencies are using FISA the tip-off should be it's the foreign Intel gents court it is not the federal intelligence Corp and you make a great point and I think an important reform now in your amendment but I don't sense that there's a great stomach amongst the leadership of either the Republican Senate or the Democratic House to reform FISA they want to be expedient they want to act as if nothing happened here they want to act as this this were a hoax against President Trump instead of an effort to overthrow a president it's the usual sleight of hand even Republicans who pretend to be the president's friend or defenders of the deep state many of them have been defenders for decades up here the deep state we've been wanting to reform it to make sure it doesn't abuse American civil liberties but they are caught up in now saying oh we don't want President Trump to know this but we got to figure out how to put forward a bill that never really fixes the problem but pretends to fix the problem and this is sort of a parlor game in Washington that they'll put forward things that don't fix them there are some good reforms I voted for Senator Lee's reform today I think it's a good reform but none of it really prevents this from happening again what happened to Carter page could still happen even when this bill passes and I think that's a travesty and the just the Chief Justice of the United States presiding over those FISA courts has been quiet and passive in in my judgment irresponsible giving his responsibility for the for those courts it would be nice to hear from him supporting Senator Rand Paul supporting reform it would be nice to see some courage on the justice in a few more pockets that extend beyond far too few representatives of the American people including you Senator Paul thank you this is doing great work yeah well it's a good point you know Devin Nunez will be on in a few minutes when he sends a letter asking for information and they find out they've done something wrong the court did nothing to reform it sat on it did fake reform and that as it became more public they finally admitted we've got to do more but it took a whole lot of effort on the part of a lot of us to try to get them to even admit that they made a mistake and that there was malfeasance in the FISA Court and very quickly as we conclude here senator Emmitt Sullivan the judge in Flynn's case general Flynn's case is now playing political games perhaps we shouldn't leave it just simply to reform a FISA but reform of the politicized federal district court system your thoughts yeah I don't know I don't understand how a court can have a case without a prosecutor so I've never heard of that I guess the court could appoint a prosecutor but that to me sounds like a judge not being a judge or not being impartial but actually becoming part of the prosecution and that's a really big mistake so I hope that's not what's going to happen here Senator Rand Paul we thank you very much and we wish you all the best of luck as you move to reform a a corrupted FISA Court system Thank You senator appreciate it thank you

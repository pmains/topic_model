our bipartisan infrastructure law continues to bring historic investments to west virginia creating long-term good-paying jobs while also addressing west virginia's infrastructure needs many west virginians rely on public transportation to go to work school and to pick up their kids from daycare while seniors and disabled west virginians rely on rural bus routes to attend appointments or the grocery store in our cities and our most rural counties it's critical that our public transportation is safe and secure for every west virginian that's why i'm pleased west virginia is receiving 13.8 million dollars from our bipartisan infrastructure law to ensure that all west virginians have reliable access to these services and i will continue advocating for these critical resources across the mountain state

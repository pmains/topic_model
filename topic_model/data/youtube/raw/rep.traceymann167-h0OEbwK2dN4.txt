thank you mr chairman and madam under secretary and our other panelists thank you for joining us here this morning i represent the big first of kansas which is uh one of the largest ag producing districts in the country um last year we did over about 10 billion dollars in ag products something that that those of us in the district are very very proud of in kansas we have around a dozen ethanol plants uh and and biodiesel plants combined the majority of those are in my district and i think everyone agree that you know these these investments have been huge for rural economic development over the last few decades you know it's been jobs it means increased demand for corn and sorghum which improves the basis which dramatically immediately impacts main street in all of our rural communities it also provides you know wet and dry distillers grain that are then fed in feed yards all over the district two weeks ago i took ranking member um thompson uh welcomed him to the district we toured a feed yard toured um an ethanol plant the largest ethanol producer in the district and and and frankly i would say that people in my district and in the ethanol industry are baffled and frustrated by this war that they feel is being waged and i agree with them on liquid fuels we've seen the price of fuel increase and that's the big part in my view on what's driving inflation not the only thing but but it's the biggest thing that's driving inflation and increasing the overall cost of things the answer is right under our feet uh here in america and it's also growing in our fields all over all over the country today a specific thing i think we could do right away would be year round e15 which would increase demand would provide some certainty for the market so i guess my first question is you know what's the administration's position on year round e15 is that something that that you support congressman mann thank you so much for that question and for your interest in the the wide gamut of biofuels and ethanol and the opportunities across the board that they present when it comes to e15 the decision maker really is the epa and so rural development doesn't work in that space we're focused like you are on the business side of the work that can be done there and so we've talked about the programs that might support some of the production that's happening in your district uh the the piece that we haven't talked very much about is the bio preferred program and i'd love to discuss with that with you as well at some point we'll let's do that as well um you know as there's this seems to be this movement towards more electric vehicles you know a term we see in our district is you can't plow with the prius i mean the bottom line is we need diesel fuel we need it today and that's not going to change anytime soon i guess specific question is what can we do to make the cost of diesel fuel less so that operating this equipment that exists in you know our farms and all over kansas and around the country um you know we've got to figure out how we can decrease the price of diesel fuel to make these operations uh more economic any thoughts on that you know from when it comes to rural development i think the opportunities are investing in biodiesel like you said and how do we make sure that we're investing in new technologies to expand the impact that ethanol and biodiesel can have that dr neil spoke briefly about the 9003 program which is about the innovations that are available within biofuels and how we can continue to support that so that as we face continuing challenges when it comes to our energy supply we'll have those technologies to respond to great and my last question what ways um do you see can bioenergy help the us regain our energy independence you know we were energy independent um we're not anymore that is absolutely in my view a an immediately fixable problem and what do you think is bioenergy's role to play in that you know when uh when covet 19 hit i think we recognize that energy independence can mean a lot of things it certainly means how do we produce energy locally that we have access to but it also recognizes a global impact when we look at pricing and and the markets globally and so when i think about energy independence or energy dependence in communities like alaska where they're reliant on diesel fuels for 100 of their energy electricity production the way that we can respond to that is creating a more diverse energy portfolio and biofuels are a key part of that i think that's how we work together to invest in that yeah i agree well thank you for being here in my view you know america is the freest country in the history of the world in large part because we've never had to rely on another country for our food and we also can be in a situation where we do not have to rely on another country for our energy and and we need to quickly uh return to that is right blow our feet right growing in our fields today and i think our policies should reflect that so thank you for being here uh with that i yield back thank you thank you

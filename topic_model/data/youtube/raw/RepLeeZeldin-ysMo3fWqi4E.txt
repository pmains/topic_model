well last night on this program we heard from a skeptic of the president's plan tonight we hear from one of the most ardent supporters on Capitol Hill a brief time ago I spoke with congressman Lee's Eldon who serves as the co-chair of the House Republican Israel caucus congressman thanks very much for joining me America's allies in the region u.s. security experts have all warned that this could cause immense upheaval in a region that's already unstable why make this decision now well the fact is Jerusalem is the capital of Israel this is a decision that shouldn't even have to be made right now this should have been made literally decades ago we have had American presidents who instinctively have known and have said during their campaigns that the right thing to do is to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel yet they didn't follow through on their very logical promise that was made and President Trump is following through not only on a campaign promise he made following through on a campaign promise past presidents have made to acknowledge the fact that Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish state of Israel but everybody is warning that this could be dangerous it could be irresponsible is it really worth it to fulfill a domestic campaign promise well it's very important that you have these elements they're terrorists elements like Hamas they've been murdering innocent adversaries and to use this as any type of an excuse to continue to terrorize innocent victims is inexcusable but how is recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel going to help stop that well for one it Jerusalem being the capital of Israel it shouldn't be that controversial because this is where the Israeli Knesset is where the Prime Minister and the president live the Supreme Court is located it is the capital of Israel so we all need to come to terms and except what is just an absolute 100% certain fact and reality for us to not be confronting the realities of the dynamics in and around Israel is a huge disservice for a for any type of a peace talk because the reality is that if you are going to negotiate long term peace Jerusalem is has been and will continue to be the capital of Israel congressman Lee Zeldin thank you very much for joining thank you take care

I believe deeply that we have to end sexual violence in this country because fundamentally it goes to a very simple question do we value women and unfortunately there's a lot of evidence that we don't we don't take sexual assault seriously on college campuses we don't take it seriously in the military we don't even take it seriously in places like Congress so we have to address sexual harassment and sexual assault head-on I've I've sponsored legislation and led on a debate of how we change how we deal with sexual assault on college campuses a couple of easy reforms have a nationwide survey so that anyone who has suffered sexual violence can speak out and tell their story make sure we work with law enforcement so that if a survivor doesn't want to go to law enforcement they're taken seriously make sure we have better training and make sure we have someone on campus who can take you through your options having that that that on-campus counselor to give you all the information and facts you need those four things alone would transform how we treat sexual assault survivors in in our colleges I would try to pass that bill right away and we already have a bipartisan support of it it's the kind of thing that we can come together and get done

i think there's more we need to be doing both to provide relief on a targeted basis to those who need it moving forward and then to ensure that our economy fully recovers uh that we've made significant investments in our workforce and our infrastructure um so that we can get things moving in the right direction again so i think we're going to see a few major legislative efforts in washington over the next year that will address both the need for relief and recovery and i just think it's it's always important to have the voices of small business front and center just this week i was named co-chair of the small business caucus in congress we have about 70 members i co-chaired with a republican member from oklahoma who has a business background uh and we're really hoping to elevate the voices of small businesses in the conversation moving forward

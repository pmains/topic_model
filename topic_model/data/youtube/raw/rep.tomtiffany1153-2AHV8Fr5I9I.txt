congressman tom tiffany you're heading uh you're heading to the border i know we're going to be speaking to you again uh again next week talk a little bit about your trip and uh your reasons for uh for going yeah so i made a couple trips down to the southern border actually the first one was right after i was elected in may of 2020 went down to just south of tucson and i've been to texas now a couple times 2021 of course went to panama in 2021 going to the yuma sector this time where the action really has been over the last six months where there's thousands of people crossing the border illegally virtually no controls in place and uh but especially with title 42 going away now which is actually a decision the centers for disease control makes uh saying there's an end to the pandemic therefore there will be no restrictions um uh want to see firsthand what is happening down in the yuma sector and uh as you mentioned going to report back to you guys next week but really interested to see what's happening there and uh looking for a few things because when i first went down there in 2020 uh that would have been june of 2020 uh the border had really been largely brought under control sheriff's state officials they were really pleased with the direction things were going he fast forward a year and it's completely out of control another year later after that and it looks like there's going to be it's going to be flat out wild west absolutely no controls in place and after two million people in 2021 coming illegally into this country by the way that does not include the godaways which was hundreds of thousands more um we're looking at triple doubling tripling that number now here in 2022 it is flat out out of control as a result of joe biden and his policies well it's it's good to hear individuals like yourself you know serving in these positions are going down to the border to get a first-hand look um drew and i both know uh how important uh it is to you can you can learn a lot about what's going on you know on our southern border what's happening if you read the right outlets if you um you know talk to other people who have been there uh like yourself who's been there before but it really is that firsthand experience that makes all the difference you mentioned going to uh south of tucson i spent some time down there at the nogales border patrol station this was back during the obama years when we had the influx of of miners come flooding into the uh flooding into the country and it's a completely different experience actually seeing the facility itself talking firsthand to the border patrol agents finding out exactly why we have the policies that we do and rarely do they match the narratives that are perpetuated by those that are trying to push their agenda especially on the left when it comes to to border issues and i think the vast majority of the country doesn't doesn't really have a firm grasp on the the negative ramifications of what's happening currently right now on on our border so it's good that you're going and you can share that information yeah for sure i mean the number one thing we can do is educate at this point because it's clear this administration is not going to reverse course uh they believe in open borders but there's a couple things that i'm going to be looking for down there one is an organization called iom sometimes it goes by all i am it's the international organization for migration when i went to the texas border a year ago they were there when i went to panama they were there when the afghan evacuees came into fort mccoy in wisconsin they were there their united nations outfit that processes these people including giving them debit cards to be able to make the trip all the way from places like panama and around the world here to the southern border they are an open borders outfit that we helped fund through the united nations and then i think they also get private money from soros funded groups and others like that but they their sole goal is to breach our borders they believe in open borders and that's one of the groups i'm going to look for to see if they're there and as we get the policy making hopefully after this upcoming election and we take control of for example the judiciary committee we need to hold groups like that accountable and we need to stop them from doing uh from basically breaching our borders because that's exactly what they're doing they're finding every way possible to be able to get people in our country and the by the administration is complicit in this i mean it is the largest human trafficking organization ever set up in the history of the world what is going on right now it is unprecedented what is happening you know night highlight just one other thing that people should be aware of that's an outgrowth of this we have now seen last year we saw a hundred thousand drug overdose deaths in america first time ever that that has happened partly pandemic related but it's also due to what's happening at the southern border because the fentanyl is it's an incredible what's coming into this country and one of my colleagues on judiciary put it really well these are not overdoses anymore this is poisoning this is what china and mexico was running to our border the drug lord send it into our country the biden administration will not stop it we are literally poisoning a generation of young people 18 to 45 years of age here in america and it is dreadful what is happening and it's uh one of the uh products of what's going on down in the southern border when you talk about the efforts of the of that united nations group that you were referencing that is enabling a lot of these immigrants that is enabling a lot of this trafficking you know call it what it is uh do do other countries deal with this at the same level the united states does is this an effort that is specifically targeted at the united states or is this an effort targeted at really any nation that has porous borders and a generous uh social welfare systems like we do yeah they'll go after any of the westernized countries we saw it in 2015 in europe if you remember uh it's part of the reason angela merkel is no longer the chancellor there is she said we're gonna open our borders to everyone from the middle east in afghanistan and they've been dealing with the cultural problems that that uh presented ever since over a million people came into europe when you look at the latest uh debacle in afghanistan as a result of the biden administration and all these people being ferried around the world many of the western european countries said not this time we cannot assimilate these people and so um they are they will go after any of the westernized countries and i believe it's deliberate i believe organizations like iom are doing that i would point out a couple other organizations that um people who are faith-based really should be looking at for example um lutheran social services catholic charities you know i understand they're trying to do right for people in the world but like when people came out of afghanistan they were not fully vetted for terror backgrounds and yet these uh faith-based groups are resettling them into our neighborhoods around america and they should really be looking much uh more diligently at the vetting process that happens here before settling people that may have terror background that is what the border patrol will tell you we don't know who's coming into our country right well um congressman tom tiffany i thank you for the time good luck in your travels safe travels and uh we'll be speaking with you again on a wednesday next week to get an update

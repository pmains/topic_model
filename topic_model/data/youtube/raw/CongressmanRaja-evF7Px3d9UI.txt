>>> IN OUR POLITICS LEAD,  AMERICANS' CONFIDENCE THAT  SOCIETY AND THE GOVERNMENT CAN  DO SOMETHING ABOUT MASS  SHOOTINGS IS AT A NEW HIGH. NEARLY 7 IN 10 AMERICAN ADULTS  SAY ACTION CAN BE TAKEN THAT  WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING  SHOOTINGS SUCH AS THE UVALDE  SCHOOL MASSACRE FROM HAPPENING  AGAIN. NOW, THAT SAME POLL WHICH WAS  TAKEN AFTER THE UVALDE AND  BUFFALO MASS SHOOTINGS SHOWING  AN INCREASE IN SUPPORT FOR  STRICTER GUN CONTROL LAWS,  STRONG MAJORITY OF AMERICANS,  66%, SAY THEY FAVOR STRONGER  RESTRICTIONS ON GUN OWNERSHIP,  UP FROM 60% IN 2019 AND JUST  BELOW THE HIGH OF 70% AFTER THE  PARKLAND SCHOOL SHOOTING. LET'S BRING IN CONGRESSMAN RAJA  KRISHNAMOORTHI OF ILLINOIS, ON  THE OVERSIGHT AND INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEES. CONGRESSMAN, WHAT'S YOUR  REACTION TO THESE NEW NUMBERS? DOES THIS ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRY  TO PUSH FOR EVEN MORE  LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THIS  ISSUE BEYOND WHAT WAS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW A FEW WEEKS AGO? >> SHORT ANSWER IS YES. IN FACT, IN OUR AREA, THE  HIGHLAND PARK MASSHOOTING ON  JULY 4th, MADE MY CONSTITUENTS  AND OTHERS EVEN MORE RESOLVED TO DEMAND LEGISLATION THAT WOULD  KIND OF GO ONE STEP FURTHER  BEYOND WHAT WE DID IN THE SAFER  COMMUNITIES ACT, WHICH WAS A  GOOD STEP. BUT NOW, ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF  ACCESS TO WEAPONS OF WAR. AND THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION, A TEENAGER ESSENTIALLY WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE A SMITH AND WESSON  M & P 15 ASSAULT WEAPON, M & P  STANDS FOR MILITARY AND POLICE. THAT AR-15 STYLE WEAPON WAS ABLE TO KILL AND MAIM DOZENS IN A  VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, SO  THEY WANT TO SEE THESE TYPES OF  WEAPONS OUT OF THE HANDS OF  PEOPLE, AND THAT MEANS EITHER  RAISING THE AGE OR BANNING THE  SALE OF THESE WEAPONS  ALTOGETHER. >> A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, 60%, SAY THEY DISAPPROVE OF HOW  PRESIDENT BIDEN IS HANDLING GUN  POLICY. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS, AND  ARE THERE ANY STEPS YOU WOULD  LIKE TO SEE THE PRESIDENT TAKE  UNILATERALLY? >> WELL, I THINK THAT THE  PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS,  AND THE SAFER COMMUNITIES ACT IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF  BIPARTISANSHIP AND THE SERVICE  OF INVESTING IN MENTAL HEALTH  RESOURCES, MAKING SCHOOLS SAFER, INCENTIVIZING STATES TO ADOPT  RED FLAG LAWS. AND MORE. BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW. SO FOR INSTANCE, I THINK THAT  THE FTC SHOULD ABSOLUTELY GO  AFTER THESE GUN MAKERS IN THE  WAY THAT THEY MARKET THEIR  WEAPONS OF WAR TO TEENAGERS AND  YOUNG ADULTS. YOU KNOW, OFTENTIMES JUST TAKE  DANIEL DEFENSE, FOR INSTANCE. DANIEL DEFENSE MAKES SOMETHING  CALLED A DDM-4 ASSAULT WEAPON. AND I POINTED OUT AT THE LAST  OVERSIGHT HEARING THAT THEY  ACTUALLY HAD A PICTURE OF A  TODDLER CARRYING THIS AR-15  STYLE WEAPON IN HIS LAP, AND SO  MY QUESTION IS, WHY WOULD A  DEFENSE -- I'M SORRY, A GUN  MAKER EVER MARKET A WEAPON OF  WAR IN THAT WAY? AND NOW I THINK IT'S TIME FOR  THE FTC TO GO AFTER THESE GUN  MAKERS FOR THE WAY IN WHICH THEY PLACE THESE WEAPONS IN VIDEO  GAMES LIKE CALL OF DUTY, THEY  USE SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS TO  GET TEENAGERS TO WANT TO BE LIKE THOSE CELEBRITIES. AND I THINK THAT THE FTC SHOULD  GO AFTER THEM. >> BOTH -- IN BOTH THE BUFFALO  MASS SHOOTING AND THE HIGHLAND  PARK MASS SHOOTING, THE  INDIVIDUAL WAS 18 YEARS OLD,  BOUGHT HIS GUN LEGALLY, AND  THERE WAS REASON FOR HIM TO HAVE BEEN RED FLAGGED BEFORE. BUT THE COMMUNITY JUST DIDN'T DO IT. WHETHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OR  TEACHERS OR WHOMEVER. I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN GET A FEDERAL RED FLAG LAW PASSED  ANYTIME SOON. BUT YOU CAN WORK WITH PEOPLE,  LAWMAKERS IN ILLINOIS, TO FIX  WHATEVER WENT SO WRONG HERE,  BECAUSE POLICE KNEW ABOUT THIS  YOUNG MAN. AND STILL THEY DIDN'T FLAG IT. >> AND ACTUALLY, THE GENERAL  ASSEMBLY IS MEETING TO KIND OF  REFORM THIS RED FLAG LAW, BUT  JAKE, IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO  ACCESS. WHY SHOULD A TEENAGER HAVE  ACCESS OR BE ABLE TO PURCHASE AN AR-15 STYLE WEAPON? WE SHOULD AT THE LEAST RAISE THE MINIMUM AGE FOR PURCHASE. BUT I HAVE ALSO CO-SPONSORED A  BILL TO BAN THE SALE OF THESE  AR-15 WEAPONS. AND I THINK THAT IT'S TIME THAT  WE SERIOUSLY LOOK AT THAT  BECAUSE IN MASS SHOOTING AFTER  MASS SHOOTING, WE SEE THE SAME  TYPES OF WEAPONS OF WAR DOING  THE SAME TYPES OF DESTRUCTION  THAT WE SAW ON THE FOURTH OF  JULY. THIS IS A UNIQUELY AMERICAN  PROBLEM THAT UNFORTUNATELY  HAPPENED ON A UNIQUELY AMERICAN  DAY, THE FOURTH OF JULY. >> RIGHT, BUT OF COURSE, MOST  GUN DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES  ARE DUE TO HANDGUNS, NOT WHAT  YOU CALL ASSAULT WEAPONS OR  SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS. LET ME ASK YOU, THE SENATE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HELD A  HEARING ON GUN SAFETY. THE REPUBLICANS ON THE  COMMITTEE, QUOTE, MOSTLY LEFT  THE ROOM WHILE SHE WAS SPEAKING. WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF THAT? WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? >> UNFORTUNATELY, THERE'S KIND  OF A SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL,  SPEAK NO EVIL TYPE OF APPROACH  BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE  OTHER SIDE. BUT THESE TALES OF HORROR THAT  ARE UNFOLDING BECAUSE OF THESE  MASS SHOOTINGS, YOU KNOW, HAVE  REAL CONSEQUENCES, AND THE  FOURTH OF JULY SHOOTING IN  HIGHLAND PARK, WE HAVE A  2-YEAR-OLD TODDLER, AIDEN  McCARTHY, WHOSE PARENTS WERE  BOTH MURDERED BY THE SHOOTER. NOW ORPHANED, AND IS GOING TO BE RAISED BY OTHER RELATIVES, OR WE HAVE THE 8-YEAR-OLD, COOPER  ROBERTS, WHO'S PARALYZED FROM  THE WAIST DOWN BECAUSE A BULLET  FROM THE SHOOTER SEVERED HIS  SPINAL CORD. AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. SO THESE MASS SHOOTINGS HAVE  PROFOUNDLY REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR REAL FAMILIES AND REAL PEOPLE. WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF THE  AR-15 WEAPONS OR BECAUSE OF THE  HANDGUNS YOU TALKED ABOUT. THERE, FOR INSTANCE, I HAVE  LEGISLATION CALLED THE COOL-OFF  ACT, WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A THREE-DAY WAITING PERIOD FOR THE PURCHASE OF HANDGUNS. IT'S BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE  HOMICIDES AND SUICIDES. AND I'M HOPEFUL TO MOVE THAT,  BUT OBVIOUSLY, I NEED SOME

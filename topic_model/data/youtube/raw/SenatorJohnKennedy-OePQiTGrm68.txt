for more on all this let's bring in louisiana senator john kennedy senator good to see you you can weigh in on that if you'd like but to the point that president biden was making when asked about the defund the police movement where he stood on that but he was asked more broadly where his party stood on that and as you heard in that montage there there are many democrats who have talked about that over time so is the gop lying when they attack democrats over that defund the police movement in my opinion sandra president biden is not telling the truth uh maybe george washington could not tell a lie but uh just about every politician since has mastered the skill and i don't mean to be ugly but president biden has a phd in it now some politicians lie because it's useful other politicians lie because they forget so what specifically are you saying he's lying about senator uh about cutting police spending number one if you look at the democratic party platform which he wrote it talks extensively about reimagining the police among president biden's most ardent supporters are the democratic mayors of most large cities new york chicago l.a san francisco seattle portland they've all cut police spending they've all talked about doing it president biden has appeared with them many times and said what a great job he's they're doing he hasn't he certainly hasn't discouraged them if i watch a house burn down don't call the police or the fire department i think i'm responsible last hour we had dion joseph on he's with the lapd listen to this senator when we have politicians who throw us under the bus who praised rioters and protesters who who vandalized and caused so much destruction okay when you put these criminal laws on criminals on a pedestal and throw us under the bus that's what's killing our morale uh it's an amazing thing you know we we canvassed the country every day certainly these big american cities and what they're dealing with is something they have not seen in decades you no i know you know that back to the president he was asked last summer if he supported taking money away from police departments he said yes absolutely that he agreed we can redirect some of the police funding that's not what he said last night he said republicans like yourself are lying about him suggesting to the fund well president biden's not telling the truth and uh that's just a fact it's been well documented your show has just documented it in the last 20 minutes the the problem that that president biden has is a is a problem with his party not all democrats but many democrats uh the whack jobs truly do believe in defunding the police they think cops most cops are racist apparently even african-american cops they think cops are guilty until proven innocent i've said this before they think that if a cop has to shoot a bad guy it's the cops fault always but if a bad guy shoots a cop it's the gun's fault and the american people see that and actions have consequences and the re when they uh when they de-emphasize the importance of the police crime rises uh duh and that's what's been happening throughout america and for president biden to say oh no no no i'm i'm not i've never been a part of that i mean you know dream weaver let me say it again if i if i watch somebody start a fire and the house is burning down and i don't call the fire department i'm morally responsible and he is and he knows it senator we are still in the middle of the middle of the pandemic it seems now the delta variants causing a big fear over what happens next with the coronavirus crisis uh but u.s envoy john kerry seems to think the priority even though we're still battling this virus should be climate change listen the climate crisis my friends is the test of our times we don't have the luxury of waiting until covet is vanquished to take up the climate challenge should that be the priority senator it's not our top priority our top priority right now is the pandemic and it's getting people back to work look co2 is it's a greenhouse gas i mean as you know it traps heat so does water vapor the problem in reducing co2 is twofold number one the zealots and number two the china we've got a lot of zealots you might an unshareable person might call them whack jobs uh who don't see climate change as a discrete scientific problem they see it as a religion based on their feelings and they want to get rid of free enterprise and turn the world upside down the second problem is that we have reduced our co2 emissions in america since 2005 we reduced them about 14 china's in that period of time has increased theirs about 70 percent there aren't boundaries in the atmosphere there aren't boundaries in space if we reduce our co2 emissions and china raises their their 70 percent and we wreck our economy to do it and china grows stronger as a result who comes out the winner here not the environment and not the united states senator thank you for your time

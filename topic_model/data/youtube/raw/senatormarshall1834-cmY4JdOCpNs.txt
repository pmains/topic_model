thank you madam chair and welcome to all of our guests today i just want to make sure you all are feeling the same pain that kansans are feeling from the economic uh cost of the february winter events i hope that that you can feel the same pain that we're going to feel for a decade an average family home like i grew up in uh two three bedrooms two two baths natural gas probably about eighty ninety hundred dollars a month that cost was twenty five hundred dollars for february and what they're going to do is take that over the next 10 years and let people pay off that debt probably it will double the average kansas family's natural gas bill for the next 10 years and it feels like we're just piling on when it comes to energy costs we're already paying 40 percent more at the gas pump and as the chairman indicated earlier today the cost of natural gas is more than doubled since this administration has taken over so certainly the cost of energy is just through the roof some small businesses in kansas sugar creek beef packing typical plays about twenty four thousand dollars a month then they got stuck with six hundred thousand dollars that month so went from twenty four thousand dollars in average you're making a business plan you get a six hundred thousand dollar hickey a homeless shelter in kansas usually paying about two thousand dollars a month two thousand dollars a month their bill for february was forty eight thousand dollars this little city of mulberry not to be confused with mayberry but the little city of mulberry typically plays about two and a half dollars a unit they were charged three hundred and thirty dollars unit a thirteen thousand percent increase thirteen thousand percent increase city of winfield uh municipality typically a monthly bill 130 000 a month 8 million an 8 million dollar surprise for them you know the people kansas want to know what is their senator doing and ferc would be one of my resources so i'll start with the chairman and kind of multiple questions here to try to answer together i think what the people of kansas want to know is who made the money who made all that money on that increase what has work done about it is there an investigation underway and what would be a reasonable timeline for the people of kansas to know that the truth about this was their price gouging and who made the money well thank you very much senator i first say i i the the the impacts were horrific and and that that's we need to think about these types of situations where there are shortages and what happens in terms of prices they want to start with jurisdiction we don't have jurisdiction over the the price of the sale of natural gas congress deregulated that a number of years ago i believe it would be helpful if congress would whether it give ferc or some other agency some sort of circuit breaker authority when there's extreme prices to impose some sort of limitations at certain times i think that would be helpful but secondly as you mentioned we do have authority over the manipulation or to guard against the manipulation of both our electric markets and our natural gas markets we've entered into a number of um inquiries with regard to alleged manipulation that occurred during the winter storm yuri um several of them we found a number of anomalies several of those particular anomalies when we investigated them we moved them on to what we call our investigations office uh so we're moving forward it takes a while unfortunately because we have to go through a lot of data we haven't made any final determinations yet but i can assure you that to the extent that we do find that there is manipulation we will make sure that who who made the money and what your what's a reasonable timeline i can't give i can get you a list of individual companies that reportedly made significant amount of money in terms of the timeline of the manipulation investigations um i don't have a specific timetable for you but moving as quickly as we can months years uh i'm hoping i'm hoping months yeah uh mr christie you've all in staten and federal level now who made some money in these events is it the pipeline is it the people that are selling the natural gas at the pump not specific companies but who who benefits from from this a 13 000 increase somebody got rich well as the chairman said that is the the situation from february is under investigation by our enforcement division and so i don't want to comment on that that investigation your question about who makes the money it could be traders it could be suppliers it could it depends on the facts of the situation in the and what happened in kansas and oklahoma uh in this past february of course as the chairman says under investigation i think a bigger issue too that needs to be just considered his background is again as we go through this transition to a different resource mix lower carbon gas has got to be part of the mix and that means gas supply has got to be plentiful and gas supply has got to be transported you've got to transport a product before you can use it and so that gets to the to the market availability of gas but as far as the manipulation of this intense shortage that we had in february uh that's definitely under investigation needs to be investigated and see where see whether there was manipulation that drove us that took advantage of that a very tragic situation thank you madam chair i yield back thank you

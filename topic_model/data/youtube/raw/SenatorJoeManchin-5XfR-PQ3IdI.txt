let me welcome everybody here today because i think it's an exciting day for west virginia it's exciting day for our country before i get started i want us all to think about all the suffering that's going on in ukraine and the effect that's had on the world i don't think we've ever seen the world the free world ever come together like this before we have a golden opportunity to reset who we are as a human race and do it with the dignity and respect and pride and basically the sympathy we have and the empathy for those who are suffering so much right now everything that we can do as united states of america i can assure you that we're doing we're giving them all the assistance all the aid that we possibly can and all the war efforts that they're going to need to make sure that this is this as punishing on putin as he thinks he wants to be on them so it's going to be a very difficult time i want to bring greetings from my friend shelly moore capito she's in poland right now with a group of senators who are representing we're taking everyone's rotating going again showing the support we have for our nato allies and she couldn't be here today because of that but i want to bring her her greetings to you it's my honor to host my dear friends who i think the first time that i can recall that we've had this many secretaries staffs president's advisory team economic team all in one state at one time and we have with us today we have secretary granholm she's a department of energy secretary a long time friend of mine she's a former governor of michigan we worked very well together and became very very dear friends and this is so good to have her it's also good to have my friend secretary deb holland deb's a former congresswoman uh she understands what the public lands are all about and how we best integrate the public with the citizens of our great country but also to preserve and cherish the lands that we have and use them in the most resourceful way uh also we have brian dietz with us and brian's basically head of the uh the he's in the gu the president's advisory council he's the head man that tries to put the numbers together to make everything work here as we move forward he has his team with us here today too for generations i think all of you know that the west virginia has done the heavy lifting and we've kept the lights on we've had the coal and we've done the mining we've done all the heavy lifting and we made the steel we've built the guns and ships and the factories and everything that we have today and i just want to make sure that no one forgets about west virginia what we've done and no one's going to be left behind that's our purpose for being here today unfortunately many of the communities that bear the scars of all the heavy work they've done enter a different position that they may have ever been in and that's what we're here to do to make sure that they know they haven't been left behind and we can do everything we can to help them and i believe the two most crucial members of the president's cabinet which is secretary of energy and interior are the two agencies that are going to help us revitalize west virginia and our coal communities and they're they're here with their staff as i said before you're going to see working group on coal and power plant communities they're going to be listening to members of our community and learning firsthand how they can use the important roles to ensure that that every coal community has the opportunity to be the greatness they've had in the past and that's our goal too i understand that there along with a few others that this morning planned that they're going to share some announcements of people behind all the speaking people that have here and the announcement they're going to share i think it's all going to be good news we've had a great morning so far we've been able to meet with new corps our newest largest investment in the state of west virginia close to 3 billion bringing close to 1 000 people to west virginia making this commitment to west virginia won out over many states it speaks volumes of who we are as a state who our people are and the confidence they have to make that type of investment with the cleanest still making in the world using electric art not not the old blast furnaces that we all grew up and knowing about and we're all changing we're all transitioning so with that i'm going to turn it over to our native friend dr brian anderson who heads up nettle in morgantown for us brian well thank you senator manchin for that very warm welcome and for hosting uh the hospitality uh that we know as west virginians uh to our federal agencies that we've been hosting over the last week and particularly here today for a listening session as the senator mentioned we're here to listen to coal communities to listen to the energy communities and to find the pathways for economic revitalization through the transformation of the energy system i am brian anderson the director of the interagency working group on coal and power plant communities and economic revitalization and the director of the national energy technology laboratory one of doe's 17 national labs is here in west virginia and the iwg the interagency working group is a group of more than a dozen federal agencies that are committed to near and long-term actions so we can support workers and support the residents of coal oil and gas communities through this transition particularly here in the mountain state the mission of the iwg hits very close to home for me i'm a seventh generation west virginian the grandson of a coal miner and my family has lived and worked in this state for many generations predating the state by about 100 years in fact i know how incredibly hard the workers of west virginia work and i've witnessed their resilience as our nation is starting to transition our energy system into the future in the future of our energy supply now west virginia is part of a new area new era of clean energy development the state has the opportunity to be a leader not just domestically but globally whether it's through jobs in research and development manufacturing labor and much more west virginia and our energy workers are well positioned to take this workforce and move it into the new and emerging energy industries there's been great progress to date in revitalizing our economies and the communities and expanding our workforce across this state and we can't stop here we have to do more and we will do more not just in west virginia but across appalachia and all the energy communities around the country this work requires the collaboration of state and federal governments which is why here today it is really exciting we're having an investment roundtable that was mentioned to support the energy communities of appalachia speaking of the investments i'm really excited to highlight a couple uh the first the us department of agriculture represented by the under secretary for rural development justin maxson is awarding five grants designed to invest in community services such as first responders grid improvements and other infrastructure to energy communities in west virginia pennsylvania ohio and kentucky second the u.s economic development administration is part of the department of commerce announced new awards under its coal communities commitment a commitment that the department of commerce set aside 300 million dollars for coal communities around our country this includes a 2.4 million dollar grant to the former mining and logging town where my family came from in pikeville kentucky it was this to help the local medical center purchase important healthcare equipment i'd like to extend the congratulations to all those recipients this work will require collaboration and dedication and as we look forward to the future of west virginia it's vital that we focus on the ability for communities across the state to reinvent themselves and to provide a diversified set of options for economic development it is my pleasure to turn it over to a vital partner of the interagency working group team and certainly somebody who is no stranger to the state of west virginia the federal co-chair of the appalachian regional commission gail manchin thank you and good morning and today it is all about numbers i am the 13th federal co-chair of the appalachian regional commission representing 13 states and in september we announced a our largest power grant program to date that was 46 million dollars across 57 counties across our 13 states and today we are yesterday we actually formally announced our second tranche of power grants power grants are the competitive grants directed toward our coal impacted communities and so yesterday we announced a another round of grants 21 million dollars to 21 counties across eight states three of those grants right here in west virginia one to the west virginia regional technology park for 886 thousand seven hundred and sixty two dollars the second one to the kanawha county commission for hundred and seventy five thousand dollars uh six hundred seventy five thousand two hundred and ten dollars and to generation west virginia five hundred and twenty three thousand hundred and that's not the end we have another uh round of applications going out they will be due april the 29th so it is this continuum of uh our coal impacted communities having the opportunity to reach out but not forgetting that we have this wonderful partnership with the other agencies and administration in washington d.c and we certainly plan at arc to continue that growing together working together and making sure that all across our appalachian region that people understand the opportunities that we have this time for the first time in our in our lifetime to really bring parity to the appalachian region with the rest of the country so thank you all very much [Applause] and now i would ask sanjiv to come up for a more important announcement secretary granholm and secretary holland for including us in this rather important meeting and i'm reminded of about three months ago when i was invited by the biden administration to the white house and this was december 15th a meeting that had the secretary granholm secretary ray mondo it had the appalachian region commission federal co-chair mrs manchin brian dees the national economic advisor and national climate advisor regina mccarthy and at that meeting three months ago i committed that on behalf of sparks that we are setting our sights on exploring the world was exploring the possibility of setting up manufacturing for a batteries hidden appellation and when i said that i happened to be sitting next to mrs mansion and i looked over to mrs manchin and she had a look of disbelief on her face i'm not kidding serious and when i was done she leaned over and asked me she says where's your company from i said i'm from silicon valley and my company is from silicon valley that look of disbelief changed to utter disbelief and i don't blame her in california especially in silicon valley we have quite a few entrepreneurs who have this tendency to be flaky so she was very justified when she had that look but folks three months from then and here i am to make good on that promise today actually yesterday we announced that we are setting up manufacturing for our batteries here in west virginia and these three months have been phenomenal i would like to thank our friends from west virginia i would like to thank secretary granholm and her team at doe to make this happen it just shows that when you have the right partners in a public private partnership you can achieve a lot in these three months i can tell you we have quite a few friends here my friend sarah builder karen skelton from due there were moments where i was like all right let's give it up and i'm sure the same sentiment was shared on the side of west virginia too but i think the public private partnership has made it happen and again a big thanks to everyone involved in making this come to fruition the real work starts now before we set up our factory we have to hire people so very proud very excited to announce a partnership with the united mine workers and jointly we will be recruiting we will be training and putting the displaced workers from the coal mining industry to work on advanced battery manufacturing and [Applause] we will be starting off with about 350 jobs but this is just the start the idea is to scale up to multiple gigawatts and scale up 10 times as far as job creation is concerned so as i said this is just the start and i will wrap up with sharing one conversation that i had with senator manchin last night he asked me he said that's very good that you are looking to make cobalt free batteries here in my state in west virginia but where will you get the cathode and the anode from i was shocked he is a smart politician nobody else asks me that question not the people we talk to to hire not our potential employees not our customers nobody asks me where will you get the material from for making cathodes or anodes i can tell you one thing when i started this company two years and three months ago the focus was to re-engineer the supply chain it's a very long phrase re-engineer the supply chain but what i mean by that is that essentially not only are we manufacturing here we are actually creating the supply chain for our lithium batteries here in the united states here in west virginia [Applause] [Music] we are going to be creating jobs both at sparks as well as at our suppliers who will be supplying us these materials here in the united states here in west virginia not in china and that's my promise to you thank you [Music] i i hope everybody gets the significance of what that announcement is that west virginia is going to be home to a battery gigafactory starting with 350 employees and training the best of the best the mine workers that have already got great skills this is a um this is what happens when you have focus and teams working together and this is what the president envisioned when he set up the intergovernmental work group on coal and power plant communities he wanted to have the federal government focus its efforts on communities like in west virginia to make sure that no community is left behind one of the people that has been instrumental from inside the white house in orchestrating that is brian diese who's behind you over here who's head of the national economic council and his team working with the department of energy and our other intergovernmental partners here so i think you just heard i want to say six announcements so far between the two you announced and the three that um gail mansion announced and the one that sanjeev just announced and i have two more to add to the pile so number one when you have a battery factory and you have to have workers who know how to build those batteries you have to have a training strategy on how to make sure that the skills are matched with the jobs that they're going to take on so we are announcing from the department of energy five million dollars toward a a training initiative a train workforce training initiative the first in the country focused on battery workers this is it's a competitive program so it's a new program hasn't been designed where it's going to go yet but i think you'll be well positioned i'll just say that um but these these pilot sites will be in partnership with labor this is being done in partnership with the afl-cio so the mine workers are going to be a piece of it the united auto workers who also build batteries across the country are going to be a part of it and so we want to make sure that we have the skilled workforce training program to be able to ensure that no worker is left behind as well five million dollars for five uh five sites across the country that uh effort will support by the way the three billion dollars that comes from the bipartisan infrastructure law that senator manchin was so instrumental in making sure we got across the finish line related to these supply chains for the electric vehicle like the battery and like the guts to the battery including the critical minerals that make up that battery we should not be relying upon countries like china or others for the supplies to make us really energy independent we should be building the full supply chain here and so part of what was done in the bipartisan infrastructure law is that we could invest in manufacturing of batteries and extraction in a responsible way of the critical minerals and processing of those minerals and speaking of minerals and making sure that we are doing things right we have another announcement which is 2.2 million dollars that the department of energy is awarding through our national energy technology laboratory which is headed by brian anderson um four this is for the company called x matte carbon core composites which are take which is taking waste from coal and converting it into carb carbon fiber and carbon composites for manufactured homes 2.2 million and that will be in bluefield west virginia as well the bottom line is west virginia has powered our nation for the past hundred and some odd years and we are so grateful for that you've brought us to where we are and we want you to power our nation for the next 100 and some odd years well into the future using new technologies as well as the ones that you have traditionally relied upon west virginia can be the pilot state for how the clean energy pie grows and how we can put people to work with fantastic skills powering our nation into the future and it's why the president's full uh agenda for creating both uh supply and demand the horse and the cart the horse has to be put the horse of demand has to be put before the cart of supply and this part of the demand means that you've got to have jobs before you have people to work in those jobs and the people that are going to be working at sparks as you heard will be mine workers and representing the mine workers in that is brian sampson and brian will you come up and say a word about what it's going to mean for y'all thank you so much we are very happy to be here um that's sanji mentioned back in december we were all at the white house umw representatives the interagency working group to discuss what to do with um and how to better serve dislocated coal miners in coal country and good well-paying union jobs both of us saw that it would be mutually beneficial for a partnership in west virginia to bring the production of batteries back to the united states specifically to the coalfields using technology developed here materials sourced here and the labor of dislocated coal miners some of the best in the world our umwa career centers have the facilities to retrain these coal miners to work in the plants we intend to begin this endeavor immediately we hope to have the folks trained at our facilities and ready to go for production this year [Music] we're on track to recruit as many folks as we can to staff the facility in morgantown we're ready to go and this is a key component in the umwa's energy transition principles that we announced last spring we need good union jobs in these coal fields it doesn't matter what kind of industry they're in it's also important important to point out the first principle of those of of that process and that was to be sure to to maintain our existing coal-fired and coal mine jobs and that would be through the the the bri the construction of carbon capture and storage facilities this would allow our current cooperating facilities and plants to continue to operate in a carbon neutral way uh you know we don't know what the future holds we know that we care about the tens of thousands of dislocated coal miners that are out there and you know the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill that coal miners across this country need to thank senator manchin and others for it coal miners in west virginia are you a great debt sir um you know that that has helped move this process forward so as we start towards this project we've got coal miners out there that are laid off sometimes the coal industry doesn't care about them once they're laid off but we do and that's who we are we appreciate the administration's work and everything that everyone has done to bring this together we look forward to working with sparks to create a world-class lithium battery operation here in the coalfields using coal miners some of the best workers in the world thank you and i'd like to introduce senator halton thank you all so much and yes i couldn't agree with that more thank you coal miners are some of the best workers in the world good morning everyone i wanted to start by thanking all the leaders who have joined us for a busy day ahead chairman manchin thank you so much i'm so honored to be here in your beautiful state and um and grateful for your continued leadership on behalf of everyone in this state secretary granholm so proud to serve with you in the president's cabinet we have a packed itinerary today where we will see firsthand how legacy pollution continues to impact people and the communities they live in as well as the ongoing work to help clean up these sites over the last several weeks i've embarked on a multi-state tour of appalachia to view several abandoned mine land sites that are in various stages of the reclamation process throughout those travels including some that we'll see here today i've talked with labor leaders current and former coal miners conservation advocates and community leaders about how critical infrastructure investments will help ensure healthy lands and waters in neighborhoods and in rural areas across the state the reality is that there's a lot of work to do and right here in west virginia it's a great place to make a great start thankfully in partnership with many of the folks you see here today the biden harris administration is already hard at work taking action president biden's bipartisan infrastructure law makes an 11.3 billion dollar investment in cleaning up abandoned mine lands with that funding people can help to reclaim abandoned my lands for recreational facilities and other economic redevelopment as well as to improve local water quality and reduce the impacts of flooding that law also provides for the first time a 4.7 billion dollar funding to clean up orphaned oil and gas wells this critical funding will create jobs right here in appalachia and across the country while reducing methane polluted air and water pollution in fact just in the last two weeks the interior department has announced that nearly 215 million dollars in bipartisan infrastructure law investments is available this year alone right here in west virginia for those abandoned mines and orphan oil and gas wells in january we made 140 million dollars available for mine land reclamation work in february we allocated 55 million dollars for orphaned oil and gas well cleanup and in march we provided another 18 million to address abandoned mine lands in west virginia thanks to the long-term extension of the traditional aml program which senator manchin was instrumental in making happen and that's just the beginning there will be many more years of reliable funding that americans can count on in the future so today i'm also excited to announce the opening of nominations for the 2022 abandoned mine land reclamation awards which recognize outstanding state and tribal efforts to reclaim abandoned coal mines presented in partnership with interior's office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement the national association of abandoned mine land programs these awards recognize exemplary reclamation projects and are the highest honor a reclamation program can receive these historic investments are all part of the administration's all-of-government approach to support communities as the energy economy undergoes a transition central to that transition is innovation and job creation with these historic investments will create vitally needed good paying union jobs in coal communities by funding all types of reclamation projects and once these sites are cleaned up they'll become part of the foundation for new economic development opportunities the last thing i'll say is that none of this could have happened without president joe biden with the help of leaders like chairman manchin and senator capito president biden brought democrats and republicans together to pass the bipartisan infrastructure law thanks to president biden not only has infrastructure week finally arrived but we can look forward to infrastructure decade that delivers jobs for the american people this law is the largest long-term investment in our nation's infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century and perhaps the largest investment in our coal communities ever together we'll make these smart investments build a cleaner and more just future for our children and grandchildren and i am happy now to turn it over to you chairman thank you [Applause] let me say um what we've all heard is west virginians is so exciting it's a new day it really is a new day for us the transition that's going on in our country the transition in the world but also for us to be a leader we are a state that basically is a heavy uh lifting state we have an awful lot of coal natural gas but we have the opportunity to do so much more and that's what they're bringing today the announcements that were made by everyone you just heard speak is unbelievable and we're going to have to really come to the table and come strong we have to have the re the labor resource we've got to be able to deliver and that's where our educators come into it we have wvu we have marshall we have technical and community colleges we have our system that basically is going to give us the workforce that's needed let me tell you how this came about to a certain extent because the president i had a conversation after he got elected but before he was inaugurated and we were talking he says tell me about what's west virginia and i said sir as he knows he didn't do well here in the election and we were talking about that and it wasn't about that he wasn't worried about how well he did or how how not so well he did he was saying why and why do they feel the way they do and what's going on i said mr president let me just tell you very quickly about west virginians we feel lately that we've been left behind we're not good enough we're not clean enough we're not green enough and we're not smart enough and for some reason it's just discarded us but yet we've done heavy lifting that brought this country where it is today we've won two world wars because of the mine and the coal that we produced the steel that we made and basically the commitment dedication of the men and women who fought from west virginia we have more veterans per capita we've given everything we can to this great country to be the superpower of the world and for some reason now no one seems to recognize it nothing's going on and people have lost confidence in the federal government that they really want to help us being part of this transition that's going on he says we're not leaving anybody behind i said i'll show you i said mr president we've heard that a lot a lot a lot from previous administrations on both sides of the out we've heard that but we have not seen it i said we've heard about all of these retraining we were going to do for the workforce we retrained the workforce and all it ended up being it was basically an extension to unemployment benefits because no jobs came because there's no factories now we're seeing basically the rubber hit the road that makes a difference now this is the first time in the history of west virginia that we had an opportunity to help ourselves because it's a partnership it's the federal government it's the state government it's the local government it's participation it's the private and basically the academia all coming together for one cause to lift up the quality of life in west virginia we've got coal communities have been left behind they're not left behind anymore they're going to have an opportunity but they've got to be absolutely in the game too they're going to have to participate they're going to have to basically join this partnership i've always said government should not be your provider but it should be the best partner you've ever had we should be your best partner you've ever had they're stepping to the table our friends have come from washington my friends i work with on a daily basis and we have the ability to sit down and work through our differences but the most important thing we have right now west virginia will continue to supply the dispatchable baseload power that's needed as this transition continues and when uh my good friend jennifer granholm was saying uh we're not going to put the cart in front of the horse and say okay now horse you push that cart up the hill the horse is not made to push you know and we're made to pull and that's who we are we can pull our own weight and we'll do that i just thank them all i think i've never been more excited today we met also and i want to say with governor justice and basically we had senator capito and her staff we have congressman david mckinley and his staff and my staff all forming a coalition to compete for one of the top prizes i think in america right now as far as in the transition going on in the clean energy is going to be hydrogen and a hydrogen hub is going to be tremendous it is an engine within itself and what it's going to be able to do we have everything here we are absolutely ready to go corby gave us a good speech last night and told us exactly where we are and a person who knows on the front line that has the ability that has the minerals has the property and everything they can go we're all in private sector public sector academia we're all in together so with that let me just say thank you thank you to all of you for being here and to our epa friends and i've said this we need you to be with us working with us we don't need obstacles we need basically partnerships and they are here to commit this is our philadelphia office they are committed as a partnership working with us if we're doing something wrong and we can do it better help us and show us we'll work together if we can do something that we think would help you we'll share that too that's the partnership that's needed and that's what really government's all about with that i'm going to go ahead and open up for any uh questions from our press if you're like and you want to go ahead and get that started you just reach out whoever well let me just say first and i want our secretary to time in gilk and whoever and sanjay there's there's a person right there that can tell you and but first of all new core new course for real you know that they're the largest still making they make it cleaner than anybody else they use all electric arc furnaces they don't use the blast furnaces that we did in the past or coking or any of that so they're for real they're going to make 2.7 billion almost 3 billion they think when it's all said and done 800 to 1000 people they bought the land they're in production from that standpoint so that's going to happen okay we know that you're talking about the programs are talking about now how do we know it's really going to help southern west virginia or coal communities and with that i'm going to look john g can tell you exactly what brought him here and his commitment is already made that's actually a very good question because that's the question i asked myself when i landed here in west virginia and that was a question that was asked to me by quite a few folks why are you here and i'll tell you why i'm here firstly batteries are about natural resource economy and that's what the state of west virginia promises so that's one the second is i'm not a rookie this is my third startup and the first two startups did not have public private partnerships then i spent some time at u.s department of energy and the lessons learned from all three were public private partnerships are the only way if we are going to make the new energy technology a viable option whether we are talking about hydrogen whether we are talking about batteries whether we are talking about anything to do with new energy technologies it has to have the right combination of public private partnership and i think what i've heard senator manchin talk about what we heard the two secretaries talk about that's the catalyst to make this happen and then the third is we need to look at what's in our house not look at the neighboring house then what we have in our house is very well trained workforce if we can train them and put them to work this is a very disciplined workforce and that's what we need and the next thing we need to do obviously is execution so as an entrepreneur i'll tell you execution is the name of the game but it's a combination of all of these as catalyst the public private partnership the workforce and making sure all of that is combined together and that's a success story hopefully it's a success story we have brandon and brandon brandon i know brandon said where's brandon denson i know he's back there somewhere he had to leave and he's been to the front line and everything the bottom line is give you the the bipartisan infrastructure bill it's one thing for me to come and say i'm going to work for this i'm going to try to get this passed that's one thing but this happened 1.2 trillion dollars over an eight to ten year period it's a commitments made the money will be going out senator grantham senator hall and all that you know 11 billion dollars in aml abandoned my land reclamation six billion dollars in in wales the old wells that we've had and wherever you live in west virginia there's some old wells that need plugged there are methane's escaping we got to do that for the environment but it's basically going to create so many jobs and these are all going to be jobs basically prevailing wage so it's all going to be high in highways jobs not just menial jobs or basically low end entry jobs so that's the commitment that's made now president biden has fulfilled that he made sure he stood came to the plate he supported what we did he was on board worked with us all the way through brian was there from economic end of it they knew exactly what had to be done and west virginia was i said we're the pilot we should be the pilot program we'll show you because we have more needs here because we've done so much heavy lifting for the last century have you found the site yesterday he said we found the site in west virginia we are a few weeks from announcing where the site will be so we are in the final stages of discussion and negotiation on that so as i said earlier we're going to start off with about 350 people in the initial phase and then as the capacity uh increases so 350 people for roughly about one gigawatt hour of capacity our intent is to scale that to 10 times here to possibly about 10 gigawatt hour and you can do the math so it's a sort of almost a linear increase in the number of jobs that will be created so and 10 gigabyte hour possibly about 3 000 to 3 500 jobs let me just say what part of the state you're going north south is it any one part you felt that you should need to be can you give me a couple of weeks we'll be announcing that i've known john for a long time he won't give you two two days john i'll be in touch with you pretty soon let me just say this to all of you i've been very skeptical about supply chains and i've been very skeptical about ve evs and going down the battery route that's why basically when we did the infrastructure bill we split off and put money into hydrogen clean fuel we can do it we can make it here we make all you want west virginia is a catalyst for hydrogen fuel it's where it should be done but with that being said i said fine let's not put our eggs in one basket because i was always concerned about being held captive by the foreign supply chain and i said i'm old enough to remember standing in line 1974 buying gas when opec shut us off and i didn't want to go through that again this is what i was so excited and jennifer and i've talked many times about that and i've talked to the epa and everybody we have got to start working get us some permits let us go to work let us start mining let us start refining they've all left this country because it made it so unbearably difficult to get through the process and i've told the president this i said if we have to use the defense production act we're in a war time and we've got to get up and running and be self-sufficient i'm sorry can you repeat it um these efforts in this moment we're living in now and what's being proposed this project and others does it feel different from training and work with course development efforts that have been proposed that have been kind sure um here we have an employer ready to go and to produce a product in the past we've spent a lot of money on retraining workers to go out of state and do other jobs and that's been one of the biggest problems my workers have had a career center in place for decades retraining people have been laid off from coal industry but we've never had partners willing to step up and say we've got jobs for them and now we do and i think that's a one of the biggest things to take away from this let me just say i the prevailing wage what's the prevailing wage right now when you're safe labor wage prevailing wage 2025 dollars an hour so we're talking about higher than any type of entry we have so the difference is right now the money's there they're going to do the wells they're going to do the uh aml mine reclamation so anything we train for that needs to be done to cap wells to basically bring land back to restoration we can use again you train to that and say here's the job you get if you train to this so if we do it through a community technical college or whatever you have associate degree whatever you have you had the skill sets for that program certified that you went through the program you'll have a job automatically this is not just pie in the sky go ahead and train for this and something might come that's the difference and now you have with the clean energy technology coming with with the batteries we want we want to get in recycling too because recycling we can recycle and do tremendous within the recycling for the battery chain also but i just want to make sure that we can do it here and i'm going to show how we do in west virginia anything else one last one one last one if you got one one okay right there the game plan is basically convincing people that there's real jobs with real money that's all because they've seen so much before they never proved out to be fruition to where there was a job for them to have a paycheck there's paychecks waiting for you now these will be ready to go when were the contract step i don't know when contracts for the aml has it started moving that now i'm not sure about the specific contracts but the aml money is moving the money's been appropriate it's already been there it's there for them they'll they'll put the money out as soon as we have the projects we have to have projects then it goes they review the project that we're doing they know exactly how much money it's going to take to fix these projects or basically do the ones that we've identified it's a partner with the state too state dep they're identifying the worst cases we have that'll be the first one we start on for aml you know from aml reclamation and also the wells that we have in the worst situation that are having more emissions as far as methane than any of the other wells and they'll be different innovation because you know we haven't ever done anything in this scale so the more the better we are at it the more efficient we are at the more we're going to do okay thank you all appreciate it very much

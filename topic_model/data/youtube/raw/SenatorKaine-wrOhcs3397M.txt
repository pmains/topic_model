16 days after the government shutdown and one day before the deadline to raise the nation's borrowing limit lawmakers finally reached a deal but it's only a short-term agreement and joining us now with more is democratic senator of Virginia Tim Kaine thank you very much senator for coming in and talking weather that we appreciate you are coming in and not sitting with us decide to be with so the dust hasn't even really settled on this yet you know I think the first question that I would ask you is what would you say to all of these furloughed workers who frankly are a little embarrassed by the attention on both sides yeah well they are they ought to be embarrassed and it was an embarrassing chapter for our country there's no reason ever to shut down the government the United States and there's no reason ever to threaten our fiscal soundness by saying we're not gonna honor our fiscal obligation so it was foolish to begin with thank goodness we pulled back from the brink I was the co-sponsor of the bill to make sure that these congressional staffers and other federal workers who were furloughed through no fault of their own get back pay that's going to happen everybody's coming back to work today so i hope we learned that don't threaten shutdown don't threaten to default that will if we learn that lesson it will be an important one but now we've got to work together to find the longer-term budget framework as you pointed out wisdom that this is the deal that sort of extends government funding through mid-january and the debt ceiling through early februari but the real core of the deal is getting the House and Senate together in a budget conference which we in the Senate have been trying to do since March to sit down and try to work out a fiscal year 2014 budget and hopefully even agree on some principles that can last beyond 2014 now there are a lot of people out there who are we're angry about what happened that it came all this came up to the last minute to that event and all that has happened how can we reassure them that this won't happen to happen again because basically this is just down the road we're we're good until December and January in February but how can we reassure them this won't happen again neither there needs to be conversations that we know yeah I mean I think it's it's fair for people to be skeptical but the reason if you really short form it the reason the government shutdown is because the two houses wouldn't sit down in a budget conference this Senate and House passed budgets the same week in march into march and the Senate said let's go to a conference and sit down you bring your plane will bring our will compromise the house didn't want to a conference and so if you don't do a conference you don't find a compromise if you don't find a compromise there's no budget if you don't have a budget the government shuts down so we are finally doing what we should have been doing since March was just sitting down at a conference table but they're hard decisions to make the Senate and House budgets are different in terms of the dollar amount there's about a 70 billion dollar difference in the dollar amount and some significant differences in programs but look I was a governor and I had two houses and they would do different budgets and we sit down in a conference table and you know how it works un one I win one we split the difference on the third we get creative on the fourth you know you just work through the issues and we have to do that there's no substitute for oh I want to ask you also you were there last week with some tense moments with Mayor Vincent Gray absolutely I and what do you say to your counterparts in the District of Columbia who feel like they were somewhat disrespected well I the fact that the district budget is tied to the federal budget and the district can't even spend its own money if the federal government does something like this is crazy so we ought to figure out a reform to that i mean i i'm i'm in favor of district statehood rights but but short of that even before we get over that hurdle we ought to figure out a way to let the district operated some budget i was mayor too i was mayor of richmond you know whatever happened at the federal level we were going to operate our services at the city level and the district's budget should not be clamped it's something like this happens now hopefully sometimes won't happen again but we ought to look at a reform to free up the district to spend its own money during it like there's some mending of a relationship that needs to be done with the District of Columbia and and their counterparts yeah I will say this nobody from the district ever called me to ask for help or advice over the course of this but but if they do want help on trying to separate out the district budget from you know this kind of dysfunctional level glad to do it they have the ability to spend their own money right now you're you're also on this on the committee you're on this on Budget Committee is my part of any with senators senator Warner I am as well um explain a little bit about how you plan on doing your parts make sure that by December 13th is deadline that we don't have this happen ago senator patty Murray of Washington is the chair of the Senate budget Paul Ryan of Wisconsin share the house budget committee we will be together in conference to try to find this 2014 plan going forward and to avoid more brinksmanship and again it will be tough the two budgets are different but that that governor's deal with that so Mark Warner was a governor he dealt with it when he was governor and so did I my biggest challenge once when I was governors I had two Republican houses my first year that differed so wildly on the budget they took it into overtime and I had to try to broker the deal between them so I've been in these negotiations before and and frankly there's no substitute for compromising you have to be willing we passed a budget Senate budget I feel very strongly about it we could put it in place without changing an apostrophe or common it would work but we know the house is going to feel the same about their budget so we have to be willing to sit down over the course of the two months spend a lot of time at it to try to find the right otherwise going board and compromise in the dirty word I mean there's there's some people in Congress you feel like we can ever compromise if we don't get our way will shut government down that's the wrong attitude you have to be willing to do some give and taken and and you know it's just old-fashioned stuff but that's what we're going to be doing over the next couple my get everyone back to the middle of the road yeah absolutely YouTube hunt you would divide a government that's Americans picked a Republican majority in the house and a Democratic majority in senate there's not gonna be a deal that's not a bipartisan deal senator kay thank you so much good we wish you thanks all right this close things over to Tucker bars right now and talk about whether

there are new troop movements by Russian troops near Ukraine and there's a fresh round of threats coming this morning we are hearing new warnings from the White House as well at more economic sanctions may be on the way congressman Michael McCaul homeland House Homeland Security chair joins us this morning with a little bit of insight into some of these things we were supposed to have a deal for the Russians to pull back what's happening now well you have to look at the whole situation I don't think the Russians really negotiating in good faith I think mr. Putin when I was over in Russia I get a sense of restoring you know the Empire of old days and the USSR the old USSR precisely and Ukraine was part of that the Baltic States I think this is part of an overall long-term strategy to win over the russian-speaking people in these areas were seen in Crimea Crimea perhaps could be a model for the rest of the the Baltic States now it's a very complex situation right now I don't think anybody wants our troops over there sanctions that we've done that in the Congress I have a bill though that would lift the ban of crude oil and natural gas exports I think this is a very smart move because Russia strangles Ukraine in the Baltic States with their energy so why not create more jobs here in Texas with eagle ford shale and the United States and also export our crude oil and natural gas to that region of the world to help them be more independent from Russia how soon could something like that take place though well I've introduced its been referred to foreign affairs on which I serve as well and so we think that this commitment on a fast track once approved it could happen almost immediately and you're talking about barges set up your ports over there that we would offload our oil and our gas on precisely and I think that's a better demonstration of power than probably perhaps these sanctions I think would have more impact and more effect than what we're currently doing okay now I want to change the subject the FAA has gotten into a little bit of busy with a group called Equusearch because of drones they're saying you can't use them but Equusearch has always use them to find bodies or find missing people what's going to happen with the regulation of drones or should they not be regulated well this year drones is gettin a little controversial as a wait i will tell you the reported drone strike in yemen with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is hugely significant and a positive thing in terms of Homeland Security they AQAP presents the greatest threat externally to the United States and to the homeland so if we can take the threat out there through drone strikes so they can't come in the United States that's a positive thing now when you look at domestically internally in the United States that's where I think against to the FAA start to regulate that more if it's a legitimate law enforcement mission or emergency response mission I think drones have a role there but I think the general population don't want these drones is sort of spying hovering around people's backyards you know out by the swimming pool you know in the summertime and you see these drunk that's I think that's what most people don't want to see real quick regulations a good thing with the drones well I think the FA is looking at certain restrictions in terms of the use of drones and I think we have to always bounce security versus privacy and I think when if it's just an exercise to you know spy and get information I think that that's not a legitimate exercise if it's a true law enforcement emergency response that's that's a completely different issue congressman like i'ma call thank you for joining us today thanks for having me you have a blessed weekend e 22 thanks Melissa you

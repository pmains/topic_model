hello everyone I'm Congressman Paul Gosar representing Arizona's fourth congressional district in the US House of Representatives I regret not being able to be with you in person today but I wanted to extend my sincere congratulations to all the graduates in the 2016 class at Arizona school of dentistry and oral health today more than ever we face a critical moment in the oral health industry and there's no room for sitting on the sidelines that was the challenge presented to me when I made the decision to run for Congress I had never held elected office before and I never imagined that I would ever have an award named after me I am truly humbled by this great honor but that's what makes dentistry great Denys are the kind of people that can get America dreaming again and I'm especially proud to recognize Jordan Janus the inaugural recipient of the dr. Paul Gosar award blank meet Jordan is no Wallflower when I first met Jordan it was clear that this was someone who was enthusiastic and passionate about making a positive difference in dentistry Jordan's remarkable achievements empower an entire industry to take bold action and ultimately provide better care for our patients trust me you don't have to be a congressman to make a difference even though we sure could use some new members like Jordan on Capitol Hill congratulations to you Jordan and to all today's award recipients and this year's graduates thank you and remember advocacy and solutions always start with a smile I hope to see all of your smiles in person real soon

hi I'm state representative Eric Burleson remember that bill that you received in the mail from our county for your personal property taxes County is sitting to a bill asking you for tax money on the vehicles and other personal property that you've already paid taxes on this bill hits the working poor of the hardest in Springfield and in other parts of Missouri owning a vehicle is requirement for living in the state it's a required to get a job to get to and from your place of work or to get to and from the grocery store and that's why it hits the working poor the hardest that's why I have filed House bill 335 this bill will take the personal property taxes and repeal those personal property taxes on your vehicles and other personal property and instead roll those taxes into other tax collecting agencies that we already have for example currently in Green County the average personal property tax is approximately five percent of the assessed valuation if this bill passes and it goes to the voters and the voters decide when they want to repeal the personal property tax and how they're going to repeal it it can be repealed by an increase of approximately one percent in real property taxes or an increase of approximately one percent in sales tax there are several reasons why we're doing this firstly taxing personal property has a negative effect on economic growth and here's why personal property is defined in economics as capital goods or factors of production factors of production are any equipment that businesses or individuals use in order to produce vehicles machinery livestock they help produce and what's dry what drives our economy forward these items produce goods that are not themselves consumed but produce other items that are then because that's why it's never a good idea for government to tax items that produce other goods when you do this you're reducing the growth of your economy so we need to be taxing consumable goods and not so much capital goods or personal property taxes secondly personal property tax collection depends on the honesty of the individuals that are filling out the forms which creates all kinds of room for errors mistakes and even fraud and we need to look no further than christian county where the county assessor recent the former county assessor made quite a few mistakes of her own in filling out her assessment form and i think she's seeing those mistakes today thirdly it's a grossly inefficient collection process in both the assessment and the collection process and if the text the personal property tax were removed then and shift it to sales tax or property taxes taxes that are currently existing as well then we could eliminate an entire tax collection bureaucracy and those savings could then be applied and given to the schools the local schools and the fire districts the very reason why we're tech collecting these taxes to begin with and fourthly it is an unethical tax I believe it is unethical to ask people to pay taxes on something that they've already paid taxes on if you have any questions about this bill house bill 335 or any of the other bills that we're following this year please contact my office my local phone number is for 175 973 635 you can also email me at eric burleson at how smug of i look forward to hearing from you and any of your comments you may have thank you for your time

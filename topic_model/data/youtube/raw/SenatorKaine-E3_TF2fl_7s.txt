mr. president I rise today to honor naval chief petty officer Scott Dayton a Virginian who became America's first combat casualty in Syria Scott is a rout was a resident of Woodbridge Virginia here in Northern Virginia he enlisted in the military in 1993 in the Navy and had a distinguished 23-year career finishing his time one of the most dangerous billets in the military as a bomb disposal expert he was working in Syria pursuant to operation inherent resolve and on Thanksgiving Day was killed 42 year old Virginian based out of Virginia Beach but he was killed working to dispose of bombs about 30 miles from raucous area which is the one of the two main headquarters of Isis Scott Dayton was a decorated sailor in his 23-year military career he won virtually every award there was including a bronze star 19 different awards and commendations and because of the fact that it occurred over a holiday weekend there wasn't a lot of attention to it but it was something that I really wanted to come to the floor today to talk about because he is the first combat death in Syria of an American service member in operation inherent resolve I wish we were paying more attention to this and and that's what I want to devote the rest of my comments to we began the operation inherent resolve which is a war against Isis on August 7 2014 President Obama announced at the time that we were engaging in targeted airstrikes against Isis because of their advanced order bill there's a US consulate in reveal and so that was part of the president's inherent powers to defend the nation to protect a consulate but within a very few weeks we had completely protected American interests and President Obama said now is the time to go on offense against Isis he appeared before Congress before the American public in a televised speech the evening of tember 10 2014 and said we had taken care of the imminent threat to the United States but now we needed to go in an offensive war to quote degrade and ultimately destroy the Islamic state and that description of what the mission is has now been broadened in the words of former Secretary of Defense and current current secretary ash Carter to focus and come on Isis's lasting defeat since the war against Isis began in august of 2014 more than 5,000 members of the US military have served in Operation inherent resolve either in Iraq or Syria and right now just as an example from my home state there is a carrier the USS Eisenhower that's homeported in Norfolk that's in the Gulf right now as part of an operation inherent resolve the US military has launched over twelve thousand six hundred airstrikes we're carrying out Special Forces operations were assisting the Iraqi military Syrians fighting against the Islamic state in Syria as well as the Kurdish Peshmerga in the northern part of Iraq because of the work of American troops and those they're working with we've made major gains against Isis in northern Iraq the territory that they control northern Iraq has dramatically shrunk we've made major gains and shrinking their territory in northern Syria and that is to be credited to brave folks like Chief Petty Officer Scott Dayton but the threat posed by as the Islamic state continues and increasingly as their battle space shrinks in real estate they undertake efforts off that battleground to try to destabilize us around the world and so this fight against ISIL which is key a key may be the key national security priority involving u.s. combat operations in Iraq and Syria will likely continue for the long foreseeable future even after the complete liberation of Mosul and Rocca which I'm confident will occur the worst costs ten billion dollars eight hundred days of operations an average of 12.6 million dollars a day and I began honoring Scott Dayton but Scott Dayton is not the only military members lost his life in this war five have been killed in combat in total in total 28 American service members have lost their lives supporting operation inherent resolve as we speak there more than 300 Special Forces now in Syria fighting in a very complex battlefield where turkish-syrian russian-iranian Lebanese Hezbollah and Kurdish forces are operating in close proximity as evidenced by recent developments and the end of growing humanitarian catastrophe and Aleppo I continue to believe and I will say this in a very personal way as a military dad that the troops that we have deployed overseas deserve to know that Congress is behind this mission as this war is expanded into two plus years I don't know whether that would have been the original expectation but more and more of our troops are risking and losing their lives far from home I am concerned and raised again something I've raised often on this floor that there's a tacit agreement to avoid debating this war in the one place where it ought to be debated in the halls of Congress the president maintains that he can conduct this war without a new authorization from Congress relying upon an authorization that was passed on sep tember 14 2001 when the new Congress is sworn in in early January I think eighty percent of the members of Congress were not here when the sep tember 14th 2001 authorization was passed so the eighty percent of us that were not here in 2001 have never had a meaningful debate or vote upon this war against ISIL I've been very critical of this president I'm a supporter of the president I'm a friend of the President I respect the office of the president but I've been very critical of this president for not vigorously attempting to get an authorization done when the president spoke about the need to go on offense against ISIL in September of 2014 it took him six months from the start of hostilities to even deliver to Congress a proposed authorization I actually think that's the that's the way the system is supposed to work that the president delivers the proposed authorization but i've also been harshly critical of the art a one branch because regardless of whether or not the president promptly delivers an authorization or not it is Congress under article 1 of the Constitution that has the obligation to initiate war and as my president knows who not only as a senator but a historian the founding documents this country are so unusual still today in making the initiation of war a legislative rather than executive function Madison and the other drafters of the Constitution knew that the history of war was a history of making it about the executive the king the monarch the Sultan the Emperor but we decided we would be different and that war would only be initiated by a vote of the people's elected legislative body and at that point would be conducted only by one commander-in-chief not by 435 we've not had the debate we've not had the vote and this has been ironic because I have for four years been in a Congress that's been very quick to criticize the president for using executive action this is an executive action that most clearly is in the legislative wheelhouse and yet it has been an executive action that the body and I'm making this as a bipartisan and bicameral comment the Bardia body has been very willing to allow the President to make I introduced a resolution for the first time to get Congress to debate and do this job in September of 2014 two days after the president spoke to the nation about the need to take military action against ISIL that authorization led to a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing and a vote in December of 2014 to authorize military action against ISIL but that committee resolution never received any debate or vote on the Senate floor in 2015 working together with the Senate colleague from Arizona senator flake I we decided that we really needed a show that our opposition to ISIL and our belief that appropriate military force from the United States should be used against them was bipartisan we introduced a bipartisan authorization of military force on jun 8 2015 in an attempt to move forward with some congressional debate on this most important issue aside from a few informal discussions in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee there's never been a markup there's never been a discussion there's never been a committee vote and no floor floor vote either so two and a half years of war against the Islamic state and 15 years now after the passage of the authorization in September of 2014 we see that that authorization has been stretched way beyond what it was intended to do the the authorization September 14 2001 is a 60 word authorization giving the president the tools to go after the perpetrators of the attacks of 911 ISIL didn't exist on nine eleven 2001 ISIL was formed in 2003 President Obama recently announced that the authorization is now going to be expanded to allow use of military action against all Shabaab the African terrorist group a dangerous terrorist group to be sure but all Shabaab did not begin until 2007 so an original authorization that was very specific by this body to allow action against the perpetrators of the 911 attacks are now is now being used all over the globe against organizations that didn't even exist when the 911 attack occurred just to give you an example the 2001 authorization has been cited by presidents bush and obama in in at least 37 instances to justify sending armed forces to 14 nations and attacking and to to send military force to 14 nations the nations where we have currently justified military action pursuant to the authorization and go after the perpetrators of the 911 attack we've authorized military action in the Bush and Obama administrations in Libya Turkey Georgia Syria Iraq Afghanistan Yemen Eritrea Ethiopia Djibouti Somalia Kenya and the Philippines as well as authorizing military activity in Cuba at Guantanamo to maintain detainees just in the last week the New York Times reported that President Obama is expanding the legal scope of the war against Al Qaeda by easing targeting restrictions against al-shabaab but again this was a group that didn't exist until two 76 years after the 911 attack mr. president I'll just conclude and say having been very vocal about this issue for a number of years it's been disappointing but we're all used to not getting our way at all kinds of things it's been disappointing to me that we haven't been willing to take up this matter I do think a transition to a new administration a transition to a new Congress that's going to be sworn in in early January always gives you the opportunity to review the status of affairs and make a decision about what to do and I believe it is time that we review the progress of the war against non-state terrorist groups al Qaeda Isis al-shabaab Boko Haram on nostra it's time for us to review US military action against non-state terrorist organizations it's time for us to redraft the 2001 authorization that has been stretched far beyond its original intent it is time for us to recognize that this is a continuing threat that's not going away anytime soon but I guess what I'll say most importantly it's time for Congress to reassert its rightful place in this most important set of decisions of all the powers that we would have as Congress I can't think of any that are more important than the power to declare war I view that as the most important the most difficult the most challenging the the the power that we should approach with the most sense of gravity that is the most important thing that we should do it should never be an easy vote it should always be a hard vote but it should be a necessary vote I think the inability or unwillingness of Congress to grapple with this sends a message that's unfortunate it sends a message of lack of resolve to allies might even send a message of lack of resolve to our adversary but the thing I'm most concerned about our people like Chief Petty Officer Scott Dayton people who are serving in a theater of war who are risking their lives in a theater war who are giving their lives in a theater of war and doing it without the knowledge that Congress supports the mission that they are on the the article one article 2 as I conclude allocation of responsibilities is not just about what's constitutional I think it reflects a value and the value is this we shouldn't order people into harm's way to risk their lives unless there's a political consensus that the mission is worth it anybody who volunteers for military service knows it's going to be difficult and will not be able to change that but if we're going to order people into a war zone into combat and order them to risk their lives and even if they're not harmed they may see things happen to colleagues of theirs that could affect them for the rest of their lives and we're going to order them to do that then there should at least be a national political consensus that the mission is worth it and the way the Constitution sets that up is the president makes a proposal but then Congress the people's elected body votes and says yes the mission is worth it and so now that we've had that boat now that we've had that debate and we've educated the public about what's at stake and now we said the mission is worth it it is fair then to ask our two million active-duty Guard and Reserve folks like Chief Petty Officer Scott Dayton folks like my oldest son it is then fair to ask them to go and risk their lives in a mission like this but if we are unwilling to have the debate and have the vote it seems to me to be sort of almost the height of kind of a public immorality to force people to risk and give their lives in support of a mission that we're unwilling to discuss and so mr. president again I offer these words in honor of a brave Virginian who lost his life on Thanksgiving Day November 24th and I hope that this growing number of people who are losing their lives in operation inherent resolve may spur this body to take this responsibility with more gravity and thank you with that I yield the floor

thank you welcome congratulations on both your nominations and let me just say thank you to both of you for taking the time to visit with me and answer my questions I really appreciate that welcome to your family as well miss cran enger' I'm gonna start with you and these are similar to some of the questions that we had together when you were willing to meet with me but let me just start with this I've heard you say time and again today in response to all of my colleagues questioning that your intent is to ensure the bureau is transparent and accountable but my concern is based on the questionings that you and the answers that you've given today we can't even get you to be transparent and accountable about the work you're doing at the OMB the current job that you have that's funded by taxpayer dollars that should be transparent to the public so I have concerns that if you can't even tell us what you're doing on a day to day basis how can we trust that you're gonna carry that over to the CFPB but let me follow up with this Mick Mulvaney said that state regulators and attorneys general should play an active role in enforcing consumer protection laws in the banking industry however as a former attorney general myself I know that AG's can't be the only cop on the beat the CFPB has been vital in uncovering widespread and massive fraud and holding those companies accountable and they are the first stop in the States to protect consumers that is your role as well my understanding from the statutes that I read and what you've said today in your statements and let me give you an example of where the CFPB was instrumental for us the state's Wells Fargo as you well know their actions affected 3.5 million people nationwide including 121,000 in Nevada alone after an investigation by the CFPB Wells Fargo paid a 500 million dollar penalty can you enumerate the powers that the CFPB CFPB has that state AG's or state regulators do not senator and certainly as we discussed in our in your office I appreciate your perspective and experience in this area the partnership with the state regulators is essential I believe to the point that you noted the states have been engaged in the enforcement why do you think engagement sooner I'm sorry why do you believe it's essential certainly because the law actually stipulates that and I think that's important though they existed prior to the bureau and were engaged in this activity prior to the to the bureau's existence and the statute specifically calls out that important coordination role whether it's with enforcement let me just say as somebody that relied on the CFPB because I will tell you in the state of Nevada the regulators weren't there when the crisis crisis occurred nobody stopped it nobody was working to prevent it but when the CFPB was created they wore they watchdog nationally to work with the states in the States AG's and I will tell you the CFPB has a national view of the issues and it is not limited by state preemption laws it is key to what happens across this country when we're looking to consumer financial protection to work with the states let me ask you this without a strong federal regulator how do you anticipate the states will be able to uncover and put together patterns of wrongdoing potential wrongdoing across the country senator I'm committed to carrying out the responsibilities of the bureau under the law which does include working with the states to to look for those kinds of things to work with them closely on enforcement matters and give them that national perspective we talked about the information sharing that is vital between the bureau and the state Attorneys General and the regulators and certainly I am committed to sharing that appropriate information with them to support their efforts and and looking at the right opportunity for the bureau to step in from a national standpoint so outside of serving as a partner for state regulators and Ag rules issued by the CFPB can also be enforced by state AG do you support empowering the AG's by issuing rules through the CFPB I believe it is an essential responsibility of the bureau to engage in the rulemaking activities setting clear rules the example yes collection.i yes senator thank you a matter deeply important to me is that every American has the right to a day in court and that the justice system works for everyone no matter the race their class their creed where you come from or who you know let me ask you this have you ever signed a contract with a financial firm that included a mandatory arbitration clause siddur I believe that I probably have through crevice manager your Laurie did you read the mandatory arbitration clause before you signed it as a lawyer I do try to read those things and I have actually read them in the past were you aware that you were foregoing your right to sue when you sign the contract senator I certainly was aware of what the clauses were that were in the contract I can't assure you that that's what was there but I you believe that ordinary Americans page through and read the fine print of these contracts and know that they are signing away the rights I am guessing that many of them do not and I think that's why the model disclosures responsibilities of the bureau in statute is important and understanding that the bureau has a role for looking at those things do you support the CFPB's mandatory arbitration rule senator Congress certainly acted to through the Congressional review Act to preclude that rule from going forward so from that standpoint it's it's it's addressed in that manner I think do you believe all consumers have a right to their day in court senator I believe through contract relationships and in general there are there are opportunities for consumers to take action including coming to the bureau and and submitting their complaints have you ever investigated a bank or payday lender or credit card company senator I have supported investigations in many of my roles I believe actually in terms of financial crimes that the Secret Service overseas and at Homeland Security Investigations oversees there has been some involvement and with those institutions but personally you've never been involved in the prosecution or investigation not of financial institutions directly known have you ever brought a legal action and as counsel formulated a case against a bank payday lender or credit card company name is chroniger please be brief no senator I have not thank you I see my time is up thank you both for being here I will tell you miss granted you I do as well have concerns about someone with out the experience to lead a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 1,600 employees billion dollars or excuse me millions of dollars and budget that is looking out for the best interests of consumers when it comes to financial projects I have concerns about what I've heard from you today as being the right person with the right experience to lead let me also say miss Reed I look forward to supporting your nomination thank you

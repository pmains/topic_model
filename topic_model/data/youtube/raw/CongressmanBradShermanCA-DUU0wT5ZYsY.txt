thank you eliana we know go to mr. brad Sherman of California Thank You mr. chairman we're considering five excellent bills here today their common sense their bipartisan and that reflects the leadership that the chair and the ranking member have brought to this committee I'll dress three of those bulls first the Taiwan naval support act if I want to thank the chairman for bringing up this bill which we put together with a lot of input from from others and I want to thank the chairman ranking member and mr. Sammon the ranking member of the the chairman of the ranking the chairman of the Asia subcommittee for co-sponsoring the bill when we look at the East and South China Sea we see China becoming more aggressive already we are spending tens or hundreds of billions of dollars on research procurement planning and deployment designed to confront China that in novell invariably creates risks of for the United States and most of that is focused on uninhabited islets in contrast look at Taiwan what is at stake is not uninhabited reefs but the entire country and Taiwan is not asking us for deployment or to spend money they are simply asking for the tools to defend themselves when it comes to these frigates the time the time has come to transfer the friggin frigates um we should be helping Taiwan defend out a technical term mr. Sherman yes it is and it's in the statute with with a page and a half of definition yes um when it comes to helping Taiwan defend itself I think it should be classified as a major non-nato ally and I offered an amendment back 15 years ago to do just that that would if that had passed we wouldn't even need uh I think to pride the administration as we do now in 1979 the Taiwan Relations Act was signed into law and it requires the United States to make available Taiwan such defense articles as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain sufficient defense capacities self-defense capacities in December of 2014 this Congress passed the naval vessel transfer act and authorized the sale of four frigates to Taiwan and the President signed that bill into law Taiwan is indicated it's ready to purchase two frigates out of the four it has the money to do so it faces a budgetary deadline at the end of 2015 and it's time for the administration to move forward with this transfer what this bill does is requires the administration to give Congress a timeline I hope they transfer the frigates before they give us the timeline that would be a very good time line next pleased to join with mr. Poe as the lead democratic sponsor of the combat terrorist use of social media Act three things about the bill the State Department's current strategy for countering Isis and other extremist groups online is obviously not working that's not my opinion that's a state department's internal opinion which concluded in june of this year when it comes to the external message our narrative is being trumped by isis we are losing a popularity contest to people that behead women public information also so the State Department strategy isn't working the think again turn away Twitter campaign has 24 thousand followers in order to reach out to those who might be swayed by Isis you're going to need a much bigger following the disloyal requires a State Department to reassess their approach and come up with a better more effective strategy second I'm hoping that this bill will prod the State Department to hire experts in Islamic theology and in is islamic jurisprudence uh not everybody they hire has to be a graduate of an Ivy League school or a top American school we need just a couple of folks over there graduates of Allah's our University in Egypt I'm not saying the State Department can issue a fatwa but somebody at the State Department should be paid because they're an expert at knowing who should be issuing a fatwa and how to make our arguments consistent with all of the interests intricacies of Islamic law and Islamic jurisprudence finally the social media companies have played a role in this I believe Facebook YouTube and Twitter have a responsibility to make sure that their platforms are not used by terrorists Facebook YouTube and with some prodding from members of this committee Twitter have made changes to take down bad content but that won't work effectively if the State Department isn't identifying the bad content the only thing worse than playing whack Amole is to not whack the moles and every time one of these terrorists sites pops up we should see it before the attended audience and have it taken down before they attended intended audience so um I look forward to the passage of that legislation and to a much better strategy from the State Department finally as far as arming the Kurdish regional government it's about time we wouldn't have to do it if Baghdad had been reasonable but if the Baghdad government had been reasonable we wouldn't even have Isis to begin with I yield back thanking we going out of mr. Dana Rohrabacher of Kel

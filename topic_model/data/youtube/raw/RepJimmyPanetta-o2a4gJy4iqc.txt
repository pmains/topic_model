madam Speaker I rise today in opposition to HR 7 a bill which brings permanency to the Hyde Amendment a bill which attempts to take away a low-income woman's reproductive rights therefore I submit to you that it is a bill more about divisive politics than decent policy this past Saturday I joined hundreds of my constituents on the National Mall we demonstrated our support for reproductive rights and for women's health care across our nation and in my district on the Central Coast of California we have an organization that administers those types of essential services Marmonte Planned Parenthood provides over 60,000 preventive reproductive and wellness health care visits each year and for some that is the only health care they can get our they can afford madam Speaker the Hyde Amendment isn't going anywhere whether we like it or not so I submit to you that it that it is these types of bills that do nothing to bring Congress together and everything to drive us apart because it is bills like HR 7 that can harm the most vulnerable in my community and across our nation that is why I respectfully ask my colleagues to oppose HR 7 thank you I yield back my time

good morning thank you for joining us for today's session from across the third district i want to welcome everyone to uh what is the final session of this virtual ag summit and we really appreciate the opportunity to do this of course i would prefer our interaction to be in person but given covid and certainly the distances involved as well we are able to be able to connect this way you know trade is not only important but i think uh we have so much uh to celebrate in terms of expanded trade different approaches to trade so many things that have already happened and i think uh capacity uh for for more good news on trade it we know that you know we want americans to buy americans but we can sell american too and the fact is we want policies that can help us uh sell our products to other countries we are a powerhou a world powerhouse in terms of agriculture production and it's high quality and to to other countries it's typically very affordable and we want though to be able to sell it and so we want to pursue policies to do so you know not long ago president trump said he wanted to he made good on a campaign promise shocker there that uh that that would happen because it it's so many times it's been said before oh let's renegotiate nafta and so forth and then it has president trump campaigned on it and he made good on that promise to redo nafta in a way that would put us in a better position a lot of naysayers there and quite honestly as a representative of agriculture which had done quite well under nafta i kept a close eye and i was very happy to be able to participate with the negotiations taking place both in montreal and in mexico city and to just interact with stakeholders all along the way a lot of folks said it couldn't be done it got done and i think we are all better for it and it was a true negotiation and and probably uh the result being the most bipartisan vote on a trade agreement certainly that that i've ever seen and i i think it could have happened a few months sooner perhaps but all right we got it done and it is now in place and i think we have more more opportunity moving forward starting on the trade agreement with kenya and the uk so so many things happening but i know uh there's someone with us today who can explain things a lot better than i can because this is wheel house he is the chief ag negotiator uh for our country uh the united states trade representative greg dowd he has worked in the ustr office now well this time i'll let him tell us but he hails from north central kansas we try not to hold it against him that he's a k-state grad but hopefully he's he's been off campus now long enough that uh it it won't spread too badly but anyway we're grateful though to have a greg ambassador greg doubt with us who has been serving in various capacities uh but he knows what's happening as a producer himself and so ambassador doubt i'll let you take over now i would encourage folks to if you have a question just to let us know in the chat in the chat line there with the zoom application so if you have questions and we'll get to those after ambassador dowd's comments so ambassador please go ahead well thank you congressman and good morning first of all i always tell folks from nebraska that i grew up 60 miles straight south of hastings just across the border into kansas and i had three television stations as a kid four out of carney five out of hastings and 11 out of lincoln so i either would have learned to love the huskers or i would have lived a very miserable childhood so that's all we had on tv was go big red and the black shirts and all that 24 7. but and i do say that uh root for the huskers 51 weeks out of the year well now you know more often than that um loved loved your days in the big eight and and uh you guys want to come down and play us again in football i think everybody would love that we'd love to see you k-state and nebraska play again in football those were those are some of the great times and at least when i was growing up and uh we we finally started to be able to give you a ball game here and and hopefully we could do that again these days so uh good to see you congressman i want to talk about ag trade a minute and kind of give everybody an update as the lead-in indicated we've been busy in fact if you look at canada mexico japan and china those are our top four markets for u.s ag exports in fact and we've renegotiated our deals with all four of these countries since i've been in this office two and a half years i'm completely unprecedented in history these four countries amount to about 47 of our total ag exports so the way i discard describe it in kansas farm boy terms we've overhauled our trading relationship with our top four markets 47 since i've been of our total trade since i've been in this job i want to spend a little time today talking to you about china and helping you wrap your head around what we've done with china and and to give you some perspective on this and to start with i want to i'm going to give you some numbers we have our trade data through the first six months of the year you hear every day about the phase one deal with china and whether we're doing good doing poorly how are we doing i want to give you some perspective and context so you can measure that um our overall ag exports right now are down three percent through the first six months and uh the uh easy reason for that is covet it is kicking our butts and and a lot of parts of the world in fact one of the most devastating numbers for me is our beef exports to mexico are down something like 57 we are way down in mexico the mexican economy is really really soft their gdp is is really struggled here this year and so that's a real struggle for us so overall we're down three percent interestingly enough though we are up 11 to china and our trade to china is doing very well in fact if you look at the last five weeks 40 on average the last five weeks 48 of our ag sales total lag sales to the world 48 of those are going to china that is extraordinary because if you look at what we did in 2017 the baseline year of our phase one agreement that number was actually only 18 so that that gives you a feeling for how strong the phase one commitment has been for us in china given the softness and the rest of the world and i want to give you some context here on on phase one in china uh in when we were starting all this trade discussion with china in 2018 total ag imports that china was importing from the world in agricultural products was 124 billion dollars last year it was 133 billion dollars this year we think it'll be around 141 billion dollars china's total ag imports from the world why is that 141 number interesting congressman is because 141 billion is exactly the same number as u.s total ag exports to the world so china right now is importing from the world 141 billion in ag our total exports to the world 141 billion so in the context of this phase one discussion what we're talking about is in 2017 the baseline we sent 24 billion in ag to china we're talking about this year being able to sell 36 and a half billion and next year over 40 billion so we're in the context of the growth that i've described taking our trade from 24 to 36 to 40 that's not a stretch that's not a stretch at all and and here's why if you look at the phase one agreement and everything that's in in that the uh the biggest piece of the phase one agreement is actually agriculture and in fact there are some 57 specific structural changes that are in the chapter 3 the ag chapter of the china phase 1 agreement we negotiated the dickens out of those the the vice minister of agriculture in china he and i we had 33 negotiating sessions to do to come to this agreement 33 sessions the shortest of bit would have been four hours actually in the room i'm in right now i have a little ptsd when i look up at this screen congressman i got to tell you 33 of these the shortest four hours the longest one would have been all day in beijing or here in washington 10 to 12-hour day we spent hundreds of hours discussing and arguing and going back and forth over every sentence in this deal 57 things to fix here's the key point as of today we have implemented have fixed have corrected up and running about 50 of those we have made enormous changes in our trading relationship with china in agriculture as a result of the phase one agreement on beef we've ended the traceability the age requirements we're still working on their octopus we got the hormone thing fixed we've sent now over oh we're right about 150 million dollars i think on the books and and beef to china far more than we've ever done before we've already through six months sold more power to china than we ever have in any year in history we finally got the poultry market reopened after being closed for five years uh our dairy we we haggled over dairy for hours our dairy exports through the first six months are up 23 into china are and so we we are really really doing well the the final point i would make is is that on china is um when before we started this discussion we had about 1500 facilities in the u.s pet food uh hay facilities uh meat facilities you name it we had about 1 500 eligible to export to china a lot of how they restricted our ability to export them is they wouldn't update their list we would send them new companies and new lists and new products to allow into china they would never do it for years they would never do it congressman today we've taken that 1 500 over 3 500 facilities now eligible to export to china across the board one of the most amazing stories that i can tell here is is that in mid-may uh we had a big thing on on nectarines and blueberries and alfalfa hay cubes and timothy hay and all kinds of stuff from the pacific northwest that we had to get into china for the first time and in order for them to do that they had to come over here and do an audit well it was may and covet and there was no way they were coming over here that was just not a possibility so and and the aphis guys the usda folks at all the ams fsis they've all worked like crazy on this for the last six months to implement this and they said we have an idea tell you what china we'll videotape how we would do the audit we will send you the videotape let you look at it if you have follow-up questions or whatever we'll see if we can do it this way lo and behold we sent them that video back in may they opened up everything said looks good to us we're ready to go i have to tell you never in my 28 years in this town would you have ever seen that out of china before this phase one discussion we have very much changed the relationship here and in fact this is the key thing i want to emphasize to you i know you see all this stuff in the media in this building we are talking to our chinese counterparts if not every day several times a week the dialogue and the report is very good that doesn't mean that we don't have still things that we're working on and fixing and talking about that aren't difficult there are but there is a great rapport there there is a great ability to talk through things now and work things out that we've never had before with china and and i want everybody to know that we're we're uh we're doing well and and i think uh we can continue to work on that particularly in the agricultural space in fact this morning uh i don't know if you've seen this or not everybody we sold china another four hundred thousand tons of corn this morning uh six seven hundred thousand tons of soybeans this morning again uh that was a nice that was actually twice the amount of corn that i thought based on my conversations with the trade that we thought it was two or three votes this week it was six so um we're and in fact um i think with these sales today the new marketing year begins september one for soybeans i think it is accurate to say we were really close within an eyelash before today i think it is close to say when we turn the page to september 1 we will have a record number of soybeans sales on the books to ship to both china and to the world so and and that's already the case i think on corn we have a huge book on corn a huge book on soybeans now uh we are going to be really busy loading boats come harvest time and and that's a really good thing so let's let's wrap up and talk about a few other things one of the most unsung trade deals in history is what we did uh a year ago with japan uh and that the credit goes to the president to an ambassador lighthizer to figure out how to do a trade deal with japan uh no offense congressman that got us to our tpp we got 90 of what we had in tpp and we did it without congress and that went into effect january 1 and that was absolutely critical critical for our weak guys our pork guys and especially our beef guys because what you were seeing is the tariffs were really beginning to separate and we were getting left behind on january 1 everything snapped back and we're even with everybody else and we're actually doing really really well our our trade with japan is down just slightly uh most of that was meat related to what was going on with kobet a little bit here earlier this year back in in april and i think we're uh we've got all the wheels back on the wagon on the mean side of the equation we're doing really really well um we're uh usmca is entered into forest here uh we have a few challenges with canada on on dairy that we know about that we're going to be working on here we have some concerns with mexico with regard to what they're doing on biotechnology and glyphosate we're keeping a close eye on that uh the the next step here we we're very busy right now working on the uk and uh that i want to give you some context in that discussion um the uk is about our 15th 16th biggest market right now i think if we get that right we can make them a top 10 market my sense with the uk is they are not the eu they do not subscribe to all of the crazy environmental and anti-gmo things that they do in france and germany in the uk i think they very much uh want to get with the program in terms of 21st century agriculture and the use of technology and agriculture i'm optimistic that as we engage with them and we move forward we're going to be able to extract the uk out of the eu and and really demonstrate to everybody over in europe that uh you know the us and us agriculture isn't scary uh we're we're very very uh safe our products are safe i think we have a great potential there on the meat side of the equation if we can get some things sorted out here they're they actually the tariffs into the uk are quite high uh for uh some of our best products where the opportunity is they're in the 20 25 range if we can get those tariffs to zero and that's exactly what we're going to do with the free trade agreement that's what we do with all of them uh we will have an ability you know they import the uk imports two and a half billion dollars worth of pork a billion dollars for the poultry and a billion dollars worth of beef from the european union four and a half billion dollars in meat so if we could get ourselves on a level playing field competitive into that market with the eu we're gonna get we're gonna get our share that it'll take some time to build that up uh but uh that's a good opportunity for us and i'm glad you mentioned kenya uh that's our first foray it's kind of a pilot project now into africa and uh the kenyans are very very excited about this this is gonna you know this is going to take a little time to build the capacity to get them where they need to be but a great opportunity to to show kenya and to show africa uh how to evolve in terms of the use of biotechnology and all the technology that we use in agriculture here and and help them build a trading system to adapt to that and uh so with that uh i think that's a good quick overview for you congressman and we'll open it up for questions okay thank you ambassador i really appreciate that that the specific numbers there and obviously there's there's a lot to be excited about even amidst some of the challenges that we are facing um i would encourage folks to just type their question into the chat line there and we will uh katie from my office she handles trade issues also on the line is eric camler from my grand island office as well as jenna haney who is my district director so they very diligently make sure that i'm getting all the information from the various places as possible and moving forward ambassador i um let me leave this off a little bit you know i think where the president and your team has been especially effective is realizing that other countries want more access to our markets and they haven't always opened up their own markets when we opened up ours therefore giving us this opportunity to really expand at this point and and i i also like to make the point that you know other countries especially china i mean they need us you know there there's a narrative you know given our factory that that we we've benefited somewhat from leaning on china but i would argue that china needs us far more than we need them and i i i just wonder if if you could point to anything else obviously that the amount of sales to china these days i mean that that's uh that's some underreported news there and i certainly appreciate you for thanking i want to thank you for sharing that i appreciate that and the the fact that we are seeing more ag products uh going to china you said we're up 11 to china yes okay anything else you could point to that that you know supports the narrative that you know china they they need us they need us to buy products and they need us in in various ways anything that you would add to that you know it is so true i know there's a lot of tension in a lot of geopolitical areas between the us and china and frankly a lot of that's warranted however in agriculture in our discussions back and forth hundreds of hours my counterpart was very frank with me greg we want your agricultural products we need your agricultural products and i could i could spend hours talking about the context of our discussions and i want to tell one story in particular is is you know we have the new product in the us the extended shelf life milk called fair life you've all seen it at the 7-eleven you can buy fair life milk and china had no ability they had no regulatory ability to import that product and we were trying to explain to them this is what it is this is what we want to do and finally under secretary mckinney got so frustrated one day here in washington over the lunch hour he walked down the street to the 7-eleven bought an arm load of fair life and handed it out to the entire chinese delegation said here this is it this is what we want to sell you and they were all like you know this is pretty good this would sell really well in china we're like we know we can't get it into the country you don't have a regulation that accounts for this and they were like oh and so and and when you see some of this stuff in phase one and you see these these bullets and this template you say well what is this this was the outline for them in china to write the new regulation to allow these products into the country for the first time and we got it done and we can do this now and that's why we're seeing our trade increase and it and it so much of these conversations were just you know we we faced this in india today we faced this in brazil today we faced this in china today is politically they get it bureaucratically the bureaucrats they they're they just kind of like well we don't know so we're no the answer is no we don't want to do it and so you have to get this kind of cut top down push to say no we're going to fix this and do this because it's in the best interest of the country that's what we accomplished in our discussions with china i would argue for the first time in my career and lifetime is really cutting through the bureaucracy to get things implemented and get things changed and get things done so another example i would use right now in fact this is a conversation going on as we speak and you know about in the media's is the discussion with brazil and ethanol and and it's the same kind of conversation brazil has access to the u.s market for ethanol at a 1.9 percent tariff we have access into brazil but they're wanting to jack up the tariff on us to 20 and the president has said i've said to them no you it's gotta if we're gonna trade which the tariff has got to be the same going both directions this is the kinds of things that ustr we're fighting and dealing with every single day all over the world know um i was i was talking to a leader from kenya a while back and i brought up the gmo issue they they currently subscribe to the eu's approach to gmos and it was this is anecdotal so please understand but i kind of got the message from him that they didn't have a good enough reason to maintain those restrictions and i i guess i would see this as an opportunity to to convince them to go by the science rather than the politics and in so doing help feed their people uh more affordably and how how much of an opportunity do you think it is with kenya to you know uh subscribe to the science of more than the politics and open up to gmos well it's it's absolutely critical in kenya because that sends the message to all of all of africa that this technology is safe and we are the same thing as with the uk as you peel that the uk out of the eu get you know the uh prime minister johnson has said in a speech and he said he he had one line there in their one of his first speeches as prime minister he said and we have to get with the program with regard to the use of biotechnology and agriculture um you know the european i've given a lot of speeches in europe we've talked to a lot of people in europe my message to the europeans is very simple when it comes to u.s agriculture we are not going back to using a stick in flint rock versus matches we are not going backwards we are not apologizing for the what how we use technology in agriculture ever and i've said that to the chinese as well and and and my counterpart in china said greg i understand technology and biotechnology we want to use it but greenpeace and other folks have really scared our consumers and and you've got to help us help explain to our consumers how this works he's i understand that and we do have to do that and that's part of the discussion as you say with kenya is helping the general populace understand and help with the political leaders uh not get the push back from the population no this is completely safe this is how we're going to do this this is the science behind this it's a process and it and it takes a lot of discussion and it can't be just government to government it has to be you know an all-encompassing thing to get consumers comfortable with it as well yeah all right katie i'll throw it over to you looks like we've got a question a few questions waiting go ahead great um all right so first question and ambassador dowd you did just touch upon this but is there any news on the brazilian tariffs and ethanol and making the playing field more even for our ethanol industry the answer is that is the topic du jour around here and uh that uh that will come together here hopefully within the next couple of weeks i don't have it's what we're working on right now is all i can say thank you next question um this is from inside us trade can you give us a sense of when we might see usmca consultations begin with mexico over biotech products uscr lighthizer in june told the ways and means committee i think the only way we're going to get that to change is first by consultations and then via an action referring to mexican treatment of biotech i don't uh we don't typically give out timelines around here on when we're doing things like we'll say that uh certainly uh the uh the dairy situation with canada and the biotech situation with mexico are definitely on the radar screen around here thank you um next question from lisa what is china doing to become less dependent on u.s agricultural exports or do you see them to continue to depend on the us and south america especially for soybeans great question and and the answer is really interesting um and so let's let's back up and talk about hogs in china for a minute half the hogs on the planet are in china and they've had a very serious disease there for the last two or three years called african swine fever by some measures china may have lost 40 percent of their hogs due to this virus to give you some context if they lost what was the number something like 13 of their hogs that's all of the pork traded in the world thirty percent of their hogs are twenty to five thirty would be the same as all the hogs in the u.s so they've lost an enormous amount of pork um they uh are uh have imported a lot of meat they're they imported eight billion dollars worth of beef last year we've already sold them more pork this year than we did all anytime in history but if you talk to them they are emphatic that they're going to rebuild their pork herds in more of a western style confinement operation half the hogs in china were swill fed meaning they were fed food scraps waste not corn and soybean meal i think one of the biggest changes in a long time in global agricultural trade has been china's decision to ban the swill feeding of hogs so they are planning on moving this more into much more the u.s style corn and soybean meal type feeding operations so if you think about the number of hogs we're talking about here that means that china's demand for corn and soybeans is going to increase in a big way and in fact you've already seen in just the last couple of months here china's imports of corn from the united states uh that in in the la in july and august china has purchased the third and fourth single day biggest purchases of corn from the united states in history uh we saw 405 000 tons of corn sold to china this morning uh that is china beginning that process of making that change and i think going forward i wouldn't be surprised that if we we probably won't sell as much meat to china going forward even though we're going to sell a lot uh but we are going to sell them a lot of corn and especially soybeans the china keep in mind when i was in this business in 2002 i remember a big conversation uh with folks in the industry oh my goodness china's going to go from 9 to 18 million tons of soybean imports 2002 and the big discussion was well is that a trend or just a one-off what's going to happen here uh katie what are what does usda currently have forecasts for china's imports of soybeans from the world for this coming year starting september 1. so in 2002 it was 9 to 18 million tons what's their number right now starting september 1. can you tell me i have an idea that you would be able to tell me are you ready for this 99 million metric tons that's a lot of soybeans and and in fact we're going to sell china at least a third of that we think and um it's gonna and brazil is gonna sell them and argentina is gonna sell them a bunch of that they're going to need a lot of soybeans and we're gonna be competitive with that and they know that and uh that's that's a relationship that we we've already built and hopefully will be ready for us for the long term here great thank you next question from brett hansen through the national lumber and building material dealers association we pushed hard for the usmca and thank you for that now we are seeing all-time building material pricing can you enlighten us on what the outlook for mills in canada cooperating with the us to help our industry with pricing and shortages that's a fair question i'm sure but i don't do lumber [Laughter] i know that's an agricultural product but our industrial folks deal with that one so that's not one i really have my head wrapped around i apologize all right next question and this is more of a procedural question um how would a change in presidents affect current negotiations that's a great question and um the the question that has been posed to me on many occasions is uh what would a change in administration do with the china phase one agreement and the answer is the agreement says uh either party can walk away from this with 60 days notice and uh i i think it would be very important to ask the other side what they plan to do here i've seen where they've indicated that they don't want to keep it which would be i think not a good idea frankly for us in agriculture i think it'd be a bad thing but i'm not going to get into all that i'm going to ask everybody to ask that question because i think it's an important question because what we have here is really really valuable for us agriculture is something that for folks in this town that have worked on china stuff for my 28 years here it's something we've always wanted we've been able to deliver on this and we have 50 of these 57 things done we have an agreement on facilitating trade here in in terms of actual dollar amounts nobody ever possibly dreamed we could do something like this with china we're doing it and we need to keep doing it yeah let me just add to that a little bit and i i guess i i might be a little freer to speak on this than than the ambassador is you know the usmca just as one example i mean ambassador dalton but usmca is a far more bipartisan result a delivered result by far more bipartisan than anything we saw uh before that and and i i served with the bush administration i served with the obama administration and to see what took place with usmca now i'll be honest with you there were a couple components to us mca that gave me a little bit of heartburn but they weren't deal-breaking and the fact is um that approach that the president promised from the beginning that approach brought a more bipartisan result and i and i almost think that the system is still kind of shocked uh from there's no question about it so you know i i mean a one of the talking points that that some folks like to use who don't like the president is well you know tpp well as the ambassador said we have basically almost all of tpp now anyway yes um the fact of the matter is correct hillary clinton campaigned against tpp and and uh so the president carrying through with what his campaign dialogue was i don't think anyone was surprised they shouldn't have been if anything they were surprised if he was actually making good on it compared to what other candidates have done in the past and and so that that bipartisan result with usmca i think is one of the more effective precursors to launching us into further negotiations with other countries yes the president prefers a trade agreement with one country at a time i i appreciate that uh that that's his prerogative and you know what we can make that work um yes i like tpp as well but president and others were concerned about that and one he won the election and and we can make it work and the president has made it work and and i think it's very important to note that the president's uh opponent had his chance uh previously and and i think squandered that but i i don't want to get any further no congressman you are exactly right and and i have reminded folks of that for years tpp didn't have the votes it would have never passed congress never and and i had conversations with the head of uh congressional affairs in the obama administration at the time saying you've got to make some changes here to get this thing through congress or it's never going to happen and he agreed so that that's you you're exactly right about this but to your point i will say this all around the world now this is when you go to talk to folks on capitol hill either side of the aisle usmca is the blueprint it is the template for us and trade going forward and so when you talk to the uk or you talk to ken you say here's the blueprint we can you know customize this a little bit for you around the edges but this is it we're not really going to deviate from this and so if you're uncomfortable with this then we're not probably your folks because this this is what both sides of the aisle in congress congress the administration everybody's agrees we work through this with our two biggest trading partners here this is what we're going to do and i will tell you congressman most countries are like you know what we're fine with this we'll we'll you know we got a few things around the edges to work on but the uk i think is good with this kenya there there we've had several other countries saying we would love to do this so your your point is exactly right and and the guy that drove this home was the president no question about it when i first came in this job and i had this conversation this is what we're gonna do this is gonna be a big part bipartisan vote people laughed at me friends of mine said there's no way greg every trade vote in history has been one vote sliver either way you're wrong and ambassador lighthizer and the president changed the whole dynamic on this topic i think forever in this town right all right next question it's a follow-up um regarding mexico and biotech products does the us have a hook for launching consultations with mexico over biotech products the usmca ag chapter says the section does not require a party to mandate an authorization for a product of agricultural biotechnology to be on the market um that sounds like a uh uh some sort of media question that's very specific i'm that's from inside us trade yes i figured all right well these guys uh they're very persistent about you know talking about all these things i will tell you this in usmca we have specific language with regard to the dealing and use of biotechnology and it's very clear what mexico's requirements and commitments are and if they don't you know meet they haven't approved a biotech train since uh the current president has been in office even though even on things like cotton which they've been using in mexico for 25 years without any problems so uh you know we have a couple of ministers down there in that cabinet that are uh very one-sided and anti-technology use in agriculture down there uh we uh we have our eyes on this and uh if this uh gets to a situation where it's gonna impede trade uh we'll be on top of it great all right back to china um thank you ambassador dowd for your remarks from what you're saying it sounds like agriculture is a bright spot in the otherwise troubled u.s china relationship i.e through the ongoing dialogue you said is occurring almost daily between ustr and chinese counterparts how does this dynamic help in the management of the complicated overall relationship and why aren't we hearing more about it i think that is the question of the day whoever wrote that question i want to congratulate you i think that is that is spot on the money uh in in my conversations with my counterpart he and i worked very very hard to make agriculture a pillar of our relationship between the us and china he and i talked about it all the time food is important you know food is different people have to have food and and you have to have food in order to to keep from having you know unrest in countries when you when you had the problems in the middle east it started about food um china is very sensitive to that and they know we have the safest most abundant best food supply in the world here in the united states they know that and they want to learn from us and they want to work with us to to get better in that area and i will tell you i i cannot emphasize enough how hard we both worked and when we when i say we i'm talking about when we would sit down together the vice minister would have 30 or 40 people behind him i would have 20 or 30 of our best people behind me and we spent hours and hours and hours working through how to get two diabolically different economic systems to come together where we could trade together in food and agriculture and i have to tell you i think we were historically successful in doing that oh great that is a great note to end on that is all the questions that we have um for today so congressman i go back to you well thank you thank you katie and certainly again i want to encourage folks with trade questions at my office katie is is the one handling trade issues these days it's great to have her on the team her first week was uh in the middle of march when when there was the exit out of washington at least me and my family wow so anyway it's uh it is uh we're great grateful to have katie on the team certainly eric in the district handling agriculture issues uh ambassador doubt dowd number one i want to thank you again for your participation here today um i think sharing some underreported news and uh of course agriculture in general we probably don't celebrate the advancements in many of the victories that we do see along the way certainly there are struggles and we are mindful of that uh but we should celebrate our victories more than we probably do and to to see that china trade with china ag trade exports with with china are up 11 and i think that's largely due to the negotiations that that took place uh under your leadership and that's lighthizer but i'm so excited to moving forward to continue working on trade and i joined the ways and means committee because of trade and knowing that for agriculture being the world's powerhouse in terms of ag production we need to sell more of our products around the world and when we can see developments positive developments like this um i i get pretty excited so uh and and the fact of the matter is even with developments like this there's room for more yeah that's right we want to do that at every opportunity uh we possibly can but uh as we have been discussing the fact that we have more bipartisan interaction on trade these days is is important to note you know president obama actually relied very happily on republicans to get his trade agenda passed uh president bush relied on republicans and a handful of democrats very small and for democrats to get his agenda pushed through this is a new day right now with trade and in the bipartisanship and in the interest and and the desire to get more out of our trade agreements and and i really salute that effort i i think you know amidst all the skepticism that previously existed it's been exciting to watch the uh shall we say new subscribers to the new ways of doing things on on trade and ambassador dowd you've been right in the middle of all of that and i certainly appreciate your service your background is impressive and the experience you bring to your current office and and i just think that it's exciting to move forward in in this direction knowing that there i think there are more victories to be had the world is watching the world watched as usmca was being drafted and negotiated and so many folks here even at home said it can't be done but it got done it received a an immensely bipartisan support in in both the house the senate and uh let's move forward let's look for the next trade agreement as well so thank you to everyone for taking the time to uh to participate here today we appreciate your questions and look forward to uh opportunities i i went to see and after being nebraska a couple weeks and then we trapped a lot and knowing that nebraska especially the third district of being an agricultural powerhouse we'll be glad to see you at here in nebraska so thank you again to everyone thank you katie eric ambassador and we'll hope to see you soon in person take care see you in a couple weeks

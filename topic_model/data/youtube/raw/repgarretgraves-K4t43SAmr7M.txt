this is your local election headquarters welcome back to this week in louisiana politics we are joined by u.s congressman garrett graves he is a republican from louisiana thanks for coming on the show congressman you bet thanks for having us back well we have lots to talk about we have several issues we want to cover but first up i want to get your response to president biden canceling the offshore oil and gas leases in the gulf of mexico is this a bad time fred it's just inexplicable i mean we're we're experiencing right now the highest gasoline prices in american history and rather than coming in and actually trying to solve the problem trying to actually help out the american economy decrease inflation make the ability to refuel your car affordable they're doubling and tripling down on the very policies that have caused these record prices not only are they cancelling some of these lease sales but they're also increasing by 50 percent the amount of money that uh you have to pay to the government for energy production in the united states out of whack which with what you're seeing in other countries all these moves are doing is further helping out people like vladimir putin china iran venezuela saudi arabia it is baffling to me that you have people that can look at what is going on right now with united states energy policy and think that these types of decisions make sense so uh with this move do you predict that it will have a direct result and we will see gas prices go up oh i think you're going to continue to see gas prices rise during the summer particularly diesel all right let's move on to the ukraine on tuesday the u.s house passed a 40 billion aid package for ukraine this is to help ukraine fight russia you voted no on this why fred i i've been to ukraine i've been to poland i've spoken to ukrainian refugees what is happening in ukraine is absolutely awful this is it is unacceptable to have uh just a thug like vladimir putin uh going in and invading these sovereign countries uh like he's doing and and and the ukrainian military deserves our support to ukrainian people deserve our support here's the problem we have already provided tens of billions of dollars in assistance to ukraine in the form of military aid humanitarian aid other assistance in terms of positioning for exam for example the 82nd airborne right there at the border in poland all kinds of assistance we're offering last week they said it was going to be 30 billion we come in town on tuesday and pelosi within hours of arriving introduces a bill that is 40 billion dollars it doesn't have sufficient detail all it talks about is how we're going to shovel billions and billions of dollars out the door and and here's the thing this is this is money for housing money for food uh medical assistance all sorts of things that people right at home in louisiana need as well as a result of hurricane item we were able to get an initial tranche of funds one month after hurricane i did provide assistance we knew it wasn't going to be enough but it was a down payment it was to try to get things started but but that was back in september it is now may and we have been trying and trying to try to get additional funds so we did two things number one we offered an amendment in terms of ukraine and said look you've left 10 billion dollars in united states military equipment tanks helicopters all sorts of arms and munitions in afghanistan that the taliban as out there uh right now pilfering we need to go collect that those american assets those american military assets and advanced technologies give those to ukraine don't give them to the taliban give them to the ukraine military secondly we offered a second amendment that would put three billion dollars redirect three billion dollars in uh international disaster assistance direct a portion of that uh to hurricane ida and other disaster victims right home in the united states we've got to make sure we're taking care of our own people first i think the lack of accountability the lack of transparency on the ukrainian dollars combined with the fact that they rejected our amendments sending the u.s military equipment in afghanistan over to ukraine and rejected our amendments on hurricane ida and other disaster aid that's why we voted no it was the right vote not not at all opposed to helping ukrainian military or people but but not at the not not while uh just completely ignoring the needs of our own citizens they rejected your amendments you also mentioned that they kind of sprung it on you they did the bill was introduced within hours of arrival back into washington on tuesday again it was it was 10 billion dollars more than we had discussed just the previous week there was no indication as to why no clear justification uh the bill all it does is for example says we're going to provide 4.3 billion dollars in international disaster aid without any type of of real explanation i got an 8 billion dollar program i mean just 4 billion program all of these dollars just these top-line numbers without any type of detail of what the funds are going to be used for what the accountability mechanism is ensuring that this equipment and dollars get to the true people in need and and how in the world they landed at around 40 billion dollars a round figure is really just i i think it's very concerning and i can't say it enough i am i am very supportive of providing help to the ukrainian military in concert with other countries and the ukrainian people but not this type of irresponsible spending that is going to contribute to the already explosive inflation numbers that we've seen in the united states all right and you said it inflation let's talk about inflation we just got some new numbers out this week any relief in sight no and and it's similar to energy fred there's there's no there's no plan there's no strategy coming out of the white house right now which is which is really unfortunate i have never in my lifetime seen uh just as a white house uh cabinet officials that appear so wholly unprepared for the jobs that they're in uh this is just it is amazing to me we've got worker shortage issues you've got millions of americans that still haven't returned to work the workforce participation rates well below where it needs to be in excess of 4 million workers haven't returned to the workforce 11 million jobs open available right now the supply chain problem there is nothing going on out of this administration trying to address some supply chain issues if we haven't learned anything from this putin invasion of ukraine we've got to have a secure supply chain we've got to produce more things domestically we cannot rely upon china and some of these other countries that are always going to do things in their own self-interest this is these are huge mistakes and unfortunately we're seeing president biden just double and triple down on these bad policies that we should have reversed uh long ago and and so i i think one of the major contributing factors to inflation is what's going on in energy look it doesn't matter if you're a retiree if you're a high school or driving yourself to school it doesn't matter if you're ordering things off of a mail order or or through the internet every single one of those if you're if you're getting on an airplane if you're getting on a train all of these things are affected by the higher energy prices and this is one of those things that really just reverberates through the economy no matter what sector you're in we've got to get energy prices under control and by continuing to stop shut down prevent domestic oil and gas production and shutting down mines and other things that are producing minerals for for renewable energy production that this administration's energy policy is no to everything and and the prices you're seeing today is exactly what happens when you carry out these large strategies and of course the major influence on why we're seeing record inflation so president biden has said he's getting lots of criticism from you republicans but he says you guys haven't come to the table with any solutions you disagree with that which is unbelievable i've introduced bills we've introduced packages of bills i'd invite the president to visit our website where we've got all of the legislation that we've introduced we've we've asked him i mean going back to january of last year when he started signing executive orders banning new energy production we started sending him letters started introducing legislation that lay out exactly what needs to happen to address these things i'd invite the president to visit our website we've got it all laid out and he can just simply follow that blueprint and it'll help return america to prosperity all right congressman garrett graves we're gonna have to leave it there thank you so much for joining us appreciate it you better stay with us we'll be right back

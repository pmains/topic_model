address X Leslie good evening the president certainly laying out his priorities for the upcoming legislative season and also bragging on many of his accomplishments we've been able to get reaction from lawmakers here over the past half-hour to the speech but I'd like to bring in right now the majority leader the House of Representatives Maryland congressman and I have to mention fellow Terrapin Steny Hoyer with us sir the president says the State of the Union is better than it's ever been to you sir the State of the Union is well that's not true we haven't he has a trillion dollar operating deficit under Bill Clinton the economy was growing up the stock market was going up and we balanced the budget three years in a row so that it's hard to say that it's better than it's ever been unemployment is down that's a good thing the economy however if you look at the a chart starting to grow up in 2010 under Obama kept going up kept going up and frankly has stayed on the same line that in in terms of increasing the Wellness of our economy as Obama set the table for and so that we on our side of the aisle he gives Obama no credit whatsoever from being bringing the economy back to health and growing a robust economy and in fact when he talks about the GDP the GDP is about what it was give or take a tenth of a point when Barack Obama was president United States so he way over stage the fact checkers are going to have a very busy night I want to talk about the president's and legislative priorities is there anything that you and the caucus can wrap your arms around that you've heard from him tonight he wasn't specific that there are two things certainly which we want to work with the President on work with the Senate on and that's infrastructure and prescription drugs and very frankly protecting pre-existing conditions we tried to cooperate with the President on infrastructure he walked out of the room we have a bill that we've sent to the Senate that carries out almost all of the front of the principles he articulated for prescription drug reform he opposed it he says he wants to save pre-existing conditions we have a bill over in the Senate that does exactly that and he has a court case trying to set aside the Affordable Care Act which protects pre-existing conditions so it's yes there are some things we at least notionally agree on but there hasn't been much follow-through on what he promised the American people well it'd be much harder given that we're in an election year I mean with a season of bipartisan support Wayne as we get deeper into the year well I'm not sure we're in the season of bipartisan support but what I believe is we have a duty to the American people we who are Democrats and in the majority in the house we represent the president has a duty to the American people and so in that sense whatever our differences are if we can work together on prescription drugs prices coming down if we can work together on investing in infrastructure if we can work together ensuring people have health care and are not a precluded from getting insurance by pre-existing condition yes in that context we have a responsibility to work together and I hope we we can do that but we'll see last question for you congressman DC statehood will the House vote on DC statehood this year yes we're going to bring that up in the near term before the before the summer DC statehood bill will be for very frankly the failure to give US citizens who live in the District of Columbia precluded from voting we're the only capital in the free world that doesn't allow its citizens to have a voting member of the Parliament or in this case the Congress in the world appreciate your time you've been through that interest thank you so much

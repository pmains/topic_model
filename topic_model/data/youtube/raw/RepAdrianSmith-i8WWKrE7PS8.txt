the gentleman from Nebraska is recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. mr. speaker under federal reclamation law irrigation districts which receive water from from a Bureau of Reclamation facility typically repay their portion of the capital costs of water projects under long-term contracts under its current contract and current law Northport irrigation district is exempt from annual capital repayment if their carriage fee exceeds 8 thousand dollars per year given the carriage fee has greatly exceeded this amount every year since the 1950s North ports capital repayment debt has been stagnant at over nine hundred twenty three thousand dollars since 1952 so long as the dead indoors landowners are subject to burdensome reporting requirements and Acree acreage limitations and no revenue is generated for the federal government I introduced this bill to provide members of the North Port irrigation district early repayment authority under their dated reclamation contract allowing producers within the north part irrigation district to pay off their portion of the contract means the government will receive funds otherwise uncollected and landowners will be relieved of costly constraints which threaten family-owned operations for example at a previous Water & Power subcommittee hearing a member of the North Port District testified acreage limitations will prohibit parents who own land in the district from passing down or selling farmland to sons or daughters who also own land in the same district similar legislation as previously passed under bipartisan majorities and according to past CBO projections could generate as much as four hundred forty thousand dollars in federal revenue this is a very simple bill which would make a big difference to some family farmers in Nebraska thank you I yield back

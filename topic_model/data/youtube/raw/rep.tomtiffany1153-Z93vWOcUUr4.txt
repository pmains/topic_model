register your answer to a poll question by also using your telephone keypad so here is our first poll question of this call president biden has been in office just over a year are you better or worse off now than you were a year ago press one if you're better off press two if you're worse off or press three if you're about the same so again this is a poll question we're looking for your input on question is president biden has been in office just over a year are you better or worse off now than you were a year ago press one if you're better off press two if you feel you're worse off press three if you feel you're about the same so i see a number of people are lodging in their votes thank you very much for participating in our first poll and now let's go ahead as the congressman asked and get to our first caller we've got wendy on the line right now wendy welcome to the call you're live with congressman tiffany hello congressman thank you so much for conducting the town hall this morning good morning wendy um go ahead and share your question sure um i did log it in with the receptionist that took it and i just wanted to know in light of all of the studies that are coming out about mask mandates the effectiveness and even the vaccinations and their harm done what measures are you doing to fight against all the draconian enacted laws and mandates that are suppressing our economy altering and lowering our children's health i'd like to know yeah there's so there's been a lot of really interesting information that has been coming out really throughout the last two years but especially in the last couple weeks and it really appears that um there's much more information coming out that questions the validity of some of the health measures that have been taken and i would take for example mass mandates you're seeing many communities that are now lifting these mass mandates and it's really happening just this week i mean in the first couple days it's very interesting you're seeing states that have had really draconian lockdowns like new jersey new york and others um they are backing off from them now and saying hey we are going to we're going to lift those mandates and it has been very disappointing at the federal level that we've seen both the department of defense as well as the cdc and the fda have these vaccine mandates we have seen servicemen and women who have proudly faithfully served their country and they've been drummed out of the military as a result of that we've seen the vaccine mandates and how it's affected employment in many of our health care facilities coming down via the federal government threatening to withhold compensation for medicare and medicaid unless you to hospitals and health care facilities unless you force your employees to get the vaccine and one example that i would mention that really sticks in my mind male clinic they released 700 employees from their from employment as a result of not getting the vaccine and it is really having a harmful impact in being able to care and treat for people and one of the greatest concerns i have in the long run is that people have delayed health care screenings as well as surgeries and things like that as a result of not being able to get into their health care provider and some of that is being driven by these mandates and it's time to stop the mandates and lockdowns and let people be able to lead their lives as they chose to and i would cite one example that was really clarifying for me it was a little over a year ago if you remember we had a big spike in the number of uh coronavirus cases in the fall of 2020 and i think it was like november when it peaked and it was interesting when you looked at the data for the upper midwest states as well as north dakota south dakota and iowa regardless of what measures each state was taking they had the same spike it was the same shape they had the same they had very similar increases in the number of people that had the coronavirus and you had states like south dakota that had very little requirements that were in place and then right next door he had minnesota that had significant requirements in place it didn't make any difference what what protective measures they put in place this basically the same percentage of people got the coronavirus which tells you that the virus is going to virus and we're two years into this it's time to end the mandates and lockdowns let people lead their lives as they choose to this has gone on long enough i'm going to close with this wendy you know it's your choice whether you choose to vaccinate whether you choose to wear a mask i think it should be everybody's choice but a place where i draw the line is with children what we have done to children in schools is just simply flat out wrong we have seen kids lose two years of learning we are seeing significant harm being done as a result of kids having to wear masks in school so much of communication especially those little ones is when they see someone's face they see those expressions that is part of how you communicate in this world and in regards to schools we should have never had the mask mandates there should not be a vaccine mandate on these children let them lead their lives as they choose to what we choose to do as adults that's our choice but let's stop the mandates lockdown shutdowns especially in regards to our schools we are doing more harm than good and i believe studies are starting to show exactly that is happening anyhow let's take our next question absolutely congressman next on the line we've got teresa from woodline teresa you're live with congressman tom tiffany go ahead with your question please well this isn't theresa she had to step away this is her husband tim but i could ask for her congressman uh the question i have is your stance on what's going on in ukraine we're sending troops into the nearby area we're doing all sorts of things to try to protect their sovereignty and yet nothing's being done to protect our own sovereignty here in america with our own borders we've got the problem with the drugs coming through the border we've got you know violent criminals uh human traffickers you name it and yet we're willing to put up and protect the sovereignty across the ocean but not here at home so i want to know what your stance is on that jim by the way um where are you from uh we're actually from i'm from lublin actually oh lublin okay hey great to have you um uh great to have you with us today thanks for the question so anyhow yesterday i believe in president biden's press conference i didn't see all of it i just saw some excerpts he said that there we should withdraw the permits or or the agreement to allow the nordstream pipeline to be built that it should be stopped if there's an invasion of the ukraine i agree with president biden in regards to that but it is way too late what he's doing um so when you look at let's just cover it from the foreign policy angle um the when the president allowed the north stream pipeline when he gave it the green light about a year ago that sent a clear message to vladimir putin that you can kind of do whatever you want to then when you add in afghanistan and the disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan and it has been nothing but a disaster in fact the biden administration is now saying we they're proposing to send like 300 million dollars to afghanistan because the country really has fallen apart now and those signals were very clear to people like president xi and china putin and russia kim jong-un in north korea that america is weak there's no other way to put it it has shown our weakness and vladimir putin is responding to that and that's why he's sitting there on the border of the ukraine threatening to go in there tim's statement that let's take care of our borders before the ukraine's border is something that i hear regularly from constituents they're deeply concerned about our united states government becoming the greatest the biggest human trafficking organization in the world where we're basically borderless on our southern border and i understand that and i agree with that i believe that's our number one concern in america at this point but the other thing that happened on january 20th when president biden came into office if you remember the very first thing he did is he shut down the keystone pipeline in other words he said we're going to become more dependent on others for our oil we're going to shut that pipeline down and then he said russians go ahead and build the north stream pipeline what shows greater weakness than saying to americans that we're going to give away our energy independence that we achieved over the last 10 years and you europeans you're now going to be dependent on the russians it has been weakness that is being taken advantage of here and america needs to reverse that and it starts by us going back to being energy independent in america that shows strength in america so there's a lot more i could say about it tim but um i hope that kind of covers some of what you were asking and we'd be happy to take the next question dirt absolutely congressman i will get to the next question in just a moment but i do before we get too far along i want to get back to the results for the first poll question we asked that everyone keyed in their answer using their telephone keypad and that question was basically are you better or worse off uh after a year or so of the biden presidency and the results for that poll we found 17 percent of respondents felt better off 71 percent felt they were worse off 12 percent felt they're about the same so thank you everyone who participated in our first poll question i'd like to take a moment and ask our second poll question again use your telephone to key in your response please and that question is do you pay more for common household expenses like gas groceries and utilities today than you did a year ago press 1 for yes press 2 for no press three if you feel you pay about the same so again our poll question we're looking for your input on do you pay more for common household expenses like gas groceries and utilities today than you did a year ago press one for yes press two for no and press three for about the same and i see votes are being tabulated thank you very much for submitting your votes and if you have a question you'd like to ask live on this call it's very simple to enter the question queue all you need to do is press star 3 on your telephone keypad again if you have a question you'd like to ask the congressman now is the time to press star 3 to ask your question live on this call if you'd like to join the congressman's e-newsletter please press star six and back to the phones we go our next question comes from kelly hello kelly you're live on the line go ahead with your question please hi miss congressman um my main question was kind of two parts was the canadian truckers up in canada um i personally very much support them uh supported financially i actually just googled how far away otto was from where i live and uh i was maybe going to be making a 17-hour drive at some point and go out there and support if i can but i was wondering what your opinions are i've been hearing whisperings that there may be an american one of those heading to dc at some point i was kind of wondering if you kind of support the truckers up in canada and also if you would support a an american trucker convoy here in the states thanks for the question uh kelly first of all hey i really appreciate people responding to the polls though i know they're not scientific um it is really good to get people's in input and um i really like the interactivity with a call like this in doing those polls and um so kelly i would just say so yes i mean if you heard my answer earlier in regards to vaccine and mass mandates lockdown stuff like that i do not support them and um that's exactly what the canadian truckers are protesting about is they've said we're tired of these draconian lockdowns and i would just say a couple things i thought it was really disappointing that prime minister trudeau would leave the country when something like that happens you know maybe initially you go to some place that's secure after all you are the head of state in canada but these people are not harming anybody they just want to send a clear message and they know there's no other way that they can do it and they also send a clear message because these are the people that move the goods around our countries these are the people that deliver what we need every day they are an integral lick uh link in what we are how we function as a society the supply chain we've been hearing about all the supply chain problems and when you put a mandate in place like prime minister trudeau has that a trucker has to be vaccinated um then you're going to cause some of them to say you know i choose not to be vaccinated and some of them choose because their doctor has said hey you've got a bit of a heart issue whatever you know maybe you shouldn't take it you're taking people out of that critical supply chain and we're finding out how important they are with the empty shelves that we see in so many stores these days so i do support the canadian truckers now if people choose to put together one in america also um you know we have the right to assemble and share free speech in this country and uh just make sure that you assemble peacefully and do it in a manner that's respectful and there is nothing wrong with that one other thing that i would mention regards the canadian truckers it is really disappointing that the site the gofundme site went and shut off those truckers from being able to get voluntary contributions from lots of people including it sounds like from kelly why should they shut that off but even worse than that they confiscated their money and they said we're going to give it to other organizations and that is simply wrong that is theft now i will give gofundme credit they said after uh running into a firestorm of criticism they said well we will refund the money to everyone and at least they're doing that but it's really disappointing they have chosen sides in regards to this it's very evident where they stand politically with gofundme and um you know people can make a choice from there whether they want to use them in the future because it's clear they're not a neutral company when it comes to participating in politics which is really disappointing anyhow with that be happy uh to take our next question by the way sign up for the tiffany telegram every week we put lots of good stuff in there what's going on in washington d.c and what is uh happening in the district all you got to do is hit star six and you can subscribe to it we try to make it substantive every week so you're getting the lowdown of what's happening out here in washington dc go ahead dirk i'm ready for the next question absolutely sir next up we've got karen joining us live on the line karen welcome to the call you're live with congressman tiffany good morning congressman um i actually door knocked with you and spooner a few years back and you've called me personally um i'm a little disappointed that i'm not hearing your voice out loud um what are you actually doing if this is general but um i'm really impressed with people like senator bolbert i don't know if she sent it to her congressman and people like her kelly lake that's running in arizona they're actually speaking out in and they say they're going to do something and when i've spoken to you before you said you were gonna fight for us and i i don't hear any answers right now from you i am i'm hearing you uh kind of agreeing with the questions but not telling us what you're doing about the different things i know you're freshmen but that you you still can speak and make your voice heard so i know that's general but i think you get what i mean yeah so stay with us here karen um i really appreciate the comments that you shared i have introduced bills in regards to everything that we have just talked about in regards to our borders i have made four trips to the southern border in the less than two years that i've been down there i went to panama i went to the jungle the darian gap to see that there are people coming from all over the world and i um illegally getting in the pipeline in panama and then coming to the united states i have highlighted that i have proposed i have made proposals to end that i was there at fort mccoy when the afghan evacuees came in and actually was on tucker carlson's show and highlighted for the american public that these people were not vetted not a single one of them went through the vetting process so i have highlighted those things and have introduced legislation now i'm in the minority and speaker pelosi is not taking any of the bills that i have proposed as you can imagine but i have been taking action in regards to those in regards to those issues i sit on natural resources i have highlighted time after time how much harm this is being done by shutting down keystone xl and by the way people talking like governor whitmer of michigan talking about shutting down line five by not the pipeline that runs through the mackinac straits and the harm that would do to northern wisconsin i have talked about that i have highlighted it and i've introduced legislation on many of these issues and uh if you have something more specific karen i'd be happy to answer it do you have a follow-up i wish i could think faster okay the pipeline i don't get fox news anymore um is there some other way you can make your voice heard maybe going on rumble or liberty daily or some of those other news outlets that actually tell the conservative side of things so that people know what you're doing i will i will do your is it star six yes okay i will do star six is that email form yeah that'll come every friday into your inbox karen and you get a really good idea of what we've been up to bills we've introduced places that i've testified you'll see my floor statements we put links in there of me speaking on the floor on a variety of issues and i think if you saw that you would see that i've been pretty darn active and i would add one other thing you know in regards to the school mandates i have attended numerous school board meetings throughout the district talking about how the school boards that these are just recommendations coming from the federal government the cdc does not have the ability to mandate on schools that they do vaccine mandates or that they do mask mandates that is only recommendations i have been taking that information to school boards and sharing it with them and saying you don't have to take this as a mandate because i think some schools assume that it was when they simply hear it from the federal government so i really tried to be active in those ways so anyhow those are a few examples that's great um i heard a tip when i was listening to a conservative radio host and he said to stop calling the shot the vaccine because it really isn't a vaccine it's a shot and that might stop some people from assuming it's a vaccine so um well i appreciate you bringing up that issue um the um it is it is correct that many people refer to it as the shot or the jab and they do not accept it as a vaccine because it's different than a tree what we traditionally think of a vaccine so i think karen like in regards to a tetanus shot that's good for 10 years right right and so that's what people think of as a vaccine or they think about mumps measles rubella shots i know i had them as a kid um me and my wife had our children take them we believe that those are important but they give um many of those give lifetime protection that's what we think of as a vaccine and people are much more skeptical of these because the efficacy starts to wear off um quite soon in as little as four months right um and the the actual trial for a vaccine to be actually called a vaccine is five years and so this what one of my colleagues yeah we yeah we got to move on to the next question but karen you're bringing up a really good point one of my colleagues thomas massey from kentucky he has highlighted how the cdc has changed the definition of a vaccine three times now over the last about five or six years and i think it's important for people to take a look at that because it is a much different definition now compared to five or six years ago and and it's important those words that they're using because they definitely have changed the definition of a vaccine okay karen i'd like to thank i'm sorry sir i'd like to move on and borrow the audience for just one quick second congressman to repeat the results from our uh second poll question and then also get on to a third poll question so we asked the the question about your common household expenses uh do you feel that uh you're paying more or less or about the same 93 percent of the response was they feel they're paying more two percent feel they're not and five percent feel they're paying about the same so thank you very much for everyone that participated in our second poll question and now let's move on to our next poll question and this we're looking for your input via your telephone keypad the question is do you think our border is more or less secure than it was one year ago you feel it's more secure please press one less secure please press two about the same please press three again the poll question we're looking for your input on do you think our border is more or less secure than it was one year ago more secure please press one less secure please press two about the same please press three and i see the numbers are being tabulated thank you very much for your input moving on to our next caller now let's go to uh to joel joel you're live on the call go ahead with your question please yeah tom this is john from tech i've just moved up recently purchased a business but one thing that bothers me is how social media is treating people like joe rogan when they have an opinion that is different from what they have they can literally destroy their reputation destroy them shut down a platform so their opinion can't even be given and uh i just feel that it won't be very long and they'll be doing that with everyone that it if you don't agree with their opinion you're not going to have an opinion you're not you're not going to be heard or you'll be destroyed basically is what's going on it happened with president trump when the president was not even allowed to have the same platform as anyone else i just feel that's wrong i just kind of want your opinion on that and what we can do about it yeah thanks so much for the question joel this is one of the biggest issues that we're dealing with at this point because it truly is censorship so i sit on the judiciary committee and this is where big tech is regulated this is where we hear the big tech issues and uh there are a few bills that are wending their way through the judiciary committee and we're having i think one good thing about this at this point is that there is bipartisan support for doing something about the big tech companies because they're clearly too powerful and that is shared by both democrats and republicans the question is what's the best way to go about doing that and you know some people are advocating for changing section 230 the liability protections for these social media platforms uh when they're denying people their free speech rights i would certainly support something that if if we could reform section 230 to guarantee people their free speech rights i think the tech companies should do that even without the changes to section 230 but that's the requirement i think also we need to look at the anti-trust laws that were enacted through the 20th century and see if they're applicable in these cases because it's very clear they have become so enormous so big that in many cases there's no option but to use them and so i'm certainly open to some solutions in that regard but i can tell you i'm disappointed in the leadership of the the majority party in judiciary that they haven't been more aggressive in going after this censorship and i think they should be bringing people before the committee that that can address that if we get the majority back i think it's one of the first things that we should do is that um we should um have these hearings to decide uh what changes can be made it was also very disappointing months ago when the press secretary for president biden said that we are working closely with the tech companies to stop um to stop speech that they said was not was inaccurate and in many cases that was in the eye of the beholder whether it was inaccurate or not and it's disappointing that we have an administration that is sending a signal to the big tech companies you can suppress speech that should never happen we are a country which values getting that word out there including people that put inaccurate comments out there the way you stop inaccurate speech is to have more speech that does show out the fallacy of something that has been put out there and i think about somebody like senator johnson who has been attacked relentlessly and all he has said is that hey let's get the information out there and let's let the public decide what is accurate and what is inaccurate and that's what i believe should happen is that let's get all the information out there let the american public let the american public sort through all that and they'll figure it out over time this suppressing of speech is wrong and i alluded to it earlier i mean we saw it basically with gofundme that was suppressing speech they tried to stop the money from being able to go to these canadian truckers who are um having this peaceful protest and they're trying to take that money away from them it is another example of censorship and it is one of the greatest concerns i have for the future of our country because with censorship we will not have free speech and we must protect that first amendment to the constitution thanks for the question joel so quickly looking at my control console for this call it's great to see so many people have joined us for this live telephone town hall with congressman tom tiffany if you have a question you would like to ask live on this call all you need to do is press star 3 on your telephone keypad to enter the question queue again to ask a question please press star 3. if you'd like to join the congressman's weekly e-newsletter please press star 6 again star six and you can provide your email to receive the congressman's e-newsletter now excuse me um um hey dirk yes sir i want to complete one other thought in regards to our last question before we take our next question here what is really interesting when you juxtapose denying people their ability to share speech like the canadian truckers like others who have been de-platformed like joe rogan and others yet some of those same social media outfits they allow the leaders in iran a totalitarian state they allow the leaders of china to be able to use their platforms but they won't allow americans to share their speech it's clear that they're making political decisions and that's not how it should work in america whether you come from the right left center wherever you come from in the political spectrum you should be able to share the information that you have now you should do it respectfully all those things like that but people should not be de-platformed simply because they're sharing speech that others don't agree with thank you sir moving on we've got jan joining us on the line jan welcome to the call go ahead with your question please good morning congressman tiffany this is jan from spooner wisconsin um i just i'm retired um i've been a conservative all my life just because i was raised i mean i wouldn't even have to you could be a conservative democrat but i am a republican my concern is i mean i was a business owner i was always i was a teacher too my concern is the unemployment why people aren't getting back to work in northwestern wisconsin this is deeply concerning for me because there are so many jobs open but yet we don't have people working and i realize some of them are trade jobs and we're doing more in the schools to try to teach some of the kids earlier in life on how to do some of these and help with that but i just don't want us to go back to the welfare state where we finally went from welfare to work and yet uh you know other people say well it's demeaning if you ask a medicaid person to do a drug test or [Music] ask them to work 20 hours a week just a value but we always valued work we were raised that way that we worked from the day we could mow along or babysit or do something like that but it i just think that we really have to to do that is to get more people working and i don't know what the solution is and what your ideas are on it for our country up here yeah i'd be happy to share a few thoughts that i have jan you get what you incentivize and what did we do two years ago when um we had the draconian lockdowns and shutdowns that happened and basically our country was shut down for a couple months and of course people had to be paid through that period of time and that was appropriate but what's happening now is those programs have not been reeled back in when it's time to move past the lockdowns and shutdowns so when you incentivize people to stay on unemployment to stay on the various uh transfer payments from the federal government that's exactly what's going to happen when you've incentivized people not to work and it's very clear it was about a year ago i think that it was identified that there's about five million people that left the workforce and and i i think that's still the case there are five million people that simply left the workforce dropped out and they have disappeared because you can see it in some of the unemployment statistics where we were up around i think uh don't quote me on this but i think we were up like 63 64 workforce participation i think we're down now to like 61 62 percent that's a whole lot of people in america that are not participating in the workforce anymore and so what do we need to do we need we need to make sure those people that can be gainfully employed if you have the ability to work you need to work it's only fair because otherwise you're asking your fellow citizens to pay for those transfer payments that you um that you're getting even though you should be gainfully employed so we need to just put the incentives in the opposite direction and incentivize people to work and it will happen we've seen it a few times in history very successfully we think about the reagan revolution in the 1980s so many people went to work after that's what was incentivized and think about it what was a bipartisan agreement between newt gingrich and bill clinton welfare reform in the mid 90s governor tommy thompson was right in the middle of that he put together the the uh pilot projects in two counties in wisconsin that showed how successful it could be to incentivize people to work and that's part of what led to the boom in the nineties is making that happen so we need to incentivize um work and i would just say this in closing on this issue you know a lot of people say well you know you're just saying this for employers you know that you're just looking out for them that is not the case at all while that's a good thing having employers with people being able to work we see restaurants closing down for more days than they did in the past shortening hours we're seeing businesses across the spectrum having to shorten hours fewer people that are there to work but the greatest value to this is people's self-worth because when people are paid when they have not worked for that paycheck it does affect their self-worth and there are times that we should help people up we should give people a hand up but it shouldn't be forever and we harm people's self-worth when we say we're just going to let you sit home and not work even though you are capable of working for year upon year we need to incentivize work primarily that people feel greater self-worth they feel a a real part of the community that they live in thanks for the question jan all right moving on now our next caller is peter in medford peter welcome to the line you're live with congressman tiffany thank you thank you congressman for putting on these town halls i have a question uh why is the federal government continuing to tax senior citizens on their social security benefits the threshold for social security uh provisional income tax was first established in 1994 and those thresholds had not been raised in 20 well 26 years so why are we continuing to pay uh a provisional tax on a on a threshold that was established 26 years ago when inflation is far you know it was uh well look at inflation so they just gave us a raise for social security and what we're going to find out when we do our taxes next year that that that raise is probably going to be eaten up on that social security provisional income tax so why does the federal government continue to tax social security when the state of wisconsin doesn't and the state of wisconsin does just fine without taxing seniors on their social security benefits hey peter um so what is the threshold do you know offhand what that is off the top of my head i think it's about there's there's two thresholds there's 85 percent and i believe that kicks in at about thousand dollars they'll take eighty five so tax eighty five percent of forty two thousand and the fifty percent one is i believe thirty two five okay and that was established that was established in 1994. now look at inflation if you if you take those two figures and figure out for inflation that should be well in the 70s and 80 thousand dollars before those those things are even considered for tax so peter when you say that at a minimum it should be indexed at a minimum it should be indexed and it's not every year more and more seniors are getting bumped into this this provisional income tax and more are going to be done this year because we had a 5.9 percent increase yeah yeah yeah well hey i really appreciate this peter um i have not taken a position on not taxing social security but i'm happy to take a look at it at a minimum as we just talked about here it should be indexed but isn't this a classic case of what inflation is doing so the federal government is saying hey we're going to get you what'd you say 5.9 increase this year and the federal government's saying um touting that but it's all going to get eaten up some of it's going to get eaten up by increased taxes because social security is not indexed but also all the other inflation that is going on whether it's gasoline prices food prices you name it whatever it is inflation is going to eat up that increase and that's why um i advocate for one of the main reasons that i ran for office way back in 2010 for the state legislature if all of you remember we had a three billion dollar deficit in the state of wisconsin and i told people back in 2010 if you elect me we're going to fix that deficit now we're not going to do it the first budget or two but if we stick with it we'll get it done by the time i left the legislature nearly 10 years later and i had helped write the last three budgets sitting on the joint finance committee we had gotten our budget to surplus because we made the tough decisions and then we made good decisions to make sure that the budget stayed in the black and we didn't have to do things like this like the federal government is doing now where they're spending so much money it's driving up inflation and by the way the federal reserve has some to do with this too in that they just keep the printing press running devaluing our dollar and it is one of the things that we need to get control of that's inflation and it starts by having a fiscally responsible federal government and that's one of the that's one of it has always been one of my top priorities thanks for the call peter real quickly i'd like to report on the third poll question we asked we do have the results that are in and the question was do you think our border is more or less secure than it was one year ago and everyone that uh submitted a vote uh on this call we've got the results four percent uh fields more secure on the border 88 percent feels less secure eight percent feel it's about the same so again thank you very much for participating in our poll questions today and it's another quick reminder if you'd like to join the congressman's e-newsletter it's very easy to do press star six right now on your telephone keypad to get your email name on the list to receive a weekly email from the congressman star six to get the congressman's e-newsletter hey dirk can i interrupt a second most definitely sir hey thank you dirk so um one of the things that i'm so glad that we had this question in regards to immigration and i think one of the important things to talk about with immigration is what are the solutions you know so as i have spoken here today and karen highlighted that one of our earlier callers okay so what can we do about it so let's talk about immigration what we can do we can end catch and release that's what president biden started on january twentieth of twenty twenty one you just catch em the border patrol and they release them into our country over two million people restore remain in mexico in other words you have to stay in mexico to get your asylum hearing and when that was being done in the previous administration 90 of the people claiming asylum they were not legitimate asylum claims therefore they could not come they could not come in and that is what kept people from wanting to come to america by instituting catch and release by stopping remain in mexico it was a clear signal to people all over the world and we're hearing that from the border patrol that there are people just coming in by the droves and why do they do that they tell us very plainly when you talk to them down on the border these migrants they say because president biden said the border is open and the third thing that i would mention we have to cut the funding to a un operated organization called the international organization for migration they take that money they give people remittances they give them help in being able to um migrate up the pipeline from panama to the united states that organization needs to have their american dollars taken away from them and not being used to be able to move people into our country illegally there are some real simple actions that we can take that would reduce this this migration flood this illegal migration flood that's going on um by probably 75 80 percent dirk i'm happy to take the next question very good sir we can get to the next caller's question but looking at the clock looks like we have time for just one more question and uh that question comes from mike mike's joining us on the line live welcome to the call sir thank you for your patience what's on your mind hello mike hi there i was uh calling tom tiffany uh on uh i was wondering if his leadership as quarterback helped him uh with his position today i'm his old running back one of them awesome um how are you doing tom i'm good you've got a dick lately you guys used to make me look good anyway this is a real good format um you know i know that you and i don't look at things politically the same but i think the format is superior and uh good luck in your future and hey i used to live up in the area that's been aqua in that area for a while eagle river so hey if you have any questions mike including don't hesitate you know something that you may think we disagree on go ahead and ask a question well honestly from the gut um i'm a little concerned of the next election and i was wondering if there's somebody out there that uh i'm not a of course i'm not a donald trump fan and i know you've been backing very strongly and uh i'm not real pleased with mr biden either and i'm wondering if you see someone out there that has uh conservative ideals that or you know wisconsin is a conservative state of course with you know prox buyer and and nelson in the past is there someone out there that we should be looking at that you know that may be interested in the the big office sure sure well there's all kinds of people that are always considering something like this and you know i think on our side of the aisle you know you've had people making noises like nikki haley mike pompeo and certainly governor desantis down in florida so there's been lots of people that have been considering that but i would go back to um our previous president and our current president our current president said he was going to um he was going to govern as a centrist and i think mike even though we disagree somewhat i think you would probably agree also that he has been anything but a centrist when you look at crime the way it is the border issue the inflation and trying to spend more money that's going to only exacerbate that inflation and our foreign policy really is in tatters at this point especially after what happened in afghanistan and i just think that there's a a much better way to go about it and president biden said he was going to be a centrist and he wasn't and i get the thing with the personality of president trump the reason i supported president trump is because of his policies and i think it's important for me as a legislator or a congressman that i always look at issues not the personality behind the issue but the policy that they're proposing and when you look at what president trump did in his four years we had peace in the middle east we had arab countries that were signing peace agreements with israel he had um walked tall with a big stick kind of like teddy roosevelt used to urge for a foreign policy and that kept people like the taliban and putin and others from doing the things that they've done here in 2021 with putin right at the border of the ukraine now the taliban basically having taken over afghanistan that didn't happen with president trump and then also look at president trump's trade policies he said we're going to do america first and when i look at farmers small manufacturers and others in my district they were really benefiting from those trade policies that were america first he sent a clear message to china you're not going to run over us anymore and then you look at the border there is no greater juxtaposition between two presidents president trump made it clear i'm going to do everything i can to protect the american people and we see the results now of the open borders since january 20th of 2021 fentanyl coming in at incredible amounts and we're seeing kids the number one killer of people 18 to 45 in america right now is fentanyl even greater than uh car crashes and other ways in which people can die and that's because of our open borders the fentanyl is just flowing in and then you see the devaluation of people's work as a result of bringing in people who many will work for cheap labor that isn't benefiting americans so i supported president trump because of his policies and his policies that were working for america and a year later these things aren't working what has happened over the last year including the things that were put in place on january twentieth of 2021 shutting down the keystone uh pipeline making us energy dependent on other countries opening up the pipeline of illegal immigration and i think there's a much better way to go about it and i'm going to be advocating for those things that will be that will stop crime in america that are going to control our southern border that are going to make us energy independent once again and to try to get a hold of this incredible debt that we're leaving on our children so anyhow with that mike hey it was great to hear

[Music] as we look toward the holidays I wanted to take this moment to say once again thank you for the opportunity of serving you while we work throughout the year to wrestle with the issues facing our nation and to support the recovery growth and prosperity throughout our part of Texas there's no better time than Christmas for us all to take a moment and to remember what's really important in life and to be thankful that we live in such a blessed nation scripture tells us for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government will be upon his shoulders his name will be called wonderful counselor mighty God Eternal Father and Prince of Peace and so as we work towards peace in our world I pray that you would know peace in every way in your family in your work in the community that we're building together and most importantly within your own heart may the spirit of Christmas be yours this season and all the best in the new year as we continue to work together toward a more perfect union god bless you and your family and Merry Christmas

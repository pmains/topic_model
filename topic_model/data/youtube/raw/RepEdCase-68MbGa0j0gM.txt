good morning and aloha to everybody uh listening in uh thank you so much for joining us uh this morning uh i am congressman ed case i represent hawaii's first congressional district which is the city of honolulu from makapuu all the way through downtown out to mililani mililani malka to wahiawa and back down through waipahu ewa beach kapolei congressman kai kahele is my colleague in hawaii's second congressional district uh but for all intents and purposes we both represent the entire state and try to help you with each and all of your issues in washington dc um today we want to talk with you about how we provide uh economic growth and opportunities especially for some of our communities uh who don't always have ready access to the to the technical knowledge and working capital and expertise and financial assistance that other communities do uh and so these will be some of our communities that can most use economic development and that is the by the way before i go any further i forgot i need to give you all the disclaimer that we are recording um this session just for for our own purposes so that we can use it in other ways um so you should know that it's being recorded um our federal government tries uh many ways to assist uh disadvantaged communities to provide economic opportunity but one of our critical ways to do that is through our community development financial institutions fund or our cdfi fund for short the cdfi fund is charged with generating economic growth and opportunity for our communities in need and they do that by offering tailored and innovative programs and invest federal dollars and expertise alongside private sector capital so this is a public-private partnership and assist financial institutions that specialize in community development to provide that expertise with federal support this is a key area from my perspective for many many of our communities throughout our country and our hawaii and and i serve on the house u.s house appropriations committee which is responsible for all uh federal discretionary funding about 1.5 trillion dollars per year and i have particularly tried to focus on uh sustaining and expanding the cdfi fund in its programming because i believe in their mission and i believe that they do incredible work and needed work throughout our country but in the um same breath i will also say that i think that here in hawaii although we have institutions and communities uh very much relying upon and doing good work with the cdfi fund the fund itself and what it does is not widely known and so my goal uh in this presentation today is to get a much broader level of knowledge information and participation on the cdfi fund so that we can take full advantage of that um here in hawaii it's been particularly critical that we do that during uh covet 19 because of course uh here in hawaii we had one of the most economically distressed results from from kovid 19 in the entire country we are still recovering from from that and federal institutions that have helped us to recover have been really critical the cdfi fund has been one of those in the consolidated appropriations act that we passed in 2021 we provided about 1.25 billion dollars to the cdfi fund and uh saw somewhere in the range of 10 11 million of that come to hawaii we have uh now in hawaii um 11 cdfis so these are organizations that are qualified to be cdfi institutions uh they know how to do it they know how to work with you and i would like to expand that universe of organizations uh many of them will be familiar to you and i'm just going to read who they are some of them perhaps you didn't realize they were cdfi's uh but the goal here is number one get more cdfis and number two get more people working with our cdfis so here they are the council for native hawaiian advancement specializing in our native hawaiian community the hawaii central federal credit union the hawaii community lending company the hawaii community and reinvestment corporation the hawaii federal credit union hawaii first federal credit union hawaii habitat for humanity association focusing especially on on on on our homeless population hhoc mortgage kauai government employees federal credit union molokai community federal credit union we have specialized programs in the cdfi fund focused on our indigenous communities throughout our country are and these are called native serving cdfis native hawaiians of course are the indigenous peoples of our country um and are fully uh participating in native serving uh cdfis um and so uh several of these institutions are focused on our native uh hawaiian community and we definitely want to assist from that perspective with that sorry i'm at home and i just uh i got to do one quick thing here good morning hey yeah you are my uh my wife will come right out in a second okay thanks a lot the beauties of doing work from home a little home improvement um i'm really really happy to introduce to you all today jody harris uh who is the director of the us department of treasury cdfi fund so she runs the cdfi fund throughout the entire country and we were talking some time ago about trying to get her out to hawaii to present to to you all and of course kovit19 has made that unfeasible for now but she joins us from uh from washington dc or right right outside washington dc uh director harris has been in it has been in the uh private sector and in the government sector for i think 30 30 plus years as i recall 25 years in the private sector in terms of credit uh focusing on communities uh in need um she's been part of treasury and cdfi since 2007 and has has risen through the ranks to run the fund um she's originally from philadelphia uh undergrad at university of maryland uh mba and mpa from nyu new york university and so i'm really happy to turn this over to her i'm going to listen in for a little while but i'm going to have to go deal with some home improvement uh i also want to and she's going to run the show from now so she'll give you a presentation there'll be plenty of time for questions and the one person i do want to introduce to you is mitch heidenreich who is my legislative assistant in washington dc he specializes in small businesses and cdfi in particular he organized this and he is the fastest way into my office with any questions whatsoever that you have um please contact mitch you put his contact information in the chat also before i leave you my website case.house.gov case.house.gov is the easiest way into my office we look forward to helping out with cdfis and anything else that you need and so with that uh director harris i am again very very grateful for you to take the time that's been with us out in here in hawaii i'm sorry it's a virtual i think you were telling me that the temperature right now is 24 degrees and unfortunately we are a little higher than that right here but um over to you director and thank you so much great thank you so much representative case i actually just checked the weather it went up to 36. so there's some progress there but many thanks for inviting me virtually today for the opportunity to discuss the cdf5 fund and the impact that the cdfi fund has had in the state of hawaii i'm going to share my screen make sure i do this right here hopefully everyone can see that please let me know in the chat if you cannot so just a little background on the cdf5 fund the cd5 fund was established in 1994 and our mission has been to expand economic opportunity for underserved people and communities by supporting the growth and capacity of a national network of community development lenders investors and financial services providers to do that the cdfi fund invests and provides assistance to community development financial institutions whereas representative case said cdfi's that's that's what we call all of them to counter this investment that has occurred in distressed and underserved areas cdfis serve as the gateway to capital and credit in communities not traditionally served by banks in other lenders so the first most important question is what are community development financial institutions so from the list of 11 cdfi's that we have cdfis could be banks credit unions loan funds which are typically non-profit and venture capital funds cdfi funds are mission-based and community-focused lending organizations they expand economic opportunity for primarily low-income communities cdfi share a common goal of facilitating economic opportunity in distressed or underserved areas across the country today and i believe it might even be more than this as of the the end of december but there are more than 1300 cdfi's serving rural urban and native communities throughout the united states you can find a cdfi in all 50 states the district of columbia guam and puerto rico cdfis in general this whole network is a collaborative force they bring together private and public sector investors philanthropy large-scale financial institutions government entities beyond the cdfi funded treasury but entities such as usda and hud and community-based stakeholders to deploy capital where it's needed most and where it can have the most impact so the next question you may be asking is what do cdfi's do cdfi's help families finance their first homes support small businesses start-up businesses establish and rebuild credit histories and invest in local education and community facilities as well as provide financial services and training the cdf5 fund supports this work by providing grants in other types of financial assistance as well as technical assistance in fiscal year 2021 we provided nearly 1.5 billion in monetary awards and loans we committed to guaranteeing a hundred million in bonds and we allocated five billion in new markets tax credits i'll go into those programs a little bit later and again feel free to pop questions in the chat or or send them over to mitch but in general the cdfi fund award recipients have successfully leveraged billions of private sector investment to create jobs build affordable housing build essential community facilities provide financial counseling and overall invest in neighborhood revitalization all in distressed or underserved communities that lack access to traditional lending or banking institutions so what makes a cdfi let's talk a little bit about certification to become certified an organization must submit a cdfi certification application to the cdfi fund for review and approval the organization must demonstrate that it meets seven requirements the first is to be a legal entity at the time that you certify while we do provide technical assistance we provide technical assistance to organizations that are operating they may not yet be cdfi's but they are legal entities and have been operating you will have to have a primary mission of promoting community development you will also have to state that you are primarily serving one or more target markets and what that means is we have three different target markets where cdf5 can designate that they will dedicate 60 or more of their lending to these areas with that lending you have to be a financial institution or a financing entity of course banks and credit unions are regulated so they automatically pass the test but if you are a non-profit loan fund you will have to demonstrate that you are in the business of providing loans and investment you'll have to demonstrate that those loans and investments are accountable and that your organization is accountable to the target markets that you designated in addition to that you'll have to provide development services that coordinate with the financial products so for example if you're a small business lender you'll have to show that you provide small business technical assistance or small business accounting courses or something that helps a small business owner build its capacity and then lastly you may not be a a government agency to be a cdfi now once a cdfi has been certified it's also going to have to be recertified on an annual basis this allows the cdfi fund to assess whether your organization remains in compliance with certification requirements and to monitor any changes in the organization's financial or other types of data such as changing board membership or change in accountability the annual recertification process also allows us to get more information on the communities that you're serving on the types of products and services that you're offering as well as offers the opportunity to update any service areas we have a lot of cdfi's that may start in one localized or specialized area and then over time grow to incorporate more areas in their target market so let's take a look at the cdfi's that are in hawaii and you all will know this map much better than i do and if you can tell with all of the dots and in the legend here we have cdfis that are headquartered here we have cdfis that may not be headquartered in hawaii but have made investment in hawaii as representative case said there are 11 certified cdfis including six native cdfis with a total asset size of 643 million the cdfi let me go back the cdfis who are native cdfis have assets that total more than 407 million the hawaii-based cdfis have received 100 awards or allocations which would be new markets tax credit allocations over the course of the last 15 years the cdf5 fund total for hawaii center nca5 for cdfis that are in hawaii or investing in hawaii is 228.2 million now let's flip over to the next slide that actually shows the types of investments so as you can see nearly 176.3 million has been awarded through new markets tax credits and those were invested in 38 projects by cdes or community development entities that are headquartered in both hawaii and outside of the state for both in-state and out-of-state cdfis the financial assistance program those recipients have reported making 1737 loans and investments totaling more than 251 million so while some of these numbers may not resonate with you all once you get more familiar with the cdf5 fund you'll note that we report everything in terms of asset sizes of cdfi's loan counts and amounts and total projects and dollar amounts this is one of the benefits of being certified because that total data then gets rolled up into the impact for the nation for the cd5 fund and as well as for individual states and regions so now i'm going to spend some time to talk about our actual programs the first one is the cdf5 program the cdf5 program provides monetary awards to invest in and build the capacity of cdfis empowering them to grow achieve organizational sustainability and contribute to the revitalization of their communities there are two parts to the cdfi program we have financial assistance awards that can be used for financial products loan loss reserves capital reserves financial services and for development services the second part is technical assistance and technical assistance can be used for capacity development that's integral to a cdfi's organizational sustainability and success or it can be used to support an organization's ability to become certified so as i mentioned on the certification page while you have to demonstrate that you need all of those tests many organizations that are just starting out as long as they're a legal entity and they do have some financing they're able to apply for technical assistance to build any areas that they're falling short within certification or just to build their capacity in general just to give you a sense of the size and types of awards that we provide under the cdf5 program there are different averages our technical assistance awards average about 150 000 and then our financial assistance award can average anywhere from 750 000 to maybe 1.5 million depending on the number of qualified applicants but in total in fiscal year 2021 cdfi award recipients reported originating loans or investments totaling more than 38.7 billion and this is part of the leveraging that representative case mentioned at the top cdfis take our public dollars and pair them with private sector dollars in order to turn that million dollar grant into an eight million dollar project or more you'll also see that other types of loans were reported 12 billion in consumer loans 10.7 billion in home improvements and 8.1 billion for businesses in our last funding round 265 cdfis received over 180 million in financial assistance awards in addition we gave out 24 million in technical assistance awards to 191 organizations our next funding rail will take place in fiscal year 2022 and that's going to open this winter so if you haven't signed up for our emails our gov delivery emails and i'll have our website information at the end you'll want to do that so you can stay abreast of all of our program developments next i'll move on to our native initiatives the native initiatives program was created to increase opportunities for native american alaska native and native hawaiian communities to access credit capital and financial services by creating or expanding cdfis primarily serving those communities and these groups we refer to as native cdfas the naca program as we call it the abbreviation for native american cdfi assistance program has a similar award component to the cdfi program but with an exclusive focus on native cdfis the performance results reported by mecca program award recipients in fiscal year 2021 show that native cdfis originated more than 7 000 loans or investments totaling 163 million based on portfolio activities of the previous year and this includes nearly 40 million in business and micro enterprise loans 31 million in home improvement and home purchase loans and almost 36 million in consumer loans the next program i'll turn to is our bank enterprise award program the bank enterprise award program provides monetary awards to fdic-insured banks and thrifts that demonstrate that they have increased their investments in support to cdfis or they have increased lending investing or service related activities in the most economically distressed communities across the country in october our last funding round the cdfi fund made 26 million dollars available for fdic insured institutions applications were due to the cdfi fund on december 14th this is our upcoming round and we'll announce those awards in the spring of 2022 next is the new markets tax credit program the new market tax credit program attracts private investment by permitting individual and corporate investors to receive a tax credit against their federal income tax in exchange for making qualified equity investments or qeis in specialized financial intermediaries called community development entities this is when i said cdes earlier we have a lot of acronyms at the cdf500 but cdes are specifically for new markets tax credit program so since the inception of the new market tax credit program in 2000 the cdfi fund has completed 17 allocation rounds and has made 1354 awards totaling 66 billion in tax credit allocation authority the calendar year of 2021 new markets for which 5 billion was made available it closed on january 13th and the cdf5 fund expects that we will announce those allocations in the fall of 2022 and i'm realizing that some of the zoom things may be covering the numbers or maybe my windows covering the numbers so i'll be sure to get this presentation to mitch um when we're done and so if folks want to have it and refer to it for reference you'll be able to do that so apologies if some of this is being cut off by the by the zoom controls okay next up next up we have the bond guarantee program and the senior five bond guarantee program was designed to respond to critical market needs by providing long-term fixed-rate low-cost capitals certified cdfis so that they in turn can utilize the financing to spur economic growth and jump start community revitalization bonds issued through the program support cdfi lending and investment in underserved communities by providing long-term capital long-term capital is something that the cdfi industry is in desperate need of um for the cdfis who are actually participating you'll know um what i'm talking about in terms of most financing that cdfis receive from banks is short term between five and seven years particularly when we're looking at small business lending so the fact that a cdfi bond guarantee is available for 30 years is a huge benefit to the cdfi community but unlike other cdfi programs this program does not offer a grant or tax credit allocation but instead is a federal credit program so bonds of course are debt instruments and these must be repaid that's one big distinction between this program and our other ones but you can see below on this chart on this slide the impact that the bond guarantee program has had across a number of asset classes from charter schools to small businesses day care nonprofit organizations commercial real estate you name it next program i'll go to is the capital magnet fund so the purpose of the capital magnet fund is to attract private capital for affordable housing and economic development activities in economically distressed areas awardees under the capital magnet fund are required to finance or support 10 times the grant amount in eligible project costs we just did a round in 2021 and that round closed in november we had up to 380 million available for awards to certified cdfis as well as non-profit affordable housing organizations this is the highest level this is the highest level of awards that have been made available under any capital magnet fund round and it's important to note that in addition to cdfis as i just said that affordable housing developers can also apply for these fundings we're going to do another round of 2022 and that is expected to open this spring now i also note that in hawaii capital magnet fund has generated 59 affordable housing units we do have data for our other programs but i wanted to highlight that this is one of the programs that where partnerships really come into play where cdfi's or other community organizations can find non-profit developers and work specifically on affordable housing or economic development related projects within a community and then the last program that i'll cover is our small dollar loan program now the small dollar loan program is a newly launched program that helps certified cdfis address the issue of expanding consumer access to mainstream financial institutions and provides alternatives to high-cost small-dollar loans that are prevalent in low-income communities through this program we provide awards to cdfis for loan loss reserves and that can help defray the cost of a new or existing small dollar loan program or for technical assistance which can be used for technology staff support and other costs associated with establishing and maintaining a small dollar loan program the first round was announced in september and we had a total of 10.8 million dollars in small dollar loan program funds and we gave that to 52 cdfis that included one hawaii-based cdfi we anticipate opening the next round in spring of this coming year so i've covered everything we have a slew of programs at the cdfi fund that if you are a cdfi are looking to be a cdfi or you're partnering with the cdfi there is a program that will likely provide some flexible capital for you to develop whatever project from consumer lending all the way to charter schools and community facilities so i'll flip to the next side that has our contact information and let me see if you see what i see i need to move this out the way so you can find us on linkedin on instagram twitter i'll also put our website in the chat and if there are any questions i think we have time for that but mitch i'll defer to you for how you want to move forward so thank you all again and thank you representative case for the opportunity to discuss the cdfi fund

mr. president I rise to introduce the taxpayer protection act of 2014 this bill would require the independent IRS oversight board to better fulfill its obligation to protect the constitutional rights of American taxpayers mr. president the history of the IRS offers abundant examples of the agency trampling on those rights in the most recent controversy the IRS subjected applications from conservative groups that were seeking tax-exempt status to heightened scrutiny delaying these groups applications suggests an effort to chill the constitutional rate of speech and association by groups that hold conservative views the details that have emerged are truly alarming the IRS has admitted that it deliberately targeted conservative groups applications for tax-exempt status for extra review if they included such words as tea party patriots 912 in their names or if they criticized how this country is being run or their purpose were to address government spending government debt taxes or simply to make America a better place incredible mr. president these inappropriate criteria stayed in place for more than 18 months and resulted in substantial delays in processing the applications of many different groups in some cases the applications remained outstanding for more than two years the IRS also sought to compel some of the targeted groups to divulge their membership lists IRS officials have subsequently admitted that there was absolutely no reason for agency personnel to have side that kind of information such behavior unfortunately is not a one-time aberration a may 2013 Time magazine article notes that the IRS has been involved in scandals going back at least as far as the Kennedy administration which used the service to investigate so-called right-wing groups President Nixon employed a secret IRS operation to investigate and audit political opponents during the Johnson administration the IRS targeted anti-war activists in the decades since civil rights groups political act activists from both the conservative and the Liberals ends of the spectrum and whistleblowers have been subjected to intimidating and discriminating discriminatory scrutiny by the IRS mr. president in 1997 the Senate Finance Committee held three days of hearings that were instigated by reports of IRS abuses one type of abuse was the so-called blue sky assessment which then committee chairman william roth characterized as agents making tax assessments that had no basis in fact or law and were in some instances simply levied to hurt the taxpayer some witnesses had to have their identities concealed out of fear of retaliation for their testimony as witness number one an IRS agent stated the abuse of the taxpaying public occurs when the IRS improperly and sometimes illegally uses its best power in the process of implementing some type of enforcement of the tax laws this agent went on to note that it wasn't the IRS Code that abused taxpayers but rather how it was being implemented in an unfair intimidating and discriminatory way I note these 1997 hearings in particular because they coincided with an effort to reform the IRS culminating in the IRS restructuring and reform act bad blog made a number of changes to the structure of the IRS and the manner in which it administers the tax laws one such reform was the creation of the IRS oversight forward by law the board is charged with ensuring that taxpayers are treated properly by the IRS and is the board is designed to be independent of the agency of the required nine members seven must be senate-confirmed to point ease who have professional experience or expertise in business and tax administration the IRS Reform Act also requires that IRS employees be terminated for violating the constitutional rights of taxpayers now mr. president the current IRS scandal was however brought to light by the Cyrus oversight board instead the abuses cat came to the public's and our attention through a may 2013 report by the treasury inspector general for tax administration following the release of the inspector general's report the oversight board released the statement saying that it would work with the IRS and the IG among others to meet its statutory responsibility to protect taxpayers mr. presint bests the whole purpose of this board and I believe it should do much more than just work with the IRS officials and the IG so my bill would strengthen its oversight role by requiring reporting to Congress my bill would ensure that the existing laws which are rooted in the response to prior IRS scandals work as they should it would require the oversight board to report to Congress each and every year on allegations of abuse of taxpayers constitutional rights on the number of employees who were terminated for such violations on why employees against whom allegations were raised were not terminated and on the effectiveness of internal controls if any that the IRS has put in place to prevent the unfair targeting of taxpayers mr. president the IRS's history of abuses demonstrates that Congress must be ever vigilant in protecting taxpayers the agency's powers allow it to pervade the most sensitive aspect of Americans private lives irrespective of whether those singled out our liberal or conservative Democrats or Republicans independents or Green Party members irrespective of their personal views the targeting of private citizens for exercising their First Amendment rights is way out of bounds it is illegal behavior and cannot be tolerated mr. president it has been said that the power to tax is the power to destroy the American people cannot and will not tolerate any abuse of that power I urge my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this bill and let us pass it to help protect the most fundamental rights guaranteed by our Constitution against abuse by government's ability to tax Thank You mr. president

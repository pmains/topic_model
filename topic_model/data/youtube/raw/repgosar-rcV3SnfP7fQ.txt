mr. speaker today I'm here to say enough is enough the president and this administration are manipulating the shutdown to intentionally hurt as many American families as possible and that is simply wrong my home state of Arizona has many national parks and beautiful scenic views most importantly the Grand Canyon the gem of the National Park Service it should not be forgotten that these belong to the people the house though the House passed HJ resolution 70 open our national parks Museum act by a large bipartisan margin the Senate is refusing to act on it which is why in true Arizona fashion the Arizona Game and Fish Commission offered to the National Park Service their own solution which is to include their own Game and Fish resources to keep open our national parks including Lee's ferry the Gateway to the Colorado River the Grand Canyon and the very symbol of Arizona on behalf of the people of Arizona I urged the National Parks of the way let residents let Americans let everyone back in to their parks I yield back

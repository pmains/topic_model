a bit of History my grandfather came over from Czechoslovakia worked in the steel mill for 53 years my area has been built on steel and a lot of Downstream Industries so I'm going to talk about the ecosystem of how things work there are manufacturing plants auto manufacturing plants in Chicago when they're out of semiconductor chips people from my district stop working for 15 years prior to becoming a member of Congress I served as a local elected official who did emergency poor relief I've sat across the table from families who have lost their jobs because of trade policies and because of no control of their own so here we are today with an opportunity to create certainty to be able to make sure that the American competes act does this when we talk about that ecosystem when the Ford plant and the automatic auto automotive plants no longer have chips and they're stalled my district stops working when they're stalled and when appliances are stalled in Downstream Industries are stalled workers and families stop working while they're going through a pandemic and we stop making steel because the orders stop because they're no longer making appliances and cars and tens of thousands of Steel Workers in my district are no longer working so what the American competes act does is it's been talked about it allows us to give those Industries and working men and women certainty about their future we've done our part with the infrastructure bill now to Shore that with the steel we need to make sure that the infrastructure bill passes so that we're investing in American domestic manufacturing but most importantly investing in American domestic manufacturing Working Families and when we do that we increase productivity that has been mentioned and so part of why we have our inflation is because demand if you increase productivity you give the tools to the nation and the manufacturers you will decrease demand where we can deflate inflation so this is a valuable tangible difference for the American people for steel producers and it has been mentioned a national security issue steel is an issue when it comes to National Security because if we're going to build ships and planes and tanks we better make sure it's made by American Steel because what we learned through the pandemic is that we can't be reliant on Bad actors so what we're doing is we are leveling the playing field and we're investing in American domestic manufacturing I urge the conferees to pass the American competes act because the American families and domestic manufacturing deserve a fighting chance and a Level Playing Field to show the world we are the very best at making Goods I think

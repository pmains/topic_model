from mississippi rise cassette to address the house for one minute without objection mr speaker on april 20th 2010 america witnessed the worst man-made disaster in our nation's history mississippi lost four of her native sons to the explosion and over the course of three months nearly 5 million barrels of oil gushed into the gulf of mexico causing extreme economic environmental damage yesterday the bipartisan restore act was introduced that will put the gulf states on the right path to long-term recovery the restore act will send 80 percent of the fines paid by bp to the areas that were most affected from the tragic event and will allow the gulf states to invest funds and projects and programs designed to rehabilitate the region economically and environmentally the act provides states with the flexibility to address their own unique and specific needs with transparency and accountability once bp is held accountable for its actions it's only fair that those hardest hit will receive the relief they desperately need and deserve i now urge my colleagues from across the country to do the right thing and support the bipartisan restore act i yield back

it is a story that is seizing the national headlines with calls for changes at the top we're talking about the the concerns raised across the country with the VA the waiting lines and the course of reports that deaths have been linked to lack of access to care and Arizona as many as 30 deaths attributed by veterans of the sub veterans to the delay and care provided joining me now a former client of my company and a candidate for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate Dan Sullivan joins us dan welcome to the Dave steer and chill hey Dave great to hear your voice good to have you here now you you are here's my take on this of all of the the five or six people who want to be a united states senator you still have a role in creating future clients for the VA you train Marines correct and someday in the future whether it's for a toothache long-term treatment for burns mental illness and/or an adjustment of a prosthetic limb you are training future clients for the VA that's right when when this story broke this is not a secret that there have always been challenges with the VA first of all how well do you know General Eric Shinseki and and what are your thoughts on on the VA stories as we're hearing them now well look I mean it's great in some ways that the national media finally picked this up but I'll tell you this this has been a story that's been going on for years and what's so frustrating here when i launched my campaign in october we raised the issue of treatment of our veterans from the minute i launched my campaign and then on Veterans Day we put out our first policy paper for my campaign and veterans on Veterans Day last year called the promises delivered project highlighting these very problems and say we as a country have to do something more about it we wrote our beds we went on talk radio we've been beating the drum on this what the USA Today last year called a national disgrace and the fact that our Congress and the Obama administration finally seem to be waking up to it is it is a national disgrace the federal government shouldn't be doing a lot of things in Alaska but one thing they should be doing is taking care of our vets is is there um is there a special ownership that the Obama administration has on this issue and let me tell you why I asked the question and it doesn't mean it it's been a mess forever in a day we can agree with that the Genesis wasn't with your election of President Obama degree well it's been a mess for a long time right but why you but they were briefed right and this was this this goes to the point of my question as to why it's especially a troublesome for the president II prior to to his inauguration he addressed i believe it was during out the campaign during his first term he addressed the VFW national conference and he told members of the VFW after he was the nominee I've got your six talking about the concerns raised about the VA he blasted the Bush administration and the collisions at Walter Reed and he said yet this was his number one priority and and it's it's failed the initiative you know closing Gitmo he hasn't done that and we could go into the whole list of what he has or hasn't accomplished but but this is not something that the president knew about when he read the papers a few days ago as he ridiculously claimed I didn't know it was a problem till I read the papers he owns this issue doesn't he he owns it and here's the thing it's gotten much worse under the Obama administration and the Senate Democrats time and power let me give you an example and we put it in our paper you can go to our website Sullivan 2014 com we launched this in November this our focus on this issue but there this issue of backlogs and wait times has grown from in 2009 when the Obama administration came into power about a hundred and fifty thousand to over 600,000 last spring and so it's gotten much worse um and now you have these other issues of secret waiting lists and things um it's gotten much worse Shinseki IIIi uh Eric Shinseki uh former general United States Army if I recall correctly correct uh not a bad guy no served his country with honor and distinction and afters as to what your thoughts are I've said this earlier Shinseki could be the guy that shows up with the best of intentions I I don't believe in my heart of hearts that general Shinseki wants a single vet to be mistreated no or a single vet to go without the care they deserve but the bureaucracy that we have created it is the VA I mean a general is used to say and get that crap done and and crap i would imagine kind of gets done when the general says it usually is the bureaucracy that we've built in the system one of the largest impediments to providing vets with the care they deserve well look I mean Dave the the point you make about general Shinseki and what I called for his resignation last week in addition to the American Legion and now a bipartisan coalition of US senators have except for Mark Begich but I mentioned very uh no honorable man served his country third of 30-plus years in the US Army served in Vietnam great service to the country but this is about accountability and leadership and after five and a half years of no one seemingly even paying attention to the issue there have been i G reports after IG reports there have been press reports it's only getting worse and at a certain point this administration needs to take accountable actions for leaders to get things done and they haven't whether it's Benghazi or the IRS and this is another example in you know with regard to Senator Begich he was quoted in The Wall Street Journal recently saying if there's a problem the Obama administration needs to fix it if there's a problem he sits on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee senator there's a problem it's not if going forward and well actually I can't go going forward yet because a couple days ago the president nited states address cadets graduating from West Point he never ever mentioned what was going on with the VA has been roundly criticized for that you train Marines you're a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps Reserve you are you are you're overseeing the formation of a brigade correct an anglican 'it an anglican it yes right part and revenue part of what you're doing and and people read papers young marines read papers people know what's going on and in the course of training they come up to you they say it colonel what what is the deal what is the deal I I mean I'm going to be using the VA I may I may have to get get some bridge work done or or something they happen in one of my buddies after they're deployed the this boils down to the essence of what we we we honored of veterans on Memorial Day on Monday the the the young man and the young women who stepped forward to surf how do you answer them what do you say to those young Marines that your training look I think it's a great question because as I mentioned the federal government has a sacred trust responsibility to these men and women in particular who have fought and sacrificed for our country and I don't think anyone disagrees with that but we're failing on it and you know one of the great privileges are still being in the reserves and a commanding officer of a unit is you get to see on the ground floor what the men and women who are still serving and deploying our thinking and I'll give you one example Dave it's another issue of not taking care of our veterans in december when i was doing training one of my Marines came to me and asked me if I knew about this budget deal that congress had just passed this guy was getting ready to retire 19 years in the Marine Corps I hadn't heard about it was news came back to Alaska saw in what he had told me will turn out to be exactly right this budget deal in December focused on cutting the retirement of one group of federal employees only veterans guys who would serve even disabled veterans cutting retirement by tens of thousands of dollars no other federal workers were affected by this budget deal it was an outrage in the guys who are still serving the women who are still serving when they see this whether it's the budget deal that Mark Begich voted for in December the cut eviscerated benefit or retirement or the lack of leadership and accountability at the Veterans Administration now it undermines their notion that there is a sacred trust between the government and those who serve and sacrifice in it's not good for military morale it it seems to me that in the backdrop of the memorial day service on Monday with the story swirling around about the VA with a continued discussion of of how we compensate men and women not just when they're deployed but when they're they're no longer actively serving this nation or the commitments made their family I it to me structurally is is low-hanging fruit and yet continues to be a challenge for this country dan sullivan you are running out to be the GOP nominee for the United States Senate if people want a more I'll find out more about your thoughts on this issue and your other positions how can they do that yes Sullivan 2014 dot-com and come on to our website as a matter of fact last night we just launched our veterans coalition in Fairbanks and I'll tell you Dave it was a great event veterans from a whole host of different Wars but the topic we discussed there was front and center at this coalition launched last night were these issues and my campaign is going to continue to focus on them the way we've been focusing on them from day one and Mark Begich needs to join me in calling Dan Southerland his resignation we always a pleasure

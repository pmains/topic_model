>>> WELCOME BACK. WITH US NOW, CONGRESSMAN ADAM  SCHIFF, DEMOCRAT OF BURBANK,  GLENDALE AND HOLLYWOOD, ALSO THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. JOINS US FROM WASHINGTON. CONGRESSMAN, THE DEMOCRATIC  SIDE, THERE WERE TWEETS OF  PEOPLE WITH EMOJIS OF POPCORN  AND TAKING IT ALL IN ON THE  FIRST DAY. BUT YOUR ASSESSMENT AS TO WHAT  YOU SAW. >> WELL, I THINK IT WAS A SAD  SPECTACLE FOR THE COUNTRY. I DON'T THINK THIS IS -- I  WOULDN'T DESCRIBE THIS AS  DEMOCRACY IN ACTION. I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS  DYSFUNCTION IN ACTION. WHEN A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT IS  NOW GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY OF  GOVERNING CAN'T TAKE THE MOST  BASIC STEP AND THAT IS TO ELECT  THEIR OWN LEADER. IT PORTENDS REALLY I THINK  DANGEROUS THINGS TO COME. IN PARTICULAR WHAT I'M  DESPERATELY CONCERNED ABOUT IS  THAT NEW MAJORITY LED AROUND BY  THE MOST EXTREME ELEMENTS NOW  HOLD ALL THE STRINGS IS GOING TO LEAD US INTO A CRISIS IN WHICH  WE MAY DEFAULT ON THE NATION'S  DEBT AND I CAN SEE KEVIN  McCARTHY FACING THE CHOICE  BETWEEN DOING THE RIGHT THING  AND RAISING THE DEBT CEREALING  SO WE DON'T DEFAULT ON THE DEBTS WE ALREADY HAVE AND LOSING THE  SPEAKERSHIP OR SACRIFICING THE  FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF THE  COUNTRY AND I WOULD NEVER WANT  TO COUNT ON KEVIN McCARTHY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH  KEVIN McCARTHY. DID IT SURPRISE YOU THAT PEOPLE  DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM ON THE --  WITHIN HIS OWN CONFERENCE? >> NO. YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY THERE IS NO  TRUST FOR HIM IN OUR CAUCUS. BUT EVEN WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN  MEMBERS THEY DON'T TRUST HIM. HE WILL SAY ONE THING, HE WILL  DO ANOTHER. HE WILL MAKE COMMITMENT AND  BREAK IT. THIS IS WHY HE HAD SUCH A  DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THAT  SPEAKER VOTE, AND IN ORDER TO  GET IT. HE HAD TO DEAL AWAY SO  MANUFACTURE THE POWERS OF HIS  OFFICE AND FRIGHTENINGLY, HE  DEALT THEM AWAY NOT TO THE  MODERATES, HE DEALT THEM AWAY TO THE MOST EXTREME ELEMENTS IN HIS CONFERENCE AND HE KNOWS NOW THAT ANY ONE OF THEM AT ANY GIVEN  TIME CAN FORCE THE COUNTRY TO GO THROUGH THE SAME SPECTACLE WE  JUST DID FOR THE LAST WEEK IF HE MAKES A DECISION THEY DON'T  LIKE. AND SO, THIS I THINK IS A  TERRIBLE DEVELOPMENT, NOT AN  UNFORESEEABLE ONE. WE WARNED THIS WOULD BE THE  CASE, THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO  GOVERN, THEY'RE STILL SO HEAVILY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DONALD  TRUMP AND TORN UP BY THAT  PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE THAT WHAT  WE SAW THIS WEEK IS, I'M AFRAID  WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT  MORE OF.  >> LISTEN, THERE ARE BOMB  THROWERS ON YOUR SIDE OF THE  AISLE AS WELL. I THINK CHUCK TODD MADE THIS  POINT, THAT CORI BUSH, THE ONE  WHO SAYS WE SHOULD GET RID OF  ALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND SOME  OF THE RADICAL MEMBERS OF THE  DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE TAKING  NOTES BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT MANY  OF THEM WERE THOUGHT THEY WERE  MISTREATED BY NANCY PELOSI. COULD WE SEE THE SAME THING  HAPPEN IF YOU WIN BACK MAJORITY  IN THE NEXT CYCLE? >> NO, WE HAD A NARROW MAJORITY  WHEN SPEAKER PELOSI WAS THE  SPEAKER. >> RIGHT, BUT THAT WAS -- BUT  THAT WAS SPEAKER PELOSI. THAT'S THE POINT. NANCY PELOSI IS NOT -- SHE HAS  SKILLS THAT YOU JUST DON'T  DUPLICATE THAT EASILY.  >> NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU DON'T DUPLICATE THAT EASILY. BUT WE HAVE A VERY, VERY STRONG  CAPABLE, TALENTED NEW TEAM OF  LEADERSHIP, LED BY HAKEEM  JEFFREYS THAT HAVE EVERY  CONFIDENCE IN -- AND YOU SAW  WHAT DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO DO,  EVEN WITH A NARROW MAJORITY TO  PASS PASS BILLS TO BRING DOWN  INFLATION, TO PASS A BIPARTISAN  INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AND TO GET  SO MUCH MORE DONE FOR THE  COUNTRY TO -- THE MOST VIGOROUS  ATTACK ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN OUR  HISTORY, YOU WILL SEE WHAT  REPUBLICANS DO WITH THAT SAME  MAJORITY, WHICH WILL AMOUNT TO  NOTHING EXCEPT MORE DISSENT,  DISCORD AND POTENTIALLY MORE  BRAWLS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. >> RIGHT. BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT WHAT WE SAW MAY HAVE DAMAGED THE  SPEAKERSHIP PERMANENTLY? NOT JUST IN THIS SESSION, BUT  GOING FORWARD? >> NO. I THINK IT DAMAGED IT FOR KEVIN  McCARTHY. HE'S BECOME THE SPEAKER ALMOST  IN NAME ONLY. IT WILL CRIPPLE HIS ABILITY TO  RUN THE HOUSE. BUT WE CERTAINLY WON'T FOLLOW  THAT MODEL. WE DIDN'T FOLLOW IT WHEN WE HAD  THE SAME MAJORITY AND WE  WOULDN'T FOLLOW IT IN THE  FUTURE. THAT'S TO BE SURE. >> PRESIDENT VISITS THE BORDER. I'LL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY,  HE'S COME UNDER CRITICISM FROM  HIS OWN PARTY OVER REINTRODUCING TITLE 42, THE HEALTHCARE RULE  THAT KEPT PEOPLE FROM ENTERING  THE COUNTRY, 30,000 PEOPLE WILL  BE SENT BACK IN ESTIMATION. WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE  IMMIGRATION PLAN FROM THE WHITE  HOUSE? >> WELL, LOOK, I HAVE ADVOCATED  FOR A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO  IMMIGRATION REFORM, YOU KNOW,  FOR OVER 20 YEARS. AND FRANKLY WE HAD LITTLE TO NO  HELP FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AISLE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM  BECAUSE THEY LIKE HAVING THE  PROBLEM. THEY THINK IT IS A WINNING ISSUE FOR THEM. IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT  FOR US TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE AND  HUMANE IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT  IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES. THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SUPPORTED,  BUT, AGAIN, THERE IS NO  INCENTIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO  DO ANYTHING MORE THAN DEMAGOGUE  ON THIS ISSUE. IT IS NOT LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES  WERE BETTER IN THE LAST  ADMINISTRATION THEY WERE WORSE. SO WE OUGHT TO DO WHAT MY  COLLEAGUES JUST SAID, ROLL UP  OUR SLEEVES, WORK TOGETHER AND  GET A COMPREHENSIVE BILL PASSED  AND STOP DEMAGOGUING ON THE  ISSUE.  >> THE LAST TIME WE TALKED TO  YOU, YOU SAID YOU WERE  CONSIDERING A POSSIBLE RUN FOR  U.S. SENATE. HAVE YOU EXPLORED THAT ANY  FURTHER? AND HAVE YOU HEARD FROM DIANNE  FEINSTEIN, YOUR COLLEAGUE,  WHETHER OR NOT SHE'S GOING TO  RUN FOR RE-ELECTION? >> YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL, I  HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR DIANNE  FEINSTEIN. SHE'S BEEN ONE OF THE GIANTS IN  OUR STATE FOR SO MANY YEARS. I FEEL LIKE I SERVED UNDER THE  BEST SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WE  EVER HAD AND I ALSO FEEL LIKE I  SERVED ONE OF THE BEST  CALIFORNIA SENATORS WE EVER HAD. SHE HASN'T MADE HER INTENTIONS  CLEAR YET ABOUT WHETHER SHE WILL RUN AGAIN. IF SHE CHOOSES NOT TO, I'M VERY  INTERESTED IN RUNNING AND HAD A  LOT OF ENCOURAGEMENT FROM PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I AM EXPLORING IT. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF,  DEMOCRAT OF BURBANK, PASADENA,  HOLLYWOOD, 30th DISTRICT, THANK  YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE

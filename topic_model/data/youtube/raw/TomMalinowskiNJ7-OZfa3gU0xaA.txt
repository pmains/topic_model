thank you everyone for joining us tonight the congressman wanted to host tonight's town hall because he figured we all needed a place to talk about the future of the supreme court and the fact that over 300 people signed up i think he may have been right um before we get started though i'd like us all to take a moment and for a moment of silence to remember ruth bader ginsburg and i'll just help his client for a minute thank you and may her memory be for a blessing before i turn the mic over to congressman malinowski i want to remind everyone to please put your questions into the chat box we are going to try to get to as many folks as we can i know many of you also emailed us questions so we're going to try to bounce around between those um so thank you all for being here and without further ado congressman malinowski thank you so much lisa thanks everybody for jumping on uh to talk about the latest drama in our national drama i i wish and i know all of us wish that we could be taking this time this moment to focus exclusively on justice ginsburg's life and on what she did for our country on her legacy um to celebrate it to talk to our kids about it but unfortunately um politics intrudes immediately it did not take uh senator mcconnell more than a couple of hours after the news of her passing spread to announce that he was going to violate his own precedent and and try to ram through a new justice to to take her seat and so we are forced unfortunately to confront all of the implications of that so let me just offer a few thoughts and then i want to uh invite a conversation um the first one is that um we shouldn't be surprised by any of this the the folks mcconnell and most of the senate republicans long ago abandoned any pretense of a fairness of consistency of respect for the traditions of the senate they their philosophy right now is that power does what power can do and they feel like they have the power at least in the senate and i think interestingly they also feel like they're losing the power in uh in all kinds of other ways including with this uh election that's looming and they see the supreme court as kind of a final bastion for themselves to uh defend uh the policies that they've been championing for many years and um the the policies that their donors um uh strongly support and so they're gonna do what they're gonna do and nobody should be surprised and i don't think we should be wasting too much of our time complaining about it uh and one reason i don't think we need to waste too much of our time complaining and screaming about it is that it is a transparent abuse of power i think it's transparent to um to most americans who see perfectly well what's going on most americans are fair-minded and whatever their political ideology i think most most folks would agree that that there should be rules and the rules should apply to everybody equally and that that's not what's happening in the way we're selecting our supreme court judges now i think that's just really plain and obvious and and we almost don't have to um drive that home i think the two really important questions right now are number one um what does this do to the credibility of the supreme court and number two more important what does it do to our lives um on the first question i am very concerned we should be very concerned our country in in in our system of government we desperately need to have a judicial branch particularly a supreme court that is uh trusted by by people that is seen as politically neutral and objective so that when there's a decision that comes down whether we agree with the decision or not all of us as americans accept it uh we accept that okay the supreme court said that that is the law now and we we have to uh even if we don't agree with it we it's legitimate we have to live with it i i think if you're gonna be um if you're gonna be following a practice of denying a president of one party the ability to pick a supreme court justice while rushing through a nominee of president of a different party under um similar circumstances you're going to end up with the supreme court i i fear that is not going to enjoy that kind of legitimacy uh and and that's really really bad for the country and something that we're going to think you know if this happens we're going to have to you know take some serious uh actions to to try to repair um the second question and and this is the one i think we need to be focused on above all right now with the election coming up is what again what does this mean for our lives what does this mean um to the folks who have already started casting their ballots uh in the presidential election in congressional elections including ours and here i you know i want to be i want to be really really focused and specific with you particularly on the issue of health care here's what's going to happen we have an administration that is in court right now to strike down the affordable care act the most recent ruling by an appellate court was in agreement with the trump administration it struck down the affordable care act that case is going to the supreme court a week after the election even if mcconnell doesn't succeed in getting a new justice confirmed if we have a four to four split on that case in the supreme court then the lower court ruling stands and the affordable care act is no more that is in my view the likeliest outcome here but here's what that means what that means is that every single american knows or should know because we will tell them that the future of the affordable care act the future of all of the things about it that the overwhelming majority of americans want protection of people with pre-existing conditions letting kids stay on their parents plans until they're 26 all of those things are going to depend on the united states congress on electing members of congress who will protect what the supreme court may soon try to take away because congress will then be faced with the choice of do we reinstate the aca that's what makes this election so important and the power is entirely in our hands remember they're doing this because they feel like they're losing power they're losing national elections they're losing the popular vote they lost the house of representatives they may lose the senate this year and so this is kind of a last last-ditch effort to to protect the stuff that the special interests and the lobbyists and the big donors um have been using the senate to protect for all the years of mcconnell's ascendants there but you know even if we lose a battle over the supreme court in late 2020 we have the opportunity we have the power to win a fight for congress for to win a fight for the white house which is much much more important and can lead to lasting change and you know what like the supreme court strikes down the aca we know how to reinstate it in a way that uh we'll we'll get the necessary votes the next time this goes before the court because you see how they ruled and then we'll make the adjustments that we need to make um on roe versus wade should we be concerned about that yeah we should be because trump's nominee almost by definition is going to be somebody who pledges to repeal roe versus wade that becomes very very real but again the united states congress remember has never passed legislation on this roe vs wade is a supreme court made law there's absolutely no reason why the congress cannot make it the law of the land and i think given this very real prospect now this becomes an issue in this election and we are going to elect a congress that will protect reproductive rights in for for everybody in the united states um so on issue after issue on health care on reproductive rights on keeping dark money out of our politics the whole citizens united decision which we're already living with it really is up to the congress and that means it's up to us we have the power to make the change that we need to make this november it's a little over 40 days i think anybody who's concerned enough to get on this call i know you're concerned enough to work your heart out over the next 43 days or so to make sure that we get a government that reflects where the vast majority of the american people are so with that um be uh be confident you know be concerned but be confident uh that we we know how to beat this uh in the most important ways be ready to do the work um and you know i look forward to using the rest of our time to take any questions or thoughts that you have um finally you see i'm i'm in my car here i'm sort of poised to go back to the capitol to vote we are hopefully passing uh the continuing resolution tonight to keep the us government open that's pretty important uh they haven't told us exactly what time but it could be uh i don't think it'll be in the next 45 minutes but i have to be ready so let's get right to it he doesn't have a phone booth to go into and just change into his bat cape so this is where we are super big cape uh i did i wouldn't tell you true this is very true thank you for clearing that up uh thank you congressman we're going to take our first question from gail c she has a question about the possibility of expanding the court gail you are you unmuted yes i wanted to know if well let me premise this by saying that i'm a member of the supreme court bar and um i didn't think i'd ever be in a position to actually say this but um would you be in favor of expanding the number of justices on the court if as seems likely trump and the senate are going to ram through a conservative justice which in my mind is the second stolen seat um against the will of millions of americans in terms of the majority and also while voting is actually already taking place so um you know number one we're not we're not there yet and right now i think we have to focus on um the fight in the senate we don't know yet what's gonna happen mcconnell has the power uh whether he does this now or in the lame duck session we don't know and most importantly the fight for the senate and the fight for the house which i think needs to focus again on how this affects people's lives but this that they're doing this because they want to take away your health care they're doing this because they want to take away women's right to choose and we have the power to not let them do that um we may not control the us senate but we we do determine the outcome of this election and they know that i think that's got to be the focus right now um on what happens after you know we'll have to see i'll just tell you my philosophy uh i've uh i'm a traditionalist i i think we need to be very cautious about um making changes like that but i'm also not a trump and if this is you know if this is how one side is going to play things those with power can just use it to take what they want without regard to rules or tradition or precedent we have people right now who are making decisions solely based on naked partisan interests and not the best interests of the country if that is the basis for selecting supreme court justices where a democrat can't select one in the last year of his term but a republican can in the last potentially two months of his term then you know we're going to need to look at whatever steps are necessary to restore balance and most important to restore public confidence in the non-partisan trip of the supreme court it's not about whether it's a conservative or a liberal justice conservative presidents have every right to appoint conservative justices and vice versa it's about giving every american confidence that we are that the process is fair to both sides so that they then as i mentioned before they consider the supreme court to be a legitimate institution and they respect its rulings even if they disagree with those rulings whether you're democrat or republican liberal or conservative you should want that outcome great thank you congressman um next question we have is from susan willett she has a question of how she we can help hi yes um i just wanted to know if there's anything when you said we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work we should do like who should we call is what actions can we take to be supportive um and to help us um move people in the right direction if that's at all possible um you know uh i sometimes people ask me you know should we call mitch mcconnell's office should we call a bunch of senators and honest my honest advice is they don't care unless you're from their state so um that's pr that's not necessarily the best use of uh of your time the best use of your time in the next 43 days is focus on the election i mean this is it this is this is what democracy is all about we get this choice every two years every four years and um we've got the power to make it come out however we want we've got obviously my race in our district uh we have important races all over the country there are candidates who need your help uh who need your voice who need your volunteer power who need you to raise money for them all those things and um you know we're in a very strong position going into november and by we i mean democrats and all of our republican allies who in in the last few months have come together to say we're putting aside past differences over policy to try to rescue our republican with a small our system of government to defend our constitution to defend the idea that that there are rules there's a rule of law that applies to everybody and if we don't have that then nothing else matters nothing else will work in america um that's what we got to focus on the next 43 days don't worry so much about trying to influence a bunch of republican senators in the senate you can't do that they're doing they're going to do what they want to do they have the power to do it you have the power to take away their power focus on that exactly and if you look in the chat you will see ways to volunteer for tom's campaign as we've always said we're not going to make a difference in the presidential election we're not going to make a difference probably in the senate but we will make a huge difference in the house so let's make sure that we send tom back to washington so sign up to volunteer everybody thank you our next question is from bill griffith he has a question about lifetime appointments uh hi congressman can you hear me i will i can't okay um do you think the lifetime appointments such as to the courts should be subject to super majority confirmation votes to force more broadly acceptable candidates so uh you know that's that's an interesting question um you know if and and you know one of my republican colleagues were here he'd probably say it's all your fault democrats because uh harry reid took away the filibuster for lower court nominees and then mcconnell took it away for supreme court nominees and so now all you need is 51 votes to ram someone through my view on the filibuster and super majority in general is it's a little bit idiosyncratic a lot of democrats just want to get rid of the filibuster right now i kind of want to go back to the old ancient filibuster where if you're gonna do it um you've got to actually physically hold the floor of the senate you've got to really show that you mean it it shouldn't be a routine thing um and so you know if we were to go back to that for really really important things the minority party if if it really believed that the the well-being of the country was at stake um could uh hold up a vote and require a 60 vote uh uh move to to to free up to um to end debate um so uh you know that's that's certainly one thing we're gonna have to think about uh if democrats take the senate what happens to the filibuster what happens to the the super majority rule on all kinds of uh different things uh one thing i i you know if we get to that point that i also think is worth exploring is is fixing in law or resolving in law this question of whether a president can uh try to appoint a supreme court justice uh in the final year of his term can the senate simply refuse to hold a hearing for somebody has happened to president obama and his nominee in 2016. uh you know they i i do think going forward we need to fix that and and i think i believed in 2016 that yes a president should be able to appoint somebody up to at least a certain point close to the election and that any uh any person nominated by a president for supreme court position should get a hearing and a vote up or down within a reasonable period of time so if you want to block that person fine but you got to actually vote them down that's i think that would be a straightforward reform once we kind of restore the the balance uh here um but that i think would be the first priority well thank you congressman thanks thanks congressman thanks bill for that question um next up we have tyler armstrong who has a question about the saving the aca hey tyler could you press the unmute button on your zoom i think tyler was on an ipad and he was worried he wasn't gonna be able to ask the question so let me see if i can find his question goes back so i'm gonna skip him right now tyler we will come back to you oh are you on tyler hello oh go ahead tyler hey tom uh in the last debate uh it came up i i mean you pointed out that uh human rights watch received the nobel peace prize uh before you worked there why would you take responsibility for their actions against the national sex offender sex offender registry when you did work there you're the top lobbyist so uh that's obviously not the the subject of our discussion tyler but since you raised it you're referring to an ad that's running right now uh that has been denounced as a vile lie by the new york star ledger that uh has been given uh the the lowest rating for dishonesty for pinocchio's by the washington post an ad the 20 or more religious leaders in our district have asked the republicans to take down today an ad that current and former republican elected officials have asked uh to take down um so you know it's it's really vile and nasty stuff it is exactly the kind of of dishonest campaigning that turns off so many voters uh not just in our district but around the country and you know the thing about uh a lie is that it only reveals one thing it reveals the character of the liar and so i'm i don't know a bit puzzled as to why uh my opponent and his supporters continue to double down on this um because it's backfiring on them in a very very big way now let's uh go back to the supreme court thanks absolutely sorry about that um no no worries okay we have karen she has a question about um whether or not there's impeaching bar go ahead karen hey guaranty press the unmute button on your zoom did you want to read the question lisa uh if i can find it hold on sorry folks um you know what let's go to patricia spinner um she has a question about whether we can stop them over on the senate um in the meantime i'll look for karen's question i think patricia has left the meeting oh my goodness all right yvonne shepherd yvonne has a question about tom yvonne wants you to get into trump's mind and figure out his motivation so i'm just preparing you and i'll let her ask the question okay yvonne can you press the amu button can you hear me now yep we can hear you well what i was wondering and i was wondering if there was anything that this could be used um as part of the discourse is i think trump is interested in having a favorable supreme court to him a supreme court that is beholden to him so that when he escalates the lawsuits against him when he loses the presidency which he will he would have a friendly audience in the supreme court is that crazy or don't you think that's the way the man thinks you know if you're asking me to try to get into his head you're asking me to go to a pretty scary place yeah i'm not sure if i if i want to go there um it doesn't matter what his motivation is it's we know it's wrong and again it's not wrong for him to want to nominate supreme court justices who share whatever philosophy he may have but it is wrong to um to just completely throw out the rules um to have a process for appointing supreme court justices that allows one side uh to play by one rule uh and denies the other side the opportunity to do the same thing we all know that that's not fair we know that that's wrong we know that it's incendiary that it's going to intensify our country's partisan divisions we know that it will leave us with a supreme court that more than half of the american people don't even trust anymore and that our system of government can't tolerate that um so again i just keep bringing this back to what what we can do um we have a unique opportunity this is happening at a moment when americans are already starting to vote and so let's make the most of that opportunity and get get to a place where you know in two months we can have a conversation about uh repairing this terror in the fabric of our of our democracy which we will then have the ability to do exactly so we have a lot of work to do for the next six weeks um i'm going to read karen's question to you congressman she asked is there a possibility of congress going through impeachment of william barr process to postpone trump's nominee process you know impeachment is uh it's it's the ultimate tool that the constitution gives us to check abuse of power in between elections because otherwise you know there'd be nothing we could do a president and attorney general could could blatantly abuse their authority violate people's rights and we'd have to wait a year two years three years until the next election to correct it um so that's what impeachment is for we have the great corrective in 43 days so this isn't a time when i'm thinking about using uh the extraordinary tool of uh of impeachment um and i don't i you know i know there's been a lot of speculation in the press about that um but i don't think that that that's real uh again i wouldn't focus so much on trying to stop the senate because um mcconnell has the votes there that became clear absolutely today and if he wants to do something that i think most americans would view as wrong he can but then most americans will have a chance to tell him how we feel about that and again the the the remedy for abuse of power is to take away their power exactly thank you for reminding us that we have the power right uh next question is from beth um lebron chuck she has a question about whether expanding the court would actually lead to more problems go ahead beth well i i happen to be listening to something today where some someone said that having the democrats to try to stop something and frankly we can't stop um threaten that we're going to add to the court now god forbid we should lose um not succeed in gaining the majority of the senate not get the presidency it would be something that the republicans would use to their advantage because at this point i don't feel like anything's off the table so would it be a good message to tell people to sort of not use that as a as a threat against the against republicans yeah i mean look i don't think i i i don't think the threat necessarily if if there's a threat out there i'm not sure if they care because they they want to pack the court that's what they're trying that's what they've been trying to do for the last four years and they're not going to stop doing that because they feel like if they have the power to do it then um that's all that they need they've convinced themselves by the way that the democrats would do the same thing in their shoes that nobody's principled that everybody breaks the rules and that that gives them the the the the excuse that that they need to uh you know to to answer these obvious uh the obvious proof of their inconsistency um so i don't think it matters what we say they're going to do what they're going to do and nor would it matter later on like if republicans retain the majority in the senate i don't think it matters that there are some democrats who floated the idea of expanding the size of the court if that's what they want to do themselves they'll do it um regardless of what we say so i i wouldn't overthink that what i would stress and i continue to stress as you hear me on this call is that right now what we need to focus on is how this affects people's lives um i'm deeply concerned about the process i'm deeply concerned about the institutional legitimacy of the supreme court but the most important thing for all of us and for all of the american people right now is what does this mean for our health care what does this mean for roe versus wade what does it mean for corruption in our politics and i'm going to keep coming back to this we're in the middle of the pandemic the trump administration is trying to take away your health care right now by getting the affordable care act struck down this supreme court without justice ginsburg is likely to strike down the affordable care act and so the choice before the american people is will you elect members of congress who will reinstate the affordable care act who will reinstate protecting people with pre-existing conditions we can do that congress can and will do that if we elect a congress that will protect what the supreme court will no longer protect just as a it's really unrelated but as a follow-up you know lawyers in particular accountants all professionals are subject to rules of ethics i find it quite amazing that justices of the supreme court are not and i feel that that's something that legislatively should be addressed and we know that scalia died being entertained by someone i don't remember the details anymore but at the time i recall thinking that it was inappropriate for him to be accepting any kind of gift from anybody so uh just food for thought on that one yeah i know i i totally agree i i think you know one of the there will be many post trump reforms should the president be voted out of office and making sure that ethics rules including the hatch act apply to the president will be one of them applying those rules to the supreme court makes very good sense to me too again it's in the interest of the supreme court for the judges and the court itself to be seen as legitimate to be trusted by the american people even if we may disagree with a particular decision thank you um next up we have lisa dickholtz she has a question about the aca lisa okay sorry about that yeah actually um i was gonna ask my second question because uh thank you for addressing the aca question my other question is a concern about you know we're stressing um you know the election results and that's a concern of mine um if cong if the senate puts through a new uh supreme court justice and trump as it seems like he is intent on doing um tries to um contest the election results especially if it's not by a large amount and there's a lot of um you know they talk about the red mirage and there's a lot of democratic votes by mail i'm just concerned that he's setting things up and the republicans are setting things up so that the supreme court will rule in his favor on any contested election uh i don't i i think it's going to be very difficult for them to complete this entire [Music] move that quickly and have a new justice actually installed by november 3rd we'll see there are actually very few legislative days in the senate um but again that's that's us sitting here and speculating and worrying about things that we may not be able to control if if you're worried about a closely contested election that gives rise to legal challenges the best way to prevent that is to make sure that it is not a closely contested election and again that is within our power to do and and honestly the issues that this brings forward like again this makes it so stark for people your health care is 100 on the ballot you know i remember at the height of the pandemic people were coming to my office hundreds of people they'd lost their jobs and they were worried about how are they going to keep their health care and and we were we were we were helping people sign up for the affordable care act exchanges we were showing them how to do it because fortunately it exists and fortunately if you lose a job you can enroll anytime can you imagine not not being there and i i think there there was going to be such an outcry just as there was when trump tried to repeal the aca through congress in in 2017 and 2018. there's going to be such an outcry now that this is a real prospect that it's going to drive a lot of people to the polls with that singular issue in mind so i'm sensing a theme here we need to work to make sure that we turn out the vote everywhere is that the point i think you've mentioned it i just want to reiterate it because i i feel like i'm screaming it constantly um we have a question from somebody who sent an email question in she wanted to know where does tom kane stand on roe v wade so um he is uh his record in trenton is uh anti-roe v wade anti-choice in this campaign he has not taken a stand on anything for or against he's hoping to somehow get elected to congress without telling people what he thinks on important issues but fortunately or unfortunately for him he's got a voting record in in trenton and it's been consistently anti-choice he voted repeatedly for example to defund planned parenthood and i that's a very clear difference between us he has his views i respect that but i don't think they are the views of the majority of the voters in our district and particularly at a moment when the the possibility of roe v wade no longer being the law of the land becomes real you know it's easy to be against roe v wade when um there's no real prospect of of any change in the status quo there's no real prospect and uh and and voters are going to want to know what i'm going to do and what he's going to do if this is struck down and it falls to the congress to decide whether uh reproductive rights should still be protected in america and one of the things i think that people fail to realize is that governor christie was the first governor in the country to defund planned parenthood and congressman malinowski's opponent isn't just a senator he is the minority um leader so he controls his caucus and we know what they they allowed christie to so i would assume i don't think he's going to grow a spine between now and then but i could be wrong i'm sorry that's just me um we're going to move on to cynthia she has a question about medicare hi cynthia did you just press the button yep right i did um is there any chance that medicare is in any trouble um i know we're talking about the aca but i'm within striking distance of medicare so that's on my plate i will do everything in my power to protect medicare the democratic house majority is not going to let anything happen to medicare as long as we are able to keep that majority uh there's no doubt that the the previous house majority had it medicare and medicaid on the chopping block you know they they passed the 2017 tax bill which um has led to a huge loss of revenue for the federal government uh adding potentially up to two trillion dollars to the national debt over ten years if we don't do anything about it and their plan they were quite candid about it was to uh compensate for that make up for the lost revenue by by slashing medicaid and and medicare uh we were elected we're not allowing that to happen and we won't allow it to happen so long as uh we we keep our majority good thank you um next question we have is deborah she has a question about she's a laundry list of legislation she'd like to see in the house so debra go ahead could you press the button under zoom hi sorry you want me to ask my question go ahead okay my question was how long would it take uh if the aca is voted down if if um reproductive reproductive right choices are voted down how long would it take for congress to reinstate the aca and abortion choice and come up with some kind of response to citizens united and like the 20 other things that need to be addressed that's a good question um i you know we'd have to i think presumably wait until the new congress is sworn in in early january and of course a lot depends on the makeup of that new congress which is why i keep stressing the importance of the election but if if we had a congress um you know determined to protect uh universal health care we could move very very quickly following any supreme court decision of course we don't know when the decision would come down we know that the court is scheduled to take up the affordable care act case a week after the election that doesn't mean it's going to be decided right away um so you know my guess is we have a new congress in place hopefully one uh that is led by by folks like me who will uh fight to protect our health care and um and i think we then move very very quickly and if we have a president who also supports the affordable care act um we'll pass and sign and have that bill signed uh relatively quickly you know we can't really we can't really write that bill until we know what the decision says um let's assume it's struck down you're going to have to look at the reasoning behind the decision and find a way to work around it through new legislation that uh that provides the same basic protections as the affordable care act we'll we'll figure out how to do it and then we'll do it and the same goes on on roe v wade there has been legislation already introduced that that would effectively legislate the the standard that roe v wade applied and you know so i think we know how to do that and i would certainly strongly support doing it i think we would do it same for something like citizens united uh citizens united is different because um that that would require a constitutional amendment that's that's a supreme court you know that's a decision the court um took on constitutional grounds the the court decided uh that money is speech and therefore protected by the first amendment and uh that corporations are people and therefore they have free speech rights uh under the first amendment so um you know we're um so to overturn that we've always known would require a constitutional amendment i strongly support uh trying to pass one uh there are other things we could do on campaign finance and corruption that that are short of the constitutional amendment uh for for example a bill that you know well the big bill we passed in early 2019 hr one which includes provisions like requiring um the full disclosure of all contributions to all the different pacs and committees that run ads uh trying to influence elections so like all the dumb stupid ads you're seeing in in our district right now that that are funded not mostly by tom kane but by all of these uh national republican super pacs that are trying to get him in there um we would know who the donors are and um be able to follow that money and understand that the lines of influence so that's one important reform that we could pursue even without a constitutional amendment more transparency thank you i believe marianne cowan is up next she has a question about the aca okay can you hear me we can marianne yeah tom you pretty much answered what i had um i'm not sure if you answered this though can the congress reinstate the aca or would they have to develop all new legislation again um they couldn't just reinstate the aca if the aca is struck down okay so we would have to craft new legislation that achieves the same goals including obviously uh protecting people with pre-existing conditions and remember what that means the republicans say they want to do that too what that means is insurance companies would not be able to either deny you insurance or raise your rates because you had a pre-existing condition and every insurance plan would have to cover all of the the the essential benefits um including for example um maternal maternal care which some of these junk plans that the trump administration has been promoting don't uh don't cover um so we'd have to craft something that does that that allows kids to stay on their parents plans uh till they're 25 that provides for medicaid expansion and uh reinsurance programs and and and all the rest uh and and just figure out a mechanism for doing it that works around whatever reasoning the supreme court might use in striking down the existing law and obviously i can't tell you how we'll do that until that case actually comes down and we see the reasoning but i'm confident that we would find a way to do it and heck i want to go beyond the aca like if they want to re they want to reopen this in a way you know bring it on because i want a public option uh i want people to have more choices more freedom in terms of what kind of insurance they they can purchase so we'll i want to do that anyway but this would certainly add to the urgency okay thanks tom thank you marianne um next up we have carol she has a question about geo tv hi tom um i was just wondering in light of so much disinformation and not being able to get out and talk to people directly with covid happening um i was wondering if you could tell us in your opinion what the best way to get out the vote is um you know we have members of my team on this call who i'm sure will want to jump in and and answer this question too it's not it's not rocket science there's not one thing we have to do all of the things unfortunately we cannot do our favorite thing in the way that we did it in 2018 we're not going to be able to knock on every single door in the district 19 times but i hope that you guys have the energy to do that and that we can then uh redirect that energy to all the stuff we can do making phone calls text messages sending postcards um being really active on social media in uh spreading out our message and the necessary pushback to some of the stupidity that voters are going to see on are already seeing on tv um you know just do more of that and at some point we may do more i mean we've talked about doing literature drops uh for example but we'll see what folks are comfortable with um but we have to do all of those things we have to do them every single day uh and repeat repeat repeat repeat and i i know you know i know we have so many fired up supporters who are already doing that and and many more who will be doing it in the final stretch the only other thing i would i would add here is big difference between now and 2018 is that in 2018 most people voted on election day and so those last two weekends everything was building up to that forget out the vote uh this time around most people will be voting well beforehand i think and and get out the vote is now um i i already have my ballot sitting at home um in hunterdon county they've already sent out a lot of them so um whatever we do we gotta be doing it now team do you wanna anybody else wanna chime in yeah i'll chime in here i'll i'll rescue you a little bit so ballots as you some of you know are out um in some of the counties not all of them but they will all be coming out probably this week uh so keep your eye out for that um we have a very robust field program you can sign up and volunteer there if you go to our website and you go to at the top it says take action click on that and you can find a way to jump on a phone bank a text a texting bank and one of the things that we've been doing throughout this has been and we're going to keep doing it is educating voters when we reach them on how to vote by mail so we're not leaving anything up to chance we're gonna we're gonna have all sorts of different ways of reaching voters but right now through the phone calls and through the text messages we are educating voters on how to vote by mail asking them for a plan i know when if you've ever knocked a door you always ask people if they had a plan to vote the plan was usually like yeah i'm gonna go to my polling place it was less important this time it's really very important for people to make for us to make sure that people really understand the steps people should also know that you can [Music] go to our website where it says vote or vbn you can look there and you can find where dropboxes are so there's all different things that we're doing and please along these lines next tuesday night we're going to be having a round table where we're going to be discussing vote by mail and we're actually going to have union county clerk joanne rajapi on the call who's going to be able to go through a lot of answer a lot of questions so please tune in but please please please get go on to our website sign up volunteer um we've got i think we've got the most volunteers in the whole country right now but you know what let's blow that number out of the water um is that true lisa yes i think we have like three more than a woman in virginia and i won't mention her name uh oh i love that i thought you might thank you congressman thank you lisa we aim to win not just one competition but all the competitions yeah i got to be a little competitive to be in this business right um so i guess one last question was from bennett westerman he had a question about what positive actions can we take they left the room oh he left through well tom take us home give us something positive to think about i i find i find that i'm repeating myself a lot and that may not be a bad thing um we are taking positive actions we are doing the very thing that mitch mcconnell is terrified of he's terrified that the citizens of this country not the political donors not the special interests but the citizens who represent the majority of the people of this country who support universal health care who support reasonable gun laws who support doing something about drug prices who support fighting corruption in in our politics who support protecting the post office who think we should be doing more to help people suffering from this economic crisis all of those reasonable things that that most democrats and actually most rank-and-file republicans agree on he's terrified that that majority is actually going to assert itself in a way that that he can't resist and uh you know so let's just do that let's do it on on november 3rd or all the days between now and and november 3rd and let's remember that we all have a part to play i got my part to play um joe biden's got his part to play he can't do it himself every single one of us running for local office has a part to play and then everybody who who volunteers who who gets the word out about about candidates uh who helps us push back against all the stupid disinformation that's out there um we're all doing our part here and uh you know so i i always say if you if you hear something in our race for me that you like get it out there if you see something uh from the other side that that deserves pushback on and boy there's so much material right now uh with all of those editorials and and public statements that i mentioned get it out there to to your networks and do it with confidence do it understanding that the overwhelming majority of americans uh are decent and and want a government that that tells the truth and plays by the rules even if we don't all agree on on on every policy issue and we're going to get that kind of government back on or around november third so that's that's where we are thank you for leaving us on a positive note thank you everyone for coming out

Nicole Iovine the chief epidemia Pepa d me ology officer at US health shann's and dr. William Jack Wis who is a leading emergency medicine doctor we have limited time with some of our guests so I want to make just a brief statement before they present and then we'll we'll have them speak and then we'll take questions again I want to thank you for joining this is an unprecedent moment in our country in a matter of weeks we've seen the spread of the corona virus across the world we've seen it become a global pandemic countries are closing their borders or in quarantines on a massive scale we're being told to stay inside for weeks workers have been laid off or feather ours cut severely business owners have been forced to cut back or shut down their their businesses their stores there indefinitely and Americans are worried about about loss of income worried about paying their mortgage car loans their rent and putting food on the table these are real fears and I think it's legitimate it's important for us to talk about them they're real fears about contracting the virus there are frustrations about the lack of testing and the lack of clarity from government but I just want to I wanted to do this call among other things to just remind us that we're all in this together we we are Americans and we all respond to this crisis we'll take care of one another that means doing our part to stop the spread of the virus and listening to guidance CDC scientists that's or we're going to offer this morning the guidance that says stay home to the extent that you can minimize group gatherings use social distancing maintain good hygiene we can't repeat these often enough but it also means thinking about our neighbors our seniors our friends with compromised health any vulnerable person for whom this virus could be devastating we need to do our part not only to keep ourselves healthy but to keep them healthy and frankly in so many instances to help keep them alive so we've got to do our part so must our government I want to remind everyone as we go on if you want to sign up for our newsletter about the corona virus or if you want to ask a question on this call hit star three we'll get into much more detail about what the government is doing after we hear from from our guests on the call so again I'm immensely grateful that you've taken the time to join us I want to start with our first guest Commissioner freed Commissioner Niki freed has been a real leader in the state's response she's got a lot more to do and we're grateful that given how busy she is and responding to this that she's taking the time to join us so Thank You commissioner freed let me over thanks - Thank You congressman I really thank you for your leadership as well and hosting this town college gets information out I like the congressman said my name is Mickey freed I'm your Commissioner of Agriculture Consumer Services and we're all you know is obviously growing concern over coronavirus but I want everybody to know that we're all in this together and be assured that we are doing everything possible in the state to make sure that you are synched during these challenging times just want to bring everybody up to speed a little bit about what steps that we as Department of Agriculture are taking to minimize the threat of Coba 19:4 car consumers for our businesses and keeping Florida's children fed during some of these school closures we regulate about 40,000 grocery stores markets convenience stores gas stations across the entire state and so we have sent some guidance to them over the last couple weeks to make sure that they are using best practices to reduce also the spread of the virus some of the letters that we've told them that we sent out is the police provide sanitary wipes to clean the keypads and nozzle handles like gas stations as well as shopping carts and ambassador handles at grocery stores we also sent out another letter up to our gas stations saying that you run out of hand sanitizer so please try to provide gloves these are just two places that millions of people across the state go to every single day we also reminding businesses that all employees must comply with state rules for hand washing before in a preparing food handling raw food and touching garbage this is typical normal standard procedures we just need to remind them even to be even more cautious and careful during these times but it also goes for the consumers in the individuals make sure that you're disinfecting your common surfaces you're cooking foods to your recommended temperatures you're regularly washing your hands and sanitizing them one of our biggest responsibilities that we have in the state is that we oversee and help fund 1.3 billion dollars in school lunch program which serves over 2 million of our kids serving over 245 million free reduced lunches every single year and so it is our job to make sure that even during these school closures that we are ensuring that our kids have meals available so we activated a week and a half ago our summer breaks website our call center and just this week our text lines help families find where they can receive nad scream meals for children during the koba 19 school closures and that's for all kids 18 and under are regardless if you are already part of the school breakfast Douce breakfast and lunches we want to make sure that every every child 18-under has access to these free meals so we're also saying that if you need to find these locations you can first do it by texting us at SL kids meals to two one one two one one so again that's sending a text at Q 1 1 - 2 1 1 and in the body of the text is FL kids meals or you can also call for a live operator 24 hours a day 7 days a week and that's by dialing to 1 1 or if you're by a computer or going on your cell phones you can go to our website which is summer break spot dot fresh in Florida comm we also have over 1 million low sodium emergency meals for seniors for community group distribution and just everybody needs to be rest assured I have been in constant communication not only with Publix and their CEO but also all of our ad producers across the state and I can assure everyone that there is a food supply and that our food supply chain is steady so there's no need to go to the food store and hoard foods all student is making it harder for elderly and those that are compromised so we're seeing all of the the news all across the state and I'm sure you all have gone to the grocery stores and seen some of the empty shelves but no that's just because everybody wiped them out that day but there will be food again they've increased the amount of trucks that there have going out from two deliveries to 6 to 8 deliveries a day so they are really keeping up with the demand as much as possible but also showing why they're closing down earlier so they can just restock and also announced this week that Publix is having a 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. hour for all seniors and those that are have compromised immune system so please take advantage of those times if you're in that 65 plus bracket to go use that the Publix one our store it's really important I've also been in touch with the FDA and all of our scientists at the Department of Agriculture tell everyone no food is safe that there is no evidence that kovat is actually transmitted from foods but always you know make sure you're washing your fruits and vegetables it's always a good habit - regardless of this outbreak and also for the seniors these again take advantage of these extra shopping hours that some of our stores are having so from South Florida and beyond we're in this together and every step along the way so if you want additional up-to-date information on some of the other things that we're doing some of our emergency orders on any of our licenses and fees and registrations that we just put out yesterday please follow us on either on Facebook or Twitter at FX or you can go online which is SD a CS gov thank you again for your leadership congressman and I will turn it back over to you thank you very much i Commissioner freed and we're grateful for all that you've been doing not only in your capacity as as commissioner addressing all of these these issues that matters so much and ensuring that there's access to food and making sure that people get the nutrition they need but also in working with with the others in Tallahassee and so many other ways as well and that's actually a good jumping-off point for what I wanted to talk about next and I'm going to talk about what we've been working on in Washington but it's important for everyone to understand that just as commissioner freed is busy working with the governor and Democrats and Republicans in Tallahassee Congress has been working together to address these issues I've been in contact with leadership in Congress but also with leadership also with leadership at in the Senate and we've been in communication with the White House as well we really are all in this together so let me just take a moment to walk through some of the things that we've done two weeks ago we voted to approve eight point three billion dollars in funding to support coronavirus response that included close to a billion dollars for state and local health agencies about a billion dollars for medical supplies and preparedness measures at community health centers we'll talk more about that in a few minutes also more than three billion dollars for research and development of vaccines that money is being toute even as we speak this week the President signed a second bill which will provide free testing for coronavirus paid emergency leave enhance unemployment benefits a billion dollars in food assistance and food security and additional funding into Medicaid and we can talk in greater detail about any of those as we go forward next is is what we're going to be doing hopefully in the week ahead Congress clearly is not done this week committee leaders worked on a stimulus package to help mitigate the health and economic damage that this crisis is causing there are going to be a lot of businesses large and small every business large and small I has been is being hurt by the impact of this virus in South Florida major industries like the airlines and cruise lines and hospitality and entertainment industries have already been hard-hit we've seen that throughout the community but small businesses especially are feeling the pinch we've seen sales drop they've had to make really difficult decisions about their employees and it it is frankly still early in our response so these are the lifeblood workers and industries of South Florida's economy and Congress isn't going to forget them and and as we move forward I just wanted to stake out a few things that I think need to be in the bill that that we have going forward that we're working on one I think it's critically important that that we provide resources to every American every American struggling to pay bills put food on the table and make ends meet because of all these closures and weather and we're still working there's still a negotiation on what that amount should be and how long those payments should continue I think at this point we need to advocate for for the higher numbers that we've been reading about and that we shouldn't just do this for a 30-day period it's going to take longer people going to feel the pain longer than that and and we should acknowledge that in the legislation that we are trying to pass in the next week we need protections for people who can't afford to make mortgage payments car payments student loan payments no one should have to fear foreclosure when they've been forced from their jobs because they're doing what the government has told them to do to help stay safe and prevent this spread so there's a lot more cover let me let me also briefly run through some national and statewide guidance that we should be following and I want to offer some resources so I want to encourage everyone as as jason has already pointed out I would encourage people to visit our website for these resources joyce house.gov slash coronavirus or usa.gov slash coronavirus there is also really important guidance from the CDC I would encourage people to to check out that guidance that you do it from our website or from the CDC's but the CDC is recommending that everyone stay home as much as possible that there be no gatherings of more than 10 people that that no one visit nursing homes or assisted living facilities and that there'd be no discretionary travel I think it's important for everyone to remember that I want to talk about testing because we've gotten a lot of calls to the office about that it has taken far too long to make testing available I think we all acknowledge that still our testing capacity and availability is is way behind and I am concerned that we're not testing enough now I've heard from the Florida Department of Emergency Management that the state is increasing its capacity there are now some drive-through testing sites in Broward and Palm Beach County but CDC's testing requirements still make it harder to get tested unless you're at high risk so we need to test more that's going to help us slow the virus recent studies have shown the virus spreads from infected people even if they don't know they have symptoms so testing will will highlight how many people already have the virus but that's also why we're closing schools and I think the governor did the right thing in closing schools I think we need to we needed to cancel events we've got a practice social distancing when in public all of this is vital to slowing the spread of the virus I think the decision to in Palm Beach and Broward and Dade County to close restaurants and beaches was the the right decision it's really hard for the people who have been impacted especially especially so many of our hourly workers who are really getting hammered that gets back to what Congress is doing and why Congress needs to act as fast as as we can to get assistance out to them but I think the decisions were right because they can help slow the spread of the virus I want to talk about protective gear for a second I spoke to the Trump administration this week to advocate for for Florida's request for more medical supplies more protective gear I want to use this as an opportunity to acknowledge and to thank and I know everyone on this call joins me in thanking the doctors and nurses and physician assistants and home health aides and every medical provider who is on the frontlines in this battle we need to make sure that they have the protective gear they need especially especially the masks and we're working hard to make sure that they do worry about closures as I alluded to before yesterday the governor issued several executive orders to close down non-essential venues where people congregate there are - there is now community spread in South Florida that means it's more important than ever to stay away from public places to avoid catching the virus now grocery stores and pharmacies and gas stations and convenience stores may remain open and I think what Commissioner freed referenced and in the earlier hours for for seniors for people who are compromised to have act the groceries is important and we need to respect that in the meantime theatres gyms and beaches have been closed and as I said I think that was the right decision next on the economic stimulus the impact of the response is severe I talked about what Congress is working on to provide direct cash assistance the amount is still under negotiation I strongly support the plan there are plans like the ones from congressman Kennedy of Massachusetts to offer cash assistance increase unemployment insurance payments and and fortify critical safety nets like Medicaid his plan would give a middle-class family of four twelve thousand dollars annually I am supportive of ensuring that we don't have to go back and deal with this on a two-week basis or weekly basis I think Congress should act now to protect people for the foreseeable future as we as we take strong action to stop the spread of the virus sick leave full-time employees are now guaranteed eighty hours of paid time off to quarantine to seek preventive care and to receive treatment full-time employees will get 80 hours of paid time off up to two-thirds of their regular pay to care for a family member of a child and employers will pay these expenses upfront but will be reimbursed by the federal government within three months and I'm going to talk a little bit later about all of the ways that businesses small businesses will be helped so that they can also help their employees disaster loans is one of those all the business owners on our call I encourage to visit Florida disaster loan dot org that's Florida disaster loan org or disaster loan dot SBA that's Small Business Administration disaster loan sba.gov for more information about loans available to them on the issue of foreclosures and evictions those will be suspended currently on all home loans insured by federal housing authority Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac we need to do more and we're working to ensure that the legislation we passes we we'll cover all mortgages on taxes I want to make sure everyone saw the news heard the news that the deadline for filing your taxes and paying what you owe has been delayed to July 15th no one should have to worry about about repercussions of not paying taxes or trying to finish their tax returns while they're complying with with all of this guidance to help stay safe so that was the right decision by the Treasury Department for veterans were working to ensure that VA providers have the necessary equipment that that they need that veterans can waive co-payments for medical visits and that housing benefits aren't affected for student veterans there's there's much more on for veterans that we're trying to include in the legislation we're working on I want to talk about travel for a moment again all to ensure people are up-to-date the State Department has issued a global level for travel advisory meaning that US citizens are advised to avoid all international travel and I've been I've been working throughout to keep people up to date on on these issues as I said before we've also been working closely with local officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties mayors and county commissioners state leaders like Commissioner freed and our director of Emergency Management Jared Moskowitz who happens to come from our district both of them from from from South Florida and I want to remind everyone just as I walked through all these that if you like to ask a question or get more information about how to access any of this information just hit star three as as this call continues so I want to say one last thing before I turn it over to dr. Iovine and then we'll come back for questions after our two speakers there have been there's been a lot of in this crisis there have been stories about people who have tried to take advantage of this terrible moment we're in and profit from it and whether it's people dressed in white coats saying they're from the CDC trying to cheat people into paying them to have tested they can't administer or hoarders or price gougers or people who who have come in to buy up the supply of surgical masks in all of those cases we have been in contact with the law with law enforcement I spoken to the attorney general's office no one should profit from what we've seen in the Justice Department and our state attorney general ashley moody are both involved in looking to stop this kind of awful behavior and finally before turn it over to dr. Iovine there has there has been as as we've gone through this there have been so many examples of really good behavior and I just I want to take a moment to thank the businesses like chambers distillery in our district that converted their production they're no longer producing vodka they're now making hand sanitizer there are others other businesses who have reached out to me and our colleagues who want to turn over it are in the process of turning over their own businesses to make sanitizer to make surgical masks to make ventilators and and I would encourage anyone who has ideas on how you can be helpful to also reach out to us press 3 provide that information to us and we're grateful finally for all of the people who have stepped up to give blood to give money to recognize that as challenging as this is for all of us some of us are hurt even more than others and and we're grateful to everyone who has done that we're going to make more information available about resources that you can turn to for help and resources that you can turn to if you are in a position to provide assistance to others who need it so thanks again everyone for joining and next I want to turn it over to dr. Nicole Iovine she's the chief epidemiology officer University of Florida Health System who will provide an update about the spread of corona virus in Florida efforts to slow the spread and what we can expect in the coming weeks and months dr. I mean thanks so much for joining us Thank You congressman and thank you for the opportunity to help give information to all of your constituents so the corona virus I just want to make a clarification about terminology people will probably see a lot of websites a lot of news things that refer to it as a Ovid and kovat is just a shorthand way of saying coronavirus disease so I'm going to use that term as I talked about this business corona virus so so kovat is caused by carota viruses part of a large family of other viruses this one is special because it is one that had never been seen before so it probably came from animal and animal we don't know which animal it is and when it made the jump into humans and then spread it is causing this large outbreak because this particular corona virus has never before been seen so right now in the state of Florida we have over 560 confirmed cases of Koated of those cases we are able to identify that about 350 of the or so of those persons had a known risk factor meaning that we know that they travel from somewhere where Co vyd is in an outbreak State or they had close contact with somebody who was known to have coded that means that there is around 215 or so for whom we don't know how they contracted the virus and that's why we know that there is community spread going on it's one thing to know that somebody was on a cruise and contracted the corona virus but when people in the community develop it and we don't know how they got it that means that the virus is spreading in the community from contacts of contacts of contacts in that way so the way it spreads this virus is like many other respiratory virus days meaning that it spreads primarily when an infected person coughs or sneezes whenever that happens droplets are produced these are microscopic droplets that are produced and they can travel in the air for about six feet after about that distance though they all to the ground so that's why we tell people to practice social distancing and maintain six feet or more away from others because that's really as far as these respiratory droplets can travel so that's the basis for that but the other way that this virus can be transmitted is by contaminating surfaces so for example if someone were to cough and they covered their coughs with their hand and shook somebody else's hand that can transmit the virus also if someone were to cough while sitting at a table for example and those respiratory droplets got on the table the next person who sits there who touches the table could then contaminate themselves if they touch their face or their eyes or their mouth with that hand so that's the reason why we have our guidance about how you can protect yourself from getting infected with the Pirotta virus so we are encouraging people to practice frequent hand hygiene and what hand hygiene means either you wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or you use an alcohol based hand sanitizer which contains at least 60% alcohol in it that's very important that's what hand hygiene means also we are encouraging people to try to be aware of how often they're touching one space because we do that actually hundreds of times a day and so if you are touching your your eyes or your nose or your mouth you could be contaminating your hand and then transmitting the infection to someone else so we ask that you try to as much as you can be aware of touching your hands touching your on your eyes or your face also when you do coughs or sneeze we ask that you cover your cough or sneeze in one of two ways either call into the crook of your elbow or if you have a tissue available to cover your cough or sneeze use that tissue and then immediately dispose of it and then perform hand hygiene either wash your hands or use the alcohol sanitizer and then finally also I mentioned that your system becomes contaminated so it's a great idea to clean these surfaces as often as you can with your normal household cleaners this coronavirus is killed pretty easily by usual household cleaners so that's a really good idea that you make an effort to clean those sorts of surfaces so in the coming weeks and months I can tell you that we do expect to see more cases of Kovach in in Florida and across the nation as well I want to point out though that that does not mean that all of our containment efforts are is working because what it really means is that if we did nothing no containment measures no social distancing we would see industry ordinary number of cases however all of the containment measures we are doing at the personal level social distancing for example at the local level closing schools for example and at state in its federal level all of these efforts are slowing the spread of the virus so I just want to be really clear that as we see the number of cases increase that that does not mean that our efforts aren't working what it really means is that we are slowing the spread of the virus compared to whether we had done nothing we call this flattening the curve you might have heard this statement used before and that simply refers to if the number of cases is increasing rapidly over time but then we do things to lower that number of cases that curve of increasing cases if you are looking at a graph for example that curve would become lower and flatter so I want to also just transition now to about treating coded there is no specific antiviral treatment that we know to treat coated so I want to really emphasize that when somebody is sick with Kovac most people can stay at home and get better on their own for people that are have a poor more severe disease and are in the hospitals hospitals are providing what we call supportive care and what that means is patients get extra oxygen they get extra intravenous fluids they get medications to manage their temperature things like that but there is no specific and divert --all medication there are a number of medications that are undergoing investigations to see if they may have activity against the corona virus but right now we do not have a specific antiviral so with that I will stop and I'm happy to answer questions as as they come in great great thank you very much dr. irenan Jason I'll turn it back to you in one second I just wanted it to chime in again doctor I mean thank you for that that really helpful and factual and science-based presentation it's exactly the kind of of thoughtful information that's necessary right now appreciate that secondly before we move on to the next speaker I also wanted to just take a moment I know I talked about health care workers before and making sure that they have the all the protection that they need the same thing is true for our first responders who are who put their lives on the line for us every day in the work that they do we have to make sure that they have the personal protective equipment that they need to do their jobs in the midst of this coronavirus we're grateful to what they do and we're working hard to make sure that they have the equipment that they need I spoke with Broward sheriff a couple of days ago to make sure that they do and then finally before we move on I also wanted to just take a moment I know I talked about the conversations that I've had that the cooperation between Commissioner freed and director Moskowitz and the governor's office and the White House I also just want to specifically thank all of the the mayors and County Commissioners and city commissioners and who are on the call and and who are working to in their own local communities to help address this crisis there their information your information in providing it to us is critical and for those of you who were out ahead of really trying to to make sure that people know what this threat is and take action just stop the spread I want to thank you it means a lot to our communities to have good elected officials like you doing this work I'll turn it back to you Thank You congressman we will now hear from dr. William J Quist the president of the American College of Emergency Physicians Thank You congressman thank you Jason it's a it's a privilege to be here and I look for all these opportunities to try to do what I can to well tell you about the work that we're doing in emergency medicine but also help you understand how particularly on the front end of all of these and I would include as the congressman congressman did all of the first responders in this discussion as well because it certainly starts in our communities with them and then as they come through the hospitals as as they come to us the American College of Emergency Physicians has about 38,000 members in 53 chapters that would include a ABC a government services chapter in Puerto Rico so we do have a good sense of what's going on I am an emergency physician and I also live and work in South Florida so I'm speaking not only from this national perspective but also the local perspective just to get started I think you know some idea from from the health system and emergency physicians perspective on on what's at home what you can treat at home and when to seek treatment specifically because there's always those questions you know the emergency department is kind of be always open place where you can come and get seen if you are ill or injured but in these points in time we certainly want to make sure that those of you who might have minor illness don't use the emergency department so that we can focus on those who are more sick but also your your visit there with you your family could potentially expose you to those who are sick in those departments and to start I think if your symptoms are minor as you've heard mild cough or fever or shortness of breath and you're generally healthy you should first notify your physician and just get some guidance from there about what you should do certainly certainly if you are sick if you feel more sick than just mild shortness of breath mild fever those things we are available for you to take care of you that would also I would say include those who might have underlying health problems like lung disease and certainly those who are more elderly or have more significant medical diseases those should certainly be seen pretty quickly in a in a hospital setting so that we can start to even even though it is supported in terms of testing the congressman mentioned this fairly I talked about this fairly well at this point we are limited in our testing in the easy if people come there we will only test those who are looking as though they are going to be admitted to the hospital and have more significant illness a wean there are not at this point testing those who have mild symptoms so it took there for that reason they just end up with you turned away and in addition that test can take a significant amount of time it's not something that comes back immediately so you wouldn't get a result at that point in time anyway I am very happy to see that there are testing sites that are being developed that certainly really helps a lot I echo the congressman's comment on testing it does allow us and understand or within the community that I saw it also helps at the end of this all of our public health officials decide what the actual course of disease is and how we can sort of monitor who has it who has mild symptoms and who's not but at this point time there is no limitation in testing and so I would refer you to those alternative sites of course to be screened and then determine if they're able to test you one I think may have hope on the horizon there is an analyzer that is now coming to our country that may be able soon to do more rapid testing so certainly you won't find out as we know when that's true the presence of protective equipment is a key key point with all of us who provide this this care at this point in time across the country and I would echo that also in South Florida or in Florida there is not a ample supply in fact there is a limited supply we still are able in most of our places in South Florida to get the equipment we need but it is it is at this time even sort of in a ration status and supplies are limited we also do hope that as we look to at the federal level that shortly we'll see other companies that will change their production to produce these types of masks and we will have more of those masks available to our health care workers because they're certainly pleading for that across the country one distinction I think too is that those surgical masks are the first line are as you've heard our n95 line is when we go from that six foot distance into more context and therefore are more at risk of spread of the virus and so they're very necessary for us as health care workers to be able to have that lessened level of mask do things about that I guess to add one is that certainly we are asking for that so that we can be protected but the other piece is that those of us who are exposed without protection than going to quarantine that does have a tremendous burden on the health care system for all of those people involved whether it's both first responders or nurses anybody within the hospital setting in our positions when we go on quarantine it's 14 days then without a position there to help take care of that that burden of disease right now we have the capacity to do that but if this continues it will certainly put a challenge on our capacity so it's very important that those masks get to us both a certain capacity in 95s and our other people who are providing for health care of it this quite a lot of this also is why it's so important to call your health provider first we want to make sure that all of these resources that are somewhat limited are used for that care of disease and for the care and protection of our healthcare workers and first responders calling your health care provider help give you guidance not only on your own care but potentially where the resources are currently available for things that you might be so please make sure you're contacting your health care providers first and I will end with echoing some of the things you've heard already in terms of what we expect to see in the coming weeks and months we are certainly seeing an increase in reported cases I would also of course state that when we see those reported cases that reflects those who are tested and those who come back with the result we've already heard discussion on community spread and we all know that there is more disease in our communities and we are able to account for and it is hard for you in almost every article and news article the disease count is reported both nationally and internationally and I know you follow all those statistics but it really is not always a reflection of disease and communities that is why as others have echoed it's tremendously important that we get as far ahead of this disease as we can so that we don't spread the disease we also I would also like of the fact that we don't necessarily look at this as a prevention of disease over the long time it's very contagious disease it is being able to have the resources available to be able to take care of those who are most sick in our hospitals as you've heard ventilators all of those things beds and to do that we need to be able to space this out and that's what flattened the curve does involve for all of us I would just mention one more thing because I think the you know the question the real protection will come from a vaccine but we also know that that's quite a long time away and so we have some time for this to be truly preventable by a vaccine therefore we have to spread all of this out so that we can care for those people who meeting our hospitals and our healthcare systems while we work on that so with that I'll stop and I will turn it back to you Jason there any questions thank you very much dr. Jaquith we will now begin our questions and answer portion again please hit star 3 to ask a question or to sign up for the congressman's newsletter the first question comes from mr. Robert Kellerman of Margate sir Kellerman yes um the lack of mass to get anything is that going to be able to be gotten by personal people because I have terrible lung condition thanks for the question mr. Kellerman I there is a the issue of masks is critical I appreciate you bringing it up I'm going to I'm going to back up first and and tell you that I there have been we've been in communication with the Department of Emergency Management in Tallahassee on the issue of masks they have a they have a big order a big order that is in the goal is to ensure that that the that everyone who needs a mask can get one that means that our health care providers need to get them it also means that high-risk people should also be able to get them and I there are I know there are efforts underway to make sure that we get them out dr. Jaquith let me actually go back to you I didn't have a chance let me thank you again let me thank you for your your thoughtful and measured presentation really helpful but if I could ask you about guidance for high-risk individuals and an access to masks yeah sure thank you I think one of the one of the things I'd mentioned up front is the difficulties we have right now are we talking and even if you look at the CDC as they talk about this there is the desired state we all would like to live in and there is the same where things start to be a little more scarce and certainly what I would say is that with people with lung disease of those more at risk mask should be a part of what you have on the other hand at this point in time as we sort of work to make more supply of those it is difficult to assure you that you would get one just like we struggled sometimes in all of our hospitals my my so my recommendation first to you is doing what I know you're doing which is that social distancing piece it's incredibly important for those of you who have those types of illnesses to avoid sickness and that's true at any time but certainly right so that first level is that social distancing that's occurred of and also that involves anybody who's a family member acquaintance will approach the house this is why we talk about this you can certainly have less symptoms would carry that disease so it's very important that the social distancing occur I do believe I do believe that at every level whether it's our private health care systems whether it's our public systems they have absolutely heard from all of us that the issue of masks it's highly critical for all of our communities including our health care workers I do believe that you know I don't have the same access of course I come to Congress is that congressman does but I was on a white house called probably about a week ago and this is one of the things all of the medical leadership mentioned is we need more of this so I would say mr. kalin keep keep in touch with all of us in terms of watching those things and the sources that might help you understand when is the best to get access cuz we do believe you should have one right now they're in a very difficult supply and I stuff this is dr. Iovine I just want to add a comment now too about masks is that having a mask I want people to be cautious not to get a false sense of security if you do have a face mask because remember the virus can still be transmitted if you have it on your hands and you touch your eyes or you touch your nose for example so actually wearing a face mask is not nearly as important right now as socially distancing and performing hand hygiene and thank you thank you both and Jason before we go to the next question let me just also thank mr. kellerman highlight what the doctors just said about about social distancing which I'm sure mr. Kellerman you're doing making sure that particularly someone who is compromised is is going out of your way this is true for everyone to avoid contact with others even people who who don't have symptoms because they could be carriers and finally I assure you that in my next conversation with the state about the delivery of masks that there are some guidance put out by the state about where the mass are going and what the plan is to provide masks for people who are most at risk in the community as well so I'm really glad you brought that up thank you and Jason next question please you very much our next question comes from mr. Steven and he says of Boca Raton good morning Ted thank you for the call hello yes please thanks um thank you Jason are you there have we yes mr. Fenton's still there okay we will move on to the next caller we have you know Abby McGregor Delray Beach a hi good morning everyone thank you so much for doing do some business and the device needs for doing and it's Nicole I have am I actually myself have anything nothing they're not know already knows just in the past for a week so I've been quarantined but I have no information I've been searching for information and what you how do you how do I find that if if I'm no longer contagious they said I do have it as a mild symptoms when is a period that I can say okay and pasta and I'm safe to continue doing the social distancing and all the guidance but not have the virus that's one and one of the things in second I have other people calling they should say if I don't have insurance what was what they do what do I go if I do have the virus and third I was just meeting as a business owner a some suggestion that I believe was solved some order a community so I have already which gives you that your information to submit that or again thank you for doing this thank you very much thanks for the questions I'll I'll take up the issue of the small small business and and what you can do after we take up the your medical questions and since we have two esteemed health medical doctors on the call to experts let me defer to them on on how to handle this and if if you have it if you're sick if you have symptoms timing for all of that dr. Jaquith and dr. Ivan I'm sorry I had to come off mute but just out on my part my driving I I think in terms of the you mentioned where where to go if you do not have insurance and certainly if you're ill if you're severely are obviously you will come to the emergency department be seen there I think the the other piece that's coming that will be very helpful is especially for those people who are symptomatic is the alternative testing centers so as you heard at the front end of this they're just kind of being stood up and Broward the Palm Beaches and that probably is the source for the the testing piece of this in terms of the social distance you know probably for that to duck I applied but certainly when you have symptom free there there's still some days a time where you can you can pass on the virus and so it's not at the end of symptoms it does require a little more time and that's it to be symptom free so that you can go into other sort of a and not consider passing it on yes hi this is doctor auditing certainly while you're coughing and sneezing is really important that you practice social distancing because you can easily be spreading the virus once you stop coughing and sneezing though it is a good idea to continue to socially distance for another three days or so because you will probably you may still be having the virus inside of you and you could be transmitting yet for example on your hands if you touch your face for example something like that I would echo again though I would echo though again that the alternative testing centers would be a good resource for you and thank you very much for those for those responses let me also chime in first on on the cost of testing the legislation that Congress passed the President signed provides that no one have to pay to be tested and in terms of actually how to get tested yes you can the CDC guidelines lay out the guidance for testing but people can call as dr. Jake was that people can call their physician if they have one they can call the community that the Public Health Department in the county if they want some guidance or for these new facilities that are being set up they can call the people who are running those and we'll have more information on that the ones in Broward one by Memorial on my guard health while my Cleveland Clinic but we'll we'll provide that information as well as far as the assistance to small businesses at this point I would encourage all business owners to to go to Florida disaster loan org that's where you can find information about state disaster loans those bridge loans are up to 50,000 or $100,000 in certain circumstances at that again is Florida disaster loan Florida disaster loan org Florida disaster dot biz bi z is for business damage assessment surveys that's also worth checking out and I would strongly encourage small businesses to go to disaster loan dot SBA for Small Business Administration Clark at just disaster loan dot sba.gov for the federal disaster loan program those loans of up to two million dollars are available I would strongly encourage you to check that and then finally I would also point out that the I just remind you as I said earlier I know people are coming on and off the call the legislation that we're working on now provides additional support for small businesses will provide additional support for small businesses but for right now I strongly encourage people to check out those sites both at the state and at the federal level and to reach out to our office with additional questions as well Jason why don't we take the next question great the next caller is Richard Schwartz from Pompano Beach hi can you hear me I can hear me talking yes Richard yes oh yeah the question I have is concerning this concept of coronavirus in the past couple couple of decades we've seen three three of them and what's to stop just another one appearing why suddenly is this is this coronavirus appearing and has it appeared in the past and just fizzled itself out and that's the first question and why is this is it just that our analytical ability is better than it was before ah that's the first part of it cause it's second part of the question which I really can't get my brain around is if we all self quarantine role in our homes and we stay there let's say for a month and we come out and will that make the corona virus disappear it will be a rule it all start up again um I just can't picture how that's going to work that's really um where I'm at I don't is it possible to create a vaccine that looks at the corona virus some kind of um something on the corona virus that's common to all corona viruses and and could stop this group in the future that's basically a mess and I'd like you to thoughts on that force thank you thank you for the question and thank you for reminding us that even as we're focused on on the immediate needs there is a bigger question about what happens after and going forward and and I would we certainly there's concern about re-emergence but I'm going to defer to doc driving address issues stop driving yes these are fantastic questions and I think you should join our epidemiology team because these are great great questions and these are things we're thinking about now I can tell you that we have had as you point out a number of other ad waves due to other coronaviruses I think you were alluding to stars that was several maybe nineteen twenty years ago and then more recently there was MERS also these are all corona viruses and so I don't think there's anything special about corona viruses causing outbreaks but you're correct this has happened this is the third time we've had a corona virus causing an outbreak the reason I think the reason that and many experts are saying the same thing about why this is happening is that the way our society is structured is is such that we are so much more connected now than we were 30 40 years ago so if you remember when stars happened there was one person who who contracted it in Hong Kong and then got on a plane and went to Canada and it spread overnight from one country to the next so that's part of the reason that these things are spreading so much more because we are truly a global community now I think you asked a really really insightful question also about what if everybody were social existence for a month and in that sort of that sort of scenario yes there would be no the corona virus outbreak would be extinguished because it is transmitted from person to person at this point so if there was some magical way that we could do that yes the outbreak would be completely extinguished obviously that's not possible so the social distancing is still a really important tool though to flattening the curve as we've been talking about if I could can't do that if you don't mind congressman be the there are many coronaviruses that are be not that are fairly benign some of the cold you get are also coronaviruses but I would also point I think to the issue with influenza you're certainly more familiar with influenza and vaccination for influenza and there are different variants that come out of influenza and when we when we circulate those influenza viruses through the system there are some years where we are exposed to a new one and there is more of an outbreak of disease but even at influenza which every year has a vaccine which comes around every year we see a tremendous amount of disease in our communities of influenza of varying severity most of the time it is that some of us have you mean immunity and therefore there's less spread or there vaccination therefore there's less spread but even that is hard to target and that comes around every year because of all of the genetic variations if you will in those particular strains of influenza which also happened with corona virus I guess the other thing I would say as the the other difficulty is as you've seen these tend to circulate around the world so even if all of a sudden all of America stayed in their houses and we which would be fantastic from a disease point of view but even if we did it's likely going to be in Europe going through South America going through Africa and all of those pieces so planning the curve as we talk about it it's sort of giving us time as well to work on those potential pieces that if and when this comes around again will make it much less severe one would be a vaccine there would be also medications that might mitigate or slow down the disease process make it less severe as that circulates around the world and potentially comes back again in another year will be way more prepared for it in that point in time and one more piece of this I guess is what you said about you know what do we do we certainly are also looking for that bright light when we are thinking about this in the past tense but what happens unfortunately at times is as these things go through our communities there is a big big ramp up but we forget all those things when we leave them in terms of how we might prevent that next one and I think as physicians as emergency physicians who are heavily involved with emergency preparedness you know those aspects in that debriefing if you well as we turn to recovery and look at as our epidemiologist will also do dramatically we look at those things that we could do to prevent those things from coming around again or to be a little bit more reactive to them will certainly be very very important dr. Jaquith thank you very much and to you too dr. i'veeen and thank you for that a really important question we're past 11 o'clock but I would love to continue on we have another couple of questions we have I want to thank the thousands of people who have who have logged on to the call and I hope everyone has found the information particularly from the experts as helpful as I have Jason why don't we go ahead to the next question our next caller is mr. John Guzman Oh from Margate hi congressman we had two questions one was about to see how funds into stimulus if it could be expedited through select deposits and most people if that was a viability to make sure they can get it the funds as soon as possible and secondly to see if they would be more testing in North Broward I know they started with Pembroke Pines yesterday I sure Thanks thanks very much for the question on the the issue of the stimulus I've said on the call a couple times and I just want to restate the importance of making sure that we have direct cash assistance and that we do it in in a way that will get it out as fast as possible the answer to your specific question is yes I believe it should be direct deposit checks from the IRS is another option the problem obviously is not everyone can deposit checks from home I think few people can we're trying to encourage people to stay home direct deposit is the way to get out the fastest and the most most efficiently so I agree with you we don't we don't have that yet the bigger issue is that that whatever we do whether it's direct positive checks that it be done with the at the highest amount that we can agree on and that we can do it as quickly as possible direct deposit in a bill a month from now isn't going to help we need to do it and and we need to do it within the next week so that's that's that question on the second on your second question about testing there is testing and again we're putting these resources up there's testing in Pompano that is coming online and we'll have more information on that Broward health is is setting that up at festival flea market they're going to be able to do up to 300 tests per day and and there's a phone number that requires appointments also Broward Broward Health can be reached at 95 four three two oh five seven three zero and again as long as we're mentioning it the drive-through in Weston is being administered by the Cleveland Clinic you can reach out to them at nine five four six five nine five nine five one and the one in Pembroke Pines is being run by Memorial Health Care and that one I don't think I have a phone number for but certainly you can get or you can check online there's also talk of doing a larger drive-thru at the parking lot at Dolphin Stadium and so we're that's not happened yet but obviously there'll be a lot of publicity about that when it does and I think that response to that question thanks very much for proposing it Jason why don't we take the at the last question okay our last question is from Judy Schneider from Deerfield Beach yes hi I'm very happy to see that there is some funding coming and I thank you so much for that the Florida disaster loan org with the emergency bridge loan program the only problem in the question that I have to you is that once you go into the eligibility requirements the whole not-for-profit sector has been left off religious organizations which are closed nonprofit arts organizations which have stopped presenting and educational organizations which are closed have been left out of this completely so I'm asking you or to please advocate on our behalf and that just to let you know we're hurting too and we need some funding and I thank you for hearing my question Judy thank you very much I am I am I actually am a strong advocate for for nonprofits and cultural institutions and museums and and so I would draw your attention to two things one I will first I'll follow up on the the state loan side it's a it's a good point I'm glad you raised it nonprofits are covered by the SBA loans by the economic injury disaster loans that program has been activated businesses and nonprofits can receive up to two million dollars in financial assistance to help cover debts and payroll and another bill so again I would I would encourage you to take a look at at that SBA website which is disaster loan dot sba.gov and finally I will tell you I had a conversation just yesterday with the with the drafters of the legislation in this case the the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to ensure that our cultural institutions nonprofits and museums are included in the next package are a lot of our nonprofits are being hit twice first because they're dealing with the challenges that that were all the other businesses are dealing with and that they're shut down and it's hard for for people too hard for them to be able to pay their employees but second because they rely so heavily on contributions there they're going to get hit again when the impact this has had on our economy means that they're unable to generate the resources they need I raise that specific point yesterday to try to provide some direct assistance to those institutions in the next bill that comes out I appreciate you bringing it up it's it's really important and finally it's now almost 20 after 11 one last thing religious organizations and nonprofits can also go get help from from FEMA so SBA and I would encourage taking a look at FEMA it's now about 20 after I know we said we were going to go to 11 and people have don't may not want to be beyond this call all day but know please know that I'm available my office is available if you hit star 3 you can sign up for our newsletter where we're sending out information timely information about this you can also reach out with

that that we're here to help make sure that your concerns and voices get raised at whatever level they need to so you can call the office you can leave a voicemail also with your question if we didn't

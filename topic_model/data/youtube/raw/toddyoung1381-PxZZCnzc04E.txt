I rise today to speak about the so-called green New Deal in its impact on Indiana's agricultural community and our Hoosier farmers as I said last week this misguided green New Deal is unaffordable unattainable and unrealistic in fact over the next decade this so-called deal would cost up to $65,000 per American household per year this proposal is a job killer and it's bad news for hard-working Hoosiers now this is especially true for Hoosiers who rely on vital agriculture our vital agriculture industry for their incomes allow me to run through a few numbers in Indiana agriculture supports more than 107 thousand Hoosier jobs agriculture also contributes an estimated thirty billion dollars to Indiana's economy Indiana's the 10th largest farming state in the nation and we're the eighth largest AG exporter perhaps most importantly 97 percent of Hoosier farms are family owned or operated agriculture is a main driver of our state's economy and it's often said that Indiana feeds the world and we take a lot of pride in that so we need our AG community to continue thriving and yet the sponsors of this green New Deal have spoken about cutting back on the farming practices that employ Hoosiers and put food on the table imagine the crushing cost to Hoosier farmers of changing out all farm equipment for electric vehicles or the cost of upgrading every single building on every farm in Indiana this is on top of the sharp climb in energy prices that we'd see under the green New Deal this bad deal would force the cost of doing business to skyrocket for Hoosier manufacturers and our farmers which would mean higher prices for consumers and less money in the pockets of hard-working Hoosiers Jim a small business owner from Muncie wrote to my office recently he said quote please stop the green New Deal in its tracks and then he wrote in all capitals now I also heard from Patrick and Bloomington who said quote as a man who served my country in combat in Vietnam 50 years ago and someone who loves my country deeply I'm very concerned about the direction our nation is heading regarding the green New Deal he added quote I hope you won't give this idea a second thought Dennis from Greenwood wrote quote my wife and I are strongly against the green New Deal we would recommend that you not support this crazy idea well Dennis I don't intend to Susan from Lafayette Road quote please hold strong and promote the values of Indiana and many Americans unquote bottom line Hoosiers don't want this harmful green New Deal it sets unattainable goals are bad for who's your farmers it's bad for our economy and it's bad for our families Thank You mr. president I yield the floor

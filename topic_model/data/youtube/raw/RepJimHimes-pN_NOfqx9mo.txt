thank you mr chairman and welcome madam chair thank you it's a pleasure to say that as a guy who grew up with a mom and two sisters and now lives with a wife and two daughters it's a real privilege for me to sit here when after 100 years the federal reserve is chaired by a woman it's a it's a thank you very much much appreciated i um want to follow up on a line of questioning by my my friend from wisconsin and just read you a portion of this of your report here um which reads uh fiscal policy was a notable headwind in 2013 relative to prior recoveries fiscal policy in recent years has been unusually restrictive and the drag on gdp growth in 2013 was particularly large i think you quantified that at 1.5 percent so my questions are um and i may keep it to a minute or so uh unusually restrictive i wonder what you mean by that and number two um 1.5 of gdp growth given up to unusually restrictive fiscal policy can you quantify that for me in terms of number of jobs well i guess it's it's it and we're a little reluctant to try to quantify it but a percentage and a half less gdp growth would probably over the course of a year raise raise unemployment by several several tenths of a percent so it is significant now the economy succeeded in growing um in 2013 at a reasonable rate um nevertheless in creating jobs but uh presumably it would have grown faster without that drag and you say it's unusually restrictive i think if you look back historically in periods like this where we're recovering from a deep downturn and unemployment is as high as it is the typical stance or contribution of fiscal policy to growth would be substantially larger that's what it means to say it's an unusual drag i mean it's not only absolutely a large negative number but it's unusual given economic conditions thank you thank you

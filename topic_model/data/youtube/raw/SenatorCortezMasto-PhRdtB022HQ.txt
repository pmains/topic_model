Thank You mr. chair thank you all for your willingness to serve welcome to your family members I appreciate that let me just start with you congressman Bryan Stein and thank you so much for taking the time to visit with me I appreciate that yes ma'am and I think my colleague may have touched on this comments that you've made regarding the LGBTQ community and I just have a question and can you just follow up for me how is it that NASA employees who are LGBTQ or have children in gay marriages how should they feel about your leadership when you've taken these positions thank you for that question ma'am and and what I would share with you is that I do believe from my heart that every human being has dignity and Worth and that each person needs to be treated as though they are a valued member of the team and certainly equal opportunity would be my highest objective as the leader of NASA and when it comes to standards they need to be uniform and people need to know what those standards are and be held to it in a uniform way and and and that's how I would conduct myself the Defense of Marriage Act has been overturned by the Supreme Court the law is now different and I will absolutely follow the law should I be confirmed ma'am thank you and I think we talked a little bit about this when we met I'm a lead sponsor on the safe drone Act which among other things requires the FAA to develop an implementation plan to achieve full operational capabilities of unmanned aircraft systems traffic management ensure the safety and security of all aircraft the plan must include a time line certification criterion established industry and government roles and include an assessment of various necessary components NASA is taking a joint lead in UAS traffic management system can you commit to continued progress and timely pursuit of UAS air traffic management technologies which include utilizing the important UAS tests I like the one in Nevada without question and in fact I've been to stead sted field the Reno Air Races I used to be stationed at Naval Air Station Fallon Nevada I flew there at the naval strike and air warfare center I can tell you that the the UAS enabling UAS to integrate into the National Airspace System is absolutely a critical part of America's not only national security but economic development we have to be better at that than anybody else in the world and I am absolutely committed to that NASA is a technology provider for that which a lot of that technology is being developed and and tested it at sted field and and you have my commitment that I will absolutely that will be a high priority for me for the interest of our country not just for NASA but for the economy okay thank you and then is it beeyotch oh I don't want to be a co thank you very much I know the SC PSC is focused on many things that create more of an immediate physical risk of serious injury or death like cribs and power tools but in your statement you mentioned technology and new products do you think we are prepared on the consumer protection side of the Internet of Things and what can we do and what can you do in your role to really address those type that new technology and what it means for consumer safety as well as when we're talking about the Internet of Things for that question I don't know if we're prepared for those things I think the that type of the Internet of Things and the products that are coming on to the market every day of a teenage daughter I don't know anything about them and it seems like every time you look at a product on the market its new it's faster it's doing things that we don't understand in a day to day basis so I think that we are going to have to as an agency make sure that we are being working with staff to make sure that they are getting ahead of the curve understanding these products how they work and how they interact with each other I think those are things that we haven't looked at close enough as a as a society but as far as the agency goes and of course I'm not inside yet so I can't comment on what they may may not have done but I think one of the things that if confirmed once I get there I think that is something that we need to move a little quickly on thank you I appreciate that because I we're in the technological age and I think everything we do when it comes to consumer safety is an important component or guide rail when it comes to embracing this new technology as well so I appreciate your comments I know my time is almost up I will submit the rest of my questions for the record again thank you all for your willingness to serve really appreciate it thank you

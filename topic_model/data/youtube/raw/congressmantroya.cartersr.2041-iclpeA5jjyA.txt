madam chair thank you very much for the opportunity to address and administrator guzman i'd like to personally thank you for touring my district and having the kind of attention to detail that my constituents certainly deserve and certainly appreciate that you undoubtedly provided and the care that you give we know that you have a very tough job but we certainly appreciate the hard work that you and the members of your team are providing for the people of america one observation and two questions first observation is there were comments that were made earlier that suggest that somehow climate change was not a part of sba and it shouldn't be a part of the discussion i'd like to very respectfully challenge that premise in my district we have had substantial impacts from climate whether it's hurricanes floods or tornadoes that have incredibly impacted our small businesses to the tune of people having to borrow money from sba to only have to come back and borrow money and gain sba because of natural disasters that which are no doing of their own so climate change is very much a part of the role that sba plays in helping businesses particularly small businesses stand back up after these these horrific natural disasters so i thank you i thank your administration the administration the biden administration and certainly your administration um uh ms guzman for for being very attentive so one quick question is a real life issue that's that happened in my district there was an individual that applied for an idol grant received notice that she had been approved and that money had been transmitted to her account now i've been in communication with a number of your um your your staff people but i want to bring this to your attention because we haven't gotten a positive resolve yet but i think one should be in order she applied for an idol grant was approved for the idol grant was notified by sba that the funds were being transferred to her account several days go by she realized the money has not it was determined by sda sba that there was a glitch and that they the money was supposed to have been transferred but never made it to her account between the time she brought that to their attention at the time that they attempted to correct the glitch meaning to then send the money to the proper account she was told that oh the program rules have changed and you're no longer eligible for the funds that you previously only a week earlier had been approved for well listen that seems terribly wrong if the person was approved and then somewhere in the process there was a rule change i think it's only reasonable that some exception be made to assist this individual i won't give her a name or any of that information on on an open line but but your staff is well aware of this and i will share it again to your office can you talk about that very briefly of and i suspect that this is not a one-off that this may have happened to other people throughout the country but certainly it's a travesty and it's no fault of the person or the applicant but they should be made whole thank you so much for uh the time that you spent with me in your district and it was uh very informative especially with the businesses impacted by uh repeat natural disasters uh i will um you know say on the covered idol program and the as well as the advanced program uh you know we we obviously have uh you know those programs close december 31st uh we continue to administer funding on uh any modifications for the idle program i'm i'm happy to explore this further and my my team will follow up immediately with your staff on this constituent request in particular i'm not pleased with the idle program overall and obviously made some significant changes um over the summer to move it reposition it add new processes and procedures and in the fall change the customer service support and listen i'm sorry to cut you off man because my time is going to go up i want to be very clear and complementary of your staff the the region 6 administrator has gone as far as he could with trying to explore this your people have have looked at and have been extremely helpful albeit not getting it over the goal post so your extra attention to this would be critically important particularly to my constituent in louisiana who has been very patient but has clearly been wronged and with my final 10 seconds i want to just once again make a make a a play for something that i've spoken to you um before and others and again i want to thank you and that is individuals who have had to apply for sba loan after sba loan each time there's another natural disaster i would ask again that you would consider some lone forgiveness and i thank you i apologize for overrunning

during wednesday's GOP debate ben Carson a retired pediatric neurosurgeon an interesting moment when he was asked to respond to Donald Trump's claims the vaccines cause autism well let me put it this way there has been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated and that there's any correlation between vaccinations and autism vaccines are very important certain ones the ones that would prevent death or crippling there are others are multitude of vaccines which probably don't fit in that category and there should be some discretion in those cases but you know a lot of this is pushed by thick government so I just have to say all of a sudden ben Carson turn it back into a doctor really for me oh my god we got that right my right that's who that guy yeah yeah it was it about the three marks yah sure besides maybe the five of us man who are I'm telling that was a long it was because it's almost as if he realized oh I'm talking to a conservative audience they may not agree with me so they frozen that they have a great government if african american physician does not support the Affordable Care Act or access to health care by up for all my terms of the expansion of Medicaid in terms of supporting what the president has done you would think as a physician he knows that african-american position he would know that african-americans need health care coverage Arizona laughing this is so interesting because you know all of us who grew up in a certain time they were all told to read dr. Carson's book and you know he was at the TV men right right right he is kind of the up from you know nothing but it is he becomes valuable in parts the GOP and election letting things as a question is it that he is valuable to the GOP in part because he is an african-american with such a strong critique of the President and I you know it's not the fittings not standing on his own merits but you know I guess I'm i'm wondering sort of then what what the value of that particular critique is about so here here's my vantage point on it and i say this as someone who deeply admires him as a physician and his pull up you know pull yourself up by the bootstraps story the Jamaican mother you know I have to always throw that in there and because we share exactly that's everything for everything that he has accomplished ben Carson as a Republican presidential candidate I have found it mind-boggling at his success and and the only conclusion I can come to is he does not help the Republican Party because he is an african-american man he is helpful to certain elements of the Republican Party because he is an absolutely non-threatening black man through from 2008 through 2012 mrs. discussion is Barack Obama and angry black man and Republicans they love ben Carson they loved Herman Cain he's quiet he's affable he's meek he doesn't fight back with people doesn't have much to say on policy and I think that is why he is frankly is doing so well on the Republican Party and yes I've said when you look at that GOP stage two latino candidates an african-american candidate and a woman running yeah it just does actually look better than the Democratic patent whose base is in fact much more diverse that Republicans still have to figure out its and it goes back to Sarah Palin actually when she was worth the vice presidential choice for McCain being a woman doesn't necessarily mean that women will vote for you exactly i work american does not mean that African Americans will vote for you it does come down to your politician what it cooks or it doesn't draw those voters but what it does do is say if someone wants to level a charge of racism against the party they can say excuse me your your candidate slate is actually less diverse it so it's not so much it helps with those marginal voters but that because there are many white Americans don't want to be seen and understood as racist it kind of allows you to say this is not a party with the right side he thinks like we do yeah thank you never please Michael Ferguson to you know deserved what he got if there are two things I think one is precisely what you're talking about will probably increase pressure on Democrats to put a Latino or even an african-american on the ticket I think it's a factor they're going to happen to think about second ben Carson actually stands i think in a long historical tradition that conservatives in our country whether back in the day when they were even segregationist democrats have always liked the up from your bootstraps self-help party but it goes back to Booker T my white house in washington and it's you know i don't wanna be unfair to Booker T is a complicated pursuit they like that people like Tim Scott people like JC Watts successfully look at the difference but on the reaction comes from I'll shut up but the reaction to colon pal the reaction to Condoleezza Rice they are very different in their persona you know and and they have been strong Colin Powell has been adamant about his you know his admiration for Barack Obama and that makes him as a black man in the Republican Party persona non when the Republican Party realizes that dr. Carson has no support in the african-american community it's going to be interesting how they see him as being valuable to the party the african-american community that we get it in terms of pulling yourself up by your booster but we also get it in terms of opportunity and the federal government providing that that basis for us to achieve equality and adjust society for us and our people in dr. Carson certainly is not speaking to justice and equality and opportunity for african-americans or people of color so when they see the black the black community done support and Bill all of you he did speak to the fact that vaccines are safe they could use it I thank you too Julie face Angela shell Bernard very nice to be in

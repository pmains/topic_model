staying within the time limit congressman Calvert thank you madam chairman assistant secretary James a general Semin I thank you for both being here I think I've talked about this with you guys once or twice before so I think you know what I'm going to talk about it's a marietta Creek flood control project as you know the project is under construction we intend to keep moving that project through we been working closely with commander Barta la district to ensure the funding is provided to the Marietta Creek project to continue construction of phase two and phase one environmental vegetation removal this rain we had heavy participation precipitation we had and underscored how important it is the current channel was at capacity throughout the February storms and this was only a twenty five year event not 100-year event that this project is designed to take care of when it's fully completed and some of the funds received by the core of the project were intended to be used in advance advance of validation report I've been frustrated the progress on this draft validation report to date as you know we've been pushing the Corps for nearly six years to complete the validation report which will update the projects economics hydraulics and hydrology the local sponsor the Riverside County Flood Control Water Conservation District recently met with the with the Corps to discuss the status and elements of the draft report the district has now had the opportunity to review the Corps recently updated economic analysis within the report has some serious concern for example the flood district has found instances where certain maintenance costs are double counted or where cost estimates are greatly exceed the actual bids there's a host of specific corrections additional identified benefits and cost savings recommendations the Corps the Flood Control District is making to the Corps which would properly incorporate the full range of benefits in the validation report secretary general would you commit to me that you both both the Corps leaders we'll work with a la district and the local sponsor addressed these concerns and incorporate the full range project benefits into the validation report sir let me go first on that one we are absolutely committed to getting this done and that's the theme of what I gonna say throughout the day here I've just talked to general Carlton yesterday and today on this I'm gonna ask her to look at this packer this is the report we've got to do to get through there I am not aware of what you talked about on double-counting a building billing so I will blow into that this afternoon and have general callers and she's right here I'll have her come back and make sure that they brief your staff if there's anything that's confusing we'll make sure that we understand exactly what's out there I think the main thing is we certainly see a lot of value in this project we're absolutely committed to get it done and if there's anything we can do with respect to the work plan of 2020 if Congress is so inclined to give us money above and beyond the President's budget then we have the authority to be able to allocate some of that in key places to be able to get some of these projects done well without a couple other questions we're gonna ask about that but that's a pretty concise answer I'll accept that and look forward to working with you to see if we can get this thing done I'd like to get it done well I've only been in Congress 27 years I hope to get it done while I'm still still here the Commissioner Berman I I'm intrigued by your map here being from California the panel here hears we talk about California water all the time we like Idaho because it's it's we like looking at their water as it comes down to California where it belongs on the Colorado system you know obviously the Bay Delta right now we're in pretty good shape as far as our reservoirs the Colorado system is there any estimates how much Lake Mead will go up in this so far yeah I'm trying to remember the numbers but I as average inflow into Lake Powell we look at it usually for the springtime runoff and last year it was at 36% for example and this year as of last Friday we believe it's going to be out of about a hundred and thirty three percent of average so a significant significant flow of water it's going to be coming to Lake Powell this year I'm gonna sell you something for Las Vegas because obviously right now they're the most concern about this as you know they're having to do extraordinary things to get water into into that area so this is good news and guys you've only been in office for a little while and you've already been able to increase the reservoir capacity committed to turning around look forward to working with you thank you thank you congressman

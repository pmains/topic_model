E PURPOSE OF OFFERING AN OPENING STATEMENT. >> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. AS WE SPEAK, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS ARE TRAPPED BEHIND ENEMY LINES IN AFGHANISTAN. IN RECENT WEEKS, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS ABANDONED THESE AMERICANS AND TRUST OF TO THE TALIBAN. MR. PRESIDENT LEANS ON THE GOODWILL OF BRUTAL TERRORISTS TO ALLOW THEM TO LEAVE, WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO THE FAMILIES OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES TO GET THEM HOME SAFELY. HERE WE ARE TODAY, TALKING ABOUT -- SAVING AMERICAN CITIZENS, WE ARE HERE TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS INAPT ADMINISTRATION'S $3.5 TRILLION FOR THE BIGGEST ENTITLEMENT EXPANSION WE HAVE SEEN IN A GENERATION. THE BIG GOVERNMENT WISH LIST REVEALS THE MOST URGENT PRIORITIES OF THE WHITE HOUSE, LEAVING AMERICANS BEHIND AND BANKROLLING SOCIALIST PROGRAMS WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AS WE OFTEN DISCUSS, WORKING FAMILIES WHO HAVE TROUBLE WITH CARING FOR A NEWBORN CHILD OR SICK FAMILY MEMBER, ASSISTING THEM IS CRITICAL TO BUILDING STRONG FAMILIES AND A STRONG COUNTRY. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE AGREED IN THE IMPORTANCE THAT PEOPLE OF A PATHWAY TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE BIGGEST QUESTION HERE TODAY IS WHETHER WE  -- NEED MASSIVE FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS, AND THE ANSWER IS WE DO NOT. YOU SENT A MEMBER TO THE RANKING MEMBER BRADY OVER PLANS TO PUT TOGETHER A PROPOSAL OF TACKLING THE ISSUE OF PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE AND CHILDCARE. YOUR LETTER SAID, WE INVITE YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS TO BRING FORWARD YOUR PROPOSALS. THERE IS A STRONG BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT THAT THE CURRENT STATUS OF WORKING FAMILIES IS UNTENABLE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS COMMITTEE'S HISTORY OF BIPARTISAN COOPERATION. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK CONSENT TO SUBMIT THE LETTER FOR THE RECORD. AS RANKING MEMBER OF THE SUPPORT COMMITTEE, I WAS PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS OUTREACH. IN MAY, WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE REPUBLICANS, ALONGSIDE THE EDUCATION AND LABOR COMMITTEE RELEASED A DRAFT CALLED THE PROTECTING WORKER PAYCHECKS AND CHOICE ACT. RATHER THAN TAKING A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH, THE DRAFT HAS A SET OF PROPOSALS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE AND CHILDCARE. OUR DRAFT CONTAINS 15 DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT BUILD ON WHAT IS ALREADY WORKING AND TARGETS RESOURCES WHERE WE KNOW THERE ARE GAPS IN COVERAGE AND A LACK OF ACCESS. TO MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT, THESE PROPOSALS WERE MET WITH RESOUNDING SILENCE FOR MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES. THE MAJORITY HAS CHOSEN RADICAL LEFT-WING POLITICS OVER COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS THAT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN CONTROL. WE ARE CONSIDERING THE LARGEST NEW ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM IN A GENERATION ON THE SCALE OF MEDICARE AT THE COST OF OVER 500 BILLION DOLLARS. INSTEAD OF DOING THE HARD WORK OF SITTING DOWN TO DISCUSS COMPROMISE AND BUILD CONSENSUS, DEMOCRATS ARE USING A LAZY, PARTISAN BUDGETARY TOOL THAT DISMISSES AND WILLFULLY IGNORES REPUBLICAN PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE. THIS BILL IS THE WRONG DIRECTION FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND THIS COUNTRY. AS WE HAVE LEARNED TOO OFTEN,' THAT PROMISE SO-CALLED FREE BENEFITS, WITH TRADE-OFFS AND CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING HIGHER TAXES AND INCREASED GOVERNMENT DEPENDENCY. DEMOCRATS WANT TO GIVE WASHINGTON MORE CONTROL OVER HOW AMERICANS LIVE, WORK AND MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEIR FAMILIES. THE ACHILLES' HEEL OF THIS PLAN IS IT IS HURRIED, PARTISAN. THIS APPROACH HAS LED TO A POORLY DESIGNED PROGRAM, SORS SA SECOND LOOK. WAYS AND MEANS DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT TOGETHER A PROGRAM THAT PUTS THE IRS IN CHARGE OF PAID LEAVE BENEFITS FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS. TREASURY HAS ADMITTED IT IS UNPREPARED TO TAKE ON THE PROGRAM. THE BILL POORLY TARGETS BENEFITS. IT ALLOWS TWO-PARENT HOUSEHOLDS WITH DUAL EARNERS MAKING UP TO $500,000 TO CLAIM BENEFITS OF UP TO $30,000 PER YEAR. IT PROVIDES NO MINIMUM BENEFIT FOR LOW-WAGE WORKERS. THIS PROGRAM IS RIGHT FOR FRAUD, WITH LAX REQUIREMENTS AND RELIES HEAVILY ON SELF CERTIFICATION. THE BILL FAILS TO CONSIDER THE REALITY OF SMALL BUSINESS BY ALLOWING WORKERS TO PROVIDE SEVEN DAYS NOTICE BEFORE TAKING LEAVE. FINALLY, THE BILL TRANSFERS LIABILITY -- TO NOTIFY WORKERS BY SUBSIDIZING IT UP TO 90% OF THE COST OF WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE ALREADY PAYING. WHY WOULD WE ASKED MIDDLE-CLASS WORKERS TO PAY FOR A

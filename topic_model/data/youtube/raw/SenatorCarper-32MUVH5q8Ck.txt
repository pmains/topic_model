president I rise in opposition today the nomination of Peter Wright to serve as the assistant administrator for EPA's office of land and emergency management I take little joy in opposing this nomination but do so for three reasons I mean make a preface before I say those three reasons I sit on this floor right up to the end of the last of the Congress trying to get Peter White confirmed trying to get him confirmed on a unanimous consent approach and we fail at the at the very end the the irony of it is that having stood here and tried to get him confirmed at the end of the last Congress in today to be in a positions that I am asking for us to postpone at least for today his nomination is there's an irony there and actually I I don't have the time to go into all the reasons but I'll I'll mention a few of them in the last Congress I as I said I work with the EPA to negotiate a set of significant policy concessions that I believe would have allowed the Senate minority to agree to a more expeditious confirmation process for mr. right I work diligently up until as I said the closing of the last Congress right and who the bitter end if you will to achieve that objective and so I've done in good faith with other EPA nominees in fact the very last nominee confirmed in the last Congress was a tipi nominee to have the agency's tribal office Chad McIntosh and my staff and I and others were very much involved in getting him confirmed and this Congress EPA has refused to re-engage with some of my office and miR committee staff and and with me the agency and no longer on this point on this when this nomination the the agency no longer agrees to the policy concessions that I previously secured and to which they had previously committed in the last Congress well this has been a real disappointment for me unfortunately it's hardly a surprise given this screen is increasingly extreme policy and tones of this EPA second EPA under mr. Wright's leadership for the past year has failed to advance a critical area of policy to me and to many other senators and as the regulation of these P fast PFOA has P fast chemicals known as permanent chemical / and Poli fluorinated alcohol substances known as p-pass are a class of manmade chemicals that includes something called PFOA P fos jeddaks and many other chemicals developed in the 1940s P pass can be found across these permanent chemicals to be found across industries and many products including food packaging non-stick pans clothing furniture firefighting foam in the military just this week Donald Trump said and I quote we have the cleanest water we've ever had close quote president has often made this statement while asserting his commitment to ensure that our drinking water is safe and it is a confirmation hearing if the administrator Andrew Weaver said and I also quote it is these Americans that President Trump and his administration are focused on Americans without access to safe drinking water or Americans living on or near hazardous sites often unaware of the health risks that they and their families face many of these sites have languished for years even decades how can these Americans prosper if they cannot live learn or work in healthy environment the answer is simple they cannot president Trump understands this and that is why it's focused on putting Americans first close quote close quote from Andrew wheelers now our EPA Administrator yet under Peter writes a leadership for the past year EPA's office of land and management has failed to heed these words where Peter ID serves on a temporary basis that confirmation I think we have a poster here that's relevant a study released today by the Environmental Working Group identified 712 locations in 49 states that are contaminated with p FS 712 locations in 49 states that are contaminated with p pass from coast-to-coast from our Canadian border to the Gulf Stream waters just last year the town of blades which in the middle of Delaware southern part of Delaware alerta' is twelve hundred and fifty residents to stop using public water for drinking and cooking because of PFS contamination at nearly twice the federal health advisory level just an hour from blades up north on Route 13 officials of the Dover Air Force Base found that 36 to 37 sampled groundwater wells showed dangerously high levels of PETA's p fo s and p f o a related to we believe the use of chemicals in firefighting foam at the base and it's not just Delaware pee fast contamination is widespread in red states and blue states in small water systems and large ones on military sites and in residential areas from Maine to Alaska while industrial manufacturers and users of these chemicals are responsible for much the contamination it turns out that a principal user of PFS was our military I speak as a retired Navy captain speaking here the presiding officer whose marine and for us itself is personally and as part of our history in the military but part of as it turns out the principal use where PFS was the military which were used it as a firefighting foam as I said earlier in 1973 as a young naval flight officer stationed at Moffett Field Naval Air Station in California and on a sunny April day I saw so i driving to work one morning mr. Dempsey was president driving to work of Moffett Field Omaha my home in Palo Alto I saw a big black plume of smoke rising above my base after as it turned out a massive NASA convair jet descended on the runway we had parallel runways and the traffic control had directed two aircraft to land on the same runway at the same time and as a result the large NASA Conrad descend on runway where a p3 aircraft my squadron my squad my sister squadrons aircraft had already landed was taxing and the larger aircraft literally landed on top of the smaller aircraft it took over an hour for fire fighters to control the blaze sixteen people died only one crewman on the p3 survived these were my brothers and sisters my sister squadron mates I understand that PFS containing foam has supported our military readiness and save lives better than most but the cruel irony is that the P fast winds up in a glass on the kitchen table these same chemicals endanger lives the Environmental Working Group and that's the name of a group the capital R capital letters Environmental Working Group has identified 117 military sites including 77 airfield where people ask contamination because of the use of PFS containing foam to both train for and fight fires involving highly flammable jet fuels yet in many states clean up of these sites has been stalled and the military has shockingly been part of the problem and may have nah last year 2018 then EPA Administrator Scott port he'll EP fast national leadership summit and proudly announced before quote concrete steps close quote the EPA would take to address pee fast contamination the second of these four steps was a TPA would propose designating PFOA P fos - the most dangerous troubling elements in this class of chemicals but to designate them as hazardous substances under the Superfund law that was almost a year more than a year ago more than a year ago making that designation would compel the Defense Department to stop fighting cleanups in states all across the country indeed in some cases the Defense Department has justified his refusal to clean up pas contamination on grounds that the Superfund designation has not yet been made designating these substances as hazardous would also unleash EPA resources to address cleanups of orphan sites where there is no identified liable polluter and despite Scott approach commitment to move forward with with the designation of PFA s says a hazardous substance is under the Superfund law under Peter rights what EPA hasn't even proposed has not even proposed to do that let alone finalize the action at this rate it will be at least another year maybe longer before this vital step will be taken Americans deserve better than this and they deserve greater urgency on this issue last month the United States Senate passed it's right here passed its National Defense Authorization Act which included several important bipartisan provisions to address be fast contamination notably I would I could not even the secure an agreement to allow a vote on my amendment that would designate P passes has her substance under the Superfund law I did not get a vote on my amendment despite the fact that 35 Democrats and Republican co-sponsors on bipartisan legislation who have clearly signaled their support for this policy meanwhile EPA continues to drag its heels acting with far more urgency to repeal environmental regulations than to clean up the water our government's own activities has inadvertently contaminated mr. right will have the ability to make this hazardous substance designation for P pass if he has confirmed let me say that again mr. right will have the ability to make this hazardous substance designation for P pass if he is confirmed he should hear strongly from this Senate our collective desire that he urgently do so as my hope that despite the many disagreements my colleagues and I have had with the truck PPA on their views on climate change and some environmental robots there could at least be some common-sense agreement on the need of clean up widespread PFS contamination that has not been the case at least thus far third finally a late-breaking matter came to the committee's attention this week regarding ethics investigation - mr. Wright's financial disclosures chairman Ross and I received news from the White House Office of government ethics known as OGE that mr. Wright despite numerous written assurances to the contrary held Stockton Dow DuPont at the time he filed his nominee disclosure a financial disclosure report and continued to do so until this March 12th a couple of months ago although EPA believes that the mr. Wright has complied with all applicable ethics laws during that period of time o GE the office of government ethics asserts that it currently lacks the information necessary to make such a determination artisan a completed amendment to his ethics agreement and financial disclosure report to our committee OG office of government ethics felt compelled to share this information with the EPW community committee because of its direct relevance to the citizen in the consideration of mr. Wright's nomination today in light of the ongoing og investigation I would just implore my colleagues to delay the Senate's consideration of mr. Wright's nomination for the time being I don't suggest delaying consideration of this nominee lightly again I was one of the key people standing as chamber back at the end of December trying to get this man confirmed in fact any delay in the Senate's confirmation the Senate's consideration of mr. Wright's nomination would not prevent him from continuing to serve in his current capacity as he's done since he first arrived at EPA in acting capacity in July July 9th 2018 I strongly believe that we must afford oh gee office government evidence they have at the office of government ethics and EPA the opportunity to complete their investigation into this matter and fully share all relevant information for both the sacrum mr. right and for the agency if the fact she described by EPA than a completed if the facts are as described by EPA Vinick investigation would be to mr. Wright's benefit miss let me say that again if the facts always described by EPA then a completed investigation would be to mr. lights benefit may close by saying this if however a GE and EPA reach a different conclusion such information would be directly relevant to every Senators deliberation when voting whether to confirm mr. right to the position of Assistant Administrator in the office of land and emergency management at EPA we close from conversations I've had with EPA yesterday it is my understanding that EPA is working to get the relevant information to øg øg to provide to the Senate pre-approved seating with the consideration of this nominee nomination while resolution of this ethics matter between EPA and Ogier is pending deprives the Senate I think of important and relevant information I've urged the laying this vote today I would do so again in the absence of that delay along were the other reasons I've mentioned I will vote no on the motion to proceed the nomination of Peter Wright I urge my colleagues to do the same and thank you are you back

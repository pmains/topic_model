a Kelly file follow up now on campaign trail attacks against two candidates for US Senate each being challenged about their service to our nation in Alaska Republican Canada and Marine Corps veteran Dan Sullivan was attacked by a super pac supporting Democrat mark begich criticizing mr. Sullivan her time he spent in our nation's capital after September 11th documents show that while Sullivan pocket in a Maryland tax credit for residents living there he was voting in Alaska claiming to be one of us in Arkansas Congressman Tom cotton was attacked by his opponent Democratic Senator Mark Pryor mr. Pryor taking issue with mr. Cotton's time in the Armed Forces I think that's part of this sense of entitlement that he gives off is that almost as high I served my country therefore let me to the Senate that's not how it works in Arkansas pretty now Tom cotton Republican congressman from Arkansas and a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and Dan Sullivan who's running for US Senate in Alaska and is a Marine Corps veteran thank you both so much for being here representative cotton let me start with you on Senator Mark Pryor saying you have a sense of entitlement that you give off that you served your country and therefore let me into the Senate thanks Megan it's great to be on with you as always it was a peculiar statement by Senator Pryor I certainly didn't learn a sense of entitlement growing up in yell County on my parents cattle farm chasing after cals and I definitely didn't have a sense of entitlement instilled in the army and basic training by drill sergeant Norton and by all my other instructors and mentors in the army they taught me about hard work about sacrificing about service to others that's what I've tried to do not only in the army but in the United States House and that's where I plan to do for the people of Arkansas they elect me to be their next united states senator senator Pryor didn't serve in the Armed Forces right no Megan he did not do you think he lacks an understanding of the discipline and the training and the commitment that you have to go through in order to successfully go participate in the arm sources forces as you did well Megan I think it was a surprising statement again I certainly didn't learn a sense of entitlement the army that's the last thing you learn in the army and that's the last thing that the soldiers the men and women I led in Iraq and Afghanistan displays coming from that's time trying to get it why would he say that you have a sense of entitlement that you deserve a Senate seat just because you served well senator Pryor has been a politician for 24 years now I'm in my first term in the house and I feel like he thinks that maybe I should wait my own term he said that I'm a young man in hurry and I'll plead guilty to that charge someone should be in a hurry to fix all the problems at the end Barack Obama have caused in Washington DC mr. Sullivan let me talk to you so now you are running in Alaska and this is another tight right Megan right but now they're going after you because you haven't always been in Alaska you went to Washington DC for a time in part when you were serving in the Marines and so even a local news anchor out there came out and said come on come off of it do you think that this attack is going to resonate with Alaskans well you know Megan this is part it's really not about my visits a POW as part of a broader issue of service in Alaska there is a tremendous a tradition of serving your country particularly in times of need and after the September 11th attacks literally thousands of Alaskans stopped what they were doing to serve their country in the military and in other ways and you know I was honored to be part of that Alaska tradition I served a year and a half on active duty recalled active duty I also served as an assistant secretary of state working on global terrorism issues under Condoleezza Rice you have the nerve to leave Alaska and service somebody's rosary that's so that's what they're going after you poor let me ask you this let me ask you this mr. Salvin because we've seen this before I mean we've seen John Kerry who of course you know came under criticism for the his own critique of American soldiers after Vietnam come out and say the following about military service and he took a lot of heat some believe it's a window into how some in particular on the left view military service stand by and listen if you make the most of it you study hard you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart you you can do well if you you get stuck in Iraq do you think that that now secretary kerry speaks for many on the left when it comes to military service look some of the best members of alaska society american society by far are the men and women I've served with in the military in the Marine Corps in what I think is going on here is whether it's mark Pryor or Mark Begich they can't run on their records they have records of failure supporting in Mark Begich this case Barack Obama ninety-seven percent of the time so what do they want to do they want to change the topic and what they're trying to do now is denigrate service whether it's Tom's service or my service because they can't run on their records and I think that's a losing strategy that's interesting to sort of get that window into how some folks view military service which is noble and difficult and requires so much courage thank you both we appreciate your service and we appreciate you being here Thank You Megan

Center rounds thank you Mr chairman um gentlemen first of all thank you for coming before the committee today we do appreciate it as you know there have been numerous reports of suspicious activity by U.S adversaries in regards to U.S agricultural land purchases in 2020 chinese-linked company planned to build a wind energy farm project near Del Rio Texas only miles away from Laughlin Air Force Base where U.S Pilots are trained and in 2022 a CCP linked company attempted to build a corn Milling plant on Farmland near a sensitive Air Force Base outside of Grand Forks North Dakota uh my question to Mr Singh to begin with and in your experience as a former deputy National Security advisor for international economics how might foreign investment in U.S AG land and companies by adversarial Nations particularly China Russia North Korea and Iran how could that impact our national security especially if in close proximity to military installations well thank you Senator food security is economic security food security is National Security I think it's as simple as that the supply chain for food in this country has to be uh taken treated with the utmost importance in the same way that we do with foundational Technologies in the same way that we do with energy and manufactured goods uh you've added an additional layer of concern which is that if the land that is built or in a Greenfield investment is used for the purpose of spying that that raises an additional level of concern and so cypheus has the capacity to require notification for the acquisition of land above a certain threshold it can bring in the experts to determine whether a national security risk is implicated and that strikes me as a reasonable Way Forward thank you um Mr Lowry I have I we have a bipartisan legislation in fact Senator tester and I have it together it's called the pass act and that would prohibit China Russia Iran and North Korea from purchasing U.S AG land and agricultural companies as well as uh adding the Secretary of AG as a standing member of the committee on foreign investment in the United States cypheus the agricultural industry is on my opinion a significant part of not just my home State's economy but nationally and making it a true potential Target for foreign investment particularly when you add in the geographic uh specifics that we've identified in the last two specific issues how might legislation like the pass Act help protect this very important sector particularly in these Geographic locations um thank you Senator I um I I don't know the specifics of your legislation but from what you just described I think that the issued to think about there's a couple as a couple fold one is as Mr Singh kind of alluded to um cypheus does have the ability under Firma the the law that was passed to reform Civics back in 2018 and the regulations in 2020 to look at uh Greenfield investments in agricultural spots that provide a national security Nexus so um uh in terms of a few things one is if the Department of Agriculture should be part of cypheus that's something I think that's a very reasonable idea right now if there is an agricultural aspect to a transaction agriculture can be brought in by sypheus and it has been in the past but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be more of a regular operation as opposed to kind of an ad hoc type of thing in terms of a Prohibition on specific countries and Investments um I would have to really look at I I have my concerns about that because I do believe strongly in the ability for countries to and entities to invest in the United States because I think that is that is actually a positive for the United States so I would be I'm a little reluctant on suggesting uh outward absolute prohibitions but I think that you know uh without seeing the legislation I think that that that would be my caution I guess thank you and I the reason why I ask is because the prohibition was specific to those associated with with uh China um uh and North Korea uh Russia in particular right now and I think that's a huge part of it in Iran and particularly because I can't imagine why we would any of us would want them to be able to purchase Farmland in particular particularly if it was an area that was near a sensitive geographic location and it surprised us that those particular two areas that I had identified earlier had actually gone as far as they did before they were were stopped so I I appreciate that and thank you for your comments thank you Mr on Senator tester from Montana is recognized yeah I think Mr chairman ranking member congratulations the ranking member uh for taking over this committee it's the first time I've been here in person I've been online so thank you for your leadership thank you Mr I'll extend you another 30 seconds please Perfect yeah keep keep going that that's perfect uh so Center rounds brought up an issue that's near and dear to my heart because we have a bill on it so it ain't over with yet folks uh I want to talk to you more about China North Korea Russia Iran uh being prohibited from buying land um number one let's just take it at that face value do we have the ability to be able to track and stop that sale from happening on farmland or an agribusiness because it applies to both um right now my understanding of the laws or rules for deciphius is that if a transaction was in a Greenfield transaction and is within a certain uh uh mileage basically of sensitive areas okay then uh cypheus can investigate that transaction and make a determination on whether or not it is a national security issue and eventually potentially even block it okay so and so the definition of a sensitive area becomes pretty damn important I would suggest yes and do you have any idea what the mileage is on that so I think that the cypheus has put together regulations and they have created an Annex and that Annex actually says which are the sensitive sites oh I got you like an ICBM missile silo would be a sensitive site that seems like it would be the question is is does that extend 500 Miles 50 miles five miles um I can't I can't remember off the top of my head iPad that's that's important to know and this by the way would not only ban that it would ban ban it all because quite frankly I'm going to tell you and I don't want to speak for sender rounds I don't think China and North Korea Russia or Iran gives a damn whether we exist or not so why should we allow them entrance any entrance into our country because if you take a look at those countries they're all Affiliated the Chinese company comes in and they're affiliated with the Chinese Communist party so the question becomes we can have the debate it doesn't matter yeah rounds and I already have our minds made up this is a good thing to have happen for for not only America's national security but for our food security which is you had already pointed out or one in the same the question becomes is if we put it into effect can you can you give us the ability so we can actually enforce it so we could actually enforce it number one number two is it even possible to do this assuming they're not going to come in as an oligarch from Russia but use a shell company that may be a Canadian company so um purchases I mean right now under cepheus cypheus has become expansive in the last few years and instead of dealing with a hundred or so transactions a year it's now dealing with over 400. okay so that means you have to have resources you have to be able to look these are National Security issues that people are looking at if you expand to the whole of the United States and basically say every single purchase of any type of land by anybody from China whether they're from a private sector or a government sector or from Russia by the way unless you're going to be a fair amount of work if if you can prove to be different private sector is government sector in China that's fine but the thing is is that um what we have to think about is in some respects how big is the issue or the problem at this point is is there a lot of ownership and I think the answer is probably no and um but then if you are going to take and look at every single transaction that takes place on Farmland from foreign foreign buyers because if you're concerned about shell companies yes that could be a fairly significant expansion of cepheus yeah I think I think it would be and I think uh the challenge is do we think this is real or do we not think this is real and and one of our challenges is we and this is the scary part we don't have big of an issue it is we don't know how big of an issue it is I can tell you I had a farm bill listening session Montana is a pretty good-sized State it's 540 miles long long and 400 miles wide I haven't had one yet where this issue hasn't either been brought up in public or private so there's land transferring all over the place here and I think we need to get our hands on it I think you know the balloon should have been a wake-up call for us all it really should have been because the truth is if if they own land where I live which is as the crow flies probably 60 miles from the nearest silo um I would say that that's of concern for me so what the hell I mean there's Tech there's there's sensitive sites all over the country here's what I hope guys and then I'm going to turn it back to Chairman I hope you will work with us to make this workable and I know it's going to be complicated and I know that people are going to say this can't be done but I think this is a huge issue I think it's a huge national security issue and I don't think we should be allowing countries who don't give a damn whether we exist or not on a land whether it's farmland or agribusiness in this country they're not our friends they're not here to do us good things okay thank you all very much

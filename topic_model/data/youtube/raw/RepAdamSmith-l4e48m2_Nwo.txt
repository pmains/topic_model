I'm Ronald L Bryant US Navy I'm Paul Reinhart US Navy I was in the Army I was Air National Guard to begin with and three years into that I transferred into the active duty army [Music] but attend my graduation bootcamp and I've seen myself I was torn apart and I was put back together one piece at a time and by the time I graduate from boot camp I mean I was stacked and my head was about that big because I made it through nine weeks of boot camp you know for less did you go to boot camp and that's where they break you down and mm-hmm build you back up and then you go to your AIT you advanced individual training and so the were there they're nicer to you and they they want to make sure you can do your job and that was kind of how the advanced campus there's there's no such thing as there's no such thing as as weekend's necessarily because there's there's duties to be done but I told them that I was in dental field and I'm most likely when I get deployed [Music] somebody but ca stood for and they said combat assault and visions of going with six or seven other guys back in that Huey chopper in the jungle somewhere and picking up a week later if you happen to be there I've been put in a lot in one year's time I did over 250 missions we had over 250 incoming mortar attacks I have had near-death experiences where things could have happened I have set off plenty of bombs myself a lot of people think because the Yellow Submarine song that submarines have windows they don't I had a a lot of positive outcomes for my service but there were definitely aspects that I was not happy with women you're in a close-knit community like that you uh they stiffen on a brotherhood and you know there's tightness oh that there are still you know friends that I met still to this day to this day so 40 years later so when I came to Seattle you I heard about a veterans community the club and once again I wanted nothing to do with it and somebody talked me into going to a club meeting and so I finally said yes and I went to the meeting and after that we started looking at the support network and and the services offered for veterans on campus and really there wasn't much of anything so we started to advocate for that kind of stuff and you know it went from something that I wanted nothing to do with to now it's my passion that's right now I'm the commander with disabled American legend in chapter group and I come chapter 23 in West Seattle you

this morning people in Wisconsin have a tough choice to make protect their health by following the state's stay at home order or exercise their right to vote what's happening right now shows us exactly why we need a plan for voting safely during a pandemic only about five out of a hundred and eighty polling locations could be open they had problems with getting people as poll workers people who were potentially putting their own lives at risk just to help folks vote and the places that did open had incredibly long lines and there weren't enough sanitary supplies so that people could be safe think of all the things that people touch when they vote now but there's a simple fix to make sure that no American will have to choose between voting and keeping themselves safe and healthy all states should allow Americans to vote by mail the solution is something that some states have been working on for a very long time and here's how it works a voter gets a ballot with a postage-paid return envelope they vote they sign it and they send it back you know it's easy to vote by mail and in addition there should be online registration extended registration deadlines and expand early voting to make sure that voting is accessible to all people and the federal government should be sending money to the states to make this happen look during it pandemic we need to make sure that voters stays safe but that doesn't mean they should be silenced join us in this fight to protect our democracy

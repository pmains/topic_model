we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw has landed welcome back folks so recording from houston we're going to talk about uh something we haven't really dove into much on any of these episodes which is our space program uh and of course uh houston has a long history of uh being a leader in the space program help us with that conversation i've got uh eric berger with us eric thanks so much for for being on oh it's my pleasure love to talk space dan so yeah you're a reporter editor you're based here in houston you're at the houston chronicle for a while um joined rs technica in 2015 as the site's senior space editor and you were a pulitzer prize finalist um for your coverage of hurricane ike in 2008 so um you know this isn't even a subject i deal with a whole lot uh just being on the committees i'm on uh and i i think the audience is probably curious to learn more we have space force coming out we've got spacex going up jeff bezos and what what was his program called he's got new shepard and new glenn yeah um all these all these billionaires going up into space and um the the the frontier has changed quite a bit or the industry let's say has changed quite a bit and nasa's role in it and i think a lot of people aren't really sure what what that is anymore um you know and really it seems like that there was a decay or a loss of interest in space for for decades really um in the last few years it seems like that that the it's no longer this sleepy space program so so what changed what is the what is the the the frontier look what does the environment look like right now for space travel yeah so you're right you know we had the apollo program in the 1960s 1970s we went to the moon um and it was great and space was a big deal and then interest has really died off kind of continually since then i think since about 2010 there have been two big changes number one as you alluded to spacex the rise of commercial space this is the privatization of space private companies doing things more efficiently than nasa can and it's really starting to pay dividends the only way nasa can get its astronauts the international space station now is on the spacex rocket in the spacex spacecraft and they're doing that at a cost you know nasa did its own internal study if they developed that kind of capability it would have been cost it would cost four to ten times more than what the government would have done that seems like a good deal it's a pretty good deal uh you know you got to deal with people like elon musk to get that done and he can be he could be difficult to work with but he does get the job done um and the second big trend in addition to the privatization of space has really been the rise of the chinese space program they put their first human space in 2003 and they've had a very methodical plan you know they don't change government every two years they don't have a new president every four to eight years and so they sort of make a long-range plan and they tell their people to go do it they provide the funding and then they execute it you can say what you want about authoritarian government i think there's lots of reasons to be very critical of china but they they set out a program and they stick to it and you know in the last couple of years they've made some really significant strides you know they landed a spacecraft on the far side of the moon something no one had ever done before um they have a couple rovers running around on the moon right now why is it difficult to why do we care that it went on the far side of the moon well we care because when you try to communicate with a spacecraft from earth you need line of sight communications and so you have to put a special relay satellite in orbit around the moon and send that signal back and we care because you know the moon is kind of the next step outward in space exploration and not just for civil space but for military space it really is seen as the high ground so china's showing a lot of interest in the moon whereas after the apollo program the united states and nasa became a lot less interested although that's changed in recent years the other big thing that china did just this year was they landed a rover on mars and and not a big deal because nasa has done that eight times but no one else had ever done that russia the soviet union hadn't done that europe had tried had failed and along comes china on their very first try and they put a spacecraft on the surface of mars they roll the rover off and it's still kind of running around the red planet exploring and so they've really emerged as nasa's biggest competitor in space um should we feel threatened by that what how should we feel about that and how much are they how much of a competitor are they really well they're not a competitor to nasa right now because if you add up nasa and a vibrant commercial space industry in the united states we're way ahead of china but i mean nasa's kind of been spinning its wheels for a while especially when it comes to human space exploration you had the shuttle program the international space station we haven't been back in the deep space for half a century now um so you could look at china and say if they continue progressing at the rate they are they'll catch up to nasa within the next decade and then there's the potential to surpass it so i think it's worth taking them very seriously does it seem like the only reason that we're way ahead is because of our private sector at this point i would say so yes i mean that is the key advantage that the united states has is you have you've got a couple things first of all you've got private capital coming into space flight and you've got lots of energy and ideas and innovation the biggest innovation over the last 10 years in space flight has been the advent of reuse you may have seen the falcon heavy launch when the boosters came down side by side or you may have seen a spacex rocket landing on a barge that really is a big step forward in that if we're ever going to make access to space commonplace and routine and open it up you can't launch rockets one off you have to make it more like an airliner where it goes up comes back and you re-fly so you talk about the moon is this next frontier um i i guess like a launching pad in in some way for for the next i guess the next next frontier of space exploration and uh are are we looking at a scenario that looks like the the parody on netflix called space force where it's like us competing against the china the chinese have a base up there and they knock over our stuff i mean it's this ridiculous show it's actually quite funny is that really what's on the horizon so i i watched space force i loved it they got a lot of things wrong like the dog in space trying to send instructions it was hilarious um it was it was it was hilarious um but you could run into a situation so like in the last year the nasa set out this thing called the artemis accords which was you know they're planning to go back to the moon and they set out some guidelines whereby you know if you're going to go with us you have to share your data you have to not claim territory on the moon you know you have to you have to you know watch out for orbital debris and things like that and one of those accords was basically like you could not go to the moon and stake out a claim on the moon and like prevent other countries from going into that if you remember in the space force like that was like the genesis of the disagreement like china went to the moon and said we we claim this space and you can't come into it um so that is a potential possibility i think it's you know it's probably a decade or two off because china's not getting people to the moon until the 2030s probably nasa could go back more quickly and they may or may not but but that is a kind of conflict you could get into do you think they should does nasa have any intention to what are nasa's intentions i mean elon musk obviously wants to go to mars right nobody seems to know what nasa wants to do they talk about climate change a lot yeah so nasa's human spaceflight program has has gone back and forth since about 2004. uh the george w bush administration wanted to go to the moon and then mars president obama came in and said we're just going to go to mars and and the trump administration came in they appointed jim bridenstine who turned out to be a great administrator for the space agency really visionary and president vice president pence sent the goal of going back to the moon in 2024 um and that's okay that was a date that really wasn't attainable with the current funding that nasa has but it was the right idea and and more important than that he said we're not going to go to the moon with flags and footprints because that's what apollo was you know we went up there six times astronauts stayed a couple days in the surface of the moon and then they came back and and that was it right we brought a couple thousand pounds of rocks back um the the vice president pence set the goal if we're gonna go to the moon and we're gonna stay we're gonna have a sustainable presence and so there are reasons to do that right one is that they believe there's ice at the lunar poles and if you break down that ice into water you have rocket propellant because you could make liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen so there's reasons to go to the moon and so the current plan is you could travel a lot further because you're launching from a place with much less gravity exactly so the moon has one-sixth of gravity if you could go there and set up a fueling station on the moon or an orbit around the moon you solved a lot of your problems um the problem is you know nasa is a big bureaucracy it's become a big bureaucracy since apollo and so they can get things done but they're not done more efficiently and so one of the things that bridenstine the administrator and the trump administration did is he tried to move the agency more toward buying services right instead of nasa building the big rockets or the big spacecraft they would go to a private company that had those rockets and buy that service and so that's that seems to be a much more efficient way of doing things yeah especially if it's american-made because um as we all understand it we've been riding with the russians i think to the to the international space station well in more ways than one yes from the time the shuttle retired in 2011 until last year when spacex you know went up for the first time we'd been on soyuz vehicles and actually for most of the 2010s the main way we got our national security satellites into space our spy satellites military com satellites they run the atlas v rocket which is assembled in the united states but the engines the rd-180s are actually made in russia and so they've been bought from russia why why can't nasa just go back to the moon by 2024 or is that i mean i guess could they it's just that what we want to do is a little bit more involved than just an apollo mission because i mean we went on the apollo missions with a a computer that was like what a basically a t-83 calculator yeah i mean the computers in the rocket in the spacecraft were far less sophisticated than the computer and the phone in your pocket um it's hard okay it really is hard to get astronauts safely off the planet on the moon and then back and the biggest piece that we did not have and do not have is a lunar lander so that's that's something that you know it can't fail because if the rocket goes down to the moon and then can't launch back off the surface of the moon your astronauts are going to die right so you've got to make sure that system works and the lunar module last flew in 1972 and so we don't have any lunar lander so they're they're trying to get funding from congress to build that and they finally settled on spacex's starship as the vehicle to do that starship as you may know is the vehicle they're building in texas and flying down in south texas and there's been lots of legal wrangling because jeff bezos a blue origin was not happy with that decision and so he's been holding it up in court interesting that he thinks it wasn't a fair contract choice um he said it wasn't fair he said it was the starship system was was too complex very famously in the space community he says it's high risk and immensely complex but the fact is the starship system is actually flying right now and blue origins plans are just basically blueprints well that's interesting bezos musk competition do you see uh texas you know we have the texas medical center here it's this massive ecosystem of innovation and collaboration you see something similar ever taking place in the space community um in terms of collaboration i mean we'll see it's it's it's a really interesting thing to think about so if for a long time the way nasa worked the human spaceflight program is the rockets launched from florida they were designed at marshall space by southern alabama and the missions were flown basically from houston johnson space center that's where the astronauts train that's where they did the planning for the missions and so forth what we've seen over the last decade is a big change with blue origin to some extent because they're launching their suborbital system out in west texas but the bigger change has been spacex because they built the launch facility in south texas and no orbital rocket has ever launched from texas before they're talking about building this huge engine manufacturing facility in central texas near mcgregor where they already test engines right and so texas has a chance to become not one of these space states but the leading space state if we if we play this right what does playing a right look like what would what would governor abbott do to to play that right he he's he's been supportive of spacex is that just is there is there any policies that we should think about or is it um from a federal standpoint i think the most important policy would be to continue this this trend that was started really by bridenstine to look more at nasa buying services rather than building and owning the vehicles themselves it would also seem to me that nasa needs a mission statement again i think um one of their recent uh i'm looking for it exactly what i'm talking about but uh where is it i don't know the point is is they keep talking about they seem obsessed with climate change which is fine let's be obsessed with that in other agencies maybe i'm not sure why nasa is but uh it doesn't seem like they have a clear mission again elon musk wants to go to mars bezos just wants to make money it seems like at the moment what the hell does nasa want to do uh you know and how is it going to excite the public i i think that's so important when we're talking about if we cared about getting funding for it for instance but i i've known i have no sense of what nasa wants and and and the idea and what so so first of all the charter that created nasa said one of its things was to study the planet earth so earth science does fall under nasa um in addition to all these other mandates that it has but you ask a very good question is what should a nasa in the 21st century look like because there's lots of people who still remember apollo and think that's what our space agency ought to be but the times are changing and so do you want your space agency to you know sort of project soft power like it did in order to counter china um do you want it to be augment the space force do you want to just study planet earth do you want it just to do planetary exploration you know how much do you want to lean into the private sector and and quite frankly dan there's no clear consensus and every time you get a new president sort of that vision changes a little bit what is the vision now i've never heard anything from this administration except uh let's destroy the destroy our interests in afghanistan besides that so what do they want to do with space have they made any well quite frankly this administration has largely embraced what the trump administration did within days of coming into office um jen saki the press secretary got up and said they supported the artemis program to go back to the moon and they also did not seek to unwind the space force now they have put more of an emphasis on climate change because that's a democratic priority that's all they do yeah we talk about but but they have not they have not changed attacked a whole lot okay so so nasa will continue in this sort of boots on the moon as uh steve as steve kerrell yeah as uh people really gotta watch space force it is an underappreciated uh series it's pretty damn good um steve steve grell is uh never disappoints um anyway but so boots on the moon by 2024 is how steve grill says it um and that seems that seems well and good there's there's strategic value in that um there seems to be just just the exploration itself the act of actually going out and exploring and going through the motions um seems to me to sim to be very supportive of the other mission set that space force would have uh which is more on the military side you know these these things collaborate quite well you know you mentioned wanting to inspire people right and and nasa is capable of doing that much more so i think than than most of their federal agencies but they they actually have to do stuff um and sending humans to the moon i think would be inspiring especially if we if we're keeping humans on the moon especially if we're keeping humans on the moon and normalizing it like now people are just used to you know having people living in space because they've been up there for 20 years tick tock videos of astronauts on the moon the funding would go through the room would go funding would go further at least you would get at least you would support the vision it's also important from a geopolitical standpoint because uh russia recently just signed sort of a a an agreement with china to go to the back to the moon to go to the moon with them like to build an international lunar station and the us and russia have collaborated in space for more than 20 years after the cold war basically that was one of the political things that had held us together that relationship the relations between nasa and ross cosmos the russian space agency is really kind of falling apart why is that what what happened well a couple things have happened but but i mean first of all putin is not happy you know really working with the united states and he's he seems to like us so much he like and and the person he put in charge of russia his is a former journalist i'm a journalist i'm not going to say anything bad about journalists but he's not a space expert um i'll say plenty of bad things about journalists no offense um he's dimitri rogison so he has sort of sought to to put turds in the punch bowl of that that relationship um and and and frankly the united states really doesn't need russia anymore yeah um and so russia kind of wants to go its own way and so they're they're sort of running toward china so it is important for nasa to lead and go back to the moon because we really want to bring our international partners with us europe australia japan canada uae partners in the middle east these are allies and we would like to sort of give them a much more um a mission a mission and something they'd like to be a part of rather than sort of partnering with china right just like hey let's just keep doing tours on the international space station and and watching plants grow or whatever it is we do up there right so so like the first mission to actually go to deep space is called the artemis ii mission it may go in 2023 2024 is going to have a canadian astronaut on it oh so deep space where are they going we're going around the moon basically it's a repeat of apollo 8. okay we just haven't done that a long time i haven't done that in 50 years no astronauts gone higher than like 400 miles you say we haven't done any deep space exploration so deep space just we sent out a bunch of sensors and things past you know right the the you know nowhere as the apollo program kind of wound down human exploration to low earth orbit that was the beginning of of space system space sources of exploration with robots so we've been the all the planets in the solar system uh the dwarf planets like pluto uh the asteroid belt uh we're going to jupiter's moon uh europa uh a lot of science fiction movies about europa what are we going to find there what do you think well you know i was pretty close with a former colleague of yours john culberson um and he was really the visionary behind that mission and got the funding and europa is this fascinating place because it's it's a moon around jupiter it's got an ice sheet several miles thick but beneath that there's more water on europa than there is in the oceans on earth and there's internal heating on europa so like you know we see life on around these vents seafloor vents in the oceans on earth and the thinking is there could very well be life on europa in the same manner an underwater sea monster like i think there's a movie called europa where they yeah i mean underwater sea monster we don't know we got to go and find out so so there's something going there right now it's going to launch in 2024 okay and it's going to land a few years it's not going to land it's going to it's just going to do about 38 flybys yeah okay all right then we'll see what goes on from there it's kind of fascinating and i think this is what people want to see i mean they want to see something new and so it's exciting that we're talking about that again at least um what would colonizing mars look like i mean how realistic is elon musk's dream on this so he started talking about settling mars back in 2002 when he founded the company and it seemed completely unrealistic back then and it still seems wild today but you've got to think about why we would send humans in space like what's the purpose of human exploration in space if you could send a robot to mars for 1 100 the cost why would you send a human to mars right for scientific reasons this is really not useful you might send them to the moon because it's inspirational but even then the cost is probably high so there's really only one reason why i think you would want to send humans to mars or beyond and that's with the eventual intent of settling our solar system and looking to worlds beyond ours and that may sound like sci-fi and it is science fiction but you know he is taking the first steps toward making that a reality um this starship vehicle that they're building in south texas with they've been blowing up and they've been you know trying to trying to get it right because what they're they're blowing them up because it's really hard you know they want to build a fully reusable first and second stage rocket that you could literally put dozens of people and send to the moon and to mars and just to give you an example of like how big of a difference this is does it look like a rocket or does it look like a plane it's a big tall shiny metal rocket and the upper stage has little flaps on it you could say her wings but it really looks like it's it looks like a 21st century spacecraft out of science fiction novel it looks similar to i think if there's a there's a series called mars which is actually really good and it's a mix between a documentary like a real documentary from modern times and then the sort of science fiction fiction uh from the future and they get to mars in this unlike an elon musk looking rocket that apparently sounds just like that okay yeah i'm just trying to visualize it for people like what should we be imagining here i mean this is a radically different capability if you had taken the lunar module back in the 1960s and said we just want to send cargo to the moon in that how much could you take and the answer was about five tons okay which is a lot but a lot yeah you could take starship and send it to the moon and if it works which it probably will it'll take 200 tons that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff that's a whole colony well not really like if you want if you want a little quality if you want to have a self-sustaining settlement on mars you need about a million tons on mars on mars but what about the moon well the moon moon i mean less because it's close by and you can resupply it the idea would be mars you'd probably like to be able to be self-sustaining there and okay so what does that look like what is a self-sustaining colony when you got a plants making oxygen like what how do what are we doing what are the basic requirements to make this happen and where's our technology at right so mars is far from a garden spot it's it's far less hospitable than the surface of mount everest or the surface of the tallest mountain in antarctica yeah um so you need you're probably living in domes yeah 100 um yeah i mean one of the questions i have about ever colonizing mars is what would that look like we just forever live in domes because it doesn't seem to me that how it doesn't seem all that realistic to geo engineer mars into something different yeah the geo engineering studies of of of making mars habitable there's no good answers like you know elon likes to wear a t-shirt called nuke mars where you would nuke the poles and make the atmosphere thicker he gets a lot of crap for that understandably but it's it you talk to physicists and they say i don't think it's going to work um what's the harm in trying what's the new thing there's nobody there so nuke our own deserts all the time why can't you nuke mars the problem is like there's nowhere else in the solar system that compares to earth right it's the only good planet to live on and there's no moons really that are good to live on either but if you believe dan that humans are destined if you believe in manifest destiny and humans are destined to sort of explore settle beyond you know at some point we're going to probably want to move beyond earth and mars is far from ideal but it's the best place to start and then from there you learn techniques and then you can maybe think about going to plants around other stores i think there's an inherent good in simply exploring and i think a lot of people can get behind that i mean you're always going to have your naysayers you know people were really mad that jeff bezos and all these guys and and um richard branson richard branson were going up and they're like why can these billionaires do this but we have all these problems here we're always going to have problems here so if that's your argument you'll never do anything um except expand our welfare state like that that's basically the argument um i don't think it's a very good one but you know it's not either or i don't either and that's right i mean these guys are not spending their money they're not launching rockets full of money to the moon right they're spending all that money on earth so they're employing people here yeah yeah that does get lost in it and you know they do pay taxes as it turns out um but but you know the resentment politics aside the bernie sanders politics aside um it is happening and i think there's a good there's a is it practical is that will have any practical benefit for a single person on earth for us to go to mars in this century maybe not but but there is something about it that i think is inspirational and good and that a lot of people would agree that we can get behind i think i think you either sort of fundamentally believe that humans are destined to settle beyond planet earth or not i mean this planet has a finite amount of resources um and and you know we have we're dealing with you know some environmental problems so if you could get all of your energy from the sun by putting you know solar panels at geostationary space and sending that power to earth and instead of strip mining africa for cobalt or rare earth metals if you could get that from asteroids and bring that back to earth yeah wouldn't that be better and so that's that's one of the promises of of commercial space is that look we have all these resources we need here on earth could we get them elsewhere and bring them back to earth because this is the best planet to live on there's no there's nowhere to close yeah no i think that's true i mean maybe it's hundreds of years away but you got to start that's exactly right you got to start somewhere um let's talk some specifics here it looks like nasa's working on this um within oh sorry hold on let's go back oh well related to so going back to what it takes to live on mars um this commercial lunar payload services initiative clips yep uh program so what this is for the moon this would be ostensibly if you want to live on mars as well can you just give somebody a give us a an idea of what that even means like again yeah and is the technology there living there it's just hard to get it all there the technology is there for living on the moon it's hard to get it there and we got to solve some problems but they are solvable problems clips is a great program you know we talked earlier about buying services and this was nasa saying okay you know we have a scientific like we want to build a rover and send it to the south pole of the moon and let it go in these these craters and see if there's actually ice there or water or what those resources because we've never explored those and they say we could we could build our own lander and launch it but it would it would probably cost us x you know billion dollars to do that instead what they've done is they've gone to the private sector and said okay look mastin or look you know there's a company called intuitive machines in houston and they're building lunar landers and they're selling that service to nasa and so they're taking private money and then they're going out and trying to win government contracts so clips basically is nasa putting its hand up in the air and saying we want to buy a ride for this payload in 2023 we're going to buy this in 2024 and we'll pay you what the defense industry does exactly what this is that's what space has become it's become the military complex that everybody that's what's about that's what nasa is trying to get to because it seems like it's a better model right it's just it's just more efficient um that's fascinating so but but can you talk any more specifics i mean what would it look like to live on the moon right now what would these modules what would these domes look like how do they get food how do they what does a self-sustaining colony look like so so nasa hasn't really released those plants but there's several routes you could go you could one thing you could do is take a pressurized module like we have on the international space station and just plunk those down on the lunar surface there's a company in italy called talus that builds those and they could build those for the moon you could also you know we could investigate the lava tubes on the moon which are basically underground large caves and you could make those habitable but we're gonna have to do some exploring to check those out and see what they're really like um and so you know we're not going to build a big lunar settlement right away but you could you know you got to go there and look at and do some exploring first before you finally decide on your architecture yeah so some of the big news over the weekend was pentagon is poised to unveil a space weapon declassifying it for the first time and space weapons are an important development against anything our adversaries might do that's one reason it's important second um they've been really classified weapons i mean they sound cool can you tell us what that even means like what are they even talking about and uh why is it significant for the pentagon to declassify is that is that a message being sent yes very much series yeah so you know space force is not you know is not is not marines on the moon like in like in the tv show maybe one day maybe one day maybe by the way we need to make this was my amendment that actually passed the house in the last ndia but then the senate got all grumpy about it to make space force use navy ranks instead of current air force ranks because you should not have a kernel of a starship it needs to be a captain well i have to agree with that one yeah all americans would agree on that because people are like what do you mean navy ranks and i'm like like star trek like start like like um star wars space balls everything everything in pop culture is navy ranks and that's how it should be in space force um but the air force got all upset about it but one day i will win this battle and they will they will transition to navy ranks it's canon so yeah that's for sure um so so what space force is right now what one of the main things that that they're trying to do is protect u.s assets in space and so we have the as you as you well know better than i do you know we have these very powerful satellites earth observing satellites military communications satellites um that basically allow our military to communicate to keep tabs on what our adversaries around the world are doing and strike back and you're getting command and control functions on some of these sophisticated satellites in space and so the number one priority of the space force is to protect those assets and over the last or in 2007 china demonstrated the capability to use an anti-satellite weapon basically filed a kinetic projectile from the surface of the earth and shot down one of its own satellites india did the same thing in 2019 and so these were these countries coming out and saying look we are emerging space powers and we have the capability to hit satellites can we do that no problem yes we can do that and so the united states has recognized that vulnerability and so they've been developing countermeasures right and those countermeasures could be like chaff on a satellite that scrambled a an interceptor it could be like um something on the ground to shoot those down it's not clear but but what the news that came out um recently in a breaking defense article was that for some time now general heightened and the chief of staff have been considering you know a demonstration of basically a space weapon and it's believed the space weapon would be basically some way to protect our own satellites whether that's like a laser on our own satellites that's already there and the idea would be that we would send a message to our adversaries that look okay it's great that you've developed these anti-space weapons and you're proud of them but we can protect ourselves so you really don't want to go shooting or wasting your money you don't want to get into shooting war with us that's interesting um yeah and there's strategic value in declassifying that and doing doing um such a demonstration um i think especially now because um things aren't great for the united states when it comes to just our standing and um people's certainty that we will that we will defend our interests yeah it's a it's a problem at the moment um let's don't want to cover here we've covered that we've covered the natural resources you know one thing um i have a question on this gets into what i do deal with on my committee which is 5g coverage and should we should we build fiber optic cable everywhere in the united states even if it's like miles miles of fiber optic cable for five people to have internet out in the rural areas or is there a better way to do it um with low earth satellites and um you know curious what your thoughts are on that i mean talking about elon musk's starlink program which would do that it's his provided internet to everybody solution but it requires thousands of these little satellites and is something like that realistic i mean how can we even track all the satellites out there now is it getting to be too crowded i know if you if i think you probably go online and find um a tracker of all the things in space and it's kind of overwhelming um granted you zoom in and maybe it's less overwhelming there's still a lot of space out there but i mean what's what's the truth there so it's a complicated issue um and we're about to find out because spacex is launching those satellites they've launched um more than 600 this year alone so do they have to check with anybody yeah they have to get they have to get faa approval for their launches they have to get the fcc approval um basically to expand their constellation um but that's dfcc fcc federal cc federal communications commissions but they've been fairly permissive like unless you're like really going to do obvious harm they're going to permit you to go and it's not just spacex you know amazon with project kuiper is looking to do this telesat in canada is doing it one web a uk company has launched several hundred satellites they're not going after the consumer market but they're going after enterprise and governments and china is going to do their own leo low earth orbit satellite internet network and and so these constellations are coming and it's going to be a major problem because we've already seen an uptick in potential collisions with all of these starlink satellites going up you know for comparison spacex now offer operates more satellites in space than any country or any company in the world and they just started launching these a couple of years ago so these are how big are these low earth um they're about 350 pounds about the size of a mini refrigerator um and they can send up about 60 of them at a time on a falcon 9 rocket and they all i mean that service is is a real thing it's already happening now there are some they don't have their full constellation so there's some dropouts but like there's um you know tribes and alaska inuits who are getting internet like that they didn't have before and it was very useful during the pandemic because they were going to online school but if you're on the internet how do you do online school how do they how do they like sign up for that internet how do they do that you get you can you can order starlink terminals like you can go online to spacex and order terminal it's like it's like a couple hundred bucks and then you you pay you know a monthly fee and if they serve your area you can you can sign up and as they say as they're building out their constellation they'll serve basically all of the world in a few years huh so that that is that is a good thing because you don't have to put 5g or cable or whatever towers everywhere and someone can just have a little terminal get this service but it does create very real issues with debris and i don't have a concrete answer for you um other than you know from a policy standpoint one thing we really need to be focused on is making sure that the department of defense has the tools it needs to track all of these satellites and to track potential debris and make sure we're you know making you know these cl avoiding these collisions and some of that policy was hammered out under the national space council that was instituted during the trump administration and that's continuing under the body administration although they haven't met yet but that's that's something i'd be very concerned about because commercial space is very important to the future of the united states but if we render low earth orbit a cloud of debris you've just completely shut down what is low earth orbit how many what height so low earth orbit is from about 60 miles up which is where the atmosphere basically stops to about you know maybe one or two thousand miles up so it's it's you know after that you get the middle earth orbit then not the geostationary okay are these low earth satellites uh geostationary as well geostationary is much higher it's about 30 000 miles and that's where basically they're falling around the earth as rapidly these earth is rotating so they're always looking down at the same spot right so so okay so this network that elon musk puts out there it's intermittent because it's not geostationary right and then and that was like the key technology breakthrough is is if if the satellites are zipping overhead like you've got to make sure that one is passing off to the next and so you need to really you need interconnected laser links and you need lots of satellites and so they're solving those problems like it's it's getting much better so where do they have coverage right now above like did they cover like a latitude then yeah is that the goal like they cover a specific latitude a string of constant coverage yeah right now like above 50 degrees latitude is is pretty good coverage um but and they're sort of bringing that down as well where's 50 degrees it's like canada northern united states why is he giving this to canada what's going on it's it's complicated um orbital dynamic stuff that i don't fully understand well i guess you need less satellites the higher latitude you are i think that's maybe part of it you know and they have put up about i think 1600 satellites so far um and they've got a ways to go they want to put up like eventually like 10 000 or more it's fascinating um okay so texas is i guess last on his list fine um all right let's talk about let's let's wrap this up with uh what the hell is going on with ufos or you ate uaps whatever yeah um what do you think of the the pentagon report the the ic report which basically said oh we don't know anything i think they don't know anything i think there are lots of interesting sightings all the time and pretty much all of them can probably be explained by you know things we don't know about birds or or you know you know classified technology i do think it's useful that we are looking into this and i do think it's useful that the pub government is acknowledging that it is um and so i think transparency is the answer here um the problem is you've got a certain group of people who think it's ufos regardless and i guess that's okay but there's just you know if you're going to make a grand claim that there's a another species out there in space that's spying on us you better have pretty good evidence yeah well okay so do you think it's a higher chance because i mean some of these some of these videos some of this evidence there's there's no way that there's some natural uh explanation for that you know the tic-tac moving around off the coast of san diego same with um some of these these sightings uh off the coast of virginia by navy pilots so is it you think it's more likely that it's just a classified um piece of equipment but then are we just we're just not going to tell anybody about it and we can't seem to get any reports on that either i mean if you can't get that answer dan i can't get that answer i can't it's very frustrating that's why congress made them give it to us and we still don't have it yeah the report was the report was very disappointing yeah and it was just like we don't know anything and um you know i don't think they can do that if it's not true uh i don't and uh i i mean you would think the president would know and and trump definitely would have tweeted about it by now if he had something if he if he found evidence i think he would have been felt compelled to share i mean it's it's just it begs the question like what are the possibilities there um what do you think of uh what do you think of like you know joe rogan's interview with bob lazar what do you what does that strike you as um i mean it's just it's it's i like to come from a a point of like you know carl sagan said if you're going to have great claims require great evidence and these are pretty great claims and so you better have pretty great evidence to back them up you know we have we have now explored the moon pretty well we've explored you know mars the surface of mars we've sent satellites around that to look at it and so we've seen no real evidence of of other people's or other you know other civilizations you know out there um i think it's it's the galaxy's a big place and one of the great things we've found out over the last decade thanks to thanks to a nasa technology program um is that there's all kinds of planets earth-sized worlds out there so like literally billions and billions of earth-sized worlds around stars that could harbor life in our galaxy so i think there's probably life out there um i've yet you know and we've been listening for it uh with seti and other projects like that we haven't heard any definitive evidence you know i i would need to see some pretty compelling evidence to believe that these you know these other life forms are here but i certainly think it's possible yeah and um and you know what's their intentions because it's as if they they're they make it they make it very obvious that they're there but they still don't like give us a real hard evidence like hey no really we're here hello you know they still don't do that as elon musk said in the famously in the joe rogan interview well they're very serious it's like i don't believe i don't really think about them they're very subtle if they're out there and joe's like you've wanted to go to mars for 20 years you don't think about aliens you know and i'm thinking that's exactly what a real alien would say and uh i mean i utilized joe rogan about it he'll say oh no elon musk is absolutely an alien and i think i think he's only a quarter joking there so i've written i've written a book about spacex and i spent a lot of time around elon for that book um and he is a unique human being like he's super smart right i mean i've interviewed uh stephen hawking four times like i've been around smart people but elon is like you know pretty pretty up there and he marries that with like this insane work ethic and he's like always working i mean he's not doing it to buy a you know half billion dollar mega yacht like jeff bezos he's doing it because like he does want to go to march like that's his vision um so he's not he's an alien but he's definitely and and different from most human beings yeah well that's clear um yeah well we'll just keep waiting on those answers i guess uh maybe we just okay you know nasa nasa is may take that under their purview like looking for for for somebody's got to i mean i think there's i think space force is taking that under its purview but really from a investigation defense you know i don't think they're doing a whole lot yeah i'm not sure what there is to do necessarily it's unclear to me well we're looking right we've got we've got radio telescopes that are listening for signs and you know we but you really can we can't really go out to them yet so they would have to come here and you asked about their intentions i think their intentions would be bad i mean if you you invested all of the time and effort to come to a world around another planet chances are you want something just buzz around buzz around our military installations in new mexico and off the coast chances are you want some resource here and it's probably not a resource we want to give up so yeah yeah well that's a scary thought um and what's interesting too is it let's say these things buzzing off the coast of san diego are alien spacecraft they know that we see them i mean they're they're so much more advanced than we are just based on how these aircraft are moving um they must know and they don't seem to care it's just it's just odd you know it's it is this sort of um it's just a strange situation that it's inexplicable yeah and maybe it is maybe it is just human technology that is extremely advanced that nobody wants to talk about um but if even congress can't get that information then i'm not really i i don't know maybe we just have to believe that they actually don't know what it is which is kind of frightening as well i think that's possible but they don't know what it is well we remain unsatisfied on that question absolutely eric thanks so much for being on this is really enlightening for a lot of people who probably haven't been looking into this issue at all so thank you oh my pleasure dan thanks so much

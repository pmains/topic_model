Michigan is recognized to close debate Thank You mr. speaker I appreciate the opportunity to come and try to clarify some of the assertions and and and confused claims that have been thrown out here you know my family has been involved in construction since the 1930s the 1930s and I will never forget the day it was a Thursday when I pulled up right down the street from my home and I saw my cousin's business that they now on that my dad and uncle and grandfather had started it's a ready mix concrete company and literally all the guys trucks were there other pickups the small company about 12 15 people at work there and every single one of those cement College cement trucks were parked in the yard the exact place that they should not be and I found out later that we had trucks on the way to construction sites that were turned around and came back that's seared into my memory I have no wrist going back to where we had had been in fact I was one of those warning about the the practices before serving in this body and frankly if those who were serving in this body who wrote dodd-frank had actually talked to a few of the people involved in the industry they might have understood what the interaction is between the buyer the seller the construction agent the closer the the people that are providing title insurance the simple fact is is that there is not an understanding of how this system works and we may have a common goal of serving consumers we have very different visions about how that needs to be done as I said there's been lots of assertions and sort of confused claims thrown around many of them frankly our problems completely unrelated to what this is and I'm not sure how the activity of the Transportation Committee relates exactly to what our work is on the Financial Services Committee but i think it's a it's an old adage when you're losing keep talking all right and that that is what's been happening here on the floor for those that have been watching the assertion that week and non-existent state regulations are out there is just amazing to me especially in California I'm betting the insurance commissioner in California would be surprised at this assertion since California is one of the 47 states that regulates title insurance respa laws disclosure requirements written into law transparency is a key element to this I was a licensed realtor when when agency disclosure first came in this was in the this was in the mid 90s you had to declare whether your buyer's agent a seller's agent a transactional coordinator there have been real changes positive changes that have happened for the consumer in that in that industry over the last 20 to 25 years the irony in this particular situation is that affiliated companies companies that may have been started by the same people that's the definition by the way so i might be a small business owner owns a who owns a real estate company and i start another company dealing with title insurance that now because thats on my personal tax form is an affiliated company I can't do or charge what an unaffiliated company could do now I might buy the argument that was that was made earlier that that you know these companies can just charge whatever they want to charge but I could only buy that if my friends on the other side of the aisle would be willing to apply equally the law the law does not apply equally here it does not do what they claim that they're trying to do you know the other element is it's been talked about a little bit this is so ridiculous it strikes me it's like saying I can't shop at Walmart or at a meijer store in our area or other places because they sell fresh produce and electronics and hardware so I need to go to a hardware store to go pick up my nails I need to go to the corner grocer to pick up my lettuce and by the way if I want to get a flat screen TV I got to go somewhere else this is about consumers having choices and abilities to to you too a streamlining those costs are need to be disclosed first of all those costs oftentimes are regulated vast majority of times are regulated by the states yet it just is a clunky system that does not work in the design of dodd-frank the assertion that any change of dodd-frank is somehow benefits mazzanti consumer or benefits somebody on Wall Street go and talk to those owners of those small companies in all of our state's go and talk to them about that about what their Wall Street option is and you know this bill is frankly widely viewed as unrealistic and unworkable and it's time that we face that reality and we change some of the elements of this this is a modest modest change and in fact it's so modest frankly that mr. mr. speaker that that our previous speaker had supported the bill had supported it when it was in committee had supported it when it was on the house floor certainly did not object to it well and I guess maybe I could say supported it because on August first of 2014 I'd like to insert this for the record mr. speaker objection so she along with 12 of her colleagues including one who has gone on to the Senate 12 Democrats signed a letter to Senator Harry Reid requesting him to take my bill up my bill and Congressman Meeks bill was a good bill last Congress and it's a good bill this Congress because it has not changed at all it has not changed at all you at all and it to quote it she urged the Senate to quickly adopt the mortgage choice act the bill that would improve access to credit and quote enhanced competition among title insurance providers frankly mr. speaker my colleague was right last time and she should be right on this Congress and unfortunately we're seeing that I'm afraid politics may have leaked in the administration is issued a veto threat and I think we may have seen why some of this change of heart has happened and i'm frankly disheartened for the American people that presidential politics have already leaked into but this with this body should be doing which is representing people which is making sure that they are getting the best end of the stick not the sharp end of the stick and frankly dodd-frank has delivered the sharp end of the stick intentionally or unintentionally way too many times it's our job to go and fix it and to make sure that the consumers that our constituents are getting the best service possibly can and with that Mr Mr Speaker I would like to urge all of my colleagues to join so many of us in a bipartisan fashion who support this bill who believe that this is the right time and the right bill to to rectify this problem and to get on with it and with that I'd like to request all of my colleagues to support HR 685 with that I yield back the balance of my time

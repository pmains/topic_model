two years ago the United States capital was breached by an angry and violent mob for the first time since 1814. it's a day I'll never forget that dark day threatened the pillars of our democracy and led to the death of law enforcement officers first and foremost I want to recognize the tragic loss of life as a result of that violent attack at least seven people died as a result of the Insurrection more than 100 other officers were severely injured those who defended our democracy that day are heroes and my thoughts continue to be with them and their loved ones as well as with the civilians who died that day I hope with the what we can all do is recognize that as Americans we're better than the events of that day our country couldn't move forward from the tragic events of January 6 without understanding how and why it happened the bipartisan January 6 committee did incredible work to uncover much of what happened on that day and leading up to it and I applaud their efforts to hold those involved accountable everyone involved in the attempt to overthrow our government must be brought to Justice no one is above the law so as we reflect on the second anniversary of January 6th we must remember that our Constitution and our democracy must never be taken for granted we must come together and uphold the values that unite US democracy Justice and equality so I wait to get sworn into the 118th Congress I promise I'll do everything in my power to help guide our country toward a better future I commit to always defend and protect our Constitution and Democratic institutions as our oath demands

in our national lead america's drugs are opening up today about the nation's worsening drug epidemic today he spoke with our dr sanjay gupta about the skyrocketing drug overdose death rate in the united states we have to look at this as an unacceptable number it's unprecedented and we must have a response that matches that historic number in terms of saving lives from april april 2020 to april 2021 more than 100 000 americans died of drug overdoses and three quarters of those were fentanyl deaths 20 year old eli weinstock is part of this devastating record in march he died after taking a legal unregulated herbal drug that was though he did not know it laced with fentanyl that's what we believe his mother dr beth weinstock and his uncle democratic congressman ted deutch of florida uh join us now and under horrible circumstances um but i do admire taking a tragedy and trying to turn it into something positive we have some people on our staff that have lost kids to cancer and are trying to be active uh in trying to help other future kids so let me start with you uh dr weinstein your son eli he was a sophomore here in washington at american university uh when he died tell us a little bit about eli and what you know of what led to the the overdose well eli was a sophomore at american and he was doing great he had a 3.7 gpa he interned at the spanish education development center here in washington um and he was on his way he had just joined a fraternity and the circumstances are rather unclear to us at this point we know that he had kratom and fentanyl in his body when he died he died suddenly in the shower one night when he was getting ready to go out with some friends and and he was a kid who would never have taken something intentionally that had fentanyl in it he did not intend to die just like the 70 000 approximately people who have died from synthetic opioids in the last year when you say he had he had kratom what is that kratom is an herbal supplement originally from southeast asia but it can produce some opioid-like qualities it's a calming substance and i was unaware that eli would have taken kratom but it is legal in washington d.c okay and congressman clearly this issue hits close to home um but you're also a member of congress um so what are you doing to try to reverse these horrific terrifying overdose numbers well first of all jake um we're making sure that people understand that this is an emergency and that it is more likely than not closer to them than they know right there is there are efforts in congress to to focus on fentanyl the fentanyl that comes from china uh comes across the border from mexico that's a piece of it there's a commission that is putting together a high-level commission with the secretary of homeland security secretary of state and others putting together a strategy that will come out in february but more than anything else it's helping people understand yeah what's happening there are kids who buy what they believe is prescription xanax or adderall sometimes from their friends sometimes on snapchat sometimes on tick tock that can be laced with with uh and and too often is laced with fentanyl and it's deadly the lethal dose of fentanyl can fit on the tip of a pencil and the dea administrator announced when they they announced the seizure of 10 million pills every one of them deadly that the drug as as she put it uh the drug dealer is no longer on the corner it's in your pocket social media companies need to do more as well and and that's that's one of the things and one of the reasons why um you guys are here to educate people because there are kids obviously eli was one of them who think they're taking something harmless and it's not uh one of the bills you're co-sponsoring which is the stop fentanyl act it only has one republican co-sponsor right now are people not aware of this i mean it's not like republicans are in favor of fentanyl i mean what's going on right there there's a lot that we need to do that that bill is one piece of uh part of it is is uh destigmatizing opioid the opioid use addictions and substance abuse disorders overuse of disorders and substance abuse disorders but we also need to deal with harm reduction we need kids to be educated which is what beth's doing so that they're in a position yes we have to pass legislation but we also have to to make available and this is something that we're also doing through legislation to try to make available uh things like fentanyl test strips so that kids are in a position to take precautions to save their lives tell us about that because i know that's important to you dr weinstein yeah so about nine months after i'm sorry about three months uh six months after eli died we started an organization called birdie light and the purpose of the organization is to get in front of kids because there's a huge knowledge gap here kids from time eternal have tried things but what they're not realizing now is that the stuff they used to try more than likely has fentanyl in it and when i get in front of kids i find out that they don't know this so for example we went to a group of kids at american and back in ohio where we live and we said how many of you know that cocaine can have fentanyl in it and only a two out of three knew that information so 30 of kids don't know that cocaine can have fentanyl in it and it's the same numbers for the pills that that ted mentioned the fake xanax the fake adderall the methamphetamine fake oxycodones kids don't know this and neither do parents so when we survey parents their numbers are even worse they're completely unaware that these pills that they can get from their friend in the dorm could be laced with fentanyl well hopefully those who are just watching right now are aware of this and they can tell people too and we will continue to try to help you guys spread the word i'm jake i hope they'll go to the birdie light website what is it where is it birdielight.org b-i-r-d-i-e-l-i-g-h-t dot org and eli's name is right in the middle of it all right well god bless and hopefully may his memory be a blessing and hopefully some good will come from this horrible horrible experience our hearts go out to you thank you so much for being here today thanks jake

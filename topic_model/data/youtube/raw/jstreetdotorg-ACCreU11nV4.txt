[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what a group Thank You senator slow news day today you may have noticed this morning President Trump announced that the US military conducted an operation to take out upper Bakr al Baghdadi the head of Isis clap for that curious if you had any reaction to two Baghdadi's demise or you know the way this operation unfolded based on early reports well I think it is good for our country good for the world he was a heinous terrorist responsible for the death of so many innocent people and I think it's important to say that today but I also think it's important to talk more broadly about what's going on and what just happened over the last few weeks with Syria and the president's policy and what has happened and and Ben is aware of this during the last few years of the Obama administration and I know you worked on this as well as the last year's under the Trump administration our military and the people that were stationed there have worked with the Kurds and worked to reduce the ISIS presence there in a major way and that was a really good thing the Kurds lost over 11,000 people and to think that this president then with one phone call from air Dhawan made this decision to leave our allies for slaughter leave this area a void to be filled in by Russia and despite the important work that was done with regard to Alba get el alba gap bagatti what they just did despite that the fact is that 100 over 100 and this is according to the head of our Defense Department over 100 Isis fighters got out there's a prison that no one seems to know who's guarding right now and there is just big trouble ahead because of the foot hole that Iran is now going to have in Syria so when you think of it from Israeli perspective and you think of it from the perspective of our allies once again this president has chosen to let Russia have a lead and then has again backed away from our allies it's a pattern that we see all over the world it's what we saw that he did when he believes Putin over his own intelligence heads it's what we saw that he did when he got us out of the International climate change agreement leaving our world and leaving every single country in that agreement except the US and when you sell you how he dealt with kim jeong-hoon where he thought he could just bring a hot dish to his dictator next door and try to make a deal when in fact he had no focus on what those results should be so let's talk about the us-israel relationship so the first pieces of legislation in the Senate drafted was s1 which was a whole bunch of legislation this were squeezed together funding for Israel some of Jordan I believe and then it also included the combating BDS act which was designed to give States legal cover for laws that they have passed it forbids state entities from contracting or investing with entities that boycott Israel it's basically you know let's States punish companies that participate in BDS some of your opponents in this race like Bernie Sanders have said that s one violates the First Amendment rights the ACLU has taken no position on BDS generally but has said that they believe that boycotts are protected speech do you disagree with that argument well first of all you know I voted for that bill and I did it because it included the 38 billion dollars of aid to Israel and when I voted the for the Iranian nuclear agreement which I thought was very important to the security of our world and I know Ben and I talked about this at the time as I also talked with President Obama one of the things that was most important to me and that I publicly stated at the time is given that Iran was going to get some funding release and money released out of this that we made sure that we continued the funding for Israel so that was my primary reason for voting for that as was a number of other senators that I think you liked in this room including many J Street and d'Or senators when they voted for it now the BDS portion while it did say that it would not violate the First Amendment I think that it would have been much better to use some of the negotiation that was going on at the time involving some other bills and other things we could have done and to me that boat while it was a difficult one for a lot of people it just showed to me what Mitch McConnell is trying to do all the time instead of bringing people together for support of Israel and a bipartisan basis he and president Trump are always looking for those wedges a way to do things that creates wedges instead of bringing people together and I think it has been very negative and I'm not just talking about one vote I'm talking about how the Prime Minister's visit was handled as everyone remembers that I'm talking about how President Trump has supported some of the Prime Minister's moves and claims during the election that I disagreed with and I think all of this is resulting in a loss of support for Israel that's very bad as someone that views Israel as our beacon of democracy as I said in the debate in the Mideast in an incomparably tough neighborhood I think it is important that we build support in the u.s. and the way I would do it as president is to not only focus on a two-state solution but also to emphasize and bring in some of the good work that Israel has done when comes to climate change and renewable energy when it comes to women's rights in a neighborhood where a lot of those other countries are not respecting women's rights in the same way that Israel does and I think it's really important to bring young people into this discussion and talk about this in a different way and it has been just heartbreaking to me the way this president has responded and is actually whittled away at support for Israel while he claims that he's trying to support Israel I would be a much different voice and one of my major policy priorities would be to bring back that kind of support for Israel that is so important for the future of Israel and our relations with Israel so you know one of the issues you just touched on was Iran and you know you were a very important supporter of the Iran deal in the Senate you deserve a lot of credit for that and J Street too helped us I I didn't to ask you you know you've said that you support trying to secure an expanded nuclear agreement that goes beyond the provisions in the current deal I think one very important question and I think everybody you know would agree that it would be better to have you know certain other provisions added on to it the question I have is would you though approach that as something you would do after you re-enter if we could get back into the jcpoa the Iran nuclear agreement and get those protections back in place which Iran has started to violate after we pulled out would you try to start from the foundation of let's go back into the existing deal and then negotiate add-on provisions or would you seek instead to negotiate a new agreement I'm trying to picture what you would say if you're up here and President Obama was still in the White House I think I'm only smiling because I think it's very important that we don't negotiate on stage before I'm even president but I do think that we need to get back in that agree and I think one of the things that would be good to change there's a sunset provisions and now that we have had a few years before President Trump precipitously took us out of that agreement and in doing so I left our allies in Europe holding the bag and gave all this leverage to China and to Russia which is the last thing we should be doing that we must start those negotiations again to get back in the agreement and I don't think any of the outcomes that we've seen in the last few months should be a surprise whether it was what Iran has been doing when it came the reported attacks on Saudi Arabia the oil field or when it's come to some of these other things none of it should be a surprise and the irony that he took 150 troops out of Syria that were helping protect our allies and then had added has added thousands of troops because of his decision to get out of the Iranian agreement and what that has caused for a risk of security is something that I look forward to debating him on the stage about because I don't think he has made America safer he certainly hasn't made Israel safer he's made both countries less safe you're one of the obviously we're in this much more difficult status quo now you know with Iran having begun to recommit nuclear material threatening to take other steps one of the difficult things confronting anybody walking into that office is going to be the hit to us credibility from withdrawing from all the agreements that you mentioned and to deal with the wrong piece of this you obviously still need to work with the European countries Russia and China how do you how do you approach the issue of restoring credibility with those countries that that we can be trusted to keep agreements that they should get behind the u.s. leadership on a complicated piece of business like the Iran nuclear agreement where Russia might have a different interests of ours but we frankly need their or would benefit from their cooperation but what is the and how do we get our allies in Europe to trust that they follow us leadership again you know we won't do what we did last time which is pull out I mean what how would you approach this issue of the Iran agreement in particular but more broadly you know how do we restore that credibility that the United States is somebody who can be trusted to keep agreements first of all you show your allies that you have their backs and time and time again he hasn't done that I was thinking of the recent tweet oh one thing I'd stop is the mean tweets okay that would be the first thing the the second thing is when you think about what he did just recently with Isis when he said well yeah they're not going to attack us maybe they go to Europe seriously how do you think France felt how do you think these other countries felt but President Trump did that so I think it's going to be really important as I've said in my first 100 days I would go and meet with these leaders go to these countries because I think that we need to repair our reputation around the world we need to repair our own diplomatic core and our State Department that he has brought down to a place where I don't think they ever thought they'd been so many of them have worked there through Republican presidents and Democratic presidents and while they may have had their own personal view about these presidents they always felt that their job was to represent their country and they would do that and he has really torn away at the core of what being a diplomat is all about as we've seen recently from the testimony from some of the diplomats that have come forward so I think building up the State Department and making clear to those other countries around the world that you're going to have a professional State Department putting in ambassadors that are trusted in those countries making sure that we re-enter these agreements and I mentioned not just the Iran agreement but the climate change agreement and you know when he got us out of that agreement there were only two countries that weren't in it Nicaragua and Syria they are now in the agreement so we are the only ones knotted and as we are seeing such a threat to our world security with the fires you're seeing right now in California but rising floods the floods that we just saw in the middle of the country this is not just anymore something that's just happening on the coast it's happening all over the US and all over the world the Russian nuclear agreement so we know Russia was cheating but yet he got us out of that agreement without even trying to negotiate back into the agreement and we're going to have the new start agreement coming up right at the beginning of the term of a new president these are all things you could do to build credibility with our allies and then the last thing that I would say is just the rhetoric against people in our own country and across the world I remember at the height of the campaign the last presidential campaign when I heard the story at actually at a mosque in Minneapolis of a family that went out to dinner at that time and this guy walks by and the parents had never experienced any discrimination even during 9/11 they had told us and they were at dinner with her two young kids and this guy walks by and he says you four go home you go home to where you came from they're Somalis and the little girl looked up at her mom and she said mom I don't want to go home for dinner you said we could eat out tonight you think of the words of that innocent child she only knows one home that's my state she only knows one home that is our country and as we see this rise of anti-semitism and we see this white nationalism and we see the hate crimes against all communities including the Muslim community the Jewish community really anyone that looks different at some point you have to hold people responsible for the rhetoric and how that has filtered down to people that have these instincts to begin with and so I think one of the things we could really do to bring the world with us and to reach out is to actually start right at home in how we treat our own citizens and our own immigrants in our own country so recently senator Warren and mayor Pete Budaj as said they were open to the idea of conditioning some US assistance to Israel if Israel either annexes the West Bank or or if there's continued settlement construction we know that Bibi Netanyahu has talked about annexing the Jordan Valley data collected in East Jerusalem shows a spike in settlement construction would you be open to conditioning aid or withholding ada's leverage to prevent annexation or or stop settlement construction again I think we are at this moment in time where it's not a good idea to negotiate these things right now but let me be very clear in how strongly I believe that that promise that the prime minister made during his political campaign was wrong that he was going to annex a third of the West Bank also the Golan Heights and what he did there I disagreed with that and I also strongly disagreed when he at president Trump's urging said that members of Congress couldn't even visit Israel and I appreciated J Street AIPAC really all the Jewish groups standing up and saying this was wrong but time and time again we've seen actions and words that actually hurt us for it moving to a two-state solution and for me what we need to do is to get a new president number one number two be very clear that as part of our foreign policy and goal of a two-state solution with which the Prime Minister and the president have not emphasized in fact the Prime Minister some point backed away from as we as we move toward our foreign policy goal that we play a leadership role that we look at the economics of this and tie that in with the political solution and one of the things that has bothered me so much with the chaos the president is caused by getting out of the Iranian agreement and boy what he just did in Syria and how his conducted foreign policy it's made it much harder to focus on getting a two-state solution and focus our State Department resources our diplomatic for our economic focus internationally on getting this done as well as by the way dealing with the China because he keeps causing blow ups all over the world even when he doesn't need to so that's how I would do it and I think we have to negotiate with strength and we should do it from a position of strength I think getting back into the Iranian nuclear agreement would also be a good sign as we look at this negotiation and standing up for Kurds and other minorities as well time for one more yeah sure you know what one way to think about this generally beyond just a specific of conditioning assistance is I think there's been a kind of fairly predominant view around the two-state solution that kind of one of the roles of the United States was to make Israel feel confident and supported so that it was comfortable moving forward with that type of negotiation in other words to provide as much security support and try to address this really concerns rather than using any particular pressure on Israel and I think it's pretty clear that that has not borne out that essentially settlement construction is expanded you the Prime Minister of Israel has become increasingly you know from talking about the need for a two-state solution 2009 to saying it won't happen on its watch and obviously we don't know who will be the prime minister in 2021 but I guess what the question I have is you know towards the end Barre entity bomb ministration for instance we abstained on the resolution on settlements at the UN we we put out some US positions which the Israeli government has not wanted us to do in the past on issues around Jerusalem the final status issues if you have an Israeli government that is not showing any seriousness in pursuing a Palestinian state do you think that the US pressure whether its aid diplomacy what is the balance between trying to exert some pressure on this issue to get them to take concrete steps towards a Palestinian state versus a status quo that is kind of more step back and left this to Israeli leaders to make this I know I don't think we want the status quo I think that we want to get a two-state solution and we want peace and there should be a way to get there but time and time again it gets held up we know what's been going on I remember being in stare out the first time I went there and seeing being in front of standing in front of a house where there was a hole in the roof because a rocket had been launched and it went right through the middle of a kitchen table where a girl was doing her homework and luckily there been an alert system and she got to the side and it seems like every time we've been closed something happens and I think you need a president that's willing to put that kind of pressure and again I'm not going to commit right now to what that pressure is but it's very obvious we need to have serious discussions with the US in the lead to get this done because the Trump administration what they had that summit where neither party came okay well that's not that helpful and I just don't think they've been in any place where they could have negotiated this when I went to Israel a few years back and what with the Prime Minister I was the one in our delegation that also went to meet with the Palestinians I thought it was really important to do that and I think it is not necessarily always it's not necessarily going to always be exactly the that you're going to identify at the outset what leverage you're going to use but a lot of it is how you handle this and what you talk about and the fact that you're willing to negotiate in the region but I just think allowing Iran to have a foothold in Syria I will say this again with Russia does not make Israel any safer and getting out of that agreement did not make Israel safer and that is why I am so wedded right now to make sure that we are continuing the aid and I think that this president has actually made things more unsafe and one other thing that I that we didn't bring up today was that this is the actual anniversary of the tree of life synagogue shooting and to take a moment to think about that and the rise of anti-semitism and what we need to do to get to a better point in this country and I have been actually really proud of what we've done in my state and it's a model for me with our rabbis working with the Muslim community has been a really big deal and we did my favorite was during the Superbowl when it was in Minnesota we actually had this viral video where a rabbi very popular rabbi in our state threw a pass down the field to an imam who caught it and it went viral but on all of our a lot of our synagogues in the Twin Cities when it's Ramadan they have signs up that say happy Ramadan we have done a lot of education of communities including Catholic churches evangelical churches other churches on different faiths and we've really made this a priority in our state and when calls were made to the Jewish community centers threats bomb threats and they had to evacuate in the middle of a cold day with little kids who had been in a swimming pool and senior citizens when they got back from what they called their walk in the wilderness the first message on there on their messages was a message from the Islamic center asking if they needed a place to meet so those are things that I always cherish and I will bring with me if I'm so honored to be the president because I think this has to be a lot more of this discussion if we are going to be able to lead internationally not just on the two-state solution but on all of these issues regarding world peace and you can't do it if you can't talk the talk at home senator Klobuchar thank you so much for being here and for your work in the Senate to push for a smarter foreign policy that emphasizes diplomacy and not more military adventures than the Middle East senator Klobuchar ok thank you thank you [Music]

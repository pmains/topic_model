can ask for two minutes Thank You mr. speaker Thank You mr. chairman for the time and certainly for your leadership on this issue I rise today in support of this bill to make permanent the tax cuts for families and small businesses we passed last year through the tax cuts and Jobs Act I'm particularly pleased the bill also makes permanent the grain glitch fix we enacted last spring this important provision ensures producers and buyers across agriculture could benefit from tax reform as intended this bill also continues the treatment of property taxes on AG land and in property as a fully deductible business expense which is vital to Ag producers in Nebraska's third congressional district as well as across the country the initial version of tax reform we moved out of the Ways and Means Committee and passed in this house last year provided permanent tax relief for our families farmers ranchers and small businesses and they deserve the certainty of knowing their taxes will not increase I'm disappointed we couldn't get the permanence through the Senate last year but I'm pleased we have another opportunity to do so this year our economy is booming with economic growth continuing above 3% and the certainty of permanence will allow our small businesses to make future investments and for families to know they can keep more of their paychecks as well as plan for the future I urge strong support for this bill and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back gentleman from Texas

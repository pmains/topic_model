hello everyone [Applause] my name is Ricky Baker coy and I am a fifth year at the University of Chicago for I am completing a master's in Middle East Studies I have been involved with J Street u since my second year of college basically since I first learned of the organization last year I served as vice president for the Midwest to the J Street u student board and this year I am an organizing fellow I wanted to share a little bit of why I'm involved with all of you in 1995 there was a giant peace demonstration planned in tel-aviv in support of the Oslo Accords my parents brought me their six month old infant to the rally they believed it would be a momentous occasion for the history books a major milestone in the peace process the two-state solution was right around the corner characteristically my dad didn't want to stay for the song at the end of the rally but also characteristically my mom really wanted to so they negotiated and we left as the song began as we walked to meet my grandparents at a cafe closeby shots rang out like many young Israelis Palestinians and pro-peace Americans I grew up in the echo of those shots that killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin my generation doesn't remember successful peace processes we've seen too many wars and bouts of violence we agonize over the current situation in Gaza and more often than not a two-state solution seems impossibly far away so my family left Israel in the fall of 2000 and immediately I was thrust into American politics with mock Bush vs. gore elections in kindergarten my parents would bring me and my sister to the election booths each Election Day we would be told which levers to pull which boxes to fill my parents would describe the candidates and their parties politics don't seem as bleak when you have a firm belief in the democratic process in 2015 I attended the J Street conference as a young progressive israeli-american college student J Street was my clear choice for a better future I was mostly looking forward to hearing from Israeli Palestinian and US politicians and decided to stay for advocacy day intoxicated by the mere idea of spending time on the hill and meeting with politicians who in my mind had the power to change everything that Tuesday one of my meetings was with senator dick durbin I was blown away not only were there over a thousand college students and 3,000 total attendees at the conference who shared my values and my vision for tomorrow but there were true political leaders aligned with J Street's mission J Street is the place where the two chapters of my political upbringing came together in addition to reflecting my values J Street has allowed me to grow as a political person through my work with J Street u and most recently with the stopped demolitions build peace campaign I have gained concrete skills and sharpened my political thinking this fall J Street you participated in advocating for a Senate letter led by senators Dianne Feinstein and Bernie Sanders the letters spoke out against demolitions in sucia and faunal Omar echoing our stop demolitions build peace campaign Illinois schools were ready Jase drew you leaders from Northwestern you Chicago and DePaul sent letters to our senators upon learning that senator dick durbin signed the letter we've rallied to thank him in the midst of a pretty hectic finals week this action engaged our College Democrats of University of Chicago chapter even more deeply in support of our work after months a progressive coalition building on campuses across the country the College Democrats of Illinois became the first state chapter to publicly endorse our stop demolitions build peace campaign [Applause] they were soon followed by state chapters of California Washington and we expect many more to come [Applause] tomorrow students will join other J Street activists and advocating for a letter spearheaded by representatives jan Schakowsky and John Yarmuth that calls on Prime Minister Netanyahu to halt the demolition of sucia Hana Locke Mar and other villages in Area C [Applause] representative Schakowsky is yet another Illinois political leader with a fierce dedication to progressive politics and the two-state solution J Street used students in Illinois and throughout the country have been lucky enough to engage with the representative on our work through J Street and J Street U students have met with President Barack Obama we have lobbied our members of Congress many of us have interned on the hill and I personally once fist-bumped keith Ellison on a J Street delegation to Israel in the West Bank as students we know that we have much to offer current representatives and candidates and we remain committed to the work of supporting our American political leaders who put diplomacy first who fight against anti-semitism Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and who fight for to preserve the viability of the two-state solution [Applause] through J Street and it's empowering political work I have been able to come out of the shadows of those three bullets on November 4th 1995 I have found a political home that allows me to participate in the politics I admire in order to realize a world I want thank you [Applause]

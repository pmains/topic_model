the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act is one of the most important measures that i've worked on during my time in the senate and i am incredibly proud to have played a leading role in the creation of this impactful legislation these investments will create jobs grow our economy improve our productivity and reduce inflation all without raising taxes our bipartisan infrastructure bill recognizes that alaska often lacks the basic infrastructure that states in the lower 48 take for granted it addresses that gap by sending billions of federal dollars back home to alaska to put alaskans to work building roads improving bridges expanding ports and airports developing water and waste water systems building out broadband and pioneering innovative transportation and energy technologies all of which will benefit us for generations to come thank you to the many alaskans who worked with me to write provisions that address the needs of both our urban and our rural communities now that this historic legislation has been signed into law i look forward to seeing the investments programs and projects that it facilitates become a reality across our great state

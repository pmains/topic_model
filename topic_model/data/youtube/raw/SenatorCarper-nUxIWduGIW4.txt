seems like only this morning that I was standing here and you were presiding over the Senate and I got through about half of my remarks and we ran out of town and I had to yield to that fellow from Maryland who sits behind me and now that the no one's on the floor I just want to take maybe five or ten minutes and and finish what I started to to say this this morning I know it's possible to ask unanimous consent that my remarks this afternoon be appended to and join with what i said earlier today if that's something you'd be done I would approve without objection I'll be great thanks so much like that as you may recall like talking earlier today about how to reduce the amount of overpayments we call them improper payments that the federal government makes and last year they added up to almost 100 billion dollars not counting the Department of Defense not counting part of Medicare not counting part of the Department of Homeland Security's a lot of money and I and having said that we also also added that federal agencies are doing a for the most part a better job at estimating and identifying those costly mistakes or improper payments I think the White House said deserves our credit not only this White House this president Britta's predecessor George W Bush deserved credit for not only in the case of George W Bush saying we ought to have improper payments law and we ought to make this a priority but also for President Obama and his team for for beginning to scour federal programs for improper payments and also taking strong strong steps to try to eliminate them in the in the future White House budget director Peter Orszag noted that energy agency's employed stricter standards for identifying improper payments resulting in much of last fall's reported improper payments increased I remember maybe four years ago five years ago when Senator Tom Coburn and I were working on this issue we found out that there may be 40 billion dollars worth of improper payments being reported by federal agencies last year it was about almost a hundred billion so it sounds like we're going in the wrong direction as it turns out what's actually happening is more agencies reported so initially not very many agencies were reporting but as we have a fuller reporting by all the agency a larger a better idea of how big the problem is and it's it's not so much that's getting worse this is we're having better reporting from the agencies and now that we're getting that the key is to make sure that agencies that are making improper payments make fear of them and then we go out and recover the monies that have been improperly paid the White House announced that this winter an executive order earlier this year to not only improve the collection of improper payments but to also approve our ability to avoid making improper payments and to increase what I think is really important the use of recovery auditing now I say the words recovery auditing or post audit cost recover like most people for most people their eyes kind of blur over and they tune out we're talking about 100 billion dollars here money that is going out most of it improperly a lot of it over payments and we're talking about a country for our deficit is over a trillion dollars and if they're we have the ability to we're going to have the ability to reduce our deficit it's not going to come from any one silver bullet or any one particular approach but this is one approach that can really help and I want to apply the administration's concrete steps to improve transparency and make agencies and agency leadership more accountable still there's a lot more than we can do which is why our legislation is currently on its way to the President's desk is so important in order to take the next steps especially when it comes to actually going out and recovering the money that we lose every year to avoidable errors in preventable fraud as I often say my staff's heard me say this more times and they care to remember if it isn't perfect make it better everything that I do I know I can do better and that includes making sure that we're making the appropriate payments to the right pay for the right amount of money and all of us in Congress share responsibility to do that that is to make it if it's not perfect make it better we all share a responsibility to do that in curbing waste and fraud the legislation that I think the house is going to pass later today and hopefully the president will sign later this month called the improper payments elimination and Recovery Act it's the result of a six-year journey during the last Congress i introduced the one of the iteration earlier iteration of this bill is Claire McCaskill of Missouri over the last several years I've chaired hearings on the issue of improper payments waste and fraud and since then I worked with the office of we've worked with the Office of Management and Budget the Congressional Budget Office and many other inspector general's and many others experts to refine and strengthen our legislation the most recent version of that legislation was introduced last summer about a year ago along with Senator Lieberman chairs are full committee senator Collins ranking member of the Homeland Security government affairs committee Senator McCain and Senator McCaskill it was approved by the Committee on Homeland Security and government affairs late last year and was a true approved by the full Senate in June of this year a companion bill was also introduced in the House by representative Patrick Murphy from Pennsylvania our neighbor to the north it's a perfect this legislation is I believe a perfect example of common sense of bipartisan common-sense and bicameral common-sense and actually as soon as you consider that Senator Lieberman as an independent here we like try camera or like try partisan rather and we have the Democrat Republicans and independents I think the bill makes a number of key reforms and more first of all it improves transparency by lowering the threshold whereby agencies are supposed to report improper payments and this will better inform the public about where their taxpayer dollars are going and it will help us in Congress to find ways to fix the problems that lead to waste second to reform key reform in this legislation is that it requires agencies to produce audited corrective action plans with targets to reduce waste it's all well and good to report improper payments or wasteful payment the key is to stop doing it and to not just report it but to go after and stop repeating the same mistakes the third reform is that this legislation requires increases the recovery of overpayments by requiring all agencies that spend more than 1 million dollars a year to perform recovery audits on all their programs and finally fourth and last the legislation penalizes agencies that fail to comply with federal financial management counting laws would make sure their progress and eliminating your proper payments is part of senior agency officials performance evaluation so you say to somebody who's like a leader of supervisor in these federal agencies part of your evaluation is going to be whether or not you're doing a good job of stopping overpayments going out and making sure you don't make a lot more of them and going on and collect money that's been a Miss paper or overpaid I'm particularly pleased with the provision of the bill requiring major agencies through make greater use of tools and many private sector businesses use to recover overpayments when they make them and when agencies have used these tools they've had some success from real success about seven years ago 2003 when Congress mandated at the time was described as a pilot recovery audit contract program to examine Medicare fee-for-service payments in other words Congress said okay Medicare and when you're making these fee-for-service payments to doctors hospitals nurses we want you to do in in three states California Florida and New York wanted to to look at those three states and see if we're overpaying money and if we are making mistakes and Medicare go get it I think a year or so later we added to the initial three massachusetts in in South Carolina during the first three years of this demonstration program about 50 million dollars was recovered returned to Medicare trust fund the second year about a quarter of a billion dollars was recovered returned to the Medicare trust fund and I think if you add up the total for the three-year pilot program which ended up being in five states they recovered about a billion dollars covered about a billion dollars is real money and one of the reasons why the Medicare trust fund is running out of money is because of fraud some people may have seen in under 60 minutes a year so ago 60 minutes today's special where they focused on a bunch of doctors offices and some some town in South Florida the doctors officers had three things in common one they had no patience to they had no doctors three they had no nurses while they were like a building off operation for Medicare to defraud money from Medicare and take it from the Medicare trust fund last year we're looking for the Medicare trust fund to run out of money in about eight years as untenable and with the changes that we made in the health care reform legislation I think we pretty much doubled that life to maybe close to 15 to 20 years but we still have a problem with all the money that's defrauded for Medicare we want to recover as much as we can and put it back into the to the program but any event the the pilot program would start off with three states expanded 25 into 19 this year we're expanding it to all 50 states there's also a provision in the recently enacted health care law it's called a patient protection and affordability Care Act its health care reform legislation adopted earlier this year but there's a provision that says we go to the folks who run healthcare the department of health and human services they have to expand this program its cost recovery program to include Medicare Advantage to include the Medicare prescription drug program and also to include medicaid and his money is recovered from fraud no overpayments miss payments in Medicaid that money will be split between the states and and the ennis and the federal government the sooner the full program is up and operating and the sooner we can recover even more money I think probably billions of dollars in additional overpayments and there's an added benefit to an expansion of recovery auditing the recovery audit the contracting pilot program has identified dozens of vulnerabilities in the Medicare payment system that can lead to additional wasting and fraud according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that's the incident overseas Medicare and Medicaid but the contractors hired to recoup overpayments identified ongoing vulnerabilities that could lead to future over payments totaling about a third of a billion dollars more so not only did the contractors recover about a billion dollars in overpayments in the three-year pilot program we've also identified additional problems in their systems that they looked at which if we will address will eliminate and reduce fewer reduce avoid errors in the future tomorrow what's today Wednesday tomorrow thursday i think tomorrow afternoon the subcommittee of on federal financial management which are privileged to chair will hold a hearing in that hearing will examine the history and the the opportunities for medicare recovery audit contracting and i would say in conclusion mr. president the the improper payments and elimination Recovery Act which were again hopefully the house will pass today and the Senate will has already passed it and hopefully the president will put his John Henry on it later this this month but that legislation will allow us to take even make even greater strides in curbing waste and fraud in the work of federal agencies during the years I had given the size of the budget deficits we face we need to do that enactment of this legislation is not the last step I think it's an important step and I look forward to seeing this important legislation signed into law and to working with my colleagues and with the administration on its successful implementation a lot of times people say this mystery about mr. president why do you do something about waste fraud and abuse and they're they're convinced there's a lot of money their money it ends up being miss pinned and properly spend overpaid in some cases the people are into need businesses he shouldn't get any money somebody ought to do something about it and with the legislation that will be on its way to the president hopefully tomorrow we're going to do something about it we're already are doing some pretty good things about it we're going to do more and we need to do to build on on that on that record thank you very much mr. president

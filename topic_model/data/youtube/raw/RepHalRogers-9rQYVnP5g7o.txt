Melanie's chairman mr. Roger have an amendment at the desk and I ask unanimous consent that the amendment without objection miss chairman as I noted in my opening statement there are very real risks associated with moving the terrorist currently detained at Guantanamo to the US and in spite of those risks and the absence of any clear plan the administration is moving forward with closing down the Guantanamo facility and as of two days ago has begun to transfer terrorists to the US and now in the morning papers we're reading to resettlement countries that's why our colleague Frank wolf has rightly pushed for restricting the funding for release our transfer of these terrorists until the president gives us his plan and analyzes the associated risks requirements this committee supported just three days ago at the Oh 10 commerce justice bill markup and that are included in the pending 09 supplemental as part of that plan it's DHS's duty to conduct a thorough threat assessment of each and every detainee something the department should be doing is a standing member of the interagency guantanamo task force there are not only obvious risks to our communities and our hometowns but there are very susceptible inmate populations in our prisons that might fall prey to the twisted ideology and evil ways of these terrorists we know about the radicalization efforts that are going on even as we speak around the world and our prison populations in this country are susceptible perhaps above any other to that kind of influence FBI director robert mueller clearly stated concerns to Congress on May twentieth when he said the concerns we have about individuals who may support terrorism being in the u.s. run from concerns about providing funding radicalizing others as well as the potential for individuals undertaking attacks in the u.s. mr. chairman this is a this is a deadly serious issue look at the spread of radicalization into the Western world since 911 a phenomenon that has resulted in multiple terrorist attacks and the deaths of countless civilians throughout Europe and one that is a growing concern within the u.s. just two days ago in Atlanta a former Georgia Tech student was convicted on charges of conspiring to provide material support to terrorism in the US and he was only radicalized over the internet not while imprisoned or under the influence of non perpetrators of terrorism and violent extremism so I believe it's clear we cannot be Cavalier in letting known terrorists infiltrate and infect our incarceration facilities and of course our hometowns I think it's without question that a plan for closing Guantanamo Bay must include a detailed threat assessment for each and every detainee how can we ask the American people to endure such risks when the threat is not known or made clear to the Congress and let me point out that despite the raging debate on this issue across the capital and in our districts the administration is thumbing their nose at these concerns and are moving forward with the transfer of these terrorists even as we speak knowing of the absolute opposition of the Congress I mean how in all good conscience can the administration ignore the requirements that they know are coming and proceed to release and transfer detainees ahead of time how can the administration move forward without informing Congress and the American people of the risks that they're asking us to face so my amendment is simple it complements the work this committee has already done by adding a vital requirement for a detailed individualized threat assessment of each detainee furthermore my amendment requires that the names of all the Guantanamo detainees be placed on the no-fly list a requirement the entire house supported just last week during the consideration of the TSA authorization bill and one that is clearly a prudent course of action finally this amendment prohibits funds from being used to grant any type of immigration benefit or visa to these terrorists so that they cannot be admitted legally into the u.s. so mr. Chairman I urge the members of the committee to support this amendment and require the proper assessment the potentially grave threats of the safety and security of the citizens of this country

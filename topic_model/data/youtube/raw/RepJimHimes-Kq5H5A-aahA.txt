well joining me now Democratic congressman jim Himes member of the Intelligence Committee thank you for joining me thank you for waiting through our live event with Hillary Clinton and tom harkin I'm sure you didn't mind listen to your fellow Democrats there no worry Alex I'll always heed to the butter cow and the deep-fried oreos you're a better man than I come like no anyway let's get to what I want to talk about here with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who claimed this week that there is still a real possibility the opposition could get enough Democratic votes to override President Obama's veto how close do you see it right now Alex I I think it remains very unlikely that Congress will override a veto in the United States Senate you've had one Democratic senator opposed the deal in the house you've had ten for an override in the Senate I think you need something like 18 or 19 Democratic senators to join in and in the house you'd need something like 45 so you're still a very long way I think from the numbers that would suggest that you would override a veto and as time passes not now not by the way there's there's you know a lot could happen in the next 30 or so days you know to move this one way or the other but as people have gotten familiar with this deal I think you know nobody's thrilled with the deal as no one has ever thrilled by any international agreement people are coming to understand that saying no to this deal is just a very very risky proposition okay but in terms of there's a lot of time here that things can happen even beyond that look by the time the deal is finalized the present stays and office will be numbered do you expect Iran to fully comply when the next American president my truck hey this deal is off and launched some sort of a new campaign against Iran well look i think you know the republicans are all saying that if they become president they will not abide by the agreement i I think that's utter fantasy I think they need to say it because they're running for president but the idea let's imagine that you know two years from now Iran is in full compliance which you know no is not guaranteed I happen to believe is the more likely course but is not guaranteed they're in full compliance you know you've got all sorts of European and Chinese and American companies doing business and all of a sudden a brand new president is going to say two years after an agreement sorry the game is off the United States is going to impose sanctions wall Iran has a history of having complied I think the probability of is pretty close to zero whatever whatever they may say okay what about Democrats who oppose the deal are they going to face the wrath of the party the wrath of the White House from there up for re-election next year and also comes to mind as Senator Chuck Schumer is expected to take the helm of the democratic party in the Senate I mean could the fact that he's come out in opposition of the deal could that be a problem for him you know we've been out of Washington at least on the house side for a couple of weeks but I will tell you this this is one of those votes that people understand a is the classic vote of conscience you know where you hope that people pull politics out of it now that's not necessarily what's happening but you know I I think people understand that this is a matter that touches on huge strategic national security issues and by the way it's not a no-brainer anybody who says one way or the other that it is a no-brainer you should just stop listening to them at that point in time because it's a very very difficult calculation with lots of risks both ways and truth be told I think that the White House and the leadership certainly on the Democratic side understands that and are treating this issue accordingly look remember it was not that long ago that we were assured that there were weapons of mass destruction in in Iraq and if people didn't do the right thing and go in and authorize military action in Iraq all hell would break loose obviously that turned out not to be the case the experience turned out to be bad and I think that an awful lot of people not everybody an awful lot of people in Washington have learned that on these issues you know you handle them with care okay I want to ask you about the claims that Isis used chemical weapons potentially mustard gas in an attack on Curtis forces this week have you seen through any intelligence confirming this report and would that change anything for us strategy I have I have not seen any such evidence this event occurred after the house left on recess so I've been following it largely in the news look for my standpoint if it were true and there is evidence to suggest that it is although it's not conclusive it would not surprise me one iota Isis has shown over the years that they will do literally anything against their opponents and do attract attention and to instill fear so gosh we're going to learn yet again that the this is an appalling group of people that we need to be very focused with our allies in the region in eliminating I do want to ask you about the chemical Supreme Court ruling that the death penalty there is unconstitutional that's taken 11 convicts from death row a bit earlier I spoke with Cynthia Hawk ran she's the sister of Jennifer Hauck Pettit who was tragically killed about eight years ago in that just heinous crime in the state of Connecticut she was murdered her two daughters were murdered her husband beaten up and left for dead but he survived I want you to listen to what she told me when I asked her how she felt about the fact that these two men were no longer on death row well meet my brother-in-law repeatedly in the head with a bat while holding a gun to him hoping that he would die they raped my sister and my 11 year old niece they strangled my sister and doused the girls with gasoline and light them on fire while they're still alive as the police are waiting outside that's extremely cruel and unusual and no let's see living in prison with computers televisions books educational classes workout facilities three meals a day heat air medical dental I care and all their needs being met doesn't bring me solace or satisfaction of any kind I wish it did you know when she told me that earlier I couldn't say anything more with our interview I was done what do you say to someone who's suffering like that and you point out that these are the conditions that these two murdering thugs are going to live under yeah well you know of course when you're talking to the survivors the family members of victims of these heinous crimes you've got to give them an awful lot of deference I mean you know heaven forbid that most of us would ever have to go through something like what those family members did so I think you I think you accept their points of view with great great humility I mean look the reality is that around this country people who find ourselves on themselves on death row have done things that literally make your blood boil and and and you know this is why we have a conversation and have had an interesting conversation in Connecticut remember this legislature voted to eliminate the death penalty some time ago the Supreme Court decision just says that for those 11 people who are on throw today they will not be executed so Connecticut has over the years eat despite the horror of the cheshire situation joined a variety of other states and saying hey this this is a flawed practice and you know through the legislature the people of Connecticut spoke and said we're not going to do it anymore so again I and by the way this reflects the personal journey of my own I understand the rage and the desire for retribution that people have I feel it if it happened to my family member I'd probably want to kill the assailant myself but of course we are a society of laws and we are migrating I think to what most people would consider a slightly more humane and less arbitrary Penal Code and and and probably over time likely to use the death penalty in this country a lot less than we did in the past alright well as always good to talk with you representative jim Himes thanks so much thank you

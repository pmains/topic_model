congressman well the bill uh thank you very much and i want to thank postmaster general de joy and i want to thank the chairman of the board uh mr duncan for your patient answering of our questions as both of you know it was president nixon in 1970 who signed a very major postal reform bill to guarantee the independence of the post office and on the postal service website its history speaks about that bill as something that was to quote remove the postal service from politics and i assume that both of you agree that that is an essential mission of the post office yes sir mr de joy i'll ask you all right uh and mr dejoy i have asked for a document labeled the joy political donations chart to be uh presented and uh i'd ask i want to ask you a few questions about that uh mr joy i mean obviously you have the right to make political donations within the law and i have no dispute with that but i do want to go through them because of these questions that are being faced according to the federal election commission records since 2016 you've donated 303.2 million dollars to republican candidates and committees uh does that sound right sounds about right yeah yeah and the republican national committee was the beneficiary of 1.3 million dollars in contributions correct yes i am a republican sir right and you contributed 1.2 million dollars to president trump's trump victory fund correct uh i would need to check that but it sounds about right okay and my understanding is that uh in may of uh 2019 you were announced as the chairman of the republican national convention fundraising committee for the convention that was was to take place in charlotte is that correct yes that is a not-for-profit foundation that was selected by the charlotte host committee which is a usually a bipartisan and within conventions uh for the city right and that you you stayed on a position until june 12 2020 shortly before you took over officially as the postmaster general correct i did sir right and in june of from january to april of this year and the run-up before you were selected as postmaster general you provided 18 contributions in the amount of about 650 000 to various republican committees correct you seem to have something in front of you i don't know what you're looking at but i give a lot of money let's let's go for the record i gave a lot of money to republicans right and let me just ask an obvious question you obviously support the republicans that's obvious totally within your right you're a big supporter of president trump totally with you right how do you square being a major supporter of the president and republican committees and other members with the independence that's required of the postmaster general can you really do both absolutely sir well you're aware of the fact of course that president trump uh has made very hostile statements about the postal service he called the postal service a joke i assume you disagree with that i do sir and he has also vehemently and repeatedly attacked mail-in voted saying and i'll quote mail-in ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud in a really 2020 election do you agree with that i i i'm in charge of delivering ballots i don't really want to comment on what that's not my responsibility electoral is it your view that if there is fraud it will have nothing to do with the united states postal service it is my view that there if there is massive i mean if there is fraud it will it's our attempt not to have any fraud with that do with the united states postal service yes but if the mail is not delivered on time and republicans and democrats who do vote by mail do not have a timely delivery of that ballot to their town clerks that in fact will result in them being disenfranchised is that not correct the mail will be delivered on time sir well we've heard that you have made significant reforms to try to improve postal service but it's resulted in significant delays and those delays have coincided of course with the run-up to the election you've heard and you've apologized for that it's not just the postal boxes the blue boxes mail sorting machines but you heard from congressman cooper uh that the requirement about the gentleman's time has expired the gentleman's time has expired but the gentleman may answer the question thank you thank you congressman again i'll repeat i had nothing to do with the with the collection boxes the sorting machines the postal post office hours or limiting overtime uh the change i made was ask the team to run the truck's transportation on time and mitigate extra trips based on a review of an ig oig audit that was absolutely astonishing in the amount of money we were spending uh spending and the number of late trips and extra trips we were were running it was a plan that was rolled out with operations and a very very important aspect of the network it's a very people ask why why why do trucks matter why on time trucks matter they do matter they're it's a fundamental premise of how the whole mail network is put together if the trucks don't run on time the mail carriers can't leave on time they're out there at night they have to come back and get more mail collection processes are late uh uh plant processes are distorted uh i see several billion dollars in potential savings uh in in in getting the system to uh to connect properly and that's why we ran out and uh uh uh put a plan together to to really get this fundamental basic principle run your trucks on time i find it really uh you know um i i would not i would not know how to reverse that now am i to say don't run the trucks on time is that the answer that we're looking to get me to say here today i think the question wasn't true

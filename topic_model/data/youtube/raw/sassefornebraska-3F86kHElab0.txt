there's only one thing in Nebraska that reminds me of Washington DC there's more of this in Congress than there ever is on a feed model Braska DC stinks but we're fighting for things that matter conservative judges like Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh losing el Chapo's money to secure the border and telling the EPA how full of you know they are when they mess with our farmers and ranchers I'm one of the three most conservative senators back there the nebraska straight talk isn't always popular same note and reckless spending quale out DC liberals for their anti-christian bigotry I speak my mind to stand on principle but every day every decision I make I'm trying to do when I think's right for Nebraska never forgetting who I work for you kind of think that's why you elected me [Music] I'm sure not making a career of this do your job for a time and then go back home that's what our founders want it Washington is just the place God's called our family for a little while speaking of which meet Cory Alex and Brett if you haven't already and Melissa of course being in the Senate has affected them too we homeschool so we can take them back and forth to DC we have helped out in the office unpaid of course so we're cranking up the OL RV and coming to visit you in all 93 counties once again doing it the only way we know how we're coming out we're trying to earn your vote there's a lot we want to get your advice on on how to make DC work better for Nebraska [Music] [Applause] [Music] you

joining me now is congressman Andre Carson Democrat from Indiana the first Muslim to serve on the Intelligence Committee and Jonathan Kaye part of the Washington Post thank you both for being here thanks an honor thank you rev congressman your response to the president's speech well I thought the President's speech was a powerful speech I thought it was a very important speech the administration released its first CBE strategy in 2011 and they've been working with many leaders who were present at the summit today in a way that helps to foster a greater understanding and cooperation in terms of pushing back on extremist activities now there's a growing concern Reverend that the emphasis has been too heavy on Muslims but I think at a time when we have folks who are claiming to be Muslim and claiming to represent Islam who are committing violent acts against fellow human beings it's time that the Muslim community comes together and say enough is enough now you are a number of the intelligent Intelligence Committee you're an elected member of Congress I've been to your district with you in churches there that's right and you are a practicing Muslim yes sir is there anything in Islam that you know and practice that in any way justifies our calls for the kind of behavior that we've seen from those that have identified themselves as Isis or ISIL absolutely not Islam means peace and the history shows that of pieced of course any religion has examples of those claiming or purporting to be adherence of that faith to have committed violent acts throughout its history but I think that's a small fraction and it doesn't represent the over billion Muslims who inhabit this globe and it's unfortunate that it takes a small fraction of extremists who plan to be Muslim to misrepresent the faith that is So You Reverend have have worked with Muslims throughout your career I know in my own community growing up in the inner city watching Muslims take control of their communities doing what law enforcement had failed to do and keeping those communities safe and pushing out drug activities now if the president therefore made this even by inference seemed like a war against religion or a particular religious group which you practice rather than a wall gives terrorists as he said would he not risk deeply offending some Americans who choose the practice of religion that you do that does not it all require all call upon or condone this kind of activity Oh without question and I think whenever you step out there boldly in that kind of way in an official capacity you risk offending some people and given the history of the Muslim communities relationship with law enforcement relationship with the government dating back to jr who was counterintelligence program many in the black community warned the immigrant Muslim community decades before of the kind of relationship that is all too often been transactional Reverend and has been a cover to spy on communities and the president noted that in his speech and I commend him for being bold and doing so Jonathan the president is prosecuting a serious effort against Isis and yet you have Republicans literally accusing him of fighting for the other side what's your response to that well it's outrageous anyone who would say that the commander-in-chief of the United States would side with an enemy inside with an enemy so brutal really doesn't deserve to be an elected official I mean it's outrageous to hear a sitting member of Congress say out loud that he thinks that the president is working against people who would love nothing more than for this country and what that clip you showed of Congressman perry from Pennsylvania shows is that the hope that the craziness and silliness and the birtherism and the other ISM that was coming out of the the 113th Congress and ever since the tea party folks swarmed Capitol Hill in 2010 that that was going to go away with the 114th Congress the new Congress that seated because there are more reasonable members of the Republican Party who were elected to the house it's we now know that that's no longer the case we are still back to having the president not only battle I you know enemies of the country overseas who want to not only bring down the United States but just Western civilization but he also has to deal with Republic some Republicans on Capitol Hill who still to this day 67 years into his tenure as president of the United States still questioning whether he loves this country and whether he will do everything possible to protect this country you know congressmen the president rejected the idea that the West is involved in some sort of holy war and he also called on Muslim leaders to reject that idea listen to this we are not at war with Islam we are war with people who have perverted Islam just as those of us outside Muslim communities need to reject the terrorist narrative that the west and Islam are in conflict or modern life and islam are in conflict I also believe that Muslim communities have a responsibility as well congressman why is it important to talk about this is a fight against terrorists and not this is some epic clash of civilizations well I think that there has been too much of an emphasis on placed on the president's the usage of phraseology this is not a class of civilizations as it were but i think that folks of good will be they seek Hindu Jewish Christian Catholic Muslim non theist must come together and make a stand take a stand and acknowledge that if you go in any major courtroom you can find a Muslim attorney or a Muslim judge my father-in-law happens to be the first to let want some judge in the country judge david shahid go to any major hospital you'll find a muslim physician there are Muslims who are making investments in our country each and every day in positive ways until the greater question becomes how can we as Americans who believe in a pluralistic society who know that our country is a melting melting pot say that we will not stand with those who are Islamophobic and those who seek to cast aspersions on one particular group when there's only a small fraction those who pain to be Muslim who misrepresent the greater Muslim community at the same time Jonathan stand firmly against Islamophobia but stand firmly against terrorism without using this as some way to pivot into a partisan shot at the president these people are beheading people are taking people's heads off and you use that to take a cheap shot at the president yeah I mean the whole tenor in tone of the debate especially around you know the rise of Isis or ISIL has been very discouraging and I thought the president's remarks that you played earlier were very important where he said you know we're not we're not going to battle against religious leaders they want us to legitimize them as religious leaders they're not religious leaders they're terrorists and as long and it would be great if people on if everyone on Capitol Hill were to take that to heart and rally arrest and all the leaders in the Western world who n in the Middle East who are trying to deal with these these savage people who are beheading people and killing people all in the name of what I don't know they might be they might think that they're they're doing this in the name of Islam in the name of Allah but we all know the truth and the president has been trying to get that across to the American people today today they've got that message but I hope they did that he did as well I hope people got it and if you can't rally around the president jonathan at least rally around what is decent and we will preserve human life but rise above this partisan bickering when we're dealing with this kind of element that wants to distort religion Congress and Andre Carson

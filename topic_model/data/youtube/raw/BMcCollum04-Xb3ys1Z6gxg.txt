objection the gentlelady from Minnesota is recognized Thank You mr. speaker well here we are the day my Republican colleagues have warned about for years the day after Obamacare so what happened did the skyfall did insurance markets crash no of course not instead health care marketplaces across the nation went live millions of Americans logged on to learn about affordable health care plans they gathered information to make decisions about what plan best meets their health care needs yes some glitches need to be fixed and we knew that would happen but yesterday was not the end of the world it was the beginning it was the first step Tea Party 46 times they attempted to shut down the Affordable Care Act they stopped no one from being able to make good decisions on health care plans so I urge my colleagues common-sense Republicans and Democrats can still come together to stop this reckless GOP the grand old party from shutting down the our government let's pass a clean CR and with that I yield back mr. speaker

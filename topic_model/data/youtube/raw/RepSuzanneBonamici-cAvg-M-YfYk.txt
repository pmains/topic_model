Thank You mr. chairman and thank you to our witnesses for being here today it was back in the early 1980s when the United States Supreme Court and Plyler versus doe found that children have a right to attend public schools without regard to their immigration status and the court found that the any resources saved from excluding undocumented children was far outweighed by the harms that they would suffer from denying them an education and also importantly regardless of your position anyone's position on the parents of these children whether you think they came here to find a better life or whether you think that they're violators of the law regardless of where you stand on that issue the court also found that holding young children accountable for the actions of their parents does not comport with the fundamental conceptions of justice we absolutely need to understand that these are children were talking about children and babies that we're talking about dr. falou C you talked about wyck I was just in a WIC clinic in Northwest Oregon last week and I heard about the fear and the confusion that this administration has created because of its policies with a chilling effect on families who are now afraid to seek out critical services that will help to keep pregnant women babies and children healthy and that's really tragic because as we heard and bred in your testimony this is a really good investment to make sure that kids get a good start in life and we know that that's not just happening in Oregon children across the country are going without food without health care putting them at risk and I want to note that this includes many children who are US citizens whose parents may not understand that they do not need to reveal their own immigration status for their children to receive support for their children to receive support the superintendent of Hillsboro Oregon schools pointed out that even though they have a significant Latino population they're not all from migrant families they're all afraid of what's going to happen to their friends and their families so these fears are we're seeing them in our schools and our clinics dr. flooey how do you counsel families who are trying to get the best support for their children for their health and development but are also so fearful about the consequence and then also dr. flooey will you also talk about wick because the recent study from the University of California the pH Fe wick and the County of Los Angeles found that for every dollar invested in wick it saves approximately two dollars and forty eight cents in medical education and productivity costs so talk about the economic risk of not of not making sure these families are getting those services thank you I've in terms of how we counsel families we do try to encourage them to be aware of what benefits they may be eligible for and I think in the current environment it is difficult for families to decide how to make that choice I'm fortunate I work in a health center that is co-located with a WIC clinic so I can partner with them in educating families about their benefits and from the pregnant mom who's child I may be seeing now all the way through the child who is about to enter a kindergarten and so that that is a benefit I think thinking about co-locating working more closely within the health sector and in our WIC clinics is critical and then in terms of the economic outcome so absolutely we know that early investment in child health and nutrition reaps benefits for that child the family and society in general and not doing so increases the risk of things like food insecurity which we know is correlated with poor decreased math and reading scores imagine taking an algebra test while your stomach is growling trying to focus in school when you didn't have breakfast that morning or if your family is encountering food insecurity thank you I'm gonna try to get another question for dr. Raza Dallas doctor in Northwest Oregon I've heard stories about the trauma young people from immigrant families are experiencing and I mentioned the super' in superadhesive their families are are concerned that the kids are afraid what are the long-term effects of the trauma that these young people are experiencing what supports will they need you know the superintendent mentioned that some of them feel like why even try if you know how can they dream if they feel so afraid and to what extent are school districts and health care providers and community based organizations able to provide to support these these students need for the question the mental health educators mental health counselors and educators I've spoken with have all indicated a concern and their own reach trying to educate themselves a bit more about what they can do they're all pointing to a need for more trauma-informed care for children the long term impact for some but not all children will be potentially under education underemployment potentially psychological distress as you said many people who find themselves unable to dream about a better future because they are living in uncertainty thank you and I see my time has expired I yield back Thank You mr. chairman

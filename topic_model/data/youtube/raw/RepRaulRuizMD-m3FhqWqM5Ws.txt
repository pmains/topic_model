this has truly been a collaborative effort across parties committees and chambers this bill is very important because it will directly benefit seniors especially seniors who cannot afford to pay higher premiums for the rest of their lives because they missed their initial enrollment period for medicare part b maybe they missed it because they were still working and didn't realize that they needed to sign up maybe they were healthy and decided that they didn't need the coverage quite yet maybe they didn't realize that they even had an enrollment window medicare enrollment can be confusing and many seniors end up paying a penalty for the rest of their lives if they don't sign up for medicare part b within three months of turning 65. not to mention they might also be faced with a coverage gap many seniors cannot afford the higher monthly premium in the community where i grew up budgets were tight and oftentimes people had to decide between buying food and paying bills or between paying rent and getting medicine so paying extra for medicare when it could have been prevented ends up being a very big deal the bennies act would address this issue by sending notices to individuals approaching medicare eligibility with information on whether they need to sign up for part b as well as when and how to do it it will also close the coverage gap so that once a person signs up for medic for part b their coverage will start the next months this bill has the support of over 85 organizations as well as all 10 former cms administrators i urge all of you to support this bipartisan piece of legislation that will help seniors get the medicare coverage they need without having to worry about a gap in coverage or lifetime of higher premiums thank you and i yield back

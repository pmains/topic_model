  MR. BUCK: I YIELD TWO MINUTES TO THE CHIEF DEPUTY WHIP, THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA,   MR. MCHENRY. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. MCHENRY: I THANK MY  COLLEAGUE FOR YIELDING.  SMALL BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES  ARE THE BACKBONE OF SMALL RURAL  COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES I  REPRESENT IN WESTERN NORTH   CAROLINA.  DODD-FRANK HAS HAD A CRUSHING  IMPACT BOTH ON THE ABILITY OF  FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES TO ACCESS LOANS AND THE FINANCIAL   PRODUCTS THEY NEED AND DESERVE.  HALF OF WHAT COMMUNITY BANKS DID PRIOR TO DODD-FRANK WERE LENDING TO SMALL BUSINESSES. NOW IT'S DOWN TO 20% OF WHAT   THEY DO. THAT'S AS A RESULT OF MASSIVE  REGULATION THAT CAME ABOUT AS A  RESULT OF DODD-FRANK.  THE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES   THAT THEY USED TO THINK IS   ACCEPTABLE LIKE FREE CHECKING  AND MORTGAGE LENDING, ARE  SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED OR ALL  TOGETHER GONE FOR THEM.  AND SINCE DODD-FRANK BECAME LAW, NEARLY THREE-QUARTERS OF   COMMUNITY BANKS HAVE LEFT OR ARE REDUCED THEIR MORTGAGE   BUSINESSES.  THIS IS PROBLEMATIC FOR  FAMILIES.  AND IMPACT HAS HIT RURAL   COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES I  REPRESENT IN WESTERN NORTH   CAROLINA, THE HARDEST. THE LAWS MANDATE HAVE DRIVEN UP  THE COST OF BORROWING MAKING IT  HARDER AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR  FAMILIES TO SAVE, LIKE LIKE  SAVING FOR YOUR CHILD'S COLLEGE  EDUCATION. THIS BEGINS TO UNDO THE DAMAGE   CAUSED BY DODD-FRANK BY REMOVING OWNER ROUSE MANDATES, VERY   EXPENSIVE REGULATIONS, BY  CUTTING OFF ACCESS TO FINANCIAL  PRODUCTS THAT THE AMERICAN   PEOPLE NEED AND DESIRE.  THE FINANCIAL CHOICE ACT   ADDRESSES THE PLIGHT OF SMALL  BUSINESSES BY CLEANING UP THESE  MESSY REGULATIONS THAT ARE   UNCLEAR AND MADE THE MARKETPLACE LESS SAFE AND SECURE FOR LENDING TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND  ENCOURAGING THE USE OF CAPITAL   FORMATION TO HELP SMALL  BUSINESSES GROW AND PROSPER. THAT MEANS JOBS. THIS BILL IS DIRECTED AT GROWING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND GETTING US BACK ON OUR FEET AND EXPAND   PROSPERITY NOT JUST TO URBAN AND RURAL AREAS BUT TO BOTH. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE F

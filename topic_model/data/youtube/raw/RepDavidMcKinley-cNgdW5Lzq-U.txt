let's stay on that mr. wise just for a minute when they go back in they study the de scientists go back and study the the dust bowl of the 30s I find it curious and in my reading that they blame the the temperature of the oceans yun stability of the oceans that the change in the temperature between the Pacific and the Atlantic I never hear them talk about carbon discharge and these are all retroactive size these are taking today's standards and reapplying them back into that period can you explain in very short why I have not looked at the Dust Bowl aspect but I will tell you this it does ball weighs probably the understand it's the worst drought in America I'll change yes ok been hit but none of the climatologists and a scientist blame climate change they're talking about what's happened with the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean and the jet stream I I'm trouble I'm troubled when you let me just character I get a kick out of you you've been here several times in before meeting say remember that show Bat Masterson remember that have gun will travel a little bit before my time mr. McKinley well perhaps it may be but he was brought in when they needed someone with a gun and you show up at all times that to attack the carbon fuel industry and you do a pretty good job of it but but it's based on I think a lot of ideology and not on the facts if you go back to be able to prove some of these information that in the past they just don't cemetery you're pushing an issue that just doesn't hold up I'm just curious do you support the idea of us shipping exporting coal and gas out of America I believe that resources and this is me speaking personally not for the Center for American Progress Action Fund I believe that resources that are developed from public lands which are owned by every American in this room and all across the country ought to be used for Americans so that we are expand jenner jet across the board should we be able to export I don't know once it went fight gets one gaskets in a pipeline I don't know whether it's come from public lands or private lands so in words when we're trying to ship natural gas out of this country and LNG de cela to your opposed to that I believe that resource is just yes or no please um well it's not a yes or no question I believe that Rios and then if you're not then my resources producing our land should be kept here same resources of privately-owned TX multi there's your answer so it do you think American afford to be having higher utility bills no we are we need to make sure that but you can can we you know you don't think we can afford it kind of remember there are other prices included in the cost of burning coal than just the price of the coal and the land and the facility itself for example the health care costs from air pollution mercury suit toxic chemicals cancer-causing agents is in the billions of dollars in there the ante a rule says the analysis and one dollar already saying that the worst air is your air that's in door not our outdoor air even the EPA says it's 96 times worse indoors and our outdoor air so now that we are only address indoor air pollution as well but that doesn't mean we ought to spew thousands of pounds of mercury which is a known neurotoxin and as you well know that there's more mercury in a can of tuna fish and there isn't a can of fly ash so and where did the mercury get into the tuna fish it came from eat air because we eat the tuna fish we don't eat the fly ash let's go on to this thing of it so what what percent are you trying to get to in terms of fossil fuels where do you want to take us when you come in with these kinds of testimonies that do you want us down with cold to eliminate Co are you trying to get us down to twenty percent what what's your vision that you think would be right for America I think what's right for America is to use our resources in a way percentage-wise I won't give you a figure but I think we ought to use a resources in a way that allows us to also not have kids have asthma attacks not have pregnant women not you don't know whether they asthma tak is caused by the outdoor or the indoor air quality know that we don't know whether asthma is caused by that but their studies by Harvard University and other medical schools it show that asthma attacks increase with the frequency of air pollution we're not saying it causes asthma but it causes asthma I don't know whether that asthma attack has been caused by dust mites aerosols or formaldehyde sprays in your house so let me go to i'll be happy to provide some studies to you for the record you have some other information that indicates that anything other than the fact that the co2 emissions now in this country or the lowest they've been in 20 years um i don't believe that's accurate sir I believe that they have gone down in recent years but I 2005 uh II I a just published it okay well I'll have to make I will double check that read up for you coming or testify again okay and it was Bat Masterson stop opponent cuz you are quite a worthy one sir I don't know his name neither but mr. Sullivan you're recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman mr. Weiss oh it was interesting when you're discussing your comments earlier you said that the oil and gas industry gets us handout subsidy I think you're referring to intangible drilling and I and I was wondering how long you've worked for the Center for American Progress and you've worked there a while I'm sure do you ever you ever travel around the country at all to go to conferences or anything like that yes or no well that's a two-part question yes I travel around the country no I generally don't attend conferences do you ever you go you but you travel for your job uh at all times yeah and when you do that you

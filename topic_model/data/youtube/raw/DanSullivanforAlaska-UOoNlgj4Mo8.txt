several recent instances of campaign trail controversy they all involve Democratic candidates taking issue or so it seems with their opponents military service Chris Gallagher live in our West Coast newsroom with more trace and Megan the reason the veterans groups are angry is because the candidates who are criticizing their opponents military service never served in the military themselves the most glaring comment came from Arkansas Democratic Senator Mark Cryer prior saying this about his Republican opponent Congressman Tom cotton watch I think that's part of this sense of entitlement that he gives off is that um I served my country therefore let me to the Senate that's not how it works in Arkansas but cotton believes serving his country enhances his credentials and is now countering prior statement by using his former drill instructor in an ad watch this drill sergeant Norton taught me how to be a soldier accountability humility and putting the unit for yourself that training stuck better half in Alaska a group backing Democratic Senator Mark Begich ran an ad accusing Republican Dan Sullivan of not being a real Alaskan listen documents show that while Sullivan pocketed a Maryland tax credit for residents living there voting in Alaska claiming to be one of us what the ad left out is it Sullivan lived in maryland to work in national security after nine eleven he was also a marine called to active duty three times including as late as last year the National Republican Senatorial Committee was not about to let that comment pass so they made an ad using a comment from a local Alaska news anchor watch this Sullivan and his family moved to Alaska in 97 in 2004 he was recalled to active military duty really you're gonna begrudge the guy that I don't think so finally in the Maryland governor's race the Democratic Attorney General went after his opponent saying that serving as a lawyer in the Iraq war was not a real job Megan trace thank you joining me now with more Pete hagseth who's in Iraq and Afghanistan combat veteran and CEO of concerned veterans for America as well as a fox news contributor peek it's like what did you do as I was here pushing paper you were out risking your life in Iraq and Afghanistan that's not a real job be a real job and certainly your tie feel entitled to be on the Kelly file because I certain regor you remember when they did a big deal on certain other networks about how the Republican National Committee was doing training for Republican candidates about how to talk about women's issues i would suggest one might suggest the democrat party might want to think about how training their candidates on how to talk about veterans issues and even sitting members of congress these are US senators in mark begich and mark Pryor who had the audacity to walk out and say you left this state to go serve your country after 911 that's not good enough you're not a real Alaskan or you went and became an Army Ranger and served in Iraq and Afghanistan putting yourself in harm's way and that somehow entitles you it's such a detachment and both of those gentleman by the way come from families where their father in mark Pryor was a u.s. senator and in Alaska his father was a US Representative so they're coming from long lines of political families and disparaging folks who put on a uniform to serve this country of dangerous that's amazing do you think I belies a underlying bias among some in particular in these in this case is Democrats but the against military service that mmm there's a certain kind of guy who goes into the military and that's this my opponent is that kind of guy oh you remember the John Kerry comment well we have actually let's just pure let's play it's from 2006 if you make the most of it you study hard you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart you you can do well if you don't you get stuck in Iraq but that is more telling than people think I think the left has a veterans problem in some ways because there is this underlying sentiment of the military is that the kid that that the place for the kid down the street blue-collar family goes to serve their country maybe get a leg up but anybody who would run for office of course they're in the ivory towers of Harvard and getting those refinements that one would need in order to be a u.s. senator my goodness if we had a few more people who know how to put them you know really put their life on the line serve this nation for something greater than just a resume we might actually get things done there's like two combat veterans in the Senate Megan combat served in combat veterans in the US Senate maybe we had a few more folks like that we might actually get some things at least John Kerry served yeah that guy's did not serve they don't put on the uniform be quick to diminish those who do I mean as just as a political matter the stupidity of that is readily apparent these are public statements readily apparent and they don't even realize it then they rarely walk back from it they sort of stick to their guns and say well I kind of Miss spoke but generally speaking they're just not qualified dismissive of what a colonel this this guy in Maryland is a kernel as Sullivan's on a lieutenant colonel cons a captain he was have led yeah the guy in Maryland you know he he was drawer like they ripped muscle Gansler was ripping on his opponent Maryland 10th look lieutenant governor Anthony Brown and he's basically saying look he was a lawyer in Iraq that's all fine and good but this is a real justice of beautiful liars and not so much the fact that he served in Iraq he has no idea what he's talking about and it's because there's detachment only a quarter of the US Senate has served like I said only to of seen combat these are folks just don't get it it's a detachment from this institution that's went and fought our Wars for the last decade and other people have stepped aside they don't understand it they don't know how to talk about it and frankly the thumb their nose they down at it and say you my dirty work while I pontificate in the Senate it's BS

joining us now we're so happy to have him back from house Ways and Means congresswoman Greg stubey Congressman it's good to see you you were missed we're so glad you're back it's nice to have you back thanks for having me your reaction to Chad Perkins report well there's so many unanswered questions still the most frustrating thing for me is this is the fact the Chinese Communist party is the number one national security threat to the United States and we find out that Joe Biden on January 31st knew about this first balloon not what happened today but this first balloon waited five days to shoot it down after citizens of our country started posting videos of this and then they started asking questions of the Pentagon and then the Pentagon actually admitted that it was a Chinese spy drone which he would have known when he was briefed on January and 31st so why in the world did he wait five days for a spy balloon of the number one national security threat to the to the United States after it traverses the entire continental United States and we find out today also saw a B-52 bomber site uh uh base that we have why would you have waited five days to shoot this down this is a question that I have and I hope that the armed services committee is going to start bringing people from the administration in and asking these very tough questions there's also this to your point this new report that the defense intelligence agency warned the Pentagon about that first balloon last week as it approached Alaska and before it entered U.S airspace but top Pentagon and intelligence officials did not red flag it as an urgent threat they sought as a way to get Intelligence on China but instead it was collecting Communications on the U.S yeah I was collecting Communications it was collecting data it was collecting video and who knows what other things that may have been in there that capabilities that Chinese Communist Party may have that we are not aware of that it was also collecting so again why would you allow the Chinese Communist party to fly a spy balloon over our country the entire continental U.S and you know about it in five days goes by and but for American citizens starting to ask questions like what is this thing and why are we not shooting it down suddenly then they decide to shoot it down after it's traversed the entire continental United States and and sent back critical infrastructure information and sensitive information back to the Chinese Communist party and you know potentially at least it looks like 23 military bases it went over representative Marjorie Taylor green really ripping into U.S intelligence officials yesterday during that classified briefing on the Chinese spy balloon she said it's acceptable she believed they made the wrong move and just letting it cruise over the U.S but congresswoman we'd like a reaction to Democrats in the media they keep downplaying the Chinese spy balloon watch this now that we know what we know that the balloon had antennas and a community communication system do you regret not having insisted on bringing it down sooner no I look at the expert the intelligence Community the defense Community they forgot more about the newer I know it's not a major breach I am much more comfortable with the explanation of what they collected as to being that let me put it this way it doesn't put our national security at risk the people of the United States the citizens of the United States were never in danger there was not any danger of any harm happening to the people of the United States because you know that the balloon first came over Canada for example and went to South America so there's dialogue and conversation that's helping helping there but to think that uh I can just say that the United States learned more than the Chinese did Congressman respectfully Congressman Meeks is incorrect the first balloon to knock go to South America it was shot down China reportedly sent a second balloon over South America so what is your reaction to the prison as saying this is not a big deal this is along the lines of saying inflation is transitory Afghanistan was a success exit the stranded 9 000 Americans 13 U.S troops killed the border is a success what's your reaction to him saying it's not a problem yeah it absolutely is a problem and Joe Biden is so used to lying to the American people and getting away with it that he doesn't think anything about it he swore an oath just like I did to defend the Constitution the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic the Chinese Communist party is the number one national security threat to the United States and five days went by and he had the ability to shoot that down and refuse to do it uh until it had collected all this intelligence information that is completely unconscionable as a former military service member that the president of the United States would allow that to happen against the number one national security threat to our country all right Congressman stuby thank you so much we really appreciate having you back on it's good to see you again we'll see you again soon see you we've got

thank you mr chairman i'm grateful to be here today to examine the urgent issue of modernizing our nation's infrastructure there is bipartisan agreement that we need to take action to improve our nation's infrastructure including roads bridges airports waterways freight rail and broadband internet however one major obstacle to achieving our shared goal is government red tape that has accumulated over the past 50 years the result in an infrastructure approval system that delays projects increases costs and leaves our infrastructure needs unmet if we want to modernize our infrastructure we first need to modernize permitting rules to set clear deadlines and reduce project approval time while maintaining common sense accountability for environmental impact rebuilding our our permitting framework will reduce costs and allow vital projects to move forward the other big question here is when it comes to modernizing our infrastructure is how to pay for it and what to include unfortunately democrats have proposed raising taxes on all americans as a way to pay for their so-called infrastructure package the vast majority of which has nothing to do with infrastructure these tax hikes will result in less investment in the united states hurt our nation's economic recovery and destroy jobs for hard-working americans instead i think we need to approach the we need an approach that leverages technology focuses on cost-effective projects finds creative ways to finance our infrastructure investments in addition the solution must minimize the burden on taxpayers as much as possible we have a responsibility to ensure the tax dollars the federal government collects from users of our infrastructure are being used wisely and efficiently for example public-private partnerships have proved effective time and time again in spurning spurring investment i have long championed legislation called the move america act which would help state and local governments leverage private dollars for infrastructure it would allow them to use issue tax exempt move america bonds or remove america tax credits to finance p3s for the infrastructure projects that are most important to their communities instead of partisan tax increases i would hope that we could have a bipartisan discussion about ideas like this to revitalize our nation's aging infrastructure so shifting gears to you mr novogratik i'm grateful that in your testimony you highlighted critical bipartisan legislation i was proud to introduce with reps del bene winstrip and bayer to strengthen our nation's most successful affordable housing program this legislation would build or preserve over 2 million affordable homes support 3 million jobs provide 345 billion dollars in wages and business income and generate 119 billion dollars in tax revenue over the next 10 years the critical expansion of housing tax of housing credit resources provided by our bill will absolutely help produce affordable housing not just in urban areas but in the small towns and rural communities that make up the heart of indiana's second district these resources will help working families people with disabilities seniors veterans and so many others when market rate rental housing is unattainable specifically our legislation would provide a rural basis boost of up to 30 percent expanding the equity available to finance important affordable housing developments in areas where production has been difficult including so many rural communities that make up america's heartland mr novogratik can you tell us more about the challenges of affordable housing development in rural areas and explain how this basis boost proposal and other important provisions of the ahcia can help address these challenges yes i'd be happy to thank you for that question and thank you for your leadership with respect to the for busy credit improvement act and the loan for like tax credit more generally it's a great pr there's a handful of provisions sort of working together with respect to your legislation that will boost the development of affordable housing in rural areas rural areas have unique challenges to develop affordable housing you have oftentimes higher construction costs due to the distances and the like as well as lower than uh average median income levels and the loan compounding tax credit uh improvement fa increasing that basis boost allows more tax credit equity dollars uh per dollar of project costs to help offset the fact that there's lower median incomes in those areas so that's a critical component to bring more affordable housing to rural areas i also would note that there's another provision a 50 basis boost that goes beyond the 30 percent for extremely low income developments which can also be an additional feature to bring more affordable rental housing to rural areas thank you sir i appreciate mr chairman i yield back i thank the gentleman

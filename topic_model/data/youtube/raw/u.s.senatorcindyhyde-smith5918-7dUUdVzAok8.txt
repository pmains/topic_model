tonight is not an evening for celebration we all want our nation to be strong and prosperous but the american people know the reality that we are all paying for president biden's bad policies and misjudgments over the past year no amount of rhetoric will convince the american people that things are better for us since president biden took office we may not be celebrating the state of our union under president biden's failed stewardship however we are americans filled with the faith-inspired confidence that god will continue to shine his favor on our nation and that things will get better i certainly will continue to work toward that goal thank you and god bless america

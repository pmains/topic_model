thank you Mr chair um question for Mr King one of the things that uh that I've been kind of confused by and I think I know there's alternative motives behind it and that's the mandatory meetings that employers are allowed by law to to hold to have these open discussions with employees about it could be anything from dress code to work hours to anything that they wanna that they want to have yet there seems to be this resistance sometimes from the Union to not only allowing those meetings to happen but also to allow them to kind of play out it's it's uh it's kind of a control piece that I think is part of the overall discussion and I was wondering if you could just discuss kind of the legal aspects of the employer requiring those mandatory meetings of its employees Mr Fitzgerald first section 8C of the national liberal relations act the Free Speech provision permits employers to have those types of meetings second there is a Prohibition well-established or prohibitions of international violations act that employers in these meetings can't threaten coerce or make undue types of pressure on an employee regarding his or her views on unionization so we already have those protections what this is really all about is to cut off free speech why is it so dangerous for a worker to hear both sides or many sides of the aspects of unionization unions don't want these kinds of conversations to occur because in some instances they can be very harmful to the Union's campaign they want the worker to hear only one side and we've heard a lot about the Starbucks meetings well apparently they weren't successful in certain locations so if they're that harmful show us the proof I I don't think it's there this is really a very active part of a campaign throughout the pro act and other ways in the executive agencies to ultimately cut off free speech and communication it's very dangerous and I just to follow up and I don't want to single out Starbucks but I I know that we have the witness here today and I appreciate you being here but my other concern is that oftentimes it it's assumed and it's integrated into the overall uh model that they're using that somebody would start at the bottom and work their way up to be kind of in that management level and then to somehow stifle that individual by saying you can no longer have the same relationship you had with the workers that you're now supervising doesn't make much sense to me but it seems that that's the case in many of these instances is that correct well it appears to be you know it's really interesting Mrs Gerald we have this whole attack primarily in small business right now the franchisee uh stores like Starbucks that are all over the country uh a lot of part-time workers people that need additional income it's a great part of our business model in this country now is every Starbucks location every small employer perfect no are there mistakes being made there may have been but why are we going after this so successful business model in this country When I visit Starbucks stores as I said in my testimony to be outset the employees are friendly efficient they do a great job I love their oatmeal we love their coffee why are we attacking such a successful business model in this country if people want to unionize they have a right to do so I'm not here to say anything bad about unions per se but let's give the worker the right and let's don't publicly shame companies for being successful yeah it's part of this conversation that I find somewhat confusing so thank you very much I yield back sure

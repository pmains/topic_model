thank you very much first let me thank congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne for organizing the special order and for your continued leadership on so many vital issues and Ford staying the course and holdin down the fort for the Congressional Black Hawk is so important that that our message of unity and our message which really describes what many of the issues are that all of our communities are faced with the bad message go out and both of you have really been tremendous in this efforts and so I rise and this evening to join this critical conversation on race relations in America and to challenge our colleagues to work with the Congressional Black Caucus to realize progress for racial justice and equality and I join with first with congresswoman Kelly and pain in sending my condolences to the families and the victims of the horrific terrorist attack in Paris and Lebanon and Nigeria and also in Egypt and know that we jaw in this quest for global peace and security throughout the world now tonight's special order is an important part of our work to address the discrimination and racism that still plagues our nation specifically as it relates to African Americans but we know that it impacts all communities of color it's manifested in it in many ways and it affects our entire country as congressman Payne said so eloquently we are the United States and so when one is affected all is affected all across the country at universities like Mizzou and Yale and places like Baltimore and Ferguson and in high schools like spring valley lyons columbia south carolina we're witnessing the painful impact of institutional racism in our communities very recently we saw this in my home district at Berkeley High School in one of the most progressive and enlightened cities in the country black students were subjected to threatening messages on campus but I'm so proud of the students at Berkeley they walked off and was not only black students it was all students and marched down peacefully through the city to protest these terrible despicable messages this is unacceptable all students have a right to learn free from violence and from threats as long as black students and any student of color feels unsafe in their classrooms our work for justice remains incomplete and this crisis isn't limited to our schools tragically people of color face institutional racism from the moment they are born according to a report released earlier this year by the Joint Economic Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus more than one and three black children are born into poverty this cycle of poverty and inequality continues in our school systems where black students account for forty-two percent of preschool student expulsion smang goddess preschool that's students but from about two years old 24 years old forty-two percent of preschool student expulsion despite accounting for only eighteen percent of enrollment first I can't figure out how any student age to 24 is expelled from school that's outrageous you have forty-two percent of preschool student expulsion czar African American babies these kids don't even get a stark let alone a head start outside of the classroom African Americans are over policed over criminalized and underemployed a report published by the New York Times in April found that there are an estimated 1.5 million black men between ages 24 254 who are missing from civic life just missing these missing men who account for one in every six black men have been victims of mass incarceration or premature death and this crisis of inequality extends to the structures of the community and have persisted from generations over the past four decades the average unemployment rate for blacks has been doubled the rate for white Americans for many black families it feels like this is a permanent recession mr. speaker this must be our call to action that's why I'm so proud of our young people throughout the country and students who are standing up to racism and injustice in their communities it's time for Congress to listen to the young people saying that black lives matter in black students matter earlier this month I held a forum on racial justice in my district to address these issues more than 300 east bay residents from all backgrounds attended and raised their voices for justice this was the second form that I've held throughout the last three months I've been able to reach over 1,000 east bay residents and so tonight in this dialogue which congressman Payne and congresswoman Kelly had time I log leads to action and hopefully our colleagues would think about hosting these types of forms and listen to what people are saying listen to what the impact of some of our policies are on their daily lives we must be part of the conversation and the solution but we must listen we must hear the pain and the suffering that people are experiencing as a result of discrimination and racial injustice now the Congress must act to start addressing the systemic racism that degrades our institutions and threatens our communities it's past time for us to get serious about addressing the lack of opportunity for black and minority families in this country right now today in this chamber there's legislation that can start moving the needle Ford we need to empower our communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color and we need to address chronic recidivism which would be a huge step towards return in some of our missing men to their families and communities to do this Congress should pass the safe justice act sponsored by congressman Sensenbrenner and congressman Scott Congress should also past the stop militarization Law Enforcement Act that's HR 1230 to to stop the militarization of our nation's police forces we also should pass the police accountability act that's HR 1 102 and the grand jury Reform Act HR 429 so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge that there's more accountability for police officers as we reform our broken criminal justice system and work to help repair those families hurt by mass incarceration we will be strengthening America we will have people who really can make a contribution not only to their families and their communities but to the entire country the federal government shouldn't continue to put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making us mistake to ban the box totally by federal contractors and by federal agencies we also need to repeal the lifetime ban on Pell grants for those formerly incarcerated as it relates to drug felonies the in eligibility for life for public assistance in food stamps we need to remove these barriers so that people of color primarily african-american men and Latino men can get back into society get a job and take care of their families once again this is an example of public policy that is invent that racism wreaks its ugly head in our own institutions and policies finally mr. speaker we must address the poverty that plagues communities of color all across the country we all have the whips Task Force on poverty income inequality and opportunity which I am proud to chair with congressman our whip mr. Hoyer we're working with more than 100 of our colleagues now to an excuse me to advance policies that give all families including african-american families living below the poverty line both in urban communities and in rural communities we want to give everyone a fair shot this includes our tap in 10 act HR 258 which calls for a national strategy to cut poverty in half in the next decade that's more than 22 million Americans lifted out of poverty into the middle class in just the next 10 years by street eating strategic and coordinating our existing programs our pathway out of poverty act HR 2721 this would create good-paying jobs that will lift families out of poverty into the middle class while strengthening our safety net for those who are still struggling ultimately the only way to end institutional racism is to give African Americans and people color a seat at the table and we need to pass legislation and policies that begin to these barriers my mentor the Honorable congresswoman shirley Chisholm she used to say if they don't give you a seat at the table bringing a folding chair and that's what our young people are doing around the country so I want to thank all of the people across our country who are bringing in folding chairs and ensuring that these important conversations happen we hear you we support you and we will keep painting for you for ensuring liberty and justice for all means just that it means for all and in doing so we will make the United States a stronger country and so Thank You congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne for organizing this very important special order and I know out of this discussion we are laying out what can be done and it doesn't take another generation to end racial and just

>>> WELCOME BACK TO "STATE OF  THE UNION." THE HOUSE COMMITTEE  INVESTIGATING THE JANUARY 6TH  ATTACKS IS GEARING UP FOR MORE  HEARINGS AFTER THE BOMBSHELL  TESTIMONY THIS WEEK AND NOW THE  TWO REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE  COMMITTEE ARE URGING THE BIDEN  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO ACT, INCLUDING MY NEXT GUEST. HERE WITH ME NOW IS A MEMBER OF  THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE,  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ADAM  KINZINGER OF ILLINOIS. CONGRESSMAN, I WANT TO GET YOUR  REACTION TO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE SOUTH DAKOTA GOVERNOR,  KRISTI NOEM, PARTICULARLY ON  JANUARY 6TH TALKING ABOUT THE  FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T THINK  SPECIFICALLY THAT THE FORMER  PRESIDENT HAD ANY BLAME. SHE SAID EVERYBODY HAS BLAME. SHE ALSO PUT INTO QUESTION THE  CREDIBILITY OF CASSIDY  HUTCHINSON. YOUR RESPONSE. >> YEAH, I MEAN, THIS -- I'M  BLOWN AWAY. THIS IS NOT -- I SERVED WITH  KRISTI NOEM IN THE HOUSE. IT'S LINE INVASION OF THE BODY  SNATCHERS. THIS IS NOT THE KRISTI NOEM I  SERVED WITH. KRISTI NOEM I SERVED WITH, YOU  KNOW, WAS CONSERVATIVE,  DEDICATED TO TRUTH. AND I, AT THE TIME, WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WOULD PUT HER COUNTRY  ABOVE HER POLITICAL CAREER AT  ANY MOMENT. IT IS CLEAR SHE IS RUNNING FOR  PRESIDENT OR VICE PRESIDENT. SHE'S SCARED TO DEATH OF THE  BASE. FOR HER TO CALL INTO QUESTION,  YOU KNOW, A 26-YEAR-OLD PATRIOT  WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF THE  COMMITTEE ALONE AND TOLD THE  TRUTH, AND THEN TO AVOID SAYING  THAT DONALD TRUMP BORE EVEN AN  OUNCE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR  JANUARY 6TH, I -- I GET AMAZED  STILL EVERY DAY BY WHAT SOME OF  MY COLLEAGUES DO. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES. SHE USED TO BE SOMETHING VERY  DIFFERENT. >> THERE ARE -- I DON'T NEED TO  TELL YOU, ONLY TWO REPUBLICANS  ON THIS COMMITTEE. YOU'RE ONE OF THEM. THE ONLY IS VICE CHAIR LIZ  CHENEY. SHE'S FACING A VERY TOUGH  RE-ELECTION FIGHT IN WYOMING. SHE FACED OFF WITH HER OPPONENTS IN A A DEBATE THIS WEEK. TAKE A LISTEN. >> OUR REPUBLIC IS NOT IN DANGER BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT DONALD J.  TRUMP. WE HAVE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT  THE 2020 ELECTION.  >> WHEN I TALK TO MIKE LINDELL,  HE DID SAY THERE WAS A SMALL,  SMALL PORTION OF VOTER FRAUD IN  THIS STATE, BUT THAT IS ALARMING ANYWAY.  >> THERE IS FRAUD HAPPENING. AND WE KNOW IT. >> I WILL NEVER VIOLATE MY OATH  OF OFFICE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY  WHO WILL, YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR  SOMEBODY ELSE ON THIS STAGE.  >> YOU HAD A COLORFUL REACTION  TO THAT DEBATE USING A TERM I  THINK MY 11-YEAR-OLD SON WOULD  LIKE. YOU SAID HER OPPONENTS ARE,  QUOTE, A BUNCH OF ARMPIT  FARTERS, BUT REALISTICALLY, ONE  OF THEM COULD VERY WELL WIN IN  NOVEMBER.  >> YEAH, LOOK, IT'S -- OKAY. HOW DO I PUT IT THIS WAY. SO, LIZ CHENEY, YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH HER POSITION ON WHATEVER,  BUT SHE STOOD IN FRONT OF HER  CONSTITUENTS AND SHE SAID, LOOK, HERE'S WHERE I'M AT ON THESE  ISSUES. THESE CORE DEMOCRACY ISSUES. NOW YOU CAN MAKE A DECISION  WHETHER OR NOT TO VOTE FOR ME. FRANKLY, THAT'S WHAT POLITICS  SHOULD BE. THAT'S WHAT EVERY ELECTION  SHOULD BE. YOU SEE HER OPPONENTS SPREADING  CONSPIRACY, YOU KNOW, HER MAIN  OPPONENT WAS A BIG SUPPORTER OF  LIZ CHENEY UNTIL SHE FOUND OUT  THAT MAYBE SHE COULD RUN AGAINST LIZ CHENEY SO THEY ARE LYING TO  THEIR CONSTITUENTS. THIS HAS TURNED INTO -- THIS IS  WHERE -- I MEAN, I HONESTLY  THINK THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS  FAILING AMERICA AND AMERICANS  HAVE GOT TO WAKE UP AND DEMAND  FAR BETTER BECAUSE WE HAVE A  PRIMARY SYSTEM WHERE SOMEBODY  LIKE LIZ CHENEY, A VERY  PROFESSIONAL FOCUSED PERSON  REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU THINK OF  HER POLITICS, I TEND TO AGREE  WITH HER POLITICS, OF COURSE,  CAN BE UP AGAINST JUST LIES AND  CONSPIRACY AND 5% TO 10% OF THE  COUNTRY OR OF THAT DISTRICT OF  WYOMING, SHOW UP AND VOTE IN A  PRIMARY AND MAKE A DECISION. WE JUST HAD MARY MILLER BEAT RODNEY DAVIS  HERE IN ILLINOIS. A 700,000-PERSON DISTRICT AND  ONLY A FEW TENS OF THOUSANDS  THAT VOTED IN THAT. SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE. LOOK, LIZ, GOD BLESS HER, SHE IS MAKING A STAND. I THINK SHE CAN WIN, BUT I HOPE  THIS SERVES AS A LESSON TO EVERY AMERICAN. LET'S FIX THIS SYSTEM BECAUSE  THE PRIMARY SYSTEM IS FAILING  YOU. >> CONGRESSMAN, LET'S TURN TO  THE EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY THIS  WEEK FROM FORMER TRUMP WHITE  HOUSE AIDE CASSIDY HUTCHINSON. HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID THEN DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TONY ORNATO TOLD  HER HAPPENED INSIDE THE CAR ON  JANUARY 6TH.  >> THE PRESIDENT SAID SOMETHING  TO THE EFFECT OF, I'M THE EFFING PRESIDENT, TAKE ME UP TO THE  CAPITOL NOW. THE PRESIDENT REACHED UP TO THE  FRONT OF THE VEHICLE TO GRAB AT  THE STARING WHEEL. MR. ENGEL GRABBED HIS ARM, SAID, SIR, YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR HAND  OFF THE STEERING WHEEL. WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE WEST  WING. MR. TRUMP THEN USED HIS FREE  HAND TO LUNGE TOWARDS BOBBY  ENGEL. >> SO, THIS IS THE PART THAT  GOVERNOR NOEM WAS REFERRING TO  AND SOME SECRET SERVICE SOURCES  ARE DISPUTING THE ACCOUNT. OTHERS SAY, THOUGH, IT TRACKS  WITH WHAT THEY HEARD. THE QUESTION IS, TRUMP ALLIES  ARE TRYING TO USE THIS TO  DISCREDIT ALL OF HER TESTIMONY. WHY DID THE COMMITTEE PUT THIS  OUT THERE, ASK HER ABOUT THIS,  THAT SHE HEARD SECONDHAND  WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING  CORROBORATING EVIDENCE? >> WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY  WHAT WE DO OR DON'T HAVE IN  TERMS OF CORROBORATION, BUT LET  ME SAY THIS, WHAT SHE SAID IS  THIS IS WHAT SHE HEARD. AT NO POINT DID SHE SAY SHE WAS  IN THE BEAST WITH THE PRESIDENT  AND SAW THIS HAPPEN. NOW, YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A GOOD  JOB OF REPORTING SECRET SERVICE  SOURCES SAYING, THEY HEARD THE  SAME STORY. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW, AND THIS IS TYPICAL FOR TRUMP WORLD, THAT NOBODY HAS ARGUED, NOBODY HAS  ARGUED THAT THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE CAPITOL. NOBODY HAS ARGUED HE DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE GUNS. THEY'RE TRYING TO ARGUE, DID HE  REALLY GRAB FOR THE BEAST. THAT'S WHERE TONY ORNATO WILL  HAVE TO COME IN AND TELL US MORE ON HIS POSITION ON THAT. >> WILL HE? >> THERE'S INFORMATION I CAN'T  SAY YET. WE WOULD SAY CASSIDY HUTCHINSON  HAS TESTIFIED UNDER OATH. WE FIND HER CREDIBLE. ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO CAST  DISPARAGES ON THAT SHOULD ALSO  COME AND TESTIFY UNDER OATH. NOT THROUGH ANONYMOUS SOURCES,  QUOTE, UNQUOTE, AND NOT  POTENTIALLY BEING AN ANONYMOUS  SOURCE.  >> CONGRESSMAN, SINCE CASSIDY  HUTCHINSON'S TESTIMONY, HAVE NEW WITNESSES COME FORWARD TO WANT  TO SPEAK UP? >> YES. AGAIN, I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO  WHO OR ANY OF THOSE DETAILS,  BUT -- AND IT'S NOT EVEN JUST  CASSIDY. BY THE WAY, SHE'S BEEN INSPIRING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. THIS HAPPENS EVERY DAY. EVERY DAY WE GET NEW PEOPLE THAT COME FORWARD AND SAY, HEY, I  DIDN'T THINK MAYBE THIS PIECE OF A STORY I KNEW WAS IMPORTANT,  BUT NOW THAT YOU GUYS ARE -- I  DO SEE THIS PLAYS IN HERE. BUT, YEAH, I MEAN, LOOK, SHE IS  GOING TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY  AS -- I MEAN, PEOPLE CAN FORGET THE NAMES OF EVERY ONE OF US ON  THE COMMITTEE. THEY WILL NOT FORGET HER NAME. SHE DOESN'T WANT THAT. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE OUT IN  THE PUBLIC SPOTLIGHT BUT SHE HAS A COMMITMENT TO TRUTH THAT  SOMEONE LIKE KRISTI NOEM AND  MOST PEOPLE IN OUR PARTY WOULD  BENEFIT TO TAKE A 10% OUNCE OF. >> WILL WE HEAR FROM WITNESSES  YOU DID NOT KNOW ABOUT WITH  STORIES YOU DID NOT HEAR BECAUSE OF THE HEARING SO FAR? >> YES. YES. THERE WILL BE -- THERE IS, THERE WILL BE WAY MORE INFORMATION AND STAY T

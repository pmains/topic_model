it's the right to give birth or adopt a child regardless of income or sexual orientation I'm lifting up the voices that aren't being heard right now and these are voices of people who desperately need someone to care a person who definitely wants to be a parent but can't afford the treatments the fertilization treatments that they need to actually be a parent or the discrimination in our adoption system there's so many loving families that want to raise young babies and children because they can and they are being stopped from doing so so this plan is about making sure families can be heard that infants can be provided for the parents can be protected and to make sure that all families regardless of their income regardless of their race regardless of their gender or their sexual orientation can be parents and can provide for their kids in the way they want to and the way they feel they need to [Music]

republican congressman adam kinser who's joining us right now congressman thanks so much for joining us what's your reaction to this ruling blocking your committee from immediately getting trump white house documents they were supposed to get them tomorrow how big of a setback do you think this is look i actually don't think it's a huge setback i think you know obviously trump's folks will spend this as a win because there's a lack of wins frankly on any of their legal side this is not unexpected i think we expected frankly that there would be a stay issued by the appeals court uh let's be clear the first judge that heard this said the president has no ability to declare kind of executive privilege to stop this and uh we also see a very accelerated timeline to hear this case so yeah i mean of course we wish we'd have gotten these documents tomorrow but this doesn't come as any surprise it's not going to slow down our investigation and i expect that you know keeping the supreme court potentially aside uh we'll have these documents fairly soon yeah we'll see if trump loses he might go to the supreme court we'll see what happens on that on that if that happens how sure are you congressman that the committee will ultimately prevail because the stakes are clearly enormous right now these include hundreds of white house documents during the trump white house visitor logs call logs even handwritten notes yeah i'm sure ultimately will prevail the question is a timeline but look the american people through congress have a right to know what happened that's the whole reason we have an archive the president the former president has no ability to declare executive privilege when the current president didn't take that declaration this is nothing short of a stall tactic a significant part of this too in fact this investigation has to do with campaign activities uh which isn't covered by executive privilege so we'll ultimately get to that will ultimately prevail but i i think have no doubt the trump legal strategy because they don't have a strategy to actually win or to actually have a committee show that there was no culpability or responsibility in january 6. the strategy is to run out the clock and so we're continuing to investigate witnesses we've we've uh or to interview witnesses we've interviewed over 150 with many more to come we'll get to the bottom of this yeah as you know as you well know a testimony for some trump top trump allies clearly also in jeopardy it's been what three weeks since you made that referral to the justice department to host steve bannon for example in criminal contempt do you have any indication on whether the attorney general merrick garland will move to prosecute because this clearly has huge implications for other witnesses as well yeah we don't have any indication yet i know there's a new i believe it's u.s attorney in the area and so there may be a process to get them spun up we certainly hope the and expect the department of justice will will do their job and refer this to a grand jury and get it done look congress has the right to subpoena similar to what a court has if a court makes a subpoena of a witness and the witness doesn't show up they're held in contempt it is the same thing with congress what we don't do is send out the congressional police force to arrest somebody though with some rule changes you actually probably could do that we rely on the doj to do that enforcement because we believe in those separation of powers when necessary so we expect and certainly hope that the doj will if if we start sending the precedent that people can simply on something so egregious is what happened on january 6 that somebody can simply ignore the will of the people aka congress that's not going to be good for the congressional branch in the long term and for the american people in the long term let me get your thoughts on a different issue while i have you congressman some democrat as you know have already introduced a resolution to censure republican congressman paul gosar after he tweeted an anime video depicting him killing democratic congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez if there is a vote on this would you vote to censure gosar yeah my lien would be yes i'd have to see of course what's written in the resolution you know all that matters the text of the resolution but you know look i don't care if it's a republican or a democrat we cannot in this country wolf get to a point where using anime even which is creepy in and of itself but using anime or regular videos or deep fakes or even just tweeted threats against the sitting member of congress can be acceptable it is never acceptable it can't be acceptable and i think you know barring any egregious language and a resolution to censor out century i would intend to vote yes and finally it's of course veterans day uh and you're a veteran of the wars in iraq and afghanistan u.s air force i know you just did your active duty military service uh in recent days you were just deployed how are you reflecting on this very very special day you know i i contact a lot of my veteran friends we all just we tell each other thanks and then of course we joke around with each other but you know for me it's it's obviously coming off a big tragedy and afghanistan has a different somber you know moment but even though veterans day is intended to celebrate all veterans obviously we think of the fallen veterans and and the fallen heroes and you know i've always worn on my wrist the name of andreas o'keefe i've worn it since 2018 who was a friend of mine that was killed in iraq so i think of him and uh you know we think of the the fact that there are 18 and 19 year olds today that went in and raised their right hand to defend this constitution to defend this country and we need to expect that of future generations and we need to expect that frankly of political leaders too we are so grateful to all the veterans and thank you uh congressman kinziger for your service to our country we're grateful to you as well thanks so much for joining us you bet

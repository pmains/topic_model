man adam kinsinger of illinois he is a member of the select committee investigating the january 6th attack on the capitol thank you very much for being on this morning i'd first like to begin by asking you uh your reflections uh on the day now one year ago uh you know i'm really disappointed today i'm sad um and not not for the obvious reason because you know of january 6 but uh first off it's been a year and feels like it's been a day but mostly because we haven't made progress and i'm not talking about the committee the committee's made progress but i'm talking about as the american people particularly as republicans i think we're almost in a worse position than we were the day after january 6th i mean on january 7th we were there was kind of this sense among gop members of congress of silence let's wait let's see where this goes you know obviously a few people were outspoken pretty incredibly liz cheney for one i was trying to be outspoken as well and then kevin mccarthy went to mar-a-lago and he took he basically took the paddles out of the ambulance and resurrected donald trump's political life by the way history books will record that the reason donald trump is still a force today i promise you is one man kevin mccarthy who went down and resurrected him and so i look back on this day and while january 6 was a terribly tragic day i think of officer sicknick i think of his mom gladys his fiancee his family those others that that took their life in the wake of this because of the mental toll it took january 6 is one day i worry about the rot leading up to it the rot that has existed since january 6 and the fact that i don't feel like we're any further along in confronting it hey congressman it's willie guy it's great to have you on the show this morning you mentioned kevin mccarthy and i think that's emblematic of the turn that a lot of people hoped would happen on january the 6th watching this and saying this is completely unacceptable we cannot stand for this kevin mccarthy said that himself that night lindsey graham said enough is enough i'm out i'm walking away from this and then sure enough within two weeks kevin mccarthy was at mar-a-lago assuring donald trump that he was still with him can you speak a little bit to those days after january 6 where you thought maybe this was it this was the breaking point and what happened to make sure that it wasn't in fact that donald trump was strengthened by what happened that day yeah i mean look the day after january 6 i mean there was a group of us talking about you know the fact that on january 1st for instance i was on a conference call talking to all the republican members i said to kevin mccarthy directly as the first basic caller because we were in virtual at that point i said there's going to be violence because we're convincing people the election was stolen you know if you're an any american that's ever been to school you know that if an election is stolen you actually have a responsibility sometimes by force and we have convinced these people of this and he just dismissed it adam next caller and and so you know that was infuriating and the day after january 6 you go together in the in the conference room where there's all the republican members of congress and it's basically silence it's like this shell shock what next what now waiting for leadership and kevin mccarthy despite his title as gop leader exercised zero leadership in fact keep in mind it was a two days prior i think the january six where he came out and forcibly said he would object to the election even though he initially said he wouldn't even though you know he signed things because he was pressured to even though he knows they were wrong and and i look at that and it's just it's it's disappointing and it's disappointing even to see some of those outspoken after january six that have since crawled back into the bunker because boy you know adam and liz are taking a whole bunch of shots and we don't want to take those shots congressman kinser it's uh jonathan lemire good morning uh today on the anniversary of january 6 can you give us an update as to the next steps for the select committee in particular there's been some talks and reporting in the last couple days there may be some prime time hearings uh in the works uh in the weeks ahead uh and also would you with the committee subpoena sitting members of congress yeah it's all good questions um we do intend to do some hearings in prime time and i think what's very important is the first kind of six months of committee activity was you know if you think of what you're seeing as the old iceberg analogy you know you're going to see a little bit the mark meadows stuff the ban and stuff that's a little bit of the number of people we're actually talking to well it's the same in information gathering uh we've talked over 300 witnesses we want to put a few in front of the american people though to show the story to tell the story because just as important as the comprehensive report is going to be that kind of shows the rot leading up to january 6 stuff on january 6 and after what's most important is that the american people get the truth free of political spin right or left free of conspiracy and and that in five or ten years you know i have a son that's going to be born any day here that he when he goes to school learns the truth about january 6 and not some twisted version meant to abuse the patriotism of their base so that's we we we do plan to do that in terms of uh you know subpoenaed members of congress as you understand there's a lot of kind of different questions on that in terms of a body of congress subpoenaing a member of congress but we will unturn every stone and move heaven and earth to get to the answer and if that includes that sure absolutely we wish they'd come and speak to us voluntarily i'm not holding my breath all right congressman adam kinsenger thank you so much and thank you for your service good luck with the baby you better thank you thank you

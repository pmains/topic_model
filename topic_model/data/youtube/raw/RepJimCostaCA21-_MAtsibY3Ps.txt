happy Thanksgiving to one and to all for all the people who live in the San Joaquin Valley this is a time of celebration but a time of thanks to be with our family and our friends we've had a challenging year and Thanksgiving is I know one of my favorite times I hope each and every one of you take a little time out to have good food and celebration and to take stock for what the good Lord has brought us knowing that the holiday seasons are upon us and that we will always be thankful for this great land we live in for the values that we as Americans share together these common bonds that are far stronger than whatever differences we may have so Happy Thanksgiving because we have a lot to be thankful for

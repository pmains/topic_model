the american people are interested in what it is that we are doing the decisions that we're making and how it is that we are ensuring that when we are making decisions and i wanted to do a call and response with you senator it is for the public trust and not our portfolio and and the bill that that that i introduced uh bipartisan bill uh which gets at this uh came about in in 2020 when i was talking with a republican counterpart chip roy from texas when all those early reports were coming out right it's the early days of kovid and uh and and there were press reports that so-and-so was buying this stock or selling this stock and we were getting feedback from constituents and frankly you know looking at the circumstances saying holy smokes we have this impending sense of worry about what might be befalling our country uh we're going to briefing after briefing about this unknown virus you know a world away and people are buying pfizer stocks and people are buying clorox stocks and people are buying stocks that you know we would come to realize really are related to a global pandemic and there was a level of disappointment about you know it's not even whether or not it's intentional and much of the hearing and i sat in for part of it earlier today was talking about insider trading we are in positions of public trust we have chosen to go through the process of running for office of asking our constituents for votes of campaigning non-stop month after month year after year so i do not think it is too much to ask for us to say if we want you to put us in this position of public trust we need to take proactive steps so that no one has even an inkling of doubt in their mind that we are not every day making a decision in the interest of that public trust that we have been granted by our constituents and not focused on our portfolios and as long as there continues to be this perception that congress is putting ourselves first putting our portfolios first then there is something we should do affirmatively and this is it right banning members of congress from buying and trading stocks and there's a variety of different proposals and they spoke about that the the witnesses at the hearing but the principle that we are here united to advocate for is banning members of congress um from being able to buy or trade stocks because it matters to people um and and that i think at a time when congress continues to have pretty low approval ratings for us to be able to say it is not just impropriety that we are avoiding it is also the perception of impropriety and that is a standard that all of us when we make the choice to run for office should be willing to meet that perception is important because the perception is what engages our constituents in our democracy or makes them say i want no part of that politics

we are following breaking news of a terror threat investigators say that they have uncovered 20 sleeper cells that they believed were ready to strike Europe the shocking discovery coming just hours after a terrorist cell raid in Belgium that left two suspects is dead let's bring in Indiana congressman Andre Carson he was just selected as the first Muslim to serve on the House Intelligence Committee good morning congressman congratulations good morning thank you for having me Alison so this must have been baptism by fire tell us what this week has been like for you given all of the news of terror plots and all the Islamic extremism that we've been talking about well I want to start off by thanking Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for her boldness and in making this distinguished appointment I come from the intelligence community I think I'm the only member of Congress who has served and work in a fusion center so I understand the importance of having different he is different agencies present and different minds working together to keep our country and our global community safer yes you understand the importance of that diversity of bringing different voices to the committee but it sounds like not everyone does in fact one of your colleagues Congressman Joe Crowley was so upset by some of the comments that he heard levelled about you joining the Intel committee that he felt compelled to write a letter about it about the negative reaction let me read a portion of it he says a shocking amount of comments made in conservative publications and on social media to the effect that congressman Carson's integrity is somehow in question as a result of his religion congressman what sorts of comments have you been hearing well the staff has says told me about you know usual comments I think for the most part folks have been very excited about this opportunity on both sides of the aisle I commend my dear friend from New York Joe Crowley who come from a law enforcement family as I come from a military family and so I think he understands he represents a very diverse community particularly a South Asian community and Joe and I have worked on me issues and we've worked on issues regarding bringing Muslims Sikhs and other groups to the table to make our country a better place to live so I commend Joe for his boldness and Joe Crowley basically calls on your colleagues to speak out against whatever Islamophobia is being leveled at you and again he felt that there was a need to do this so but congressman I I imagine that you can understand how confused Americans are about Islam and particularly about this murderous strain that appears to be part of the religion somehow how do you explain it to people well it certainly doesn't represent the religion and those who are purporting to be Muslims it's not any different than those who claim to be Christians or Jews or Hindus and commit atrocious acts I think it's clear that we will never win the war on national terrorism or even global terrorism for that matter without getting help from Muslims getting help from seats getting help from non theist and those who are committed to keeping our country safer and making the world a better place to live congressman let's talk about the breaking news this morning we hear that there have been these raids and throughout Europe in Belgium and they've uncovered that there may be 20 sleeper cells with as many as a hundred and eighty people involved in them they were poised to attack we're told by investigators this must make your head swim as you are part of the Intelligence Committee what more can you tell us about what's going on through Europe well I think I'm it is clear that the European intelligence agencies have been working with the US intelligence agencies in terms of targeting the threat and isolating a threat I think there's more to unearth and and discover i think i am not an expert at telling france what she should do with her citizens but sending 10,000 troops is a start for them i know they certainly don't want to become a totalitarian state but in but in protecting the rights of citizens there's a delicate balance between keeping people safe and surveilling a citizen to the point where we are targeting people specifically not because of race not because of religion but making sure retargeting the right people and eliminating the threat to make people safer very quickly the Pentagon here at home says it's deploying 400 more troops to train the rebels in Syria to fight against Isis are more troops the answer well I think we don't want to have what we had in Iraq but we certainly want to provide the the rebel forces with the right equipment to secure that region i think that the administration has done a fantastic job there's more to be done but we cannot win this war unless we get help from our friends in the Arab League and the international community it's very clear congressman Andre Carson thanks so much for joining us on new day and best of luck in your news thank you for having me another big topic for us allison is the nightmare in Nigeria as boko haram the reign of terror just continues

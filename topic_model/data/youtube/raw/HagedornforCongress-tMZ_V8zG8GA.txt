they're talk now Jim Hagedorn fresh off the endorsing convention for the 1st district and things we have went successful in the way you had hoped to on Saturday Jim I was very honored to receive the first districts endorsement for Congress and we came out of our Mankato convention energized and unified and we're looking forward to this race against liberal Tim Walz he's been in Washington ten years he's misrepresented us on the key issues and we're going to have a debate on the on the issues and we're going to take it to them through the campaign well at least so far you're not looking at a primary this year well you never know how these things go all I can tell you is that actually today is one year that we've been back in this race we crisscross the district we go to every spot we can we shake as many hands as possible because that's the way we have to win to get to the people so we're running hard no matter what happens and we're and it's always a joy to get out here and talk to issues and the issue is pretty much the same and you want to lead off with the thoughts on Obamacare oh boy every everywhere we go in the district people are hurting because of this Obamacare they're paying 15 20 25 thousand and premiums with deductible so high that the underlying insurance is virtually worthless we had a stage four breast cancer survivor speak at my convention for me she and her husband pay over 30,000 and it's just it's hurtin everyone from farmers to small business people to average consumers and we need free market reform so people can hold their own insurance we can have competition we had people with health savings account so they shop those are the types of things we have to do a congressman Walz voted for that Obamacare he's hurt the people who represents and he doesn't even have the courage to come back and ask him about it securing the border is another big topic yeah that's another point of disagreement Tim Walz is an open borders liberal who supports Obama's amnesty I'm on the other side we need to secure America's borders and go back to the rule of law on our immigration issues just recently we had to trial of two illegal aliens who killed unfortunately a Minnesota farmer 90 year old retired man named Earl olender that's that's just terrible it's a preventable it's a preventable crime the Congress of the United States the president everyone who hasn't secured the borders they've let down the American people they let down mr. oil Anders family and we need to get back to the rule of law when it comes to immigration and how about the veteran well the veterans issues are serious I mean unfortunately we still have a backlog of people trying to get care veterans aren't receiving timely quality care I've come out with several solutions for veterans one would be with the VA we need to make the bureaucrats accountable if they hurt or in any way have misconduct we should be firing or demoting them pretty much on the spot that bill was brought up last year it's called the VA Accountability Act Tim Walz voted against it he said it was a right-to-work issue for the VA bureaucrats I say it's a right to life issue for the veterans another solution that I have is that I think all veterans every each and every one of them should be able to go out and choose their own doctor and get care when and where they need it so they can have timely quality care congressman Walz opposes my position because he thinks that will hurt the VA and I say you know what instead of defending those bureaucrats in Washington I'll be out there defending the veterans and while you may who have mentioned that it's time for the Republican Party now to maybe fall in line behind the presumptive presidential candidate and know some people are hesitant to do that but what are your thoughts on there well I'm not hesitant at all I've said all along that whoever wins the Republican nomination at our Cleveland convention is the person we have to get behind it appears so that's going to be Donald J Trump and if that's the case I'm going to support him and his policies look this is a big difference between the Democrats and Republicans Hillary Clinton and Tim Walz offer Obama's third term they offer a Supreme Court stacked with people that are going to take away our Second Amendment rights a right to religious freedom on the other side we offer big bold change in Washington solutions to secure the border protect us from Muslim extremism get our economy rolling and protect our god-given rights the right to life the right to keep and bear arms and religious freedom so big contrast in the election and I'm looking forward to it ok anything else you want to say Jim all right it's always a pleasure to get here the people in Martin County the area I've been wonderful to our family throughout the years and just looking forward to seeing them on the campaign okay thanks a lot and good luck thank you right

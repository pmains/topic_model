uh this is just shocking it sounds like if you're a democrat you get whatever you want but if you're a republican you don't unfortunately um this has been a very disappointing process being a freshman member of the infrastructure committee i came to congress to work with my colleagues my colleagues who are democrats and republicans for decades the transportation infrastructure committee was that one of the few places in congress that we could work in a nonpartisan manner and to hear my colleagues on the democrat side of the aisle they're getting whatever they want and yet if you're republican you don't this is not the american way um understanding how important our country's infrastructure our roads and our bridges are this is the lifeblood of our economy this is the one place where we should be able to work together these are important to every single american in this country roads do not see republican or democrat i had high hopes we could find common ground and work together to make this country the best it has ever been and the one way we could have done this is through the infrastructure process uh sadly today it appears that i was wrong the majority's my way or the highway bill was crafted with no input from republicans and in fact we when we vote on republican amendments later today i imagine not a single republican amendment is going to pass out of committee these are this policy this infrastructure bill doubles down on failed policies and burdensome mandates and it's ultimately going to fail in its goal of providing much needed upgrades and investments for traditional infrastructure for roads and bridges aviation airways waterways etc so instead of talking about building america today we're focusing on spending billions of dollars related to climate related to emissions greenhouse gases social and environmental justice now i agree all of these are important issues some of these issues i've actually worked on as a republican um but congress congress can and should address these issues but not in an infrastructure bill because they have nothing to do with infrastructure instead of doing the people's work the house democrats have chosen a a path that is partisan but as a partisan as it gets and this infrastructure bill is just a wish list of liberal spending in fact one out of every two dollars spent in this bill is going to be tied up in the green new deal kind of spending that's 50 of this bill is going to be tied up in green new deal this is the first step in implementing the american jobs plan i know it's been renamed a couple of different things now um because it can't be sold to the american people they're not buying what we're selling today with no this is no republican input there's been no compromise this is not a bipartisan measure in any way shape or form and in fact you know it it won't even pass the senate at a time today where the senate is evenly divided 50 50 and there's a very slim majority in the house this is the time when we should as members of congress be working together for the american people and the president has claimed he wants to work with us republicans so why is there no input from us republicans so today after debating a bloated and partisan my way or the highway bill with no chance of final patches passage in the senate this is an entire waste of time thank you and i yield back

  RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. WITH ME --  >> GLAD TO BE WITH YOU. >> THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE. THIS -- I ASSUME YOU HEARD MY  CONVERSATION WITH KEN, RIGHT,  THE ISSUE. DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH  REINCE PRIEBUS IF AN FBI AGENT  SAYS A STORY IN THE "NEW YORK  TIMES" SAYING CAMPAIGN WAS  SOMETHING CONVERSATIONS WITH  RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE, DO YOU  PROBLEMS WITH REINCE PRIEBUS  WANTING TO CORRECT THAT? >> I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE  WHITE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT FBI  WITH THIS. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE PRESSURE OR  LEAKS, WE SHOULD LET FBI DO ITS  JOB AND DO IT QUITELY.  >> I'M TRYING TO THINK -- THE  FBI SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT. I AGREE WITH YOU, ON THAT. "NEW YORK TIMES" SHOULD HAVE  GOTTEN STRAIGHT IN THE BEGIN, OR CNN. ASSUMING THE STORIES ARE  INCORRECT OR EXSAG RATED DO YOU  AGREE WITH THAT.  >> CO CONSPIREING IN THE DNC  THAT'S WHY I ASKED LORETTA LYNCH TO SETUP -- WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT  INVESTIGATION CAN TAKE PLACE AT  THE PRESENT TIME.  >> THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE THAN THE ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  TODAY. THAT PREDATES THE INAUGURATION. THAT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THAT'S A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION. >> I THINK IT'S THE SAME IN THE  SENSE WHAT THE FBI WAS TALKING  WITH PRIEBUS ABOUT. IF THAT CONTACT WAS THERE, AND  THEY WERE CONSPIREING TO USE THE FRUITS OF THE CYBER BURGLARY OF  THE DNC THAT COULD BE A HIGH  CRIME OR MISDEMEANOR.  >> WHAT IF THERE'S NO CONTACT AT ALL SO THE PEOPLE HAVE -- THE  FBI, THE FBI SEEING THIS GOING  ASTRAY IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES"  WITH EXAGGERATED THING, WOULD  YOU NOT THINK THAT IF THAT WERE  DUMPED IN THE LAB OF REINCE  PRIEBUS HE WOULD WANT TO CORRECT IT IMMEDIATELY AND NOT LET IT  SPEND YEARS DRIFTING ITS WAY  THROUGH WASHINGTON.  >> THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I  WANT TO DO BUT I HAVE TO LIVE BY THE RULES. THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T PUSH THE FBI, AND FBI DOESN'T REVEAL  THINGS AND TALK TO THE WHITE  HOUSE AND WE LET THE  INVESTIGATION GO FORWARD. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT  CONTACTS THERE MAY HAVE BEEN. I'M CONCERNED WITH THE 35-PAGE  DOSSIER PUT OUT BY FORMER  BRITISH SPY, YOU TAKE IT WITH A  GRAIN OF SALT, PART OF IT HAS  BEEN VALIDATED. TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP SEND HIS LAWYER TO CONFER WITH THE  RUSSIANS IN PRAGUE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF  INVESTIGATING TO DO BUT IF TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN WERE  CONSPIREING WITH THE RUSSIANS TO MAKE USE OF THE THEFT OF DNC  FILES YOU WATERGATE WAS THE  THEFT OF DNC FILES, BACK THEN IT WAS FOLDERS, NOW IT'S ON  COMPUTERS.  >> WE NEED AN AGGRESSIVE THOER  ROW INVESTIGATION WHAT HAPPENED  LAST FALL. I WISH WE COULD DO THIS FASTER  AND NOT WITH FUNNY BUSINESS AT  ALL. THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR  EVERYBODY.  >> A

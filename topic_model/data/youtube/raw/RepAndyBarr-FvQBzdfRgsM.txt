and mr griffin i want to revisit this issue of payment for order flow uh payment for order flow has been around for decades correct i saw i know it's been around for at least one or two decades i can't answer before that period of time and it's it's a recognized uh an approved practice by the sec correct yes it is and and payment for order flow is set by the brokerage firm not the wholesaler right that i it is ultimately a negotiated number but it is a number that is set by the brokerage firm and not by us as the market maker uh well as a market maker um that provides execution services to retail brokers you are required to meet best execution requirements is that correct yes it is and in other words market makers are required to provide the same or better pricing than the exchanges correct that is correct and how can market makers offer that better pricing to mr sherman's line of questions so there are a number of drivers that permit us to offer better pricing than what is available on exchange the first is that exchanges have legally mandated minimum text sizes of a penny so if you look at a stock like amc it trades five dollars bid 501 offered if the exchange could trade with a half cent increment it would probably trade 5.005 bid 501 offered or vice versa but the exchanges are limited between one cent minimum tick size and we have been clear on the record in prior testimony that exchanges should be permitted to have a smaller and more competitive tick size that's fact number two is that the average retail order is much smaller in totality than the average order that goes on to an exchange because this order is smaller and i'll share a number with you the typical robin hood orders ballpark about two thousand dollars in size because it's a small order the amount of risk that we need to assume in managing that order is relatively small as compared to an order that we have to manage from our on exchange trading and as i'm sure you're well aware we are the largest trader of stocks on exchanges in the united states so let me let me move to mr tev uh really quickly on that point um what impact my greater restrictions on the payment for order for a model have on your ability to offer zero commission trades we do believe uh congressman that that's an important question and payment for order flow helps cover the costs of running our business and offer commission free trading to customers when we started people didn't even think that there was enough margin left to make this business work but we've been fortunate to make it work and to make it work for our customers well let's talk about why robinhood restricted trades i think your your explanation about uh margin requirements uh charged by your clearinghouse makes sense um is your clear is your clearinghouse supervised by the fed and the sec i believe that's are the margin requirements charged by your clearing house in turn approved by the by federal regulators yes yes and uh did federal regulators uh approve the value risk charge that was imposed on robinhood i i believe congressman the value of risk charge is outlined in general terms in dodd-frank but i'm not sure who approved the specific implementation of that formula so if anyone has a problem with your decision to all trades it's fair to say that their frustration should be directed toward federal regulation congressman you know i'm not trying to throw anyone under the bus uh in direct frustration anywhere all i can say is robin hood security played this by the books and uh played it basically the only way that we could remain in compliance with our deposit requirements mr pot can uh appreciate your testimony that melvin always follows laws governing shorting stock but melbourne lost 6 billion dollars in 20 training days uh trading days let me ask you about your risk management uh did your short positions exceed float uh no they didn't know well shorting has its has an important role to play in our markets allowing for legitimate hedging and price discovery but we are interested in naked shorting and so we would hope that uh that you would clarify that um and and and how it is that you make sure that you're first locating the borrow time

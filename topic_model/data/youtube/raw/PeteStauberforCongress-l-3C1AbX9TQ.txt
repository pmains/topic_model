my family knows firsthand the importance of affordable health insurance our son Isaac is the light of our lives he's faced numerous health challenges including a preexisting condition and just like you we rely on our health insurance but that's why I support requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions anyone telling you otherwise is lying I'm Pete Stauber and I approve this message because in Congress I'll always do what's right for my family and yours

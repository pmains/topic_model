news at six beginning tonight by joining our senior senator from missouri roy blunt here live in our studio senator blunt thanks for being here with us tonight great to be with you david great to be with you heather so we have several questions we want to ask you first let's go ahead and get to that viral video of the lake of the ozarks that surfaced over the memorial day weekend a lot of the feedback that we are getting is some people who are frustrated and want life to get back to normal others who are a little frustrated that there are no repercussions from people not social distancing what is your response to that well i'm not in the repercussions business that's something that local officials are going to have to decide but you have to use judgment here i mean this is clearly a dangerous thing or tens of thousands of people wouldn't have died you know we have 35 000 people on average die from the flu every year we're gonna have three times that many people die some some will be over counted some will be under counted but clearly this is dangerous now the looking at those those uh shots of people at the pool they appear to be the most safe group you know people caught roughly around college age 10 years either way or the the lowest death numbers have been right in that group but it's selfish just because you might get it and not have a big problem to assume that the person who you see at work every day or you go by and see your grandmother or your grandfather and suddenly they're sick people just have to use better judgment here this is the country has gone through an incredible s series of ramifications on the economy and on people's health because of this and people have to take it seriously if you don't care about yourself you should care about the other people you have impact on and the lives you could endanger even if your life is not endangered by bad behavior let's talk about the potential if there is potential for a second stimulus package perhaps more payments to americans is that possible how might we pay for it and also what are your thoughts about hazard pay for some of those essential frontline workers well i think we're going to have to have another effort to see what needs to happen hospitals still struggling we've got large sectors of our economy that are still struggling i don't think all of the programs have worked quite as well as we had hoped they would some of them worked better than we thought they would but we need to take a little little time here david i think to really look at what we're trying to solve in june july and august which is a different moment than april and may things are changing quickly and just doubling down on programs that may very well have been the right programs for this month and last month are likely not to be the right programs for what happens next we need to have better testing it needs to be easier to take and a quicker response kids going back to school people going to work people wanting to visit a nursing home all of those things are going to have to be thought of in a different way than we've been thinking about them now you've said that there's a perfect storm brewing with how covid19 is impacting mental health in this country what are our leaders in washington doing to increase mental health care and make it more accessible well you know one of the this is something i've spent a lot of time on in the congress that and and national institute of health research something that i think really is going to pay off here in the near term with the vaccines and tests and other things but on the mental health front one we need to treat mental health like all other health two if you have a mental health problem or maybe even if you don't the the percentage is high of people who say they're more concerned about their personal mental health than they were before this isolation started and we see i think in greene county overdose deaths and suicide deaths are 25 higher than they were last year at the national distress number run by health and human services there's a 900 percent increase in people calling we're seeing the uptick for the first time in about three years in uh opioid-related deaths again and you can see why this would happen you know suddenly you're by yourself or you're with somebody else you don't want to be with you're by yourself you've lost your support system you begin to think okay what i just need something to make me feel better for a little bit what was that that really and then you think well i could probably take those pills again one time and not be hurt it just doesn't work that way and so we need to be aware of people we know who have a behavioral health challenge we need to treat that like we would any other health problem anybody had be willing to talk about it be willing to deal with it and in missouri we've been one of the eight pilot states for some legislation i did with the democrat from michigan center stabineau excellence in mental health where we do have dozens of locations in our state where in whatever way you can afford it you get your behavioral health situation treated just like you do any other health situation and in this area rural health center is really the regional person that puts that plan together and we've been putting a lot of money behind that and i think as you invest in mental health the other health care costs that people have go down and it's logical if you're seeing your doctor if you're showing up for appointments if you're feeling better about yourself your other health care problems are going to cost less probably the financially smart thing to do certainly the right thing to do is to be aware of the mental health challenges that this is exacerbated okay 10 seconds here can you talk real fast about how we can make public private partnership work in terms of speeding up and getting more testing out well probably not in 10 seconds but what we've done is really put a plan together that we're going to take the best ideas out there that the shark tank kind of environment thinks will work go into production with maybe five of them understanding that five of them probably aren't going to by the time you get them produced have passed all the other tests to be safe and that and and have the efficacy they need but if you get two of them 60 days or six months earlier than you would have gotten it earlier would have gotten otherwise it's worth whatever investment you've made to move forward with all five of those likely ideas and hope that uh by the end of this year there's a vaccine available that's when we really turn the corner on this fight for the economy and against the virus missouri senior senator roy blunt thank you for being here we appreciate your time all right

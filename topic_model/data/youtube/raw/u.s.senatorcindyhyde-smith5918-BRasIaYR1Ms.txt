the white house recently stated that the president's policy is to ban additional leasing and that is from an april 19 statement from the white house press secretary at that time it is not in line with the president's policy which is to ban additional leasing and we've seen the obvious detrimental effects that is this misguided policy is having on all american families does the interior department agree with such a policy senator what i could say is that i am guided by the law okay and it is clear violation of your department's requirement to prepare and maintain a five-year program for the offshore leasing and development so if you agree with the law are you saying that you're in compliance with this now we are working on it given the fact that of of the conflicting litigation that we had of the fact that it was the process was stopped in 2018 for three years and that we had to pick it back up again

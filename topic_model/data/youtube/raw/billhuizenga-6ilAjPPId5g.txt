I'm and Mr Speaker I rise today supporting char 1153 and as someone who worked in the housing industry in fact for the third generation this is a very important issue to me and more importantly to all of our constituents across the country the qualified Mortgage ability-to-repay rule as mandated by dodd-frank Act went into effect in January of 2014 this QM rule is the primary means for mortgage lenders to satisfy its ability-to-repay requirements additionally dodd-frank provides that a QM may not hit points and fees in excess of 3% of the loan amount so far so good the currently however defined points and fees include among other charges salaries had paid to loan officers a loan level price adjustments as the Chairman was talking about those are traditionally known as points payments by lenders to score corresponding banks credit unions and mortgage brokers and wholesale transactions as has been discussed fees paid to affiliated however not unaffiliated title companies and this is the one that's most bizarre of all amounts of insurance and taxes held in escrow that counts as towards that 3% as a result of this confusing and problematic definition many an affiliated loans particularly those made to low and moderate-income home bar owers could not qualify as qm s without that designation it's unlikely the loan would be made and if it were it would only be available at higher rates due to the heightened liability risks consumers would lose the ability to take advantage of the convenience and market efficiencies offered by one-stop shopping hardworking Americans realize one-stop shopping every day they partake in it an example in West Michigan I'm with the headquarters of Meyer Meyer is a great regional supermarket chain that that is where families across the Midwest go to buy groceries pick up clothes for the kids pick up auto parts there it is a ones ah that allows you to do just about everything you need for your home while purchasing a home is one of the most important decisions of family makes and why shouldn't they have the same ability to take advantage of that same cost-effective convenience of one-stop shopping when buying a home I along with representative Gregory Meeks and Ari introduced HR 1153 bipartisan legislation to modify and clarify the way that these points and fees are calculated and help families across America to one-stop shop this legislation is narrowly focused to promote access to affordable mortgage credit without overturning the important consumer protections and sound underwriting required under dodd-frank sibility to repay provisions and as the chairman pointed out also the RESPA provisions that our federal law stay in place very similar legislation overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives last Congress as well as in the hundred and 13th I think it is important to note that when we first introduced this bill in 2012 it looked substantially different however working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle we work together to improve the legislation the result has been a truly bipartisan effort at every step of the way in the legislative debate specifically HR 1153 would do a couple of things it would provide equal treatment for affiliated versus unaffiliated title fee's it doesn't change the 44 states that have a regulated title insurance cost structure it doesn't change any of those of those costs that a homeowner would have it just allows them to actually go lower rather than higher it also clarifies the treatment of insurance held in escrow these two simple common-sense changes will promote access to affordable mortgage credit for low and moderate income families and indeed all families and especially though first-time homebuyers by ensuring that safe and properly underwritten mortgages passed the QM test whether or not you supported dodd-frank it's clear that the law is going to require some to ensure qualified borrowers aren't locked out of homeownership and the beneficial features of a qualified mortgage the QM represents the safest best underwriting mortgage available on the market it's the gold standard and it should be the gold standard we should want more responsible people getting QMS not fewer quite frankly this is something that we should all agree on in fact we did last year our bill doesn't touch any of the CFPB's strict underwriting criteria it doesn't in any way suspend a lender's a legal requirement to determine that a borrower has the ability to repay that loan you know the ranking member points out a real problem that did happen in the industry and frankly one that many of us in the industry warned of but this doesn't this does nothing that allows state regulated title insurance to be violated or any of those federal steps regarding the qualified mortgage in no way side steps any of these RESPA or QM requirements and but Mr Speaker I must admit I'm completely baffled by the ranking members new opposition to this bill it was very carefully negotiated in order to receive bipartisan support which the ranking member has voted for previously in fact she was so supportive that she along with 11 other Democrats from the committee sent a letter dated August 1 of 2014 to the Senate urging the Senate to quote quickly adopt the Mortgage Choice Act end quote and I'd like to ask that this letter be inserted into the record mr. speaker without objection in the letter it stated that the bill would quote improve access to credit and that quote enhanced competition among title insurance providers well I couldn't agree more with the ranking member you know she talks now of kickbacks and I'm confused as to how an affiliated title structure pricing structure versus an unaffiliated title purchase is somehow a kickback I'm confused at how an escrow money that is put into a holding account to be used later to pay off debt I'm curious well that was a kickback and I wish I had time to yield to the gentlelady to to hear that answer but she's talking about megabanks and and this is frankly just a red herring in this whole thing Congress has the opportunity to help the more Americans realize a portion of the American Dream not by some grandiose law or decree but by simply reforming a burdensome regulation home ownership is a pillar of the American life for generations today we can refer that pillar and reassert that home ownership can and should be an attainable goal I want to thank my colleague representative Meeks and many others who have worked so tirelessly on this to fix this flawed provision and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for HR 1153 and I yield back gentleman

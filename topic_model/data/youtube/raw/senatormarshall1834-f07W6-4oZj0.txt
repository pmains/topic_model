turning now to the crisis at the u.s mexico border house minority leader kevin mccarthy will travel to texas today with around a dozen republican house lawmakers to see the crisis firsthand this as the number of unaccompanied migrant children in u.s border patrol facilities has reached a record high joining us to discuss what's really happening at our border is kansas senator roger marshall senator thanks so much for joining us emma good morning to you thanks for having me on absolutely we've learned that the number of unaccompanied migrant children has tripled in the last two weeks to more than 3 200. now the department of homeland security has ordered fema to head south and assist at the facilities which are overcrowded and lacking basic resources according to reports senator how did we get here well emma look i'm a physician and we've done mission work all across the world i know a humanitarian crisis when i see one and this is a humanitarian crisis this will soon look like a refugee camp as this as this just balloons up within this next several months it's a health care crisis and it's a national security crisis we got here because of president biden's policies open borders and amnesty he's empowered the cartels uh to make lots of money look the cartels are making more money smuggling kids and and folks into this country than they were from smuggling drugs it's just it's so hypocritical of everything that we stand for that he's actually made the situation worse that these kids are being sold into slavery uh parents paying two to three thousand dollars to have their children transported across mexico a third of them boys and girls are being sexually abused and then they're being sold into slavery we got here because of president biden's policies and don't forget president trump gave nancy pelosi two opportunities to solve this problem with legislation that included securing the border and fixing a broken immigration system but she wanted no part of it she did not want president trump to get credit for this solution as you say you visited the border at least three times is what i've heard and and i want to ask you what kind of guidance do our border agents really receive here and has that changed under this new administration well well certainly the new policies of instead of returning them to mexico is that we're letting them all go but mostly the border patrol is just overwhelmed there's no way we don't have enough possible people to ever control the situation when you have this poorest border and of course the cartel has taken advantage of it in in our little short 30 mile helicopter ride yesterday we saw over 200 individuals trying to cross the border and then what the cartel will do is they'll dump a whole lot of people at one location and the the border patrol you know comes in there and tries to handle that situation and guess what 20 miles down the river the cartel is smuggling drugs across for every person that the the border patrol captures there's two people that are getting through so in a given day the numbers are telling us are way underestimated in a given day in that 30 miles which you're seeing here beside behind me this is what i saw yesterday look at the poorest border look at the fence it's not completed there so the the folks are coming through those wall through the walls are being smuggled in it's a it's this open border policy that president president biden's created so we've seen uh the lawmakers the house lawmakers will be headed down to the border uh soon today what do you expect to come from this visit here and what could they maybe take back to washington and implement changes into policies here well i wish that they would implement policies but but speaker pelosi chuck schumer the president have a far left liberal immigration policy they want no input from republicans on anything and they don't believe in border security we'll never solve this problem without border security but from a health care standpoint again i went down there three years ago we were concerned about the healthcare folks just overwhelmed with uh tuberculosis and scabies and hepatitis but now we're seeing five to 25 of the people coming across the border testing positive for corona and then they're taking them all and putting them in a congregant housing situation so if you didn't have the corona you soon would in addition this is going to be some type of subset of virus that we've not seen here this is the hypocrisy i'm talking about president biden doesn't want us to meet with all of our family on the fourth of july maybe i'll get to see two of my kids but not all four of them i can't have all my grandchildren and my parents there but yet we're inviting hundreds of people to cross the border every day with this virus we're close to herd immunity we're going to have herd immunity in this country by april or may if our president and our governors do their job and we're just going to be reinfecting it this is going to get much much worse it'll get three times worse until the heat gets so hot this summer that they'll stop coming well you mentioned the july 4th date and that was sort of the goal that we heard from president biden as to when we could expect things to get back to normal as you say you've got a physician's background here you've also talked about whether or not people should be receiving these vaccinations the number of people who should be because of course we don't at this point have enough vaccines for everyone at this moment you've advocated before for people to receive at least one shot as opposed to waiting to get those two shots of the vaccines here for moderna and pfizer which encouraged people to get those two doses here do you stand by that decision that medical advice again without being fully vaccinated it's better to have one dose well we'll look you have to look at the big picture i want to empower the fda to make the decision not just a group of senators making this decision i want to make sure every senior gets two shots every person with a high risk condition needs to get two shots but there's lots of real world evidence out there that says after one shot of these vaccines that they're 75 to 90 percent effective we will reach herd immunity a month sooner is after we get all the seniors vaccinated and all the high-risk folks they're two vaccine if we give everybody else one shot we will reach herd immunity much much quicker and we want to empower the fda to use this real world data and by the way they're already doing this in great britain i bet europe will be doing it soon as well so i want to save thousands our our plan would save tens of thousands of american lives have you heard uh feedback from it what's what's been the uh potential response from dr falchi or other figureheads we might recognize well you know dr bauchie lives in a in an ivory tower and has not had to set out in rural kansas making to taking all this science and applying it so this scares them they're afraid they're going to be sued they're afraid to uh to make an on on the job decision a decision that can impact everybody uh so of course they're going to push back on it because the fda has not approved it for this use but i want to empower the fda to use the real world evidence that's out there that would suggest this look this is a crisis uh and this would save tens of thousands of lives so for you know i hope people pull their head out of the textbook and see some real world application here uh that that this is what a lot of doctors i've talked to agree with me that this would save thousands probably tens of thousands of kansans lives so i hope that that that they realize that not every patient follows the textbook and that if we had 70 to 80 affecting us giving people one vaccine we'll reach herd immunity a month sooner some of the textbook guidance seems to change because we heard initially it was six feet of distance and now if you've been watching dr fauci's latest interview three feet is acceptable um senator marshall we appreciate you joining us from the great state of canada emma it's always great to be on with you thanks thank you take

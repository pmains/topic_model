senator from New York Madam President there's a bill at the desk and I ask for its first reading the court will read the title of the bill for the first time as to 872 a bill to amend the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 or so and so forth of for other purposes I now ask for a second reading and in order to place the bill on the calendar under Rule 14 I object objection having been heard time the bill will be received its second well we would reread its second reading on the next legislative day madam president 100 days ago the House of Representatives voted unanimously to pass the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 reform Act the bill that would fix the way we deal with sexual harassment discrimination here in Congress the current system is broken it makes no sense that a staffer who is sexually harassed or discriminated against has to possibly wait months for mediation for counseling for cooling off before she or he is able to even file a claim this bill would also make sure that when a member of Congress is sexually harassed or discriminated against someone on their staff the taxpayers are not left holding the bag that is what the bill does there is no reasonable excuse for anyone to stand in the way our constituents do not deserve to have their hard-earned dollars paying for these settlements what they deserve is a vote on this reform now but what we've seen since the house acted nothing but politics as usual despite having significant bipartisan support on this issue I want to thank my colleagues the Minority Leader Chuck Schumer senator Klobuchar senator Murray for their strong leadership on this issue and all their efforts to this bill here in the Senate they have been great partners and trying to move this forward it is long since time that we should be acting on this issue we need to pass this bill and send it to the President's desk so he can sign it into law because what we've seen so clearly after the several months and years that we've been talking about this is that sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace is far more pervasive and egregious than we previously might have recognized we've all witnessed harassment and discrimination we all see what it actually does to society whether it's happening in factories or in restaurants or in Hollywood or in the halls of Congress or right here in this building but the difference is while practically every other industry in the country seems to be taking this issue far more seriously and at least trying to make an effort to change their workplaces Congress is dragging its feet once again a problem is staring us right in the face and we are looking the other way enough is enough we should do better we have waited a hundred days and we should not have to wait any longer so I urge my colleagues to do the right thing now to support this bill fix this system here in Congress that is failing our staffers on this issue of sexual harassment this is what is as easy as it gets so let's have a vote and let's pass it I yield the floor

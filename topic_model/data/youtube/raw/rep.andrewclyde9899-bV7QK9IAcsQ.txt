last week as I fought as one of the 20 conservative members to secure victories for the American people by dismantling this institution's broken system and restoring the people's house as it should be part of the status quo here in Washington which we fought to change is politicians making empty promises of government accountability but believe me in this when we vowed accountability is coming we meant it establishing the select committee on the weaponization of the federal government hands the house a powerful tool to uncover the two-tier justice system that is rotting our Republic it's no secret that alphabet agencies have been dangerously weaponized against the American people as an alarming example the FBI has coerced citizens to relinquish their second amendment rights and use big tech companies as private sector proxies to silence Americans Free Speech it's time to thoroughly investigate our government agency's atrocious behavior and abuse of power in disregarding and destroying America's precious freedoms and this select subcommittee will have the teeth to do just that I want to thank speaker McCarthy and chairman Cole for their invaluable support in bringing this resolution to the floor for a vote and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for this resolution so we may deliver transparency answers and yes accountability to the American people as we have promised

I think the chair and the ranking member and our witnesses for being here mr. Vollmer I recognize that china is taking advantage of our laws and without auditor inspections from the PCAOB might be putting on a client company assets at risk which could hurt Main Street investors I am concerned however that prohibiting trading in public companies is also a drastic measure perhaps an overcorrection that would also adversely affect Main Street investors who might own shares of those companies either directly or through mutual funds in their retirement accounts what are the implications if trading prohibitions on hundreds of public companies were implemented if it were done at once as the bill proposed it seems to propose there it would be quite disruptive to the marketplace current shareholders need some advanced reasonable advance notice so they can try and sell out if there were to be a total flat ban that's not the proposal in the bill right bill would allow trading to continue in the united states ranking member whose anga not just abroad they certainly might be able to trade abroad we can't deal with that but they could still be treated in the United States in the US over-the-counter markets the way the bill is currently written they would only prohibit exchange three well what happens to the exchange-traded funds ETFs then and mutual funds that own shares of those non-us companies that would be dualistic they would continue to trade I think reasonably well if it's a fairly high volume traded are there less drastic or disruptive alternatives mr. Vollmer that would not be as harmful to the US capital markets I think there are and I propose to in my written statement one quickly would be a case-by-case determination by the SEC quite similar to a process the sec uses today in over a hundred times a year to stop trading when there's inadequate public information available and that's called a section 12 j proceeding and so the sec could do that the only minor changes needed are needed for current law and then i proposed a more creative solution which would be a bonding or insurance policy requirement i saw that mr. bowler i'm also concerned about the decline in american IPOs over the last few decades and the growing trend of American companies opting for private capital as opposed to public markets meanwhile China's IPO market produced over one-third of the world's IPOs in 2017 which makes the decline in American IPOs even frankly more troubling why should we find these trends concerning sir well I agree that there's there are some quite concerning trends I think we need more study about why the Chinese companies have been able to engage in frequent IPOs and we have a declining trend in the u.s. I don't have an answer to that but I agree with you we need to do more work what do you think if some of some of the biggest deterrents could be to companies going public oh well there are many issues that scholars have identified and I don't think that scholars have come to rest on any one regulatory burdens through the registration process or one a second is that when you become a reporting company you take on a whole series of very costly obligations the bills discussed in today's hearing create these kinds of additional requirements on American public companies adding to their regulatory compliance costs I agree completely not every one of the bills today being considered but many of them increase the costs of compliance increased disclosure costs and those all add to the cost of raising capital and these increase compliance cost for public companies deter private companies from going public is that correct I agree with that yes how does a company going public not only benefit the economy in terms of of jobs but also in terms of Main Street investors in America oh there there are lots of economic studies that have been done about the benefits to our society at large from IPOs but mostly from almost all forms of capital raising it leads to economic growth new products I just don't see the consistent the constant decline as we've seen now over decades and decades as China and other actors move into this space it's it's something that we have to really look at and I think you're right study in terms of the deterrent factors to private companies in the United States of America going public so I thank you for your testimony I'll yield back the chair

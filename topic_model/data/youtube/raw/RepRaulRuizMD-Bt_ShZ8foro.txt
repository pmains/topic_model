china wants to welcome congressman Ruiz to the committee and recognize them for five minutes thank you I appreciate that mr. chairman the clean air and clean water act protect our basic necessities clean breathable air and safe drinkable water fundamental elements we all need to survive and we need to prioritize protecting our health I'm an emergency medicine physician I take care of asthma and the worst moments I've taken care of kids who have come in with a neck asthma exacerbation and gone into cardiac arrest and that passed away and those moments of me having to tell their parents that their child just died still haunt me to this day asthma is exacerbated by air pollution it is one of the most common pre-existing diseases among children in the US and leading cause of hospitalizations and school absences there are over thirty four million asthmatics in the US including 7 million children annually nationwide there are over 10.5 million physician visits due to asthma two million emergency room visits due to asthma and 11 billion dollars spent on asthmatic treatments while asthma can be debilitating or even life-threatening it can be a controllable disease asthma densified by environmental conditions such as outdoor air pollution so why would we want to make it harder for asthmatic children and vulnerable populations to breathe clean air we also know many of the water systems that serve low-income communities have drinking water contamination levels above federal guidelines which can lead to a number of developments on behavioral health issues in my in my district we have rural communities that rely on well water because there's no water infrastructure and there's high level of contaminated arsenic funding improvements to water systems would improve the lives of these families and children's and many of these families live in underserved areas and rely on health care Medicaid to get access to take care of their asthma and all of the other developmental problems that they have miss maze tell me are you you and Medicaid yes we are covered by the the Flint water Medicaid expansion so that was part of the expansion yes okay what you know lead can have a cute toxicity it can cause your ability behavioral changes headache abdominal pain nausea vomiting all these things that's just if somebody takes a big swig of lead toxicity that's not what's happening in Flint that's more of a higher dose but doesn't cause acute symptoms it's more chronic in nature those are the silent killers the silent things where you know people may have developmental delays they have hearing problem nerve nervous system injuries kidney speech language even growth muscle bone development and eventually seizures which can be life-threatening so if you didn't have Medicaid what would happen to your children we would not be able to take them to the rheumatologist to the the osteo specialist fantasy because of their growth plates and growth problems they would not be able to get the blood work done to consistently see what's going on ideal of seizures at this point so I wouldn't be able to see my neurologist my gastroenterologist my rheumatologist are infectious diseases dr. are toxicologists and environmental physician we wouldn't be able to see any of them because we couldn't afford it we just do not have that money so if we did not have the health coverage we wouldn't be able to try to manage the side effects of these permanent damages and that are your neighbors in the same place the other parents of children that have these calamities absolutely a flint is 41 % at or below the poverty line so we're struggling city as it is and access to quality medical care if you do not have Medicaid is slim to none so we have so many people that never got tested so they don't even know how high their blood blood levels were during that first crucial 28 days so we have people that are dying from seizures there was a 29 year old school security guard who had a seizure and died at the school and we have no idea what it was caused by because he didn't have insurance so we are absolutely terrified right now any kids that you know with renal failure on hemodialysis or anything we have a lot we have several different rhian dialysis clinics that are full there's a waiting list my oldest son now high blood pressure because he has kidney damage all three of my sons have low vitamin D levels because their kidneys are not producing enough because they have been hit or by the side its primary reason why I ran for office to begin with I I didn't grow up in the political world guys I didn't run for City Council and then work my way up I came straight from the emergency department because I I take care of these patients that I care so much about and it breaks my heart to know how sometimes politicians up you are so removed from the human face of failed policies and they're not smiling they're on hemodialysis they're worried and if we don't start prioritizing correctly our funding to help patients and help real people with real problems and and kind of make that our focus instead of you know prioritizing putting at the top of our list removing these protections in order to benefit you know some of the companies then I I think we're just going to have a worse human tragedy and with that I'm sorry you're going through this thank you I'll be praying for you and your family thank you so much yeah

shin to recommit that I offered today is simple straightforward and long overdue the amendment is a technical correction to update our nation's laws to reflect the realities of the day by eliminating outdated discriminatory language that's currently found in the u.s. code over a year ago the Supreme Court ruled definitively on the question of equal protection for all citizens under the law their decision in obergefell vs hodges struck down discriminatory laws that find marriage and made marriage equality the law of the land following that decision the Veterans Administration issued guidance to ensure that all legally married veterans and their spouses would have access to the full range of federal benefits that they earned through their military service yet title 38 of the US Code which governs the VA still reflects decades-old language that does not meet the constitutional reality of today this is why I am offering the motion to remove the sex specific definition of spouse found in the VA code now updating the u.s. code is nothing new to this body in 1986 Congress updated our nation's laws to reflect the fact that not all veterans are men and not all veterans spouses our wives and earlier this year I would remind the house that we passed by unanimous vote a measure offered by my friend and colleague from New York congresswoman Ming to remove discriminatory liang face found in the code the house is not in order man speaker lady is correct the house is not in order the gentlelady is recognized you by passing this MTR we can take yet another step to clean up our laws and recognize all american veterans and their families are equal indeed we owe it to those who have worn the uniform and to their loved ones to respect their service and their sacrifice in both word and indeed so let's remove this discriminatory language and ensure that all veterans are provided the respect the benefits and the equal protection they deserve accordingly I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to have just a fraction of the courage that these brave American heroes have and vote for this MTR I yield back

wonderful thank you all so much for joining us this afternoon i'm lisa mandelblatt i'm going to be moderating today's discussion about uh campaign finance reform and we're really lucky to have folks with us today besides our amazing congressmen who are working really hard to make sure that our democracy actually works for the people we have congressman john sarbanes who represents maryland's third congressional district among other things that he does in congress he is the chair of the democrat democracy reform task force and he is the author of hr1 the for the people act which is legislation to fix that that actually passed the house to fix our democracy and give a voice back to the people and we have tiffany muller who is the president and executive director of n citizens united let america vote and the end citizens let america vote united action fund so thank you all so much for being with us um folks who are in our audience feel free to put your questions into the chat and we will try to get to as many folks as possible for the second half of this conversation so welcome everyone um i'm gonna start us off unless you'd like to congressman i'd love it if you started off actually all right i'm going to start i'm going to start off by kicking it off to tiffany well wonderful i i would love to start us off um thank you so much lisa it's such an honor to be here with you again today uh congressman malinowski congressman sarbanes it's always so much fun to do these together and before we all uh came together we were in the green room talking about uh in october of 2018 when congressman sarbanes and i uh joined uh then candidate tom malinowski for congress in his district for one of these uh get out the vote kind of rallies and talking about campaign finance reform and it was one of our favorite events we talked about it all all the time the room was packed the audience asked the best questions and it doesn't hurt that congressman malinowski is just such a champion on these issues and always speaks with such authenticity and heart on them so it really is an honor to be joining you guys today on it too um so i'm tiffany muller i'm the president of in citizens united and let america vote and we are tackling two of the biggest issues facing our democracy today big money in politics and voter suppression and so ten years ago the supreme court uh decided the citizens united case and for those who don't know it took two really terrible ideas and it merged them together and it said money equal speech and corporations are people and they put a for sale sign on our democracy and what we've seen since then is about four and a half billion dollars of outside special interest money flooding into our elections to try to buy our elections frankly um and in new jersey we've seen over 73 million dollars of outside special interest funding over almost 11 million right there in congressman malinowski's district but more importantly it's not just the amount of money it's what happens to our policy system and what happens in washington dc because of that money and what we've seen is that really no matter what issue you care about whether it's addressing climate change or passing universal background checks to stop gun violence or lowering the cost of prescription drugs or protecting medicare and social security no matter what issue uh you care the most about you can trace the inaction and dysfunction on it back to the money in our politics back to those special interest donors who are protecting a rigged status quo that right now works really well for them but isn't working so well for most americans um and you know congressman malinowski is a true leader on this he understands these issues he's been working on these issues for a good part of his career and cracking down on uh corruption when he was at the state department cracking down on shell corporations he really understands that corruption undermines our democracy and he's really dedicated his life to this cause there couldn't be a clear contrast between him and his opponent tom keane would be just another cog in the machine he's already taken 1.2 million dollars from corporations and corporate pacs while congressman malinowski he takes zero zero dollars from corporate pacs and you know uh he was one of this new wave of reformers that came in pledging not to take that money and when they entered congress there was a huge push on them to change their mind to go back on that pledge to take the money and congressman malinowski said no i made a pledge to my voters they're going to know i stand for them and so he's not taking any money from corporate packs but it does mean he needs your help because he's running a really people-powered campaign so during his last campaign he fought to make sure that h.r won the for the people act which i know congressman sarbanes will talk more about uh was the first order of business in a new congress he helped lead a letter of over a hundred candidates saying that in a new congress it should be the very first item of business that's a letter that uh i know the speaker still holds up and says this showed real momentum this is what brought us all together around this um on the other hand we know again his his opponent will stand up for the status quo he's taken 75 000 from the telecom industry um and he just won't fight for new jersey families so i'm here today because we're 16 days out from the election this is a close race and congressman malinowski uh needs your help to get over the finish line and we need him in congress because he is such a true leader and so it's really an honor to be here today uh i'm gonna kick it back to lisa but before i do i also want to just say how honored i am to be here with congressman sarbanes he is truly the leader of these issues in our in the democratic caucus he was the primary architect of the hr one for the people act which is the largest anti-corruption bill that we've seen in 50 years he's an ally a friend and it is such a pleasure to work with him day in and day out to write our democracy so lisa i'll turn it back to you tiffany thank you so much i really appreciate all those kind words and everything pointing out how important this is to keep malinowski in this seat to make sure that we've actually have folks in washington fighting for voters and not for special interests um congressman sarbanes you want to tell us a little bit more about hr1 and what a breath of fresh air it was to have the congressman malinowski join you for sure well thanks for having me again and can i just say tom malinowski is like this heroic figure that has come out in new jersey he's completely unflappable i mean look at him now it looks like his blood pressure is just like this and i don't know how he does it but it's a it's a character trait which i think brings a lot of people towards them i was thinking of that scene from from apollo 13 about um when they said houston we have a problem and they were losing oxygen and they threw this they threw all these things on a table and tried to figure out what to do to save the crew and i i feel like tom has this kind of astronaut like calm that he brings so houston our democracy has a problem which is that big money is calling the shots we have voter suppression going on we have conflicts of interest but tom showed up in 18 with this incredible class of reformers he was a leader in this effort and i'll never forget the event we had with tiffany and myself and tom in new jersey down the home stretch just about this time two years ago and people were hopeful that if the democrats got the gavel back we would go do all these things we were promising but they were also skeptical because in a sense they've heard it a hundred times before they've been promised that reform would come they were promised by donald trump in 16 that he would drain the swamp etc so there's this kind of you know the the landscape is littered with broken promises when it comes to actually fixing our democracy and fighting corruption so they wanted they wanted to believe that we were going to do this and if we got the gavel we'd follow through and tom understood that when democrats took over we had to push fast to get this onto the floor of the house hr1 and to get it passed within the first 100 days he was one of the voices that would not rest when it came to that agenda and so he's in a position to go to the voters and say promises made promises kept and if you send me back and if you send back the class of 18 and if you bring us reinforcements which we're hopeful is going to happen across the country key reformers that frankly i have to do a shout out now to tiffany muller ecu that have been lifted up through the great work of n citizens united over the last two and four years but if we bring those voices back to washington and we get a good result at all the other levels that we're hoping for we can do this it's the hardest thing to do because this kind of broad transformative uh change to our democracy is also very disruptive of the status quo but tom and his classmates in 18 have shown that they have the courage to stick with their promise they understand there's disruption involved but it's the kind of good disruption just the way john lewis used to talk about good trouble and if we keep making good trouble if we keep self disrupting so that we can create a new reality and a new status quo in a new culture in washington that is respectful of everyday americans maybe we can overcome that skepticism that cynicism that has become so corrosive of the body politic in our country so i i mean i'm so excited to be in a sense in the home stretch here and back with tom and tiffany for this town hall probably some of you that are joining us tonight were in that in-person town hall two years ago so i can tell you this guy kept his promise to you um and he is a leader now in congress and he's just cool as a cucumber again just look at what he's just sitting there totally calm look with it with his hands behind his head what is this um so there we go and and look what what he's what he's fended off in recent weeks we all know about this that's been coming at him again just the courage of his conviction the leadership is something tremendous to see five seconds on hr1 voting reforms to address voter suppression redistricting reform so that people feel respected by the politicians ethics transparency accountability addressing conflicts of interest and then changes to address the undue influence of money in our politics disclosure small donor matching systems to fund congressional campaigns so every day people can step into the candidate pool and run for office and be successful all the grievances we've heard for the last five ten fifteen years from americans across the country about what's wrong with their democracy hr one tries to address those i was privileged not to author it but to assemble hr1 it represents incredible work from our caucus for years in those areas of reform my mantra is the hr1 bag is packed it's by the front door if we get the trifecta we got to grab it and go but getting that trifecta includes holding the house and that means keeping tom malinowski in office back to you thank you so much congressman so congressman malinowski let's say we can pick up that bag and get going what's going to happen what can we hope for um everything will be okay but we'll have a fighting chance um so look first of all i wanna i just wanna thank my friends uh tiffany and representative sarbanes for having my back again and more important for all the work you've been doing to fix our democracy over over many many years we're going to complete it together i'm confident of that um and i i think all of us agree that hr one in this congress should be hr one in the next congress and maybe we can refine it a little bit we passed some other things in the house this year that are kind of in the same bucket but i i i firmly believe that the first bill we take up in the next congress hopefully with that trifecta hopefully with the ability to enact it into law is uh is this reform legislation that we are all committed to here um what would it mean well john john mentioned some of the highlights of the bill number one the transparency would mean that all that uh we'd know where all the money's coming from that's paying for all of the horrible ads that you guys are seeing that doesn't stop the ads but transparency is good because we can then hold people more accountable and folks will understand the you know the special interests behind the ads so that they understand why this uh this money is being spent uh who's trying to influence us and why um the uh the the all the provisions to fix our voting systems uh we're doing pretty well in new jersey in terms of avoiding voter suppression um but uh having nonpartisan uh commissions to uh to to write uh the lines of congressional district would certainly help us and and actually just just financial assistance to our state to upgrade our voting system so that we have a paper trail for every single ballot this is by the way the first time in decades this election when we will have a paper trail for every ballot in new jersey because we've gone uh to this all-male system um but uh you know if we don't keep that if we go back to machine voting i do want to make absolutely sure uh that we have the assistance to use machines that are properly secured and then john mentioned this very briefly the small donor matching system what that would mean is that it would be worth every candidate's while to spend a lot more time with the kinds of donors who can afford to write a twenty dollar check or a fifty dollar check to the candidate that they support and to rely a lot more on the grassroots fundraising whether it's having a big barbecue in somebody's backyard or sending out emails to a grassroots list which means again candidates and members of congress would would therefore automatically spend more time with real people and less time on the phone chasing those big dollar contributions which is time taken away no matter how conscientious you are no matter how serious you are about policy it's time taken away from doing the job doing the job that you all sent us there to do um so that's hr1 but by the way like the closer we get to the end of this crazy campaign that i'm in the the more uh the more strongly i feel that hr one is not enough and that we also need to take the step that tiffany's organization is named after and do that constitutional amendment to repeal the citizens united decision i was just on a downtown walk in cranford new jersey and i had the experience that i actually find this very funny and fun but it's also kind of disturbing where you meet kids like 10 year old kids and they can recite all the ads um you know especially the negative ads against you which is the funny part you know like oh my god tom malinowski you're too liberal right um but they're also like oh my god every time i turn on my shows every time i watch youtube it's like oh they're so annoying because we're at the stage of the campaign where it's so many millions of dollars in one little congressional district that it's constant and really the only reason you even do the ads is because your opponent has the ads and if you don't do the ads then then your opponent has free run to go after you and tell all these ridiculous horrible lies in my case and if you're not countering that you're you're not going to win but it's not like you're persuading people with these ads anymore um and then you look at a place like south carolina where you know i love jamie harrison our democratic candidate but he raised 55 million dollars in the last three months it's crazy it's absolutely crazy how much money is going into the system and it's really just money competing against money at this stage in the game um but we we will never it's constitutionally impossible to place any limits on that we can get transparency with hr1 but to actually place limits on it unless we deal with that citizens united decision we're never going to be free of that system that is driving our voters crazy making people more cynical about politics and taking us away from the campaigns that we need to be running where actual candidates are debating issues in front of actual voters so that's what i want that's the change i want in our district get rid of 80 of these ads have debates forums small donor fundraisers that's the democracy we need absolutely well that's actually a perfect um leeway trans i can't even speak today i'm sorry folks so tiffany green day please do you can do this uh tiffany how did we get here with and how do we fix it how did we get here this is for tiffany not you oh sorry good i was gonna give it to tiffany because she said oh there we go i was like i can't i was trying i was hitting the mute button and it wouldn't work uh yeah so i mean money in politics has always been a problem in our country and it's one of those things that throughout our history we have there's been this push and pull between trying to push back on the access and the influence that the wealthy and well-connected have in order to create a democracy that is more reflective and more representative of the people right and we constantly expand what that means and what that looks like um so even before citizens united i think most folks would have said there's too much money in politics but it pales in comparison to what we're seeing today so in 2008 the cycle before citizens united um there was a 148 million dollars of outside spending in our elections that's a lot of money but right now more than that is being spent in most of these individual senate races across the country right so we went from 148 million dollars in 2008 which was a very expensive cycle as you know it was when obama was running the first time uh and we have gone to a system where it this past cycle it was 1.4 billion dollars of outside special interest spending a 900 increase in just a few short cycles and congressman malinowski's point what that is actually done is it means that no longer do you have candidates controlling the spending in their own races so it used to be in a competitive toss-up seat like the congressman's the candidates themselves were responsible for about three quarters of the communication and the spending in their races and outside special interest groups or you know other folks who are interested in the race accounted for anywhere between a quarter to a third and but it meant that the race stayed more positive it meant that the candidates had to tell more of their story about who they are what their priorities were why they were running it meant that they had to do some of that standing in the public square and having those debates and having those forums and since citizens united what we've seen is a complete reversal of that that actually in most competitive uh senate and house races which is just a limited amount of them right so this is also congested into just about 60 races every cycle three quarters of the spending in those races is controlled by outside special interest groups so it's americans for a better america versus tomorrow america will be great all spending all this money against each other we could use real names but it doesn't even matter it is just these dark money or gray money outside groups uh that we have no idea where their funding is coming from or why they care so much about this race just telling lies and misinformation about the candidates right so the races are more negative the candidates don't control the messaging uh and it furthers to the congressman's point skepticism mistrust just not having faith in our democracy right and here's the other part that it's done the very threat of that money being spent also keeps people from doing their jobs in washington i'll give you a good example climate change prior to citizens united there were 14 instances of senate republicans joining with senate democrats to address the very real concerns of global warming and climate change since citizens united there have been zero it's not because the oil and gas lobby went and spent in every single one of those races but it's because they said if you join and actually try to address this we will go spend so even the very threat of that unlimited and undisclosed spending is enough to keep our policy debates you know just in complete dysfunction just in a state where they can't move forward um so that's how we've gotten here and the only way we're going to get out the first and most important way you've heard us talk about some of the policies and those are important we need to overturn citizens united we need to pass hr1 we need to put structures in place that give power back to the people but you know what we have to do first first we have to send the right leaders to washington because first you have to have people who will even recognize that the system is broken and that they are willing to stand up and say no i'm gonna do it a different way and that's why thank you to everyone who's taking time out of their sunday afternoon to join us today because congresswoman malinowski is truly one of those leaders and it's why we have to send him back to congress thank you tiffany i know it's really important to remind folks that congressman malinowski is there to actually get these reforms made and done so they can pass really important legislation and um unfortunately his opponent is not one of those people and um you know as we said we've had the congressman doing these drive-by meet and greets and we have him doing drive up meet and greets i should say in light of what's going on here and um downtown walks and meeting with folks on street corners and really making sure he's engaged with people and that's just not something his opponent does and i don't think anything will change if and when he the other guy if he ended up in washington so thank you um congressman anything you want to yeah me or john you could speak okay thank you um so a couple of points to build on what tiffany just said so that ratio is very interesting um in our race uh i don't have the precise figures off the top of my head but on my side it's still about three quarters of the the money that that is paying for ads in communications in support of me uh is raised it is money raised by me again none from corporate pacs overwhelming majority from individual people who just support me support what i want to do and are inspired to give for that reason um on my opponent's side the ratio is pretty much reversed the majority of the spending um has come from uh mostly political party based super pacs like the congressional leadership fund uh the national republican congressional committee and the important thing about that is it think about the the the incentive structure that that creates for candidates number one um i i could say a lot of mean and nasty things about the leadership of the democratic party and if i went super far in that direction because i felt like it and they said malinowski we're cutting you off i would still have the majority of the resources that i have right now certainly enough to run a very credible campaign for congress so it allows me independence whereas my opponent couldn't do that even if he sincerely wanted to distance himself from donald trump for example i don't think he does but if he sincerely wanted to do it uh and his uh party-backed uh trump-backed super pacs decided all right to heck with you we're out of here he'd have almost nothing left to run a credible congressional campaign um and so it makes it almost impossible for him even if he had the courage and the desire to be independent of the party line um the second point you mentioned briefly tiffany it also creates more negativity because when it when you're the candidate and you have to say at the end of every ad that you're paying for i'm tom malinowski and i approve this message it does force you to be a little bit more responsible you need to know you can personally stand by that message um the ad is much more likely to be positive it's more likely to be issues based and if it's negative if it's a criticism of your opponent then it's something you've looked at and you can say you know what i can stand by that i can go out into the public square and if somebody confronts me about that i can say you know what it's a fair ad and and here's why um and so what ends up happening is it's the outside groups who are doing the really vicious ads and campaigns say all right they'll do that they'll do that for they'll do the dirty work for me uh and then i'll put up nice squishy little ads of me with a golden retriever and my beautiful family and that kind of stuff and so you end up with a lot more vicious uh not just negative but dishonest vicious fear-mongering political messaging out there because candidates can say oh well that has nothing to do with me um and we're seeing that of course in our race big time right now yes we certainly are i want to just change uh direction just for half a second and then we're going to open it up to um questions congressman sarbanes we've seen the voting rights act gutted and now with the pandemic and voting being just so confusing for so many people can you talk about how what hr one would do to make sure that every single per every american who's who can it will can vote sure well you're right i mean um we saw the attack on the voting rights act and the shelby case knocked out what they called this pre-clearance formula where there were certain communities states and communities across the country that had a historic record of discriminating when it came to voting and before they could put in any changes with respect to how voting operated there they needed to get that pre-cleared by the united states justice department that was knocked out what was incredible was within minutes of that decision being made you saw voter suppression uh schemes being put in place across the country in those very communities and in those very states and districts so there was a group of americans uh not very patriotic in my estimation who had these voter suppression plans ready to go they were sitting on a shelf and as soon as that shelby decision came down they pulled him off the shelf and they put him into place and look people like mitch mcconnell are grand architects of this structure that has undermined people's ability to vote across the country for years so this gave them even more leeway and maneuvering room to do that kind of thing hr1 contains a lot of provisions actually in large measure based on some of the voter suppression that we've seen over the last few years in 2016 even in 2018 we did some adjustments uh to what was emerging as the blueprint of hr1 to account for these voter suppression efforts across the country that would address them head on and that can make a tremendous difference going forward because right now the average voter it's incredible to say this you know almost 250 years after our founding more than 50 years after john lewis was nearly beaten to death marching across the edmond pettus bridge because what he just wanted to protest for the right to vote and yet in america it's still like running an obstacle course to try to register and vote it doesn't make any sense it's an embarrassment frankly if we believe as we do that this is the greatest democracy in the world why is it still so hard to vote so hr one has a lot of things to address voter suppression but also a lot of things to just make it easier more convenient and more sensible the way we vote automatic voter registration same day voter registration a certain minimum number of early voting days across the country no excuse absentee ballot voting everywhere in the country and then we also have been trying to put funding as as tom indicated behind that to help local boards of elections state board officials and so forth to kind of stand up and fortify the election system across the country so if we can get those reforms in place and the goal would be one of the reasons we need to move fast on hr1 in the next congress is because there's a certain window of opportunity to get these things in place so that they're actually online in a sense by the 2022 election so that voters can actually see that they're benefiting from those reforms that's why we've got to move fast if we get this window of opportunity so that's the essence of the voting reforms that are proposed in hr1 it all can be distilled to i'm tired of running an obstacle course to get to the ballot box just make it easier and more convenient for me to be able to do that and absolutely hr one is designed to make that happen thank you and here in new jersey we're lucky we have ballot drop boxes in every county and a lot of the towns what a lot of people don't know is that congressman malinowski's opponent actually voted against those ballot having those drop boxes and he voted against automatic voter registration when you get your driver's license so when you think that voter suppression is only happening in the southern states just know that there are folks right here in new jersey who are trying to do that as well i want to open it up the floor to some questions if that's okay with everybody um i know we why don't we start with diana jones is diana on the call still here i am hello okay go ahead diana there you are hi i had a couple questions it it seems the good work that the sheldon whitehouse did on the scotus hearings unmasked a lot of dark money buying seats in the supreme court and they seem to be doing it by actually donating to a 501c that then turned out next to a pack it seems to me that could be something that you could wrap into hr1 it's a sham you know a tax deduction for a political donation that's number one number two we're in this teeter-totter view now that people have taken advantage of the power that they extend to themselves where everything you guys pass the next one unpasses it and you i think you're going to lose a lot of people worldwide as well as in the u.s how do we make what you pass last without having to depend upon having a trifecta well um you know the i i you can never guarantee anything right in a democracy nor should you be able to because the system is by definition open to change including change in the in the wrong direction but uh i think all of us uh despite um despite all the hard knocks that our democracy's taken that we've all witnessed in the last few years i think we're pretty confident that if we make it easier for people to register and vote if we incentivize candidates to run by trying to earn votes rather than donors then we are going to be more likely in the future to see reform pro reform candidates anti-corruption candidates elected because this stuff is hugely popular with the american people the hardest election to win is going to be the first election right this one because we have to run this election against voter suppression we have to run this election against dark money with all of the disadvantages that the rigged system has placed in our path if we can overcome them enough to be able to elect a congress and a president willing to put these reforms into place the next election and the one after that is going to be easier for honest anti-corruption candidates to win and we'll still have all kinds of debates about policy and we'll be back and forth republican democrat conservative liberal but i i i think less likely to see a reversal of the the reforms themselves um yeah let me just let me just add to that i think tom's exactly right first of all on the 501 c 3s and c4s and see everything's in all that way that the hidden money the games that get plays the shell games that's very much at the heart of hr1 is figuring out how to stop those shell games um in fact there's a rider that that mitch mcconnell always puts on to the appropriations bills which uh restricts the um internal revenue service from doing the kind of review of these tax exempt organizations that may be engaging in political activity that would require them to behave better he blocks that every time hr1 includes a provision that would make it clear that the irs has the authority to do that kind of investigation among other transparency measures that are included it's also important i think because i don't think we've mentioned it but hr one has a significant number of provisions that we actually broke out into something called the shield act and tom was hugely instrumental in in some of these measures to protect us against um foreign intervention in our elections now i very much believe that that we're more vulnerable to foreign actors attacking our democracy when we lack confidence in it ourselves because it's easier to sow discord and spread this information if people start out already not trusting our own government so one of the benefits of passing hr1 putting these reforms in place is you start to strengthen people's commitment and confidence again in their own democracy which makes a democracy more resilient to that attack from the outside which is so critical these days and then in terms of the staying power of these reforms one of the big problems with this cynicism that we've been talking about today is that it's caused a lot of americans to flee the political town square out of disillusionment frustration anger and they've kind of gone up into the hills and bunkered down because they're so upset and frustrated when that happens extreme elements rush into the town square they take over the political discourse and you can get this kind of tip for tat mentality operating if we can begin to pull citizens back into the town square where we can benefit again from what a democratic pluralistic society offers us in terms of exchanging ideas debating as tom said but doing it in a respectful and information-based way then i think all these reforms we're talking about are ones that will become embedded in our country again as we move forward so um it's all kind of mutually reinforcing but right now we have to take that first step we kind of have to break through the doors that have been locked against the american people and and largely it's mitch mcconnell and the koch brothers and these special interests that are standing there with their arms folded at the gates of our democracy saying you won't you shall not pass and we have to overcome that and i think we can do it i think the american people are ready um to make that change so um it's not going to happen without getting people had come back to washington but if we get it done we can keep moving and i think the american people will uh will support that as we move forward you know the only other thing i would add to all of the the great comments that both congressmen just made is this isn't a partisan issue outside of washington d.c republicans independents democrats everyone wants to get money out of politics everyone wants the corruption cleaned up everyone wants a government that they think listened to them so outside of washington dc and capitol hill where uh they are attempting to turn this issue into a partisan political football um the people are with us even 75 percent of republicans want to overturn citizens united so what we have to recognize is that um we have to make sure we educate them we have to make sure that we inform them about why we're doing it and what it is um but i think that that helps hold on to it longer term because the people are literally with us on this now 75 it's hard to get 75 to agree on anything right right yeah thank you diana thank you so much for your question um i believe ingrid has a few questions and great are you unmuted ingrid are you there it looks like you've uh um you know we're going to mute ingrid and we're going to come back to ingrid um let's move on mary jo mcshane had a question mary jo lisa yes hi i'm mary jo yeah um i guess i wrote a question anyway thank you for this presentation i um i i don't know too much about the subject um i guess i'm curious to know if dark money is involved is there no way to trace back to the contributors of the dark money yeah that's part of why it's uh called dark is that um they are not forced to disclose who the initial contributor always was so i'll give you a couple of examples of how it works and there's what we call dark money which is undisclosed where there's some money that we call grey money uh which is that it's semi-disclosed but not really um and there's a whole host of ways that folks have been working to hide the the initial input of the money into the political system um and the other thing before i talk about actually how this works is we've seen the increase of undisclosed money since citizens united so the supreme court made this made this terrible decision but one of the things they said in this decision was well we'll have complete transparency and disclosure around political giving and so that will shine light on it and that will keep uh public officials held accountable but actually what we've seen instead is that 50 percent 5-0 half of the money being spent in elections is undisclosed money where we don't know where it's coming from so one example is that we know that there was uh we know that money that is given to a 501 c 4 which is supposed to be a social welfare organization doesn't have to report all of its donors it's supposed to have to report some to the irs but they have uh stripped away even the rule as congressman sarbanes was talking about to report it there so um we have seen folks like the nra take massive amounts of huge donations and we have no idea where that's coming from um as a matter of fact we still from 2016 we believe that there were russian uh foreign interference through the nra um and we watched their political spending more than double in that one election cycle but we literally don't know where the money comes from other ways that we see it happen um one of uh one of them is the american chemical council which has lots of oil and gas and folks from both in the united states and outside the united states who pour money into the american chemical council they then give it to this place called the american action network neither one of them have to report their donors they then turn around and give it to a super pac called congressional leadership fund so the only thing you can do is you can trace that donation back to american action network but you have no idea who the original source of the donors was was it exxon was it bp was it some individual we have no idea um 501 c 3 and 4 they don't disclose on the fec website that's correct that's correct so a 501c3 is a tax deductible charitable organization so um we definitely see them especially as sheldon whitehouse um enumerated this week in the judiciary stuff but the one we see taken advantage of the most is the 501c4 which is supposed to be a social welfare organization they're supposed to have to spend at least half of their money on things for the community good and for the common good um but we know that oftentimes they're just set up as shell political organization so that they don't actually have to report this money and they only report they don't report to the fec they only report to the irs to the irs yeah and they don't even have to report those donors so we can't we literally do not have the mechanism to trace that money back and the irs is under no obligation to release information to people is that they're currently not even under an obligation to collect the information yeah the irs has to be careful about what it divulges because there's a certain uh kind of confidentiality that it maintains generally with taxpayers and tax filers across the country about that that's important standard but there's a lot more the irs could do if they if they were freed to do it to monitor whether these organizations that are supposed to be meeting certain standards are in fact um really just a vehicle for leaning on our on our political system which over the last few years they have been another important reform in hr1 is to fix the broken federal election commission which uh doesn't operate these days because it's it's basically in a deadlock this is the this is the commission that exists to kind of blow the whistle on bad conduct in at any moment but certainly in the home stretch of a campaign it's the cop on the beat if it can't do its job then if some super pac or other organization is breaking the law and coming in and spending money against tom there's no way that fec is in a position to stop that because their hands are tied right now if we fix that commission then in real time they could be bringing vigilance looking out for this bad behavior and calling people out on it and making sure that it stops and doesn't impact the election and one last thing i just wanted to say is you know it can be kind of demoralizing to talk so much about the influence that big money has had and there's no question about the impact that it has had on our politics which is why i'm so drawn to the parts of hr1 that are about empowering everyday americans to push back to actually be players in their own democracy again yes it's important for us to put a referee on the field of our democracy to blow the whistle when the big actors are misbehaving so that's what we do with the fec that's what we do with transparency and accountability because those big money actors are out there we've got to call them out throw the flag but that's not enough if average americans are still up in the bleachers of their own democracy as spectators watching what happens on that field of their democracy they kind of feel like well what's what's the point why should i be involved why should i care one of the wonderful things about this small donor matching system is that it's so empowering of people and it will pull folks out of the bleachers bring them on to the democracy field where they can be power players themselves and they can compete against the big money packs and against the koch brothers and say don't go on it this is our democracy we own it we call the shots there's that phrase he who pays the piper calls the tune well right now the piper the candidates are being paid they're being supported they've become dependent upon big money actors and those big money actors call the tune they decide what the laws are they decide what the priorities are when it comes to all the things we care about if the people of this country if everyday americans were the ones that called the tune because they're the ones lifting up and empowering candidates across the country our priorities could change overnight and we could make progress on them so this has always been about power people are angry and frustrated when they feel powerless but they can get engaged and they can become motivated if they see an opportunity to exercise power on behalf of the people james madison said the government should be dependent upon the people alone that's the vision of our democracy and republic that we need to get back to and that very much is at the heart the center it's the north star behind the hr one and reform thank you um i think ingrid is ready ingrid are you ready yep are you ready yeah yep we can hear you hey guys so uh i had a couple questions but this is i i hate citizens united so since the scotus appear to lean in favor of corporations and especially now i think it might even go a little strongly that way how would the house actually initiate a reversal of citizens united because the first amendment right has not changed and that was what was used initially for citizens united to um be ruled in favor it would require a constitutional amendment and that takes how many states three quarters of the state i know that's a lot okay but this is popular this is not a crazy idea this is a very popular thing and so any constitutional amendment is hard it's designed to be hard but this is not um not impossible so that would be the same with voting rights because when we're doing voting rights we are fighting state governments not necessarily no the voting rights act which was gutted by the shelby decision as as john outlined before uh we've already passed legislation in the house which we now call the john lewis civil rights act um in addition to the provisions of uh of hr1 um that we believe would correct that problem um citizens united i think is in a different category i'm i assume you guys agree or would you disagree with that yeah i mean the shelby decision the supreme court actually said to to congress directed congress to come up with a new pre-clearance formula which is what you all did in h.r for the now called john lewis voting rights act um and citizens united it definitely builds on previous cases and is in a different just a different bucket um but here's why i have hope i have hope because uh we know that so many of the people are actually with us on this i have hope because an organization like mine that is grassroots funded and grassroots powered and has four million members couldn't even have existed five years ago but there's so much outrage about this now that we do and we can and we're growing and i have hope because 20 states 20 have already passed ballot measures saying we need to overturn citizens united and those aren't just states like massachusetts or new york those are red states like montana where it passed with 72 percent of the vote so you're right we need uh you know we have to pass it in the house and the senate which goes to why we have to make sure we're electing the right leaders to the house and the senate and then we have to get it ratified in the states um but we start in a stronger position than with some other things that we want and hope to do because so many of the people are with us and because we've already seen such amazing momentum on the state level around this issue thanks tiffany for that explanation um i'm going to sort of wrap this up my apologies to folks who didn't get to ask their questions but i hope that in some ways they were answered as we went along and i just want to remind everyone we've got 16 days we have 16 days to make sure that congressman malinowski goes back to washington continues to fight for us continues to fight for democracy and all of the good things that come along with that um so in the chat you can see there are ways to sign up to help us get out the vote we're really excited that next sunday we are going to be doing a drive in rally for geo tv there should if you go onto that same mobilize site you'll see information about it and just help us bring this home because they're not the these two are not the flip side of the same coin we are diametrically opposed candidates who are so different from one another i know that congressman malinowski represents every single one of us every single day and i want to make sure he goes back there so i hope you'll all help me make that happen um congressman you have any last words well we're it's far too soon for last words lisa but uh onward words so you know people sometimes ask me like if you could only do three things or if you could only do five things uh at the start of the next congress what would they be and i find those really hard because my i can't like narrow it down to three or to five but when they ask me okay if you only get one thing what would it be that is in a funny way an easier question because if i could only get one thing it would be this stuff because this unlocks the door to everything else i know that if we could if we could do this if we could pass something like hr1 then it would just be a lot easier to get healthcare to get prescription drugs to get the gun reform to get action on climate change to get all the other stuff that that voters rightly demand that affects their lives and i think that's why it's so popular people get that and so i love running on this issue um and i honestly think look we gotta win an election before we can fix our elections before we can fix our democracy but we win this one against these obstacles that i think we're about to overcome i i think next year can can be a historic year of recovery and renewal and reform in america and i can't wait to be part of it we can't wait to help you get there thank you all so much for joining us tiffany congress sarbanes thank you so much for joining we'll all be together in the same exact place

minister sanchez welcome and thank you for coming here this afternoon kind of a follow-up question that the chairman was getting at as well kansas doesn't have a huge hurricane with billions of dollars of damage typically we have lots of small disasters it's a tornado impacting a town you know two or three different times a year and then we've had our share of wildfires as well while this disaster office has been there for each of our events they're at an incredibly slow pace for example fires in hutcheson kansas on march 9th the sba resource center wasn't set up until april 28 seven weeks later constituents struggled to wait seven weeks for that assistant why would there be substantial delays what would you feel a success how do you major success what would be your goal in your response team getting to a disaster sure thank you senator i'll address in part what the sba challenge is and how we tie it to the larger picture uh typically for loan processing uh is about five days and then disbursement of first funds is is is uh sorry loan processing's about eight days for homeowners five days for the actual disbursement we come in on the ground after there's been a disaster declaration at the state we are working with our state partners to educate about how we meet the threshold to try to expedite that process so that we can be on the ground quicker as well what about this the time to be on the ground from the time the disaster occurs how do you measure that and what what would you think like seven weeks just seems too too long to me yeah senator if that was uh seven weeks from the time of the disaster what we have to wait for to actually open the lending process is for the disaster declaration to be uh cleared uh requested by the state and then we can be on the ground we're working with our partners to educate how we can expedite that for our states uh but once once we get that trigger we can be on the ground within 48 to 72 hours so your goal would be once the state declares a disaster is to have presence there in two to three working days yes sir uh one once that comes to us we sign it and we're on the ground okay again kind of on the same long line of questionings for those wildfires it appears that our staff had to do most of the i'm going to call it marketing letting them know what the sba could and couldn't do how they could help what can you do to better improve your communication to those small businesses that you're there to help them what what are the opportunities for improvement there i think as the chairman mentioned reaching into score and those local district offices to see how we can tailor that for that specific community uh and i have a commitment to work with our officials from those states and local officials to see you're where the expertise is on that ground how do we leverage our knowledge to those local communities what communities should we be in what does that mean needs to look like we want to increase access of those programs it's an undertold story so we want to partner with that when we're on the ground with local officials and local expertise to make the most impact okay thank you so much i yield back

and joining me now one of only two republicans on the january 6 house select committee congressman adam kinzinger republican of illinois congressman thanks for joining us i know you can't confirm or deny that that text came from rick perry's phone but is the committee planning on bringing perry in before the committee to answer questions well i think if we do that if we if we decide he's somebody we want to talk to that he can provide information that you know one of the 300 other witnesses we've interviewed so far haven't i think certainly that would be on the table but here's an interesting thing regardless of where that text came from because i can't confirm or deny anything is you look at no matter all the numbers of texts that are that are coming out or what people have been saying and you kind of get a peek into the window of their world didn't seem like a lot of these techs were saying hey let's just figure out who got the most votes and declare that person president it was everybody with this new kind of scheme and trick to get around the constitution or to use a technicality of the constitution and i think we have to sometimes step back and say i do believe there are probably some real kind did we break the law questions here but even bigger than that in my mind is what does that say about the the future of democracy if we do we truly believe in it or is it all about when at any cost it's interesting the committee released some truly remarkable texts uh as you noted sent to former chief of staff mark meadows while the capital was under siege that he that he gave to the committee they came from politicians fox personalities even uh the president's own son pleading with meadows to get then president trump to call off that mob explain to our viewers why these these taxes don't just make for dramatic reading but are materially relevant to your investigation well so it's material materially relevant for a number of reasons obviously we have a trail of mark meadows being aware now of what was happening at the capitol not just you know maybe i knew maybe i watched news and everybody may know that that wasn't true but yet you now have proof of it people desperately pleading for him to get the president to be involved because the president for something like 182 minutes nobody heard from him nobody knew what he was up to uh despite this being all over the news and we know he watches the news i also think it's important particularly with the fox news side of things is they went on tv that night some of those people and said this may be antifa this may be the fbi and in the last 10 months have continued that narrative so they had such a chummy relationship with the chief of staff of the president and then in some of those texts said this is making us look bad not this is making you look bad or america look bad this is making us collectively in our movement look bad and uh and so for the last next 10 months they're going to go ahead and obfuscate it that's why that's so important as well i want to play something your fellow republican on the committee congresswoman liz chaney said this week did donald trump through action or inaction corruptly seek to obstruct or impede congress's official proceedings to count electoral votes now in that question she appears to be deliberately referencing the language in a criminal statute quote whoever corruptly obstructs influences or impedes any official proceeding or attempts to do so shall be fined or imprisoned not more than 20 years or both unquote do you believe that donald trump committed a crime and is that something the committee is explicitly investigating i i don't want to go there yet to say do i believe he has i think that's obviously a pretty big thing to say i we want to know though and i think we'll by the end of our investigation and by the time our report is out have a pretty good idea we'll be able to uh you know have out on the public record anything justice department needs maybe in in in pursuit of that nobody jake is above the law nobody not the president he's not a king not former presidents they aren't former kings nobody is above the law and if the president knowingly allowed what happened on january 6 to happen and in fact was giddy about it um and that violates a criminal statute he needs to be held accountable for that i'm not ready to go there yet but i sure tell you i have a lot of questions about what the president was up to so you are looking into that yeah we're looking at so look here's the thing with the the report january 6 is a very important day we will get every bit of detail that we can possibly get on that what i think so that's important for the president's role but what i think is almost more important is what led up to january 6 what is the rot in the democracy that allowed the six to happen and have we corrected from that sense because what really matters to me is yeah i want to hold the people guilty accountable but i want to make sure this never happens again otherwise january 6 will have been yes a failed trial run but sometimes a failed trial run is the best practice to get one that succeeds a coup that would succeed in toppling our republican republican congressman jim jordan acknowledged that he sent meadows a a tax he forwarded on the language from a former pentagon official and that text laid out how pence as vice president could allegedly reject unconstitutional electoral votes obviously that's a scheme as you mentioned earlier in the show jordan's set to become the chairman of the house judiciary committee if republicans take back the house next year can jordan credibly chair that committee can he credibly share it no can he chair it yeah and i think you know very likely he will because two years ago three years ago or so the republican party saw these non-serious legislators these bomb throwers these let's just get attention as not real contenders now they basically run the republican party i mean what's kevin mccarthy been doing the last year basically whatever marjorie taylor green tells him to do um and and that's you know i look at that and go yeah he could not credibly head the committee but he certainly could head the committee and uh look as a party and i say this to fellow republicans do you really think this is a winning solution for the future yeah it may make you feel good because you're owning people and getting all angry and all that stuff you think it's a winning thing for the future i don't but uh we'll see congressman adam kinzinger thanks so much for being with us uh merry christmas and happy new year to you and your growing family thank you jake back

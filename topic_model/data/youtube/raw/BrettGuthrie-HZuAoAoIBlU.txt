Thank You administrator do you want to finish your comments you were just making it thank you so it a 55 year old couple making 66 thousand dollars a year in Grand Island Nebraska could face an annual premium of over $31,000 and that's on top of a 12,000 dollar deductible in that same situation in Colorado that premium would be thirty two thousand eight hundred dollars in New Jersey the the premium would be almost sixteen thousand so we're talking about people having to spend a third to a half of their income on premiums and that doesn't even include the deductibles and so if those individuals or that couple have a pre-existing condition they don't have any protections today so I was going to talk about the lowering premiums but you're lowering for minority very high premiums that increased since the ACA was passed of the lord but you have made our efforts and and put into place to lowering what john to remain to further lowering premiums I think one of the things that we need to do is focus on lowering the cost of care and there's been so much discussion about throwing more money having you know at the problem having more government control but what we're focused on is lowering the cost of health care many of the initiatives that we have at CMS whether it's around drug pricing whether it's getting rid of administrative burdens that are getting in the way of doctors spending time with their patients and actually increasing costs on whether it's focusing on efficiencies in the system like interoperability and making sure that patients have access to their healthcare records we're trying to focus on actions that are gonna lower the cost of care for Americans if we do that more people will be able to afford health care thanks and I don't want to switch a little bit I have some Kentucky hospitals that contact me about the star rating system before and their question is they understand what the purpose but it doesn't adequately or reflect the quality that they that they produce at their hospitals so I know CMS decided to change the hospital star rating methodology and so my question is that some stakeholders requested same as to remove or suspend star ratings from Hospital Compare website until the hospital star rating mythology is updated but what Tim has what does CMS plan to use the kurma thought methodology to update star ratings and early can you estimate for the fix of this appreciate the question so first of all to start with as we are focusing on lowering health care costs we think that price transparency is very important and along with price transparency quality transparency is important and that's what the hospital star ratings are all about I appreciate the the comments and the concerns that hospitals have raised about their methodology and we've made it clear that we want to work with them so we can make sure that Americans have access to quality information that's going to give them the best understanding of what type of hospital what kind of issues that hospital may have so we are dedicated to working with them in the meantime though we want to be able to use what we have because we think it's important for patients to have that information thank you very much with them thank you very much and last week or week before last thing classically we had a markup on a drug pricing bill here and and the big concern that I've had and one of the the great things has been bipartisan was that the cures Act the things that we moved here and the being in DC when I talk to people back home that things are working and things are moving forward it's the blockbuster drugs that are coming out the blockbuster procedures in the bill that was the CBO estimated that 10 to 15 remedy remedies or cures would be would not come for because of the impact of the bill and there were a couple of members on the other side one is that ten to fifteen would be something to just have to sacrifice for the fact we've been able to negotiate lower drug prices a one set and that well we have these blockbuster cures we can't afford them then what good are they so essentially they're not we don't we the bills better than those those cures and I just my comment was well let's come up with a blockbuster cures and figure out how to pay for them and not lose them because what if that one's Alzheimer's diabetes I mean all the things that are out there so my question is I get to is one of the ways is value-based arrangements and I know there are certain things such as stark law and other things that kind of get in the way of trying to do the value-based arrangements could you talk about that value-based arrangements and pay value-based arrangements for dealing with expensive cures sure I appreciate the question and I think we are seeing the advent of new high cost we've seen drugs price at a half a million dollars a million dollars two million dollars and those are providing hope for so many patients and because of these new medications can actually cure diseases and can actually prevent some downstream costs for the healthcare system over the long term so they can actually reduce costs that being said I don't think that our system is set up to handle this in the Part B program we pay the average sales price plus an add-on of right now it's about four and a half percent with a sequester but it's an add-on payment so if you think about paying an average sales price of a million to two million dollars pressing an add-on I don't think the system can handle it that being said we do need to think about value base times expire challenger now recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois mr.

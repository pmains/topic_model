good morning welcome to this press conference on this beautiful day and welcome to the introduction of the 2011 oil independence for a stronger America Act I want to thank my colleagues senator Udall is unable to join us because the wildfires that are burning in New Mexico Senator Carper who will be here shortly senator Bennet who fortunately is here and michael breen the vice president of the Truman National Security Project and former Army captain and they each will have comments as we go forward in just five days we're going to celebrate our nation's independence but even as we engage in this celebration of our political independence we have greater and greater economic dependence unfortunately on foreign powers to supply us with oil for years leaders from both parties have agreed that our country has a problem when it comes to overseas oil our addiction to overseas oil doubles our trade deficit it threatens our environment it puts our economy and our security at the mercy of foreign regimes that sure neither our values nor our interests today the lifeblood of our economy is oil and if that oil is joy choked off our economy has a heart attack that's an unsustainable and a risky path for our nation and that's why we're here this morning to chart a different path forward to chart a path to energy independence we have the technology know how to eliminate our dependence on overseas oil and to do so within a 20 year period the question is not the technology the question is whether we have the political will to take us forward the oil independence for a stronger America Act lays out a roadmap the chart that you see here and I'm going to address these briefly because of the time constraints were on but I can follow up in the end we have five strategies that reduce our old usage electric vehicles and fuel-efficient cars creates deployment communities to take on the issue of the chicken-and-egg people don't want to buy cars until they have charging stations don't want to put out charging stations until the cars are there and it also raises fuel efficiency standards a third of our oil is burned in car transportation and we take that on we also address alternative fuels next-generation biofuels from algae and biomass third smart transportation options for families we should be helping our communities to create plans that move people not cars that means light rail that means rapid bus transit that means pathways for walking and for biking fourth efficient freight transportation businesses need options for transporting their goods a truck and move a ton of freight 150 miles on a gallon of fuel and that's a long ways but a train can move that same same ton of freight over 400 miles a barge can move it over 500 miles a ton of freight on a single gallon fuel and under this plan we'd shift ten percent of our Freight onto rail marine shipping and a study to see how we could shift more in the future and fifth efficient homes and buildings to help reduce the demand for heating oil we also need to have a national council on energy security so that our determination as a nation to end our diction on foreign oil is not interrupted by the ups and downs of our presidential elections the ups and downs of our congressional elections we need to same emphasis that we have with the National Security Council in having a national energy security council so with that I'm going to invite my colleagues to come forward and share their observations I'm delighted to start with Senator Bennet welcome thank you everybody for being out here today and I want to especially thank Jeff Merkley for his leadership I'm very proud to have co-sponsored this bill in the last Congress and very pleased to do it again is I've traveled the state of Colorado over the last two and a half years it had town hall meetings in red parts estate in blue parts the state Democratic areas Republican areas tea party meetings first of all I can tell you none of them are as contentious as the discussions we're having in the building behind me but the one thing that everybody could agree on is that makes absolutely no sense for this country to have an energy policy that requires us to send billions of dollars a week to the Persian Gulf to buy oil and that is the energy policy of the United States right now it's a backward-looking energy policy we need an energy policy that actually looks forward to the 21st century and says that for national security purposes we're no longer going to rely on this source of oil we're going to find a way to do it ourselves and for an economic reason for jobs we are going to create energy security in the United States of America you know I often said when people were saying we don't think we ought to change this and we are not change that I would say you know what our largest single export from the United States is aircraft we export 30 billion dollars a year of aircraft from this country China's export of solar panels last year was 15 billion dollars half our single largest export they didn't export one solar panel 10 years ago and we invented the technology in the United States but I think this bill does is assert a principle an important one that it will not be the energy policy of the United States that we're going to rely on oil from abroad and instead we are going to lead the world in the energy revolution that's coming in the 21st century that means jobs for the United States it also means jobs for Colorado where we've seen the job growth and new energy outstrip any other part of our economy so I was pleased to sign on to the bill look forward to working with people of both parties and the others the other house to make sure that we leave our kids a world where they no longer are reliant on buying oil from the Persian Gulf thank you for having me today Jeff thank you for your leadership we're delighted to have Tom Carper who co-sponsored is with us last year when we first launched it and we're diving into it again because the problem has not disappeared you know on a day that's beautiful I almost feel like we have not a care in the world but as it turns out that we got a whole lot of carers and among the cares that we have our when we pull up to a gas pump and fill up our vehicles with with with fuel we send a lot of money to places around the world to the countries that are unstable undemocratic and I'm afraid that too many instances they actually use our money to try to hurt us and we ought to be smarter than than doing that there's a the national security aspect of what senator Merkley star trying to do here but sometimes we lose sight of but it's a very important part of it and I just applied his efforts to they'll make sure that as we move toward 2016 when the requirement of fuel efficiency the average reaches 35 miles per gallon that we won't just stop there that will keep on going we're trying to set a good example in galul or doubler for for many years was the only state in which there's auto assembly operations and we lost it literally in 2009 within a six-month period a Chrysler plant Durango's hybrid rangos realized I our GM plant will rebuild to Pontiac solstices and Saturn skies they went away and the idea was at least at the time that neither plan would ever be opened again well guess what we're going to open another the GM plant it's already open it works going on and then late next year we'll have about 2,500 people they're building a fisker product fisker product hindered fix is one of premier auto designers really in the world and he's starting a smaller company and they're going to be building vehicles that will get about 80 miles per gallon 80 miles per gallon drop dead beautiful cars with that kind of mileage and what we want to do is to incentivize more that digital that's what's possible anyway the chevrolet volt and we have Nissan Leaf role we want to make sure that when people call our offices as they have when it's jeff for or michael bennett they call our office and say oh I'm concerned about the price of oil we want to be able to say well there's like here's a list of 40 vehicles that you can buy in this country that actually get 30 or 40 miles or 50 miles per gallon and think about this the next time you're making a purchase so what that's one number one get ourselves off of foreign oil at the same time while we do that find ways to develop products cars vehicles in this country that we can build with new technology itself not just in this country around the world the fiscal products are we're going to be manufacturing late next year at our old GM plant and Wilmington Delaware will go about have we sold in this country have them we sold around the world got a fixed at Wilmington port of Wilmington auto terminal we're ready to roll so that's number one that's what I call turning taking adversity and turning it into opportunity number two I come to work almost every day on the train and i drive my car we live just about 10 minutes from train station in Wilmington and I got on the train and right across the the right by the train station is a we have a line of cabs so people can come to take the train by a cab and the right across the street from the train station is a bus station and so you have the opportunity drive your own car now the opportunity to take a cab to the train station have the opportunity to bus maybe an interstate bus or local bus and you have the opportunity to walk I mean there's like it's multimodal so multimode we come down on the train to to bwi just south of Baltimore people can get off the train take a shuttle go catch a plane and that's the that's those are the kinds of connections that that are smart and make sense and the idea is to kind of like make them all work together to know intermodal way and then meet the individual needs we have is people part of what senator Merkley is trying to do here is to the Denali again ensure ensure that people have smart choices for energy-efficient vehicles reduce her it depends on foreign oil but also to make sure that we have options to get out of our cars trucks and vans and maybe take a gap maybe walk maybe take a bus maybe take a transfer train and art and our neighborhood we take septa but make sure that we have those options available and that that we used it and I was pleased to offer legislation and last caller is called clean tea and it helps to actually make a fair amount of money available for that purpose and delighted that Senator Merkley included that in in this in this bill the last thing I'll say we sent us intend to see a lot of things to the eyes of our own state then that and in our stay we have a little company called DuPont they've been around for a long time and they've just gotten very much into the business of biofuels they think it should be possible for us to fuel ourselves and feed ourselves and wasn't that long ago that you'd raise an acre corny maybe get 75 bushels the corn off an acre before long we'll be up to 200 250 pushes a coin for acre and I've never been a big advocate of corn ethanol as in as an option to fuel our vehicles but the idea of using the the stock of the corner the ears of the corn the leaves of the coin creates cellulosic ethanol cellulosic ethanol it actually has better energy density travels batter in pipelines mix is better with gasoline there's all kinds of biofuel I work that's going on we need to do more of that and some of it is really exciting better energy density fewer environmental consequences and again the legislation that he's proposed Moses in that direction so think about it more energy efficient vehicles that's great number to help people get out of their cars trucks and vans and take other modes of transportation that makes sense and I kind of linked together in a smart way and number three for those of us are still going to be needing fuel to fuel our vehicles we can't harvest the wind maybe just yet off of rehoboth beach delaware will be able to to grow our way out of this with with fuels they're a lot smarter than corn ethanol that's the way we want to go and in direction we need to go this man is ladies I'm proud to be in this parade with and thank you thank you very much Tom and now we have michael breen who is the vice president of the Truman National Security Project former army captain and we talk about very many dimensions of our diction oil we certainly talked about the impact of carbon pollution we talked about the difference between sending our dollars overseas or creating jobs here at home but we don't talk enough about the national security implications of being dependent on oil from many parts of the world that do not share our values and so thank you for coming to help us address that part of this puzzle today Thank You senator the Truman National Security Project and the veterans of operation free are proud to stand with Senator Merkley senator Carper senator Bennet and Senator Udall in this critical fight for American energy independence and independence from oil the veterans of operation free have seen firsthand on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan that our dependence on oil fuels national security threats and makes us less safe we've defended oil convoys and insurgent infested territory we've dodged improvised explosive devices purchased with Iranian oil dollars and we fought terrorist organizations that get their weapons from oil money as these senators have said we send about a billion dollars a day overseas to pay for our oil unfortunately too much of that money winds up in the hands of extremists and countries who don't share our values it's time to break that cycle these senators are leading to break that cycle so we're proud to stand with them self-sufficiency technological innovation and skilled labor our core American values these leaders have placed their faith in those values we place we're very proud to place our faith in them so we thank them for standing with us we're proud to stand with them to secure America with clean energy and break our addiction to oil and keep us safe here at home thank you very much Thank You senator okay well with that will open this up to see if folks have any questions and i'll refer all the tough questions to Senator Carper and Senator Bennet oh no they're not here okay well I'll try to cover any questions yes well we anticipate right now that this will probably be in the Energy Committee senator Bingaman the energy committee is working right now on the electric vehicles bill which that particular bill is a portion of this bill and that has bipartisan support it is a tremendous to have a member of the Republican leadership on board and and we are we are working to try to figure out how to get that piece back to the floor there are other components that will come up in the context of the Surface Transportation Act and there are yet other components that will come up in the context of the Banking Committee because the banking has a responsibility for for transit and so there will be two be a kind of collaborative effort on a vision as large as this that is ending our dependence on foreign oil between a number of committees here in the Senate yes when we introduced this bill last year was anticipated that it would be considered in the context of the overall energy bill that was being led by Senator Kerry to use market forces to cap carbon pollution and this would be a component that that bill didn't end up making it to the floor and becoming a potential vehicle and so this time we anticipate that more this the elements of this this bill some of them may be tackled individually such as the electrical vehicle deployment bill where senator Carper spoke to the clean tea a portion of this it emphasizes transit and would most likely be in the the banking side of Banking Committee and but so we'll be taking the components together merge it individually merging them together as the committee process allows us yes I think there was there was so much argument over energy in the context of a comprehensive if you will carbon strategy but this breaks down the puzzle into pieces that Americans can wrap their hands around first they understand inherently that dependence upon oil from the Middle East is a problem it's why president after president has spoken to that addiction in that vulnerability they understand inherently that if we spend a billion dollars a day overseas that's creating jobs overseas not creating jobs here in the United States of America and during this recession what could be more powerful than keeping those energy dollars at at home so I think that these themes bring citizens together with kind of a common sense understanding and it brings hopefully it'll bring members of the Senate together across the political aisle yeah what I anticipate is that we will have to find pay-fors to be able to fund the bill senator Alexander and I have committed ourselves to find a pave for for the electric vehicle portion and I think any other piece that is able to proceed is going to have to be part of a structure that involves fiscal responsibility anyone else well I want to thank my colleagues thank you very much michael breen for coming today and thank you all of you for covering this issue that's so important to our national security to our stewardship of the environment and creating jobs right here in the United States of America thank you

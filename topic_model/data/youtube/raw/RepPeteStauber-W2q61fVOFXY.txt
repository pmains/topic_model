Thank You chairman young for yielding today to me Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in opposition to this Democratic messaging bill HR 11 46 a harmful attempt to undermine responsible energy development throughout the history of our country we have observed a pattern of politicians in Washington and the east and west coast legislating based on what they think is best for the folks in the rest of the country as we've listened to debate today we can clearly see that this Washingtonian habit is alive and well for my good friends on the other side of this issue they think they know better than the Alaska Natives living with in Anwar they think you know better than those who would benefit from the job growth they think they know better than our unions they think you know better than the people closest to the project I urge my colleagues to take a step back and look at the unsettling trend that is occurring throughout this country of outsiders with a tenuous grip on the truth imposing their will on the people really impacted by these local projects for instance in my home state of Minnesota the same thing is happening with the replacement of line three people from the Twin Cities who are unpacked by this project are launching efforts right here in this chamber to stop the replacement and stop the job growth and economic development that would accompany it instead of putting our laborers Operating Engineers Teamsters and construction workers to work they support legislation that are undermining these jobs these projects are meant to develop our natural resources to ensure our energy independence and yes mr. speaker to ensure our energy independence and not redo and not have our reliance on foreign and hostile nations to this country we responsibly develop our energy with the strongest environmental standards and labor standards in the world Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill let's listen to those affected directly by these projects and do what's right thank you

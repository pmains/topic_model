chairman before I get into my questions can I refer can we go back to your opening statement on this I anticipate you will no and and go you had a line in there that said that this caused security issues for the for the for the IRS do you mind I am repeating the words of the IRS as they have instructed us would you mind you might find it as you want to proceed then I will find it here and we'll go back and do it again okay yeah thank you because I again if they're if there's security concerns with an agency I certainly think that we we as members of Congress in our oversight capacity should should dig down into that and understand that especially for an agency that has been one of the largest purchaser or firearms and ammunition um if if they're concerned about their security and safety and having to purchase that much weaponry and we got 87 000 new agents coming on this thing just deserves some attention but I want to go back to something and reiterate a point that my colleague Mr smucker touched on and that is the fact that the the customer service and the the advocacy for for the taxpayer at the IRS it's just almost non-existent at this point you've talked about hiring 87 000 additional agents okay which is you know I hear about this from my constituents back home all the time they are they are they know what's fixing to happen they are they are about to be that they feel that the weight of the federal government coming down on them for for for no reason but why aren't we focusing on doing the things on getting the bank returns taken care of why aren't we focusing on on making sure um that that the IRS employees are fully back in in the office working why aren't we making sure that we're doing things on behalf of the American people instead of doing things to the American people so you know this I I agree with Mr rice as well this is not a political stunt this is legitimate oversight that this that this committee should be doing to understand why 30 million documents just destroyed okay without asking the question I mean if there's if they're good reasons hey let's let's talk about that but shouldn't we ask that question and shouldn't the IRS shouldn't we be able to dig down more deeply into that I I think this is I think I would encourage everyone to support this and Mr chairman if you're ready to shoot that and when the gentleman relinquishes his time okay okay uh with that I will can I I will reserve the balance of my time thank you gentlemen so in a memo that was an email that was sent to the Republican staff director on this issue let me read verbatim in response to your request I'm advised the document includes information on what data is transcribed or not transcribed timing of case selection as well as what data can be matched or not matched access to this information allows taxpayers to potentially avoid our systemic abilities to identify non-compliance in essence wholly jeopardizing voluntary compliance you could even allow information that would evade detection the IRS is not releasing the document as the release of this document represents a significant risk to the agency I want to include this into the record so the the risk to the agency did they Define what that risk was or what the consequences of any damage would be to the agency they did not to my knowledge inform us of precisely what that was well in that case I'm going to go back and I think I had two minutes and 18 seconds left I want to I want to go back and say this is exactly why we need to be you want to reclaim your time I reclaim my time please um this is exactly why we should be looking into this is they said it would create a risk to the agency if they haven't defined what that risk is we need to know about that so again this seems pretty basic to me let's go you know let's find out exactly what's happened so we can understand this risk thank you if the measure fails my suggestion would be that the staff directors on both sides simply have the IRS in for a private conversation and then inform members or members should be able to participate if they would like yes and I think members should participate in that Mr chairman thank you thank you are there other members who would like to strike the last word I believe the general

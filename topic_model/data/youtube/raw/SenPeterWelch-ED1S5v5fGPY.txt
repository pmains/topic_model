Shaden of improving services to our veterans and your contribution I know on behalf of my colleague we thank you for your input to the VA committee today with not any other further comment I yield three minutes to the gentleman from Vermont well I thank you very much mr. chairman and I really admire the work you and the entire committee is doing on this you know Vermont is a small state but our Vermont National Guard has absolutely always answered the call to serve we had the highest casualty rate of among the northern states in the Civil War and then in Iraq and Afghanistan we had the highest per capita casualty rate of any state in the nation we are extremely proud of our National Guard but as you know many members of the military who were exposed to burn pits are beginning to experience very negative health effects from the toxic smoke they inhaled and my goal here is to plead with this committee and I know you take the concerns of veterans more seriously than anyone else in Congress that this committee take the lead in addressing the issue of burn pit exposure aggressively and quickly to help those who are suffering and for whom suffering awaits them burn pits as you know were commonly used on u.s. military sites during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to burn all types of waste from chemicals paint medical and human waste to munitions petroleum plastics and rubber on May 7th I met with a group of Vermont National Guard members led by Pat cram the widow of a service member who died Michael cram sergeant major Michael cram of the Vermont National Guard he died in to sit this past December from prostate cancer believed to be a direct result of his exposure to burn pit burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan sergeant cramp sergeant major cram first deployed to Iraq in 2004 with a group of MPs from the 42nd Infantry Division of the Vermont National Guard and they joined up with 278 Tennessee National Guard Calvary in Iraq all 21 soldiers from that group deployed together for 18 months returned home with their families safely or so they thought but since their safe return this group of 21 soldiers has lost two members from prostate cancer and another has been treated for it they believe their exposure to burn pit toxins is the reason the group is closed they stay in touch their family support each other and I was inspired to hear about how they've stuck together throughout these years but those members that have not had the direct health issues that some of their comrades have faced are now wondering how they'll do and will they get sick we must prevent that from happening we should avoid another situation like Agent Orange where veterans were waiting decades for Congress to act Congress must commit to funding concluding the to conduct the research necessary to understand the consequences of toxic burn pit exposure many members are doing excellent work congressmen women SD Gabbard winstram and Ruiz and I support all of their efforts however I ask that we expedite our commitment to getting more research to codify a presumption of service-connected disability to burn pit exposure so that veterans can more easily get compensated and get the care that they need and deserve and I thank the committee for inviting me to testify and look forward to continuing to work with you on this thank you thank you mr. Welch and thanks for focusing on this important issue and again we appreciate your input but but mostly just your love and commitment to the veterans of Vermont and beyond something we all share absolutely one of the last bastions as we say of bipartisanship so great god bless and thanks again for your input - thank you well now reset

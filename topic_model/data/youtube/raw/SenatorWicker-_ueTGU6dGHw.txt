delighted to have mr. Lee Smith's and he possesses a wealth of experience and expertise in hurricane preparedness disaster response and community resilience efforts he has served more than three decades of public service in the US Army the Mississippi National Guard and particularly as Mississippi's National Guard director of military support during his time in the National Guard mr. Smithson supported operations for hurricanes Isadora Lily Katrina Gustav Ike and Isaac so he knows what he's talking about when it comes to hurricane response in addition to our recovery efforts for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill he is currently executive director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency as director of me mom mr. Smithson coordinates all activities within our local communities to save lives protect property and reduce suffering for those citizens impacted by disasters so we're delighted that he's here and that he'll be part of the expertise for our second panel and I appreciate you indulging me on that because as the chair knows we are back and forth between two hearings at the present time now let me let me just follow up Admiral on icebreakers I'm learning there there are icebreakers and then there are icebreakers you know the the there's there's sort of a notion going around that that some of our allies can build a pretty good icebreaker for 200 million dollars and why aren't we doing that I think you were explaining to me earlier in a private conversation that the kind of icebreaker that we've authorized in in the NDAA is far more complicated than that and and gives us a lot more capability so if you would tell us what this almost billion-dollar ice breakers capable of doing and how many of those we need and how many of these less capable vessels we need Thank You senator so I was in again in Finland and they're one of the offerors if you will for four ice breakers I'm of the mind that our US shipyards can build this and we can build this with the US Steel and with the US prime movers as well so yeah I would consider this as a an investment in our military industrial complex in our in our shipyards and we have five u.s. shipyards that have now weighed in to compete to build the first heavy icebreaker but they will look at other commercial designs rather that's a heavy icebreaker right well what capabilities is a give us it gives you the ability to break ice up to 21 feet thick and you might say well does that ever happen last year the PolarStar broke through over 80 miles of ice 14 feet thick a medium ice breaker would never even make two or three miles of headway in those icing conditions so we're still seeing heavy icing and this was to be able to sustain our mission in Antarctica in the US if there's an area where the United States leads it is in the mission in Antarctica we have a significant vote but we're seeing China in particular stepping up its presence in Antarctica with less than transparent initiatives going forward of why so much China moving to and you know what could these less expensive Finnish icebreakers not do for us that this heavy icebreaker will be able to do so when we look at our icebreakers they do more that you they help on the Great Lakes are they they wouldn't fit through the souvlaki know they need lighter tugs on the great length oh you're limited by the Soo Locks and the width of a ship you've got at least three kinds we're talking about now we're talking right now is the heavy icebreaker we have me talking about all three sir okay let me take take it from the top but yeah the most critical one is our heavy icebreaker the PolarStar she's gonna leave in a few weeks for Antarctica if she is beset in ice the United States has no way to recover that show there's nothing in our inventory that can break it loose we would probably have to ask Russia can you break us out of the ice please I don't want to be put in that position I don't think our nation wants to find ourselves in that vulnerable situation we have no self rescue capability our other icebreakers we have self rescue capability but operating in heavy ice we have one we are a one-trick pony and that is it an icebreaker does more than break ice it gathers information it is it can do law enforcement if necessary and exert sovereign presence the ice breakers and the Baltic do one thing only and that's to open up a shipping channel to resupply the ports in the Baltic a medium icebreaker less capable it can break ice up to eight feet thick it supports a scientific mission a lot of the work the Healey did this year it was a classified program but working for the Office of Naval Research so these are multi mission platforms that can operate in a nice environment okay well let's say you and the experts in your field decide we need X number of heavy icebreakers and we need Y number of smaller less expensive icebreakers we can certainly build those at our American shipyards can we not we can't okay but we don't have plans to do so at this point we do so there's a hundred fifty million dollars in the 2017 appropriation we have five shipyards doing industry studies we'll put a request for perform what type of icebreaker a heavy icebreaker no I'm asking about plans for the smaller icebreakers we won't look at the smaller ones I'm talking to the great lake icebreakers we're or over a decade in the in the Arctic our plans are to have one kind of icebreaker and one only is that what you're saying a heavy icebreaker and we got plans to make one we have a high latitude study it was commissioned over five years ago that said we need six icebreakers three heavy three medium okay we could build those three mediums in the United States couldn't we absolutely but we don't have plans to do so do we we do okay and what are those plans well we need to build our first heavy first you know I am scraping money but what are those plans though even if their long-range build the first heavy icebreaker in the water by 2023 do a block by to buy two more there's a National Academy of Science in and then and only then we would look at buying the medium ice breakers so we really don't have plans to buy three smaller less expensive ice breakers do we let's make sure we're talking heavy medium and then we have great we have three different iceberg okay well let's not talk about great lakes right now okay so I think I'm asking mr. chairman about whether we have any plans to build beyond the three heavy ice breakers that you've talked about do we have any plans to use our American shipyards to build medium icebreakers we do or is that just an ocean demo okay what are those specific plans I asked could you three heavy and three medium icebreakers and we've been in a 10 a decade-long battle to get a 150 million dollars that doesn't even build one icebreaker so I can't tell you when I'm gonna get the funding to build out this fleet but we need a fleet of six icebreakers I need an appropriation to do that if I have a floor of two billion dollars in my acquisition budget I can move on with this but I don't have the money okay well we won't we want to be teammates with you on this and and I think we're just mr. Chairman I think we're just scratching the surface this morning we'll get into this more in and at the specific hearing but I've got associate the chair and the ranking member bringing this to to the attention of the public and the Coast Guard well I think this

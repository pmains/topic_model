for the opportunity to present the views of the Department of the Interior on HR 24 31 include Hinchcliffe Stadium within the boundaries of Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park the department would support HR 24 30 and it the inclusion of this historic Stadium within the park boundary would facilitate the National Park Service's role in preserving and interpreting a nationally significant cultural resource associated with the history of African American achievement and racial integration by including the stadium within the park boundary the bill would bring this iconic property under the provisions of the parks enabling act that would authorize the National Park Service to enter into cooperative agreements with the owner to identify interpret restore and provide technical assistance for preservation the bill would also enable the National Park Service to accept the donation of the property Hinchcliffe's stadium is a 10,000 see art deco structure that was built as a public works project between nineteen 31 and 32 it served as a venue for professional and amateur baseball automobile and motorcycle racing entertainment in school athletic competitions in March 2013 four years after congress authorized the Patterson Great Falls National Historical Park Hinchcliffe stadium was designated a national historic landmark the stadium's national significance is tied to its history as a Negro League Baseball venue between nineteen thirty-two and 1944 serving as the home field for the New York black Yankees the New York Cubans the Newark Eagles and others as cited in the national historic landmark study Hinchcliffe also drives at significance from its integral role in the social history of the city many of Patterson's silk and other mill workers form teams played in the stadium making it an important part of the fabric of community life in industrial Patterson during the Great Depression and in decades beyond Hinchcliffe stadium is owned by the Patterson public school district in May 2013 the school board voted unanimously to support legislation that would includes a stadium within the boundary of the park with the proviso that the school district not relinquish control of the stadium or require National Park Service acquisition of the property or permit the National Park Service to acquire or manage the stadium without the express support of the school district the school board and the National Park Service are in agreement about the desirability of maintaining ownership of the stadium by the Patterson public school district we believe that the role of the National Park Service with respect to the stadium should be limited to providing interpretation education and technical preservation assistance for that reason the department would support HR 24 31 bended to prohibit the National Park Service from acquiring ownership of the stadium we would be pleased to provide the committee with the recommended language finally I wanted to let the committee know that the department will be submitting statements for the record 42 of the other bills on today's agenda one statement is for HR 1839 the Hermosa creek watershed protection act and the other is for HR 414 the fort wainwright military reservation conveyance these bills are not under the purview of the National Park Service mr. chairman that concludes my statement I would be happy to answer any questions you may have it's too

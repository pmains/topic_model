TUESDAY TO MARKUP THE ELECTORAL COUNT. A KEY PROCEDURAL STEP TO PASSAGE, THE BIPARTISAN BILL TO CEASE TO TRUMP PROOF CERTAIN -- IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. HERE TO TELL US MORE AS SENATOR ALEX PADILLA, DEMOCRAT FROM CALIFORNIA. SENATOR PADILLA, THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO THE SUNDAY SHOW. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON SET HERE IN LOS ANGELES. >> ABSOLUTELY, WELCOME TO MY NECK OF THE WOODS. >> YES, YES, FOR ONCE. >> BACK WITH YOU. >> THANK YOU. SENATOR, YOU ARE ON THE RULES COMMITTEE, THERE IS THIS PROCEDURAL VOTE THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. ONE, WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT THAT THIS GETS DONE? >> HERE IS THE CRITICAL, AND LET ME REMIND FOLKS THAT IN ADDITION TO BEING A SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA, I SERVED AS CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE BEFORE JOINING THE SENATE, OVERSEEING ELECTIONS, THE MOST POPULOUS AND DIVERSE STATE OF AMERICA. EVERYTHING FROM BALLOT DESIGNED TO VOTE BY MAIL TO CERTIFICATION OF ELECTIONS, AND OF COURSE, ELECTORAL ACCOUNT ACT WHICH KICKS HIM EVERY FOUR YEARS, IT WAS ABUSED, EXPLOITED, MISINTERPRETED, AS PART OF JANUARY 6TH WHEN TRUMP INVITED, INCITED A DEADLY INSURRECTION AT THE NATION'S CAPITAL. IT WAS THE ELECTORAL COUNT ACT THAT THEY WERE ABUSING. SO, WE'LL BE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE SENATE THIS WEEK, TIGHTENING UP THAT LANGUAGE TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS LIKE BETTER PROTECTING AGAINST ROGUE GOVERNORS, LEGISLATORS, THAT MAY WANT TO LOOK AT ELECTION RESULTS AND SAY, NEVER MIND, WE'RE GONNA SET A DIFFERENT SET OF ELECTORS AS PART OF WHO SHOULD BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. MAKING IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THE POWERS OF THE VICE PRESIDENT ARE AND ARE NOT WHEN IT COMES TO ACCEPTING THOSE ELECTORAL VOTES IN CONGRESS EVERY FOUR YEARS. THE CHANCE, THE THREATS AGAINST MIKE PENCE, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE PERCEIVED AMBIGUITY ANGELA, I THINK IF WE CAN TIGHTEN UP THAT LANGUAGE, WE NEED TO DO IT NOW, EVEN THOUGH THE NOVEMBER MIDTERMS ARE UPON US, WE KNOW THAT'S REALLY THE KICKSTART OF THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CYCLE. IT'S THAT THE RULES CLEAR WELL INTO 2024. >> RIGHT, THIS IS ALL ABOUT GETTING THINGS IN PLACE FOR 2024. HOWEVER, THERE IS THE SENATE BILL THAT YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO DISCUSS, THERE'S ALSO A HOUSE BILL. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT. WILL THE TWO CHAMBERS BE ABLE TO RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCES AND ACTUALLY GET A BILL THAT CAN PASS BOTH CHAMBERS AND GET TO THE PRESIDENTS DESK FOR SIGNATURE? I FIRMLY BELIEVE SO, THERE IS BOTH BIPARTISAN AND BUY -- SUPPORT FOR THE NEED TO GET THIS DONE AND DO IT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE BILL, TRY TO KEEP THE SAME ROLE, RIGHT NOW, WHETHER THE SENATE ACTS ON THE HOUSE BILL, THE HOUSE ACTS ON THE SENATE, BILL DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET THEIR, BUT I THINK THERE IS BUILDING THIS MOMENTUM TO MAKING SURE WE GET THIS TIME. >> IS THERE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO DO THIS? >> ABSOLUTELY. >> ARE THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE ON BOARD WITH THE ELECTORAL. >> THERE IS ALREADY TEN, MAYBE 11 REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR NAME PUBLICLY TO THE SENATE PROPOSAL OF ELECTORAL -- WILL START HUSHING IN THE RULES COMMITTEE THIS WEEK. MORE LIKE I SAID, WERE PROTECTION AGAINST ROGUE LECTURERS, OR ROGUE GOVERNORS THAT ARE TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES. MAKING IT CLEAR WITH THE VICE PRESIDENTS POWERS ARE AND ARE NOT. AND THEN MOST IMPORTANTLY, ONE BIG PIECE OF DOING EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO TO AVOID A ANOTHER JANUARY 6TH AFTER FUTURE ELECTIONS. THEN WE GO BACK TO WORK, BY THE WAY, SHOULD NOT LEAVE THIS AS THE CONVERSATION, TO DO WORK THAT WE STARTED PROTECTING THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO -- ACCESS TO THE BALLOT. IF THERE'S ONE CONCERNED IT WAS THAT IT WAS THE SPECIFIC ELECTORAL COUNT ACT, BUT IT DOES NOT ENCOMPASS THE NEED TO PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS IN AMERICA? THAT WORK WILL CONTINUE. THE ELECTORAL COUNT ACT PREVENTS FUTURE INSURRECTIONS OR JANUARY 6TH TYPE OF EVENTS? ABSOLUTELY. >> IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY, SO THERE'S TEN REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE WHO ARE ON BOARD, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE YOU NEED TEND OVERCOME A FILIBUSTER. THE ACTION WILL MOVE IN THE SENATE, I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS AND TALK ABOUT THE BIG NEARS RACE HERE IN LOS ANGELES. WE'RE GONNA PUT UP THE LATEST POLL THAT SHOWS OUR GUESTS IN THE FIRST HOUR OF THE SUNDAY SHOW, CONGRESSWOMAN KAREN BASS IS LEADING HER REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER, RICK CARUSO, IF MY MATH IS RIGHT THERE, BY 12 PERCENTAGE POINTS. BUT I WANTED TO GET YOUR REACTION, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND. TO THIS MAYOR'S RACE. WHY EVERYONE WHO SOMEONE THOUGHT WAS GONNA BE A FORMIDABLE CANDIDATE, A BILLIONAIRE LAKE RICK, ACCORDING TO THESE POLL NUMBERS, ISN'T GAINING ANY TRACTION? >> WELL, SUBSTANCE MATTERS, RIGHT? NOT JUST IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF VERY WEALTHY CANDIDATES, BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, SEEKING OFFICE, YOU CANNOT BUY OR WIRE AND. VOTERS ARE SMART ABOUT THIS. I THINK WHAT KAREN BASS HAS GOING FOR IS NOT JUST THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY, ALL PARTS OF THE CITY AND BEYOND, BUT A TRACK RECORD. SHE SERVED AS SPEAKER AS THE ASSEMBLY IN THE DARKEST DAYS OF THE GREAT RECESSION. I SAW HER MASTERY OF NAVIGATING POLITICS AND BUDGETS TO SURVIVE ECONOMIC DOWNFALLS WHILE MAINTAINING A SOCIAL SAFETY NET, TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP, I'VE SEEN HER IN CONGRESS BEING A TREMENDOUS VOICE FOR VOTING RIGHTS, FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, FOUR -- AND THEY KNOW THAT HOUSING IS A BIG ISSUE HERE LOCALLY IN LOS ANGELES, AS IT IS A LOT OF CITIES ACROSS AMERICA. I THINK SHE -- THE EXPERIENCE AND THE DEMEANOR TO PULL PEOPLE TOGETHER TO GET THE HARD WORK DONE. >> SENATOR ALEX PADILLA, OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING BACK TO THE SUNDAY SHOW. FOR COMING ON SET. >> ALL RIGHT, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. >> ALL, RIGHT COMING UP, FORECASTERS ARE KEEPING A VERY CLOSE EYE

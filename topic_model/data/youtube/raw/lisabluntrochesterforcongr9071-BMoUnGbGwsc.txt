hello Delaware welcome to another edition of we all go to Washington I'm your host congresswoman Lisa Blount Rochester Delaware's at-large member in the US Congress last month I was joined by civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis for a discussion on the importance of voting and between now and Election Day you can catch me here on channel 28 on the fourth Sunday of every month at 9 p.m. and on YouTube in this episode I'll be joined by an incredible panel of guests for a conversation about how you can get involved in elections at the federal state and local levels of government before I introduce my guests I want to take a moment to highlight a few of the legislative initiatives I'm working on in Congress just this week I introduced a first-of-its-kind criminal justice reform bill called clean slate which provides reformed federal nonviolent offenders the opportunity for a second chance in life my bill would automatically seal their records so that a minor drug offense is not a hurdle to getting a job buying a home or going to college this bipartisan legislation passed and was signed into law in Pennsylvania a few weeks ago and now we are working on it at the federal level on our last show we talked briefly about how to transform a moment into a movement and that's why I'm also pleased to introduce the empower act which will build on the work of the hashtag me to movement by cracking down on sexual harassment in the workplace we've got an exciting show for you and a lot of ground to cover so stay tuned until the end of the program for an important update on voting deadlines I'm Lisa blunt Rochester and I'm running for re-election for Congress here in Delaware and we hope that you will continue to be on this journey with us because there's still so much more work to be done welcome back joining me is Meghan Wallace the co-founder of Mary Ann's list muthoni wa Moo crawl the vice president of national outreach and training for Emily's list and Eric SRAM the Delaware Democratic party chair they're here today to tell you about their organizations and how you can get involved so when I first threw my hat into the ring to run for Congress I really didn't have an idea of the different resources that were available to me or even how to hire campaign folks so this is why I really wanted this section to be a part of the show because people really don't know you know how what are the jobs and how to get involved or what are the resources that are available to them so we've got a great panel and I'm gonna jump right into the questions all right okay so inquiring minds want to know what made each of you get into politics in the first place so we'll start we'll start with you Megan so I think for as you said politics can be intimidating so I think for a lot of women we come to the work through something personal so the person was political that kind of feminist mantra so personally I got involved because I was an advocate for domestic violence and survivors of sexual assault so that's really where I found my passion for politics doing the legislative work around those issues really did you come in as legislative aide or have yeah I served as a volunteer yep so I friend from college who I had worked on some student advocacy work within those areas had invited me to apply for a job as a legislative aide and so I kind of took the chance and did so and that's where I got my foot in the door excellent excellent and how about you Eric I actually did a year of AmeriCorps VISTA and after my first year I really found it interesting kind of working at the grassroots level serving folks that didn't have the best opportunities in life so moved to Delaware did a second year of AmeriCorps VISTA and and met a lot of politicians - my first time and join my first campaign and realized that you know why I went to school to be a teacher that kind of the organizational side of campaign management getting a message out and really helping people so I I don't want a campaign work in politics that way excellent excellent in Lithonia well I would say it has something probably to do with the subtle fact that I could hold protest signs oh I think you may be familiar yes sort of parental osmosis yeah but I'm the daughter of two really active educators who believe that to whom much is given much also is required and you know I I actually got involved though in the way that I'm involved in my organization Emily's list because understanding and I know we're gonna go right into these resources about how many people really don't know the resources that are involved just to win one little congressional seat and I know it's not little but really when you think about how many seats there are in this country and amount of resources it takes to win those it's incredible and so my first job in politics really taught me how many people had a political education gap around campaigns and how they work you know it's interesting as I sit here and listen to each of you I've I've been with these folks for years now and have watched their dedication and passion for multiple issues and for multiple candidates and so this is really special to actually have this conversation because we're talking about on a local level and also on a national level and I really wanted to share with folks you know a little bit about what your organization's do I mean first of all Mary Ann's list is new emily's list has been around but a lot of people don't even realize that emily is not even a person it's you can tell them what it stands for and then our Democratic Party a lot of folks don't know how they can get involved in what the party is there for as well so let's start off with muthoni talking about Emily's list and then we'll go to Mary Ann's list and in the party well look I think we were never more aware of the fact that there were a lot of folks who after the 2016 election wanted to figure out how to get more engaged politically and that we needed to do more to make ourselves a lot more visible in to up the resources frankly that we were able to provide to women across this country we are now at over 40,000 women who have reached out to Emily saying I may be interested in running for office but they're also saying I'm not sure like I want to do something I know I want to do something help me figure out what that is and another 8,000 who have said well I know that I absolutely want to help a woman run so with that we have built out a ton of resources that I won't go into right now but go to Emily's lethargy join our run to win list and there's so much to be gained by that including joining our Facebook community of over 5,000 women well a lot of people don't know that Emily stands for early money is like yeast makes the dough rise and it's one of those things that we need to be able to compete is to be able to have those resources and so I'm gonna turn it to you Megan to talk a little bit about Mary Ann's list and where that came from sure so Mary Ann's list is an organization much like Emily's us where we work to elect approach always democratic women and we actually started kind of out of a debate among some of my colleagues and I around how we really needed a woman to run for an open congressional seat in Delaware and at the time we had heard that Emily's list was in our state trying to find women to run for that seat and this was before Lisa's name was out there and we were really frustrated with the idea that we had had two men kind of throw their hat in the ring at that point and just frustrated the idea that how is it possible and across our state that there's no women leaders that could step in and run here and of course emily's list came in and and helps recruit Lisa yeah I mean here we are yes but we know that there's a pipeline of candidates that need to be ready to fill seats like that so we really see a place for a local organization to kind of step in there and just share who Mary Ann told about the Mary Ann yes so we're named after to Mary Ann's Mary Ann shad Carrie from Wilmington and Mary Ann's sordin Stuart from Sussex County and these two women were suffragettes they both died before they ever saw women have the right to vote and we wanted a north and a south northern and a southern woman and and also Marion Chad Carey's are very prominent african-american woman and so we really felt like they embodied kind of the values of our organization and so those two Mary Anne's are who we've named ourselves for excellent excellent and now I'm going to turn it over to Eric to talk about the Delaware Democratic Party and share with with folks who we are what resources are provided well I've definitely changed in terms of since I became chair it's just making it more open transparent diversity making sure we have a depth of candidates that really show all walks of life in Delaware you know we provide all sorts of resources from campaign trainings to the voter file but I think you know most importantly we have to do a better job and we're starting to get there in terms of putting out our democratic message like what really lights people on fire what makes people want to come to the party and get involved and really reminding people that it is their party it's it's not a go to a boy party it's not a party with the back room where people decide and really tried to change that kind of perception of our party say that again WW lds.org excellent we really do have limited time but I did want to ask one last question and it really is about 2018 and what is at stake why do people need to vote why do people need to be engaged and in in a few seconds if you could each just give what you think are the reasons that this is an important important election these midterms I'll start with you mate so first of all I think everything's at stake so I think that everything especially at the local level at the state legislative level we have all kinds of policy decisions made from criminal justice reform to education you name it and so we really need to have women at the table helping make policy decisions about our own lives excellent excellent and I would just say look we're at a point where we're deciding what kind of country we want to be and we need everybody's voice as we make this critical decision going forward excellent and Eric they mean anything that pops in Devine is the Supreme Court but back to the local level we need to make sure we have you know quality Democrats elected at all levels to really protect well I want to thank my guests for joining me and I want to encourage each of you to get involved whether it's through emily's list or Mary Ann's list the Democratic Party and there are a whole host of other organizations as well but you have a place at the table and we want you to join thanks to so many of you we made history in 2016 I became Delaware's first woman and first person of color to represent us in Congress it was an incredible evening and I remember a lot of people asking me what does it feel like to make history I really didn't think about it we were just doing the work but then on the day that I was sworn in that I stood on that House floor and raised my hand to take the oath I carried with me a scarf that my sister created that was an oath that allowed our great-great great-grandfather to have the right to vote and at that moment it really hit me that we are here because we're standing on the shoulders of those who came before us I've spent my entire career working to ensure that all delawarians had the opportunities they deserve and that didn't stop when I went to Congress lisa has been working hard to help the businesses up and down the state find the capital they need to help them succeed in Delaware she believes in engaging people of all ages and all backgrounds in the democratic process and she's working to ensure all voices are heard she listens to you people's today and empowers them to be leaders of tomorrow she understands that in order to be successful we need a safe learning environment she recognizes that the keys to enriching our children's futures and unleashing their innovative and creative spirit are a quality education and the arts she believes that love is love and that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity has no place in our society she knows that if we're going to leave the world a better place for our daughters we have much more work to do to ensure that they have equal opportunity so that they can reach their full potential I'm running for re-election because there is still more work to be done more for us to accomplish to truly leave our mark on history this year every voice must be heard so I'm asking for your vote and your participation in our journey to reelection and remember when Lisa goes to Washington we all go we all go we all go we all go we all go I'm Lisa blunt Rochester and I approve this message tonight we have a very special guest a dear friend and a colleague of mine representing New Mexico's 3rd congressional district he's a proud native son of his home state and he's also chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee known to many as the d-triple-c we're joined here by congressman Ben ray Lujan of New Mexico congressman thank you so much for joining us and say hi to Delaware well it's always an honor to be with you representative you know the leadership that Lisa brings to the Congress to the American people we just have learned to appreciate her so very much we count on her and we believe in her I know as so many of you do as well but hello Delaware it's an honor to be with all of you my name is Ben ray Lujan as I was introduced by Lisa from the great state of New Mexico from a small little town about 20 miles north of our capital city of Santa Fe and I grew up on a small little farm out there fourth-generation where I today nowbut grew up attending to that little farm and doing everything from getting up early in the morning and the winter making sure those stock tanks were of cracked open so that the animals could get to that important drink of water during the day but all the hard work that comes with it so always an honor to be here but especially to say hello to all of our friends and all of the supporters and voters and constituents that Lisa Rochester represents and fights for day in and day out I'm so pleased to have you here and for those of you who don't know memory he you know sometimes people talk in Washington a lot about shining stars and rising stars and all of that he is a true star and he is truly a person who believes in our democratic ideals he is a person who believes in supporting candidates and making sure that we actually get to 218 in 2018 and so what I wanted to have you share a little bit about is just tell people how you got involved in politics in public service because part of this show is focused on making sure that people who are interested in running know about running people who are interested in working on campaigns know about campaigns but most importantly that everybody play their part and get involved and vote so if you could just share a little bit about your background in terms of you know getting involved engaged in public service and and then we'll talk a little bit about what's at stake for the voters this year well Lisa I was really influenced and inspired by my parents my mother who retired after 33 years from the local public school district a little school by the name of pocket don't try and spell it but you can come visit okay mom so you come on out and it's a great little community and my father he was an ironworker my father learned how to weld out in the shipyards of San Pedro California came back to New Mexico where he was able to marry his high school sweetheart my mom Carmen I worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory working to build the facilities up there as well and while my father was up there he you know he would talk to his brothers and sisters in labor and talk about one challenge or another going blind in the community and they would tell him Ben so I shared my father's name man you know we're tired of you talking about this why don't you do something about it yeah and so my father said well I'll do it then but I'm gonna need your help and so he ran for county commissioner and the small community that we live in and worked hard knocked on some doors pounding the pavement and didn't win Wow so his friends and family they realized how serious he was about this and he kept working two years later he ran for that same seat because he believed that public service was a way to make a difference in people's lives and you could you could advocate for those that didn't have a voice and be that strong voice and he won I served on the County Commission soon found himself elected by his colleagues as the chair of that Commission and my father was a blue-collar guy he grew up weld and getting those hands dirty getting up early in the morning sometimes when he'd get up for his shift and he tried to fire up that old Chevy he had it starts sometimes it would have it wouldn't keep him from getting to work he'd walk up the road yeah when that truck didn't start and I'll be darned if you know someone he worked with didn't pick him up get him to work and bring him back at the end of the day and then we'd get together we tried to fix edalji get it fired over the next day but so my father served in the County Commission and then soon found himself serving in the State House the state legislature he served as a whip he served as leader and served as Speaker of the House and state of New Mexico and all along it was his partnership with my mom the importance of getting involved staying involved compassion fighting speaking up that really influenced me now I was the youngest of four okay by eight years and so you know I say that I'm was the accident that kept my mom and dad young okay and so my siblings they didn't want me around he's too young we don't have to babysit him I never appreciated the education of being present and learning because I'd always be with mom and dad at campaign events at rallies in hearings in different meetings sitting in the governor's office visiting with advocates whatever it may be I was there at my father's and my mother's feet listening and learning and it was that appreciation that really inspired me and got me involved Lisa I saw my father he'd make a difference every day he had an open-door policy and even while he was serving as Speaker of the House if people come visit him and mom or us on the weekend knock on that door you pour him a cup of coffee wait welcomed him in yeah and hear them out yeah try to make a difference and so it really was watching you know people that I was fortunate to be raised by that instilled in me the importance of that hard work and getting things done you know that we really we have that in common my my father actually served in public service as well both in the education system but also in in elected office as a city council person and then he became city council president and in Wilmington many of you know Ted blunt and you know I think you're right that that being there and being a part of knocking on doors listening when constituents called with problems it creates that sense of of knowing that we're in it together and that we have a responsibility and just like your dad my dad ran and didn't win the first time so lesson to everybody don't give up just because you might not win the first time because even the fruits of that labor might end up in Congress who knows you know and even in that defeat you can still make a difference you know you're raising issues and questions and bringing attention to issues that deserve attention because all those in justices that sometimes people turn a blind eye to well speaking of in justices or turning a blind eye let's turn an eye to the fall of 2018 and what's at stake and why do people need to be engaged why do people need to vote look there's so much at stake and in the community that I was born and raised in similar lissa to communities all across America it's it's small its rural everyone knows one another you know you you you get to know the same family and friends and neighbors when you go into the ball game or the grocery store you're going to church wherever it may be and it's that community that you get to know but you also get to know people well especially when they're confiding in you and so many families across the country are still facing immense challenges working two and three jobs middle-class families that are still struggling to pay the rent or pay the mortgage to keep that roof over their head maybe save a little bit so that way they can put it into some savings or maybe even just go out and go camping or get to the ballgame or whatever maybe on the weekend so many people across the country are still going through tough times and I think that's what my colleagues my Republican colleagues are just blind to the notion that our Republican colleagues would pass a tax cam a bill a piece of legislation where our Republican house colleagues promised to probably Aurra ties middle-class families and I'll be darned if the package rewarded corporations in the most wealthy with eighty three percent of that benefit the split was a half middle-class families that were problems that they were going to get more support and be the primary focus of the bill they were lied to and that's not right right they should have been prioritized but along the way the Republicans in that piece of legislation actually did something that's increasing the cost of health care in the American people whether you're in Delaware or you're in New Mexico you see the cost of those premiums going up those deductibles going up out-of-pocket cost going up and look my father he sadly passed with about was Stage four lung cancer people with pre-existing conditions our Republican colleagues piece of legislation actually was going to turn their backs on them and then we now saw that under this administration they actually did turn their backs on people with pre-existing conditions people like my dad would have been left out and we all share stories like that right so we save what's at stake see the dignity and the respect and the treatment of hard-working middle-class families across some air that's what we need to be focusing on and in my opinion that's what's at stake right now is making sure that they're put first and we have an agenda that's for the people of the people and by the people and that we're driving that agenda home and that same story that I told you about my father it's also about the working conditions that people find themselves in well we didn't know is every day that my dad was going to work he was getting a little more sick every day he was in a smoker but he died because of a about with Stage four lung cancer and he didn't need to if there would have been safer working conditions in place for those people that get up for that morning shift for that graveyard shift that are putting in that hard day's work that come home dusty to be able to be with their family or their kids keep that roof over their head they deserve to be protect and they deserve better yeah and it's just not right and there's pieces of legislation every day that are actually putting workers in harm's way so it's personal for me I know it's personal for you and people across Delaware and back in New Mexico that's what's at stake and so I just say look everything that we can do to put people first to fight for her democracy to make sure that we're making things better I think that's what that's taken whatever that drives you personally yeah focus all that energy if you marched back in February or January 2017 with the women's March if you're a student or someone across America that's driven by the March for our lives if you were so concerned with what we saw Republicans and this administration doing with the assault on climate issues and climate change in global warming and the assault on science and you got involved the march of science whatever that may be if you've been able to bring that voice forward with the courage of being a victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment and the me2 movement has freed so many people in the country to speed up whatever it may be we need people voting and we need them to be active so it's all at stake and we can be better now I don't want to end that on a low note right I'm inspired about what can be done and you inspire me every day Lisa will weigh you you speak to us and you into the greater good of what we can get done here and I think that's what we're also looking to do across the country is make sure that we're inspiring one another and then we remind one another why it's important to get involved a boat and that we lend that helping hands wherever we can we're supposed to love thy neighbor exactly and we do more when we get that done I totally agree and I wanted the audience to hear hear from you because you are on the road all across the country trying to make sure that we elect great people to Congress and that's really what's at stake I mean it all of these issues that Ben ray just talked about are at stake and even the most recent issue you talked about the the me2 movement just today I was able to with some of my colleagues both on the Republican and Democratic side Senate and House introduced a bill called the empower act to deal with the whole focus of making sure there's a tip line for people who are being harassed making sure that there are not these non-disclosure clauses in in in contracts and really just to prevent that kind of discrimination and those are the kind of important things that are on the line for us as Ben ray mentioned health care and I as many of you know I'm the kind of person who says you know reporter asked me Lisa are you frustrated being in Congress and I said I'm not frustrated I'm motivating that's what we want people to be we want you to be motivated and activated so that when the fall comes we're ready to make the changes that need to be made so I just thank you so much for your leadership across the country I thank you for your friendship and he's a mentor and we just we're just really blessed to have you as a part of our team thank you very much mr. chairman No and thanks to everyone out in Delaware thanks for being supportive of Lisa Rochester

if you find yourselves out in New Mexico please and look us up oh let's get this done and please get involved stay active and let's vote ladies and gentlemen were almost out of time we have so much more to talk about in the next few months so I hope you'll continue to join me don't forget to join me every 4th Sunday through the fall at 9 p.m. and on YouTube because when Lisa goes to Washington

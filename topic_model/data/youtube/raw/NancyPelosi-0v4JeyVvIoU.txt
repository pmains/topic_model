as it is the proud American tradition we can both ensure the security of our country and welcome desperate women and children and seniors facing Isis brutality my colleague as you spoke before me just said our hearts go out to the refugees but our hand of friendship does not and it could we could do this in a bipartisan way if we betray our values as a country and slam the door in the face of those innocent victims of terror we do not strengthen our security we weaken ourselves in the fight against Isis savage ideology there are other things that we could be doing in a bipartisan way and I would have hoped that that was a place we could have gone with this and one of them relates a closing loopholes in the visa waiver program our colleagues on the Senate side today are putting forth their principles and they state if an Isis recruit attempts to travel to the United States on a fraudulent passport paper passport issued by a country that participates in the visa waiver program that individual would avoid biometric screening and in-person interviews how could we allow this loop road losses if we are truly addressing this challenge in a comprehensive way and if the Republicans want to make a nation safer in the face of terror there's another clear area in which we should act and that is we should be voting on Congressman Peter King Republican Congressman Peter kingsville to close the appalling loophole that it's outrageous it's outrageous that that a person who's on the terrorism watch list listen this someone is on the terrorist watchlist could walk into a gun store and buy a gun his bill is called the denying firearms and explosive too dangerous terrorist acts Visa Waiver close the terrorists gun loophole according to the GAO over the last 11 years more than 2,000 suspects on the FBI's terrorist watch list bought weapons in the United States

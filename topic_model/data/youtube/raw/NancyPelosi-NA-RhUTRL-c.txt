you talk about birth control you're talking about women's health I firmly believe I want to remove all doubt in anyone's mind where I am on this subject this is an issue about women's health and I believe that women's health should be covered in all of the insurance plans that are there right now as we gather here and another part of the country there is a hearing five men are testifying on women's health my colleague carolyn Maloney of New York who is on the committee looked down at this panel from which a woman who was the Democratic witness was excluded and said where are the women and that's a good question for the whole debate where are the women where the women on that panel imagine they're having a panel on women's health and they don't have any women on the panel Dola what is it that men don't understand about where health and health central the issue of family planning is to that not just if you're having family but if you need of those kinds of prescription drugs for your general health which was the testimony they would have heard this morning if they had allowed a woman on the panel I think the fact that they did not allow a woman on the panel is symbolic of the whole debate as to who was making these decisions about a woman's health and who should be covered and I remind you I think it's 26 states have this requirement already so this is nothing really new more than half of the states already have it so this is probably a pretty good debate to have just saying suppose you were suppose you were a Christian Scientist and you had an institution and you said oh if people work here for us who are not Christian Scientist or if they even if they are they cannot avail themselves of any medical treatments because that's what we believe would that work for you I mean it's just a kit so so shall we say disrespectful of the contribution that in this case women make to the workforce 98% of Catholic women I am told by all of you and use birth control to determine the size and timing of their families so again it's a women's health issue yes I think that all institutions recover at good health insurance should cover the full range of health insurance issues for women and I think it's really an curiouser of that as we get further into this debate the Republican leadership of this Congress thinks it's appropriate to have a hearing on subject of women health and purposefully exclude women from the panel what else do you need to know about the subject if you need to know more tune in I may I may at some point they move to explain biology to my colleagues thank you all very much

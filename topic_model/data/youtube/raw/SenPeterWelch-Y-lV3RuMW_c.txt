MR. WULL MUCH. THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEMAN IS  RECOGNIZED FOR THREE MINUTES.  MR. WELCH: I THANK THE   GENTLEMAN. I WANT TO STATE TO MY  COLLEAGUES ON THIS BUDGET THERE  ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS  YOU ARE MAKING THAT NEED TO BE   CHALLENGED.  ONE, YOU ARE SAYING WE HAVE A  SPENDING PROBLEM NOT A REVENUE   PROBLEM. THIS COUNTRY IS SPENDING ON  DOMESTIC PRIORITIES AND DEFENSE  AT A LEVEL THAT EXISTED WHEN --  THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES WAS DWIGHT D.   EISENHOWER.  THAT WAS BEFORE MEDICAID AND   MEDICARE. IS SPENDING ON  DOMESTIC PRIORITIES AND DEFENSE  AT A  WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE  ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET  THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF THIS  COUNTRY, BOTH ON DEFENSE WHERE   WE NEED SOME HELP, BUT   DEFINITELY ON THE DOMESTIC SIDE  AS WELL. THE SECOND ASSUMPTION THAT YOU   ARE MAKING, IT'S AN ASSERTION  MADE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IS   THAT TAX CUTS WILL PAY FOR   THEMSELVES.  THAT'S THE THEOLOGY OF YOUR  BUDGET.  TAX CUTS PAY FOR THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW, WHY NOT GO TO ZERO?  IT WILL ALL BE RICH. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S BEING  SAID HERE. NOT GO TO ZERO?  IT WILL ALL BE RICH. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S BEING  SAID HERE. BUT THE TAX CUTS ARE ALWAYS AT   THE HIGH END OF THE INCOME   SPECTRUM, WHICH IS EXACERBATING  INEQUALITY AND CREATING A  PROBLEM FOR US TO MEET   ESSENTIAL NEEDS IN THIS  COUNTRY. SO, THIS QUESTION OF TAX CUTS  PAYING FOR THEMSELVES IN FISCAL  RESPONSIBILITY, LET'S HAVE A   LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY HERE.  THIS WAS THE THEOLOGY OF GEORGE  BUSH WHEN HE PASSED THE TAX  CUTS WHEN HE BECAME PRESIDENT. THEY DID NOT PAY FOR   THEMSELVES.  WE WENT FROM THE CLINTON ERA   SURPLUSES TO THE BUSH ERA  DEFICITS, AND IN ANOTHER   FISCALLY, GROSSLY IRRESPONSIBLE  MOVE, HE PUT THE WAR ON THE  CREDIT CARD. THE WAR WAS ON THE CREDIT CARD.  WE HAD UNFADE FOR TAX CUTS AND   UNFADE FOR WAR.  THIS IS NOT JUST FISCAL  RESPONSIBILITY, THIS IS  GOVERNMENTAL PERSONAL, CONGRESS  AOL, -- CONGRESSIONAL,   IRRESPONSIBILITY.  YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THINGS.  WHETHER IT'S THE WAR OR FOOD   STAMPS OR ANY PROGRAM YOU WANT   TO PECK, TO HAVE PAY FOR T IF  YOU DON'T PAY FOR IT BY THE  MAGIC ASTERISKIC OF SAYING THE   TAX CUTS WE PROPOSED WE'RE   GOING TO SPEND BY CUTTING  TAXES, WE GOING INTO A WAR WE  DON'T PAY FOR, $1 TRILLION, IT   DOESN'T WORK.  AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE IN THIS  PATH THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS  WITH RESPECT TO THE LONG-TERM  DEBT.  I BELIEVE IN THAT. WE'VE GOT TO PAY OUR BILLS.  WHEN WE HAD THE MAJORITY, WE   HAD A DOCTRINE THAT SAID, PAY  AS YOU GO. IF ANY DEMOCRAT, THE BUDGET  CHAIR, OR ME WANTED TO PROPOSE   SOME SPENDING, YOU EITHER HAD  TO COME UP WITH THE REVENUE OR   HAD TO CUT SOMEWHERE ELSE. I BELIEVE IN THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE IN UNPAID FOR  TAX CUTS PAYING FOR THEMSELVES.  I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE'RE --  WAR SPENDING PAYS FOR ITSELF   AND WE CAN PUT IT ON THE CREDIT  CARD.  NOW, WE'VE GOT SOME PROBLEMS   AND CHALLENGES IN THIS COUNTRY.  WE'VE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY   PROBLEM. KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL MANY GET  OUT WITH A DEBT THE SIZE OF A  MORTGAGE.  WE'VE GOT AN INEQUALITY  PROBLEM. IT'S NEVER BEEN WORSE. THIS GOES KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL BACK TO TH  DEPRESSION WHEN WE HAD THIS  DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT HARDWORKING  PEOPLE MADE AND WHAT THE TOP 1%  MADE.  WE'VE GOT A HEALTH CARE  AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM. YOU DON'T SOLVE THAT BY  SLASHING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE   AND THROWING 24 MILLION PEOPLE   OFF OF HEALTH CARE.  WE'VE GOT A INFRASTRUCTURE   PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TOTALLY   NEGLIGENTING.  IT IS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS  BUDGET.  WE'VE GOT A DREAMER PROBLEM. HOW IS IT THAT IN THIS CONGRESS  WE'RE LITERALLY NOT ALLOWING   800,000 YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAME  HERE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR   OWN, NOT VOLUNTARILY, AND WE'RE  GOING TO GIVE THEM THE HOOK AND  DEPORT THEM. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. WE'VE GOT A RURAL AMERICA  PROBLEM. RURAL AMERICA HAS BEEN LEFT  BEHIND.  THE INEQUALITY IN THIS COUNTRY   IS REALLY HITTING HARD ON RURAL  AMERICA. PARTS OF VERMONT.  ALL PARTS OF THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BUDGET  THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO GIVE  HOPE TO RURAL AMERICA BY   INVESTING IN THE

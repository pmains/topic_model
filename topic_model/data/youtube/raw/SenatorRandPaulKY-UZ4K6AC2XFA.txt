initially government officials were honest enough to admit that the goal of mitigation efforts AKA lockdown was to flatten the curve but the area under the curve the total deaths from the virus would likely be the same in other words the lockdown was to mitigate the spike in viral deaths or hospitals would not be overwhelmed but the same amount of people would likely die with or without the lockdown the media and frankly government officials seem to have forgotten this important caveat flattening the curve morphed into a belief that we could change the course of the pandemic with an economic lockdown this is unfortunate and has led to the protracted lockdown recession we are currently mired in it's important that we examine the data learn from the data and try to avoid the man-made aspect of This calamity in the future to those who argue that the lockdown flattened the curve in New York and New Jersey the evidence argues otherwise New York and New Jersey wound up with the sharpest Spike or highest death rate in the world at over 1700 deaths per million in contrast Sweden had a relatively softer touch few mandates and mostly voluntary guidelines Sweden's death rate ended up about a third that of New York and New Jersey some might argue that Sweden and New York and New Jersey are different populations perhaps but even the average death rate for the U.S is now greater than Sweden in fact the U.S death rate is quite comparable to less developed parts of the world where social distancing is virtually impossible such as Brazil Bolivia and Ecuador which brings us to an important question is man really capable of altering the course of an infectious disease through crowd control the statistics argue a resounding no the evidence argues that mitigation efforts have failed to flatten the curve that most countries regardless of Public Health policy suffered a significant spike in deaths and then a gradual decline now some will argue what about Hong Kong Taiwan South Korea Japan each which have had extraordinarily low death rates Hong Kong Taiwan and South Korea certainly enforced stricter quarantine and contact tracing rules in the U.S but Japan's rules were largely voluntary since their prime minister lacks the legal powers to enforce a lockdown one explanation for the low death rate in much of Asia is that the population may have a higher degree of exposure to Coronas virus colds coronavirus colds and therefore have more pre-existing cross-reactive immunity if scientists were interested there is a fascinating field of inquiry looking at susceptibility to covid-19 an assessment of whether people not have pre-existing immunity to similar coronaviruses in fact pre-existing cross-reactive immunity to coronavirus may explain why we have so many people that have very little symptoms or asymptomatic well there's still many things we need to learn about this pandemic it's important that we the people not simply acquiesced authoritarian mandates on our Behavior without first making the nanny State prove their hypothesis as for now what we do know is that New York and New Jersey and Connecticut and Rhode Island still allow the highest death rates in the world we also know that Sweden who enforced few mandates ended up with a death rate one-third of New York and New Jersey we also know that the overall death rate for the U.S now is essentially equivalent to that of South America where social distancing and mitigation efforts are virtually impossible Dr fauci today you said you are not for economic lockdown yet your mitigation recommendations from dating to baseball to restaurants to movie theaters have led to this economic lockdown do you have any second thoughts about your mitigation recommendations considering the evidence that despite all of the things we've done the U.S our death rate is essentially worse than Sweden equivalent to the less developed world that is unable to do any of the things that you've been promoting do you have any second thoughts are you willing to look at the data that countries that did very little actually have a lower death rate than the United States you know Senator I I'd be happy at a different time to sit down and go over detail you've said a lot of different things you've compared us to Sweden and there are a lot of differences and you said well you know there are a lot of differences between Sweden but compare Sweden's death rate to other comparable no us uh Scandinavian countries it's worse so I don't think it's appropriate to compare Sweden with us yes we have I I think in the in in the beginning we've done things based on the knowledge we had at the time and hopefully and I am and my colleagues are humble enough and modest enough to realize that as new data comes you make different recommendations but I don't regret saying that the only way we could have really stopped the explosion of infection was by essentially um I want to say shutting down I mean essentially having the physical separation and the kinds of recommendations that we've made you've been a big fan of Cuomo and the shutdown of New York you've lauded New York for their policy New York had the highest death rate in the world how could we possibly be jumping up and down and saying oh Governor Cuomo did a great job he had the worst death rate in the world no you misconstrued that Senator and you've done that repetitively in the past they got hit very badly they've made some mistakes right now if you look at what's going on right now the things that are going on in New York to get their test positivity one percent or less is because they are looking at at the guidelines that we have put together from the task force of the four or five things of masks social distancing outdoors more than indoors avoiding crowds and washing hands or they've developed enough Community immunity that they're no longer having in the pandemic because they have enough immunity in New York City to actually stop I challenge that uh Senator because we're afraid I want to please sir I would like to be able to do this because this happens with Senator Durand all the time you were not listening to what the director of the CDC said that in New York it's about 22 percent if you believe 22 percent is hurt immunity I believe you're alone in that there's also the pre-existing immunity of those who have cross-reactivity which is about a third of the public and many customers which would actually get you I'd like to talk to you about that also because there was a study that recently came out that pre-existing immunity to coronaviruses that are common cold do not cross-react with the covet 19. thank you senator Paul senator

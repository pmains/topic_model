quickly ask you also about guns you as obviously the senator from Connecticut have been such a proponent for some kind of action you've been talking to the White House we understand the president has keeps pointing to mental health issues it's not it's people who pull the trigger it's not the gun are you getting encouragement from the White House staff that he is willing when you all come back to do something about background checks or other gun gun measures or is he gonna revert back to this mental health NRA mantra' I wish I knew the answer to that question Andrew the President and I had a conversation some weeks ago in which he expressed you know his desire to pass a meaningful background checks reform bill I read that to mean one that would not be supported by the NRA and the gun lobby and we are as we speak in discussions with the White House about just that significant changes to our background check system to make sure that more guns are subjects more gun sales or subject to background checks and thus far the White House is at the table and I see a path forward to getting something before the Senate that would that could pass but it can only pass the Senate if the president supports it so you know ask me in a couple weeks as to whether the president's interest is sincere but I think it's good news that we're sitting down and talking about this

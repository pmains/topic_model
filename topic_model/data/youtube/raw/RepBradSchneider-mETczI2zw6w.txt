Mr. Speaker,
I rise today in strong opposition to the Trump Administration’s shameful new policy separating
parents and children on our southern border. This policy is even being applied to those
legally seeking asylum here while fleeing violence in their home countries. The current system of prioritizing criminal
prosecution of those seeking protection rather than assessing legitimate asylum claims has
to stop. These are not our nation’s values. Our country is better than this. Our people are better than this. But we do have a chance to get something right. We’re currently within a handful of signatures
of forcing a vote on a series of immigration proposals, including the bipartisan USA Act
which pairs a resolution for our DREAMers with smart investments in border security. June is Immigrant Heritage Month – a time
to reflect on the history of immigration that so many Americans share. We must live up to our heritage by ending
this cruel policy of family separation, securing DREAMers a permanent future here in the United
States, and finally reforming our broken immigration system.

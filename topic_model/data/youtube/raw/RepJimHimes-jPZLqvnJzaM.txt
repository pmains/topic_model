talk about that Iran deal in the politics surrounding it let's bring in congressman jim heintz he's a Democrat from Connecticut he's on the House Intelligence Committee and he was at the meeting getting briefed on the Iran deal just last night congressman thank you for joining us so morning good meeting do you feel more comfortable with the deal well look I think the Secretary's because I Carrie Lou and Moniz were all there did a pretty good job of walking through the framework of really making it clear that if and of course that's a big if they can get a final deal that looks like this framework that is a huge step backwards for Iran's ambition to develop a nuclear weapon and you know the Secretary was passionate about you know as we have to do every time we consider anything here don't compare this deal to the perfect the idea that Iran was going to capitulate one hundred percent with no face saving measures you know complete capitulation but compare it to the alternatives that said to answer your question Chris I would say that and and and I think this was both you know people acting and thinking in good faith and people may be acting and thinking politically there was a great deal of skepticism in the room well you have your own skepticism about this right i mean you want to see how the fill the holes are filled in you want to see what verification means how are your points of resistance any different than what you're seeing on the Republican side well look anybody who is thinking about a deal with Iran has to approach a deal with some skepticism and we need to get to a point where at least we know that there is in fact total transparency you know as the secretary said yesterday this is not about trust the old Reagan statement of trust but verify this is actually it is to be a successful deal is about don't trust and verify and so we want to see that in fact that you know all the measures that would provide transparency into their grammar there and of course you know we need to make sure that the sanctions if and as they are lifted are lifted in a way that if Iran misbehaves they can be put back in place and I think that's what we need to see but look I you know anybody the negotiating with Iran would demand those things what we need to be a little careful about as a country and I think Kerry tried to make this point is that we don't want a torpedo this Association before it's finished and there's a lot of ways that Congress could do that and you know the Secretary was very passionate and saying let us finish this deal and get a you know see if we can get to a place that will make you and the world because of course we're not the only one negotiating here as comfortable as you can be ask you something let me play this sound bite of your colleague who's also on the House Intelligence Committee Republican representative Chris Stewart about why he was unimpressed with the briefings I want to see if you disagree with it why what I see is a complete lack of understanding between the Americans and their rainy encounter parts once again do we have unfettered access to their military installations we say yes they say very clearly no do they live sanctions the day the agreement is signed they say yes we say no so I don't think those are misrepresentations in the millet in the media so much as there's just vast disagreement on what this really means see wrong he's partly wrong look shocker of shockers the Iranians are spinning this to their hardliners a little different than the administration is describing it to the American people now that is I think an attribute of potentially a successful negotiation here's the thing though when a negotiation is completed there will be a document that will be extraordinarily specific about these things there will be no ambiguity in a document that that is acceptable and so yes of course right now before a deal is is finalized people are going back and beating their chests about about everything that they achieved and what a good deal they got and of course positioning themselves for the final negotiation remember this is the Middle East there's an awful lot of positioning that goes on and of course we're in an area of the world where the rhetoric and the anti-us rhetoric and the chance of death to America we've been living with those for you know 30 plus years um people just need to sort of calm down and remember that there's a lot of details yet to be worked out but that if they can achieve what they say they can achieve it is probably a better outcome than No Deal uh or certainly a better outcome than a rush to a military back on a run or when you talk about rush let's flip the script here for a second put some onus on you guys you have senator corker who's thinking about pushing a vote on the bill to say that the Senate maybe all of Congress has to have a say on this deal the White House seems to be walking that line when maybe it doesn't even need to as you well know the overwhelming number of agreements that this country makes are not treaties are not congressional executive treaties they are just executive deals and by bringing you guys in and having corker have this vote aren't you threatening the deal by not letting the negotiations just take place well the answer to that question is potentially yes and look I appreciate senator corker you know I think he's trying to do a good job here and you know I appreciate the fact that he did not join in that absolutely outrageous letter that 47 Republican senators sent to the mullahs of Iran you know he he at least understood that advising your enemies leadership in the middle of a very delicate negotiation is probably not consistent with the idea that politics ends at the water's edge so I appreciate corkers approach on this and I think what we all need to do is you know make sure that the certainty is there that a deal is a good deal but let's not torpedo this thing look there's no doubt in my mind that there are those who believe that you cannot negotiate with Iran now you know they have to explain why Iran actually negotiated a preliminary agreement and stuck by the terms of the preliminary agreement and then point out to a better alternative and a lot of them say oh well I could have you know we could get a deal well you know you weren't in the room and and you can always you know criticize a deal but you know there are those who want to attach things to corkers bill which would essentially torpedo these negotiations and and I think that's not a place we want to be look here's here's where I think my constituents I suspect the bulk of the American people are they want us to make every effort to strike as strong a deal as we can and not start closing a lot of doors that if you close all those doors at the end of that hallway is yet another military conflict in the Middle East so I think the administration is saying and most people would agree that let's see if we can get a good enough deal with all of its messiness with all of its compromise to try to avert uh a UH Iran getting a nuclear weapon and or an arms race in the region but be yet another war in the Middle East congressman hein thank you very much for being with us we'll keep you in the loop on this process and you please do the same thank you Chris

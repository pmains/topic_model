let me ask my questions on trade part of the jurisdiction of the subcommittee last week Canadian basilar David McNaughton to the United States and white house economic advisor Larry Kudlow predicted that the administration could remove section 232 tariffs on still on an aluminum in a matter of weeks mr. secretary I don't need to tell you that the retaliation of US Agriculture as a result of these tariffs have been incredibly difficult to our producers dairy producers processors depend on exporting their cheese to Mexico I have a significant processor that you met when you came to California last year 20% of its product goes to Mexico we have products that are in decline in China and India exports to Canada the list goes on 44% of California agriculture depends upon foreign trade the president admitted last week that his strategy to get the u.s. MCA approved was to threaten the use or increase of 232 tariffs on Canada and Mexico that's also impacted our European allies he also threatened to withdraw from NAFTA before us MCA has brought to a vote I think that strategy is a mistake I was in Mexico in December for the inauguration they simply said look at we're willing to reduce our our tariffs but we want you to pass us MC and that's our only leverage so my question to you is whether than pursuing new markets and trade deals which we need to do with Japan and we need to resolve with China where are we with regards to us MCA and these 232 tariffs can you confirm that an ambassador McNaughton and Larry Kudlow have hinted on that the administration will finally remove these I think misguided 232 tariffs in the next few weeks I can confirm that we've had discussions at my level with my contemporaries both Minister McCauley in Canada and secretary Villalobos in Mexico regarding the interest of all three countries to ratify us MCA which we all believe would need to have the 232 tears resolved as well I mean that's their only leverage obviously they want it to pass we want it to pass but we need to get going certainly I think again the the removal of the tariffs I think is in the interest of all and we're advocating to the administration to do that certainly the president has responsibility for the whole economy he began the - 32 investigation demonstrated a weakness in our steel and aluminium sector and the potential for lose the 80 percent target data analysts said that's been met yes sir and I think what we're moving toward is a resolution over the tears possibly to be replaced by reasonable quotas with which Canada and Mexico can live and have the retaliatory tariffs removed we look forward to continuing to work with you my times expired but this is a critical issue and obviously for American agriculture as you know

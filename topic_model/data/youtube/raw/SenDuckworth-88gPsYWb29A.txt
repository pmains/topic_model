and it's great to be here today thank you to all of you for joining me and especially to the YWCA Illinois National Education Association women employed March of Dimes and Planned Parenthood fittingly right here just before Mother's Day at just ten days old my daughter Miley pearl made history swaddled in blankets nestled in my arms she became the first child allowed onto the Senate floor in our nation's history now she slept on as I voted nay on the matter at hand blissfully unaware of the matter and of the milestone moment as a mother I'll never forget that day and I'm endlessly grateful that my colleagues changed chamber rules to allow me and all future parents in the Senate to fulfill our responsibilities to both the Constitution and our newborns but I also never understand how it took 229 years for the Senate to adopt policy that allows working moms to well work that figure is shocking but also unsurprising even in 2019 far too many workers in the u.s. don't have access to the benefits resources and workplaces that they need to support their families even though more than seventy percent that 7-0 percent of women with children are in our labor force and 62 percent of marriages feature two working parents many of our federal policies and workplace policies still fail to lift up families yesterday with the help of the many of the groups here I introduced several new bills to start making things better to help make things easier for working families the first bill is the end diaper need Act it would provide low-income families with diapers which as any parents knows are not only critical to the health of infants and toddlers but to economic and emotional health of families as well this bill would also help provide diapers for medically complex babies and children through home and community-based health services and ensure families are able to use health flexible spending accounts to purchase diapers no family should struggle to purchase diapers for their babies yet one in three mothers report that at times they do not have enough diapers to keep their children clean dry and healthy the second bill that I introduced is the education support professionals Family Leave Act while the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 was an important step towards ensuring many workers in America had access to unpaid leave to care for a family member or themselves it doesn't extend that access to more than 40% of our workforce people like the clerical workers janitorial staff and bus drivers we trust to work without children at their schools every day often failed to meet the hourly threshold needed to qualify for FMLA benefits these support professionals are unable to take time to care for loved ones or even themselves without risking their jobs my legislation would change that by finally giving the more than 2.7 million educational support professionals across the country the ability to take FMLA leave when they need it I'm also proud that I was able to introduce expanding on-campus childcare to help parents succeed Act which builds on legislation I've worked on for years to help student parents attend and finish college by increasing access to affordable childcare services right where they need it on the campus and while policies like extended and paid family leave lactation support and flexible hours for new parents should be the norm for workplaces unfortunately many employers haven't still moved into the 21st century and there's more we can do to help working families that's why the last bill are my working family package of legislation the honoring family friendly workplaces Act is one that I introduced it will encourage more and more employers to enact family-friendly policies by creating a program to recognize employers and businesses and to actually do a good job welcoming parents into their workplaces it's a certification program it would be housed at the Department of Labor and would allow employers to highlight when they treat their workers well and offer benefits and policies that help new parents and all workers succeed these bills are just the beginning of what we can and should be doing to help working families look I will always be so proud that my little mighty pearl helped bring the Senate into the 21st century making life easier for any future senator with a swaddled sleepy newborn to care for but the reality is this country can't wait another two hundred and twenty nine years for Congress to pass legislation that looks out for families outside of the Senate chambers thank you all again I thank you for everyone who's here with me this afternoon and I will be followed by Miss lakhan's Alice thank you

we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks to the greatest podcast you've ever heard if you haven't given it five stars i'm not sure what you're doing look i know how many people download each episode if all of you gave me five stars i'd have more stars than ben shapiro that would be really cool okay not that i'm competing with anybody or anything i just am um so i am very honored to have with me former speaker of the house paul ryan uh paul thank you so much for being on i'm not sure that i need to go i usually do a long introduction and bio for people people know who you are but maybe maybe tell us what you're up to now yeah hey good good to be with you dan um i am not baking in the sun like you are down in houston um it's raining all the time right now yeah so i um yeah you guys need more of those aqueducts there you guys you guys they have a hard time getting your water just we're working on it we're working on the third reservoir i know i know issues you need the third reservoir bill um yeah so uh i do a lot of fun stuff and that's the great thing about being you know out of government out of congress i get to do what i want to do um i i work i do some private sector stuff uh i do some boards and speeches but my vocational portfolio consists of i teach in the economics department at notre dame i'm a fellow at the american enterprise institute working on a few discreet projects there and i have a charitable foundation called the american idea foundation which is focused on center-right uh free-market poverty policies uh and all of these things i do give me the ability to schedule my time how i want to so i've making up for a lot of lost family time i've done more stuff with my family in the last two years than i did in the prior you know eight combined probably i bet you're not i bet you're happier it's awesome yeah i'm very yeah definitely that i just was part of my problem um you know when you in government there are some jobs i think are sort of better for empty nesters like speaker of the house um i wasn't an empty nester um was really happy to have done the job honored to have done it enjoyed it but it was i sort of had a ticking clock which was kids in high school you know flying the coop before too long i still have two left in high school my daughter just finished her freshman year in college um so i'm just making up for a lot of lost time and i'm doing fun stuff and i work on projects that i care about yeah so it's really fun well that's good to hear i mean i think i think this job in congress is is fulfilling and it's a mission i'm a very mission oriented person but but people always ask are you enjoying it i'm like that's not really the right question i enjoyed being in the seal teams i know every once in a while i get blown up but i truly enjoyed it it was it's just a very different world it was also fulfilling that's all i ever wanted to do this is also fulfilling it's a mission it's it's important um i want to jump right right into it so so just for the listeners we're going to talk about anti-poverty measures from the conservative angle this is uh mr this is speaker ryan's you know expertise on many levels as you say you you teach about it you work on it you have a foundation on it um foundation i think is the right word to use here when you're teaching your students what kind of foundational research do you give them foundational readings where do we start as conservatives i mean you and i have talked about this before we need to be able to understand multi-layers deep why we believe what we believe because it's founded in a lot of truth and a lot of history so maybe give us some quick insights onto what you might assign people i couldn't agree more with that i think it's important that conservatives understand the rudimentary irreducible primary principles in the moral court moral code on which we operate that makes sure that when we do engage in populism meaning try to be more popular it is tethered to principles it is it is populism rightfully directed because it flows from constant principle it's not just running around loose um doing whatever you know whatever popular will occurs and so i do worry that sometimes we forget about conservatism when pursuing populism that's another comment for a political discussion yeah but to answer your question um so i teach in the economics department at notre dame i also serve on the board of something we call the laboratory for economic opportunity which is basically poverty economics using econometrics and economic tools like randomized control trials to prove techniques of getting people out of poverty at the core of this one of the classes i taught the last last year that i really enjoyed was the morality of capitalism catholic social teaching and free market economics i had students read authors like michael novak a prominent catholic theologian and free market advocate and devotee he recently passed away because i do believe that there is a moral core foundation um to capitalism and my argument is that free enterprise is the best weapon against poverty and that's a timely conversation given the fact that we had this sort of fetish with socialism we had this sort of young person romantic attachment to the fashionable you know idea of socialism but when you actually just scrape below the surface of socialism realize it is this basically conformity um no choices and enforce poverty and it's it's just misery it sank economies from eastern europe to latin america and everywhere in between and so free enterprise classical liberal classical liberal economics is really what what gets the individual moving so at the core i think you have to understand what natural rights are natural law so we we study natural law natural rights and the foundation of free market economics that comes from that you can go to the renaissance and read adam smith you can read john locke you can read the founders frankly and there's a lot that you can get from these classic classical economists you can also look at the austrians you know mises hayek you can go to the chicago school milton friedman bob and dell so there's a lot of good writing that is out there i think michael novak is one of the authors that i sort of point to in my classes we sort of distilled all of this and frankly it's a catholic university and i'm a catholic so we do it through that lens but that's not necessary the the basic idea of natural rights and natural law which is the foundation of america is our rights come from god not from government they're pre-government they're ours as individuals and so that view um is anti-identity politics it's anti-collectivism it's pro-individualism and pro-free market and that view combined with a moral code um that with that we believe in as as human beings that you know at a catholic university i teach it through catholic social teaching um allows you to to enjoy the fact that a free market economy rests on a moral foundation of based on natural rights natural law with a bill of rights and individual rights and a constitution designed to protect these rights so that we are free to design and run our own lives um and that we believe in local control and local government and federalism we call this subsidiary as catholics all of that gives you a moral understanding of a of a society that gave us the greatest country in humankind that gave us this enormous american experiment where our foundation which my foundation describes is the american idea the condition of your birth doesn't determine the outcome of your life um that american creed and american idea is the most revolutionary thing we've ever had as human beings it is it is the one thing that ran contrary to all other ways societies organize themselves mostly through the coercion of collectivism and it's it's easy to defeat these things i think um and the progressive left is trying to pull us back toward the same old tired ideas of collectivism and socialism which has you know created a lot of rot in a lot of societies the last point i'll say is to have a free society like we designed a constitutional republic it does require truth it does require morality you know washington said it best and is exiting you know farewell address they built we built a system of natural law and natural riots in a constitutional republic with individual rights which sort of requires a moral society a moral country and so it's important that we as individuals keep civil society big and and growing so that we can keep ourselves tethered to truth and to to individual moral codes so that we can enjoy um the gift of freedom that this country has given us that you fought for as as as as a sailor you know in the seals those are all i love all that i mean i'll i'll just add and emphasize your point on the um the basis of morality and whether you're an atheist or a catholic you can't deny that america was founded on judeo-christian values um people are like well i'm a good person i don't have to believe in god to be a good person that's true but big butt you grew up in a western civilization that is founded on these values whether you like it or not and that's a good thing and maybe a little appreciation for that might be in order um and the last thing i'll say is that the left is always saying well jesus was a socialist see they like they like to take a lot of the things you're saying and say that's exactly why we need to spend more money on people because of our morality right so they they they twist these things it's easy to be a leftist it's the arguments are unbelievably easy because you can always look you can always find imperfections in a society and use that as an excuse for that collectivism that you talk about and this is the battle we always fight on as conservatives our base is always really upset because we're always on defense and i know you know what i just tell them look you're a conservative get used to it you're always on defense that's the entire point of being a conservative so deal with it stop complaining you're not a victim they're like why don't we go on offense because we're not crazy activists that's why okay we're on defense and that's the point the last thing i'll say is this whole jesus is a socialist nonsense flies in the face of jesus teachings he didn't he didn't say um you know he said you should give charity not demand that somebody else gives charity and and also this notion of collective guilt is really important this gets a little philosophical but it's really important to note that the bible's teachings are you are guilty for your sins you are responsible the essence of personal responsibility is unbelievably important in jesus teachings collectivism is not you're not responsible for the sins of your father but this is exactly what the left teaches it's completely the opposite of jesus's teachings and so maybe i just kind of want you now to to move on to you know speaking of charity speaking of helping the poor which is certainly what jesus taught what are our solutions to that what's the first what's the framework we should think about anti-poverty programs then i want to get into some specifics with the on opportunity zones and the um uh the tax credits uh the the eitc tax credit and all of that yeah so i'll pick up where you just left off which is and i i've i've had this conversation for years with constituents and people around the country the question is do we have a country that is wired to produce or promote equality of opportunity the answer is yes or do we want to change this country to promote equality of outcome which is really socialism which is antithetical to our founding creed to our constitution and i would argue strongly that that promoting equality of opportunity is the goal of america that is the goal of of our government in our society and we should maintain that and not substitute it for a quality of outcome because the kind of government you have to have to do that is radically different than what we have um in the last point you said about uh collectivism and the guilt by association identity politics is going to be the undoing of the american creed if we allow it to take root and that means the left is always practice identity politics what i what worries me most these days is the right now is flirting with it also for populist means that are untethered to core principles so if we believe in this sort of group resentment or tribe against tribe then we will lose sight of the entire moral premise of america and natural rights and our constitution and our in our framing of our society so i just want to punctuate the point you just made and so that brings us to public policy and can we strive for a system of dynamic upper mobility where we promote the equality of opportunity so everybody gets a shot at having the best version of their life that at rising to wherever they want to go wherever they can go limited only by their god-given talent and their own effort that's the kind of society we want to achieve that's what america is sort of wired for and so there are lots of techniques and programs and policies that can do that but they also must respect the inherent dignity dignity of each individual person they must respect the dignity of local of of local government of local people of communities to tocqueville did a great job of looking at how america was so special especially unique by having civil society um where you had local connective tissue where people just kind of helped each other yeah where people because we we respected people having more control over their lives and their communities could do more with each other and that that that civil society made people better people because they helped each other volitionally voluntarily by choice and so um going into tax credit policy and all of these things all of these policies that that have proven to be effective i think do they capture this dynamic which is they enable people to be to to make better lives for themselves to help each other to rise and to and to rise the income scale to pursue this beautiful notion of opera mobility where you can be better off than your parents and your kids can be better off than you um that's a great idea in this country so we can go through the litany of different proposals i think what we've had in the poverty space this is this is one of the things that i sort of matured through the system as i looked at this it's important to know for the audience you traveled around the country just really searching for solutions it's you're not this isn't some think tank ivory tower commentary you you really were on the ground for many many years this is this is your passion it's important to note that yeah my mentor was jack kemp so i spent some time as a young guy staffer you know going through you know uh public housing places like cabrini green robert taylor homes in chicago and and sort of seeing how the the poverty industrial complex and the war on poverty actually backfired in so many amazing ways in a bad way and so i spent years running around the country mostly with my friend bob woodson um learning about poverty seeing poverty exploring poverty getting out of janesville wisconsin and kenosha wisconsin you know where i'm from and learning about poverty in poor rural areas and poor inner cities and and did this for a number of years to just educate myself to try and understand this issue better to come up with better solutions is the different types of poverty something that strikes you one of the you know i saw a bloomberg study and i know it's bloomberg but like they do have sometimes good studies and uh yeah this one has just what it really got down to was the many many different types of poverty because there's intergenerational poverty right there's poverty because you're a one-parent household there's poverty because there's mental illness and you know how do we construct policy based on the many different facets of poverty uh and you know i tend to think as a conservative probably agree that like the simple solutions for complex problems are generally the best but you know how does that inform your thinking and what did you yeah i do agree with that i i so i there are different kinds of poverty mostly you know there's situational poverty there's momentary poverty i focus on intergenerational poverty the most stubborn form of poverty okay which is which is poverty in areas that have only known poverty for many generations it's passed on from generation to the next and in a lot of the problem there is basically bad government policies um so what i learned in my career as a policy maker both in in washington and policy fights but also just touring the country studying poverty is we were measuring it the wrong way number one um when i was head of the budget committee i did a year-long study on commemorating the 30th anniversary of the war on poverty and and i wanted to learn okay so we've just spent about 15 trillion dollars on a lot of different programs what are we getting for it is it working it took us a year literally to get up get a taxonomy of all that the federal government does so i had my entire budget committee staff and congressional budget office and general accountability office spend a year studying all that the federal government does on poverty there was no listing of this there was no accounting of this so we basically did that basically concluded right now rounding to current numbers we spend about a trillion dollars a year uh on anti-poverty efforts and programs for the federal government on just a little less than 100 programs wow um and we never measured success based on results or outcomes we measured success based on input and effort how much money are we spending how many programs do we have how many people are on those programs so it was all effort-based measurement and we never studied evidence based on is it working are we getting people out of poverty are we breaking the cycle of multi-generational poverty those questions weren't even asked and so what we tried to do is switch the debate to a results-oriented debate and as i got into this fight i found myself into a bunch of ideological clashes and when you have ideological clashes left versus right unless you totally control washington you know 60 votes in the senate a hardcore majority in the house and a president of your own party which almost never happens you're just going to have a big stalemate and so we had lots of stalemates we we got welfare reform in the mid 90s i was a staff guy i worked on the issue at the time um and and every now and then we would get a victory opportunity zones welfare reform here and there but we basically had stalemates i basically decided let's go use the field of economics which is something i've spent my career in and see if we can get past the stalemates to something a little more antiseptic and um a little less ideological which is let's just use the field of economics so i wrote a law called the evidence act which is literally the last thing i did when i was speaking of the house i passed in the lame duck session of 2018 trump signed it in 2019. my co-author was patty murray a friend of mine who i normally disagree with on almost everything who i just know real well uh she was you know she's a liberal senator from washington and the evidence act basically takes the approach of let's use the field of economics to study outcomes um to see whether or not it works or not and there are one or two programs that the federal government now has that are evidence-based policy programs this evidence act i think will give us a whole new field of social science in government and out of government where we actually measure whether or not these poverty programs work or not do they achieve their stated goals of getting people out of poverty and then we can leapfrog the ideological stalemate of you know dependency versus independence and all of these things what when could we expect a report on that that we in congress could use as a yeah so so you need to write hurt on omb omb and that's this is like when mick mulvaney and russ vote were running the place those guys were doing a good job of helping make sure um it's the law gets executed but but it was just literally at the end of this last administration so now we need with this current administration on b to keep pushing this through and and by all uh measurements they're doing that so we now have access we society academics universities in the government to this raw data on the effectiveness of poverty programs that we have to push through so we can actually measure the effectiveness of these of these programs and what we do at notre dame is we also run randomized control trials through to our notre dame economics department on poverty programs um to see does it work or not at the end of the debate here i believe i'm confident i'm a confident conservative i believe our principles work i believe thrift i believe work i believe incentives intact families all those things work to get people out of poverty if you have your high school diploma if you have you know parents staying together raising their kids statistically that helps keep you out of poverty so i'm a person who believes let's just let's just submit these programs to a raw clinical analysis economically rigorous analysis and i think it will validate our principles and that will make it easier for us to sort of you know have policy fights that are settled by data and evidence versus ideology and partisanship and i think we'll start moving the needle on poverty what it invariably means is you can't lose the secret sauce of local control of federalism of incentives of personal responsibility and all the things that come with that and so our goal and hope and this is what we do at my foundation what we study and teach at notre dame and it's what the evidence act ultimately hopes to achieve is that we start measuring success in the war on poverty based on outcome and results not based on input and dollars spent so that we can actually transition dollars from ineffective wasteful programs that are counterproductive to efforts that actually get people up and out of poverty and we start breaking the cycle of poverty going by going at root causes of poverty and that's the whole goal of all this and also too complex so when you've got 90 plus programs i mean like there's a lot of potential problems the way the program is designed the benefit cliffs the but uh the how the programs interact misaligned incentives but complexity my god you know you're in poverty and you've got to navigate this system i don't understand how on earth you would do it look i'm not an expert on this like you are but generally what i say about this is look it's let's simplify the hell out of this why do we have 90 different programs look if you if you are in poverty and we have ways of measuring that just use the earned income tax credit and we we can expand that if possible why do you have different programs for housing for health care for for food i mean it's it's hell to nab it's already hell being in poverty so why do we add to that hell by making it so complex and i'm like i always have to health care is my or my specialty so i talk about it in terms of this i'm like why are we subsidizing insurance companies or institutions when we should be subsidizing the patient like we believe everybody needs health care okay it's not technically a right the way the left says it is but forget it that's just splitting hairs on on vernacular you know let's but what we do agree on we want everybody to have it i do agree with that just like i agree with the fact that i think everybody should have access to food okay but we don't we don't say go to the grocery store pick out what you want right don't know the price go through the cashier and that cashier just bills the government that would be crazy right we give you a voucher we empower you the customer and you go buy food for yourself why is it why is health care any different health savings accounts would be uh the first step to that i don't want to go down that rabbit hole because i have no i'm such a limited i know i just such a such limited time with you hsh was my amendment to the o3 medicare bill so i wrote the agency law as an amendment to the 03 medicare bill so i spent many years on that particular topic um including writing that um but but it's the same concept effectively uh that you that you use in hsa so again as the guy who wrote the hsa law or is the guy who wrote this evidence act they all flow from the same principles uh which we were talking about before which is upper mobility you know natural rights being in control of your life and running government through the person running running support through the individual not in a top-down way through a collectivist kind of a scheme that treats everybody the same to your point uh this is something i'm working on aei which is without getting ahead of you know where we're going with this thing i believe you can collapse the poverty programs um into a radically simplified version of what they are that is so much more easy to navigate for an individual and do it in such a way that that is designed in the right way so that it's not complex that it doesn't have benefit cliffs that tell you don't keep advancing in life um that's what benefit cliffs do they actually make it harder to rise and incentivize the right kind of behavior like thrift saving personal responsibility work family formation things like that and there are tools in front of us like the eitc and the ctc i think that could be used to do that we can wrap them around that give it give the audience a quick like 30 second uh lesson on eitc and and the pitch for opportunity zones and again with such limited time then i want to move to a talk of of politics in congress and you're in your experience on that last few minutes best idea that there is in fighting poverty that exists today is the earned income tax credit it's milton friedman actually designed the idea he called it a negative income tax at the time and so it basically says it pays to work the earned income tax credit means you get a tax credit for working so it layers on top of of your paycheck now it's got to be improved in its design because it's a lump sum at the end of the year it should actually be embedded in your paycheck so it shows that work really does pay that is the best way to get over these benefit cliffs which is as you rise the income scale you lose certain benefits and sometimes taking two steps forward in earning an income you can you can take three steps back by losing benefits the eipc is is one of the better things that we have to help get over that that hump so the eit and the child tax credit just helps families who have children you know pay for the fact that you have children and then there's extra costs involved so that you can help with family formation um we have demographic issues we need to address meaning you know we don't want to be like japan and you know and europe where we have where we're cutting ourselves in half every generation with a 1.2 birth rate we want to be able to you know produce you know a good birth rate that keeps a dynamic growing society so we can go down those rabbit holes the point of it all is is i believe that there are new techniques to fighting poverty that give us um better tools that encompass our principles that make good on the american idea and i really do believe with technology with the digital money uh programmable money with with the kinds of technologies that are out there now we can design a safety net a poverty safety net that truly helps people rise and make the best choices in their life and become the best versions of themselves and not have um a a cohort of dependency right we don't want to trap people in poverty right now what the left is basically saying is you're stuck in your current station in life and we'll just give you some more government to help you cope with it yeah republicans are evil they don't want to give you more money yeah that is what that is what that left is proposing what we believe is in this country we want to give you the the best chance at the best life you can have for yourself and give you an equality of opportunity so you can make the most of your life and that's the tool we want to equip you with so that you can stand on your own two feet and be proud of what you can achieve and and and have a life where your kids can even do even greater than you did that's the whole american idea in a nutshell and we can do better policies i think with technology and economics that we have never seen before to kind of accomplish this goal and i think it's a great message for 2022 like there's a lot of sections of policy that we need to just take offense on healthcare environment anti-poverty it's it's not a bad message right we want to simplify the program so it's already hell being imposed i've already made up the lines in my head it's already hell being in poverty but shouldn't be hell navigating the system and republicans want to help you rise out of poverty not survive in it that's right and that's exactly what democrats want they want you to survive in poverty and they call that compassion no no i want you to rise out of it all right but for us to win in 2022 we got to get our together okay excuse my french but it is my podcast i can say whatever i want so um unless i get censored by the speaker because it's my official podcast whatever let's move on for not swearing everybody would give me a hard time in leadership because i just don't i don't it doesn't yeah you just it wouldn't matter it wouldn't work with you it would not it wouldn't come out right you're just too nice um but uh okay look we gotta get our  together um there's divisions in the party i don't think they're quite as bad as the media likes to say they are but but it's not nothing and um you've got like the let's call it the chaining wing on one side and you and you got all the others on the others a lot on the other side um i i find it all to be melodramatic and theatrical and um and i make that point quite often but it's important to note for people and i've talked about this often what are the different types of members of congress and how do you navigate that as speaker of the house it's hurting cats it's got to be it is a job i will never watch i will never run for speaker thousands i never wanted it either um it's not it's not so the job found me i didn't look for the job uh there are two past people taking congress there's the policy path and there's the leadership path which is more of a political thing i chose the policy path i wanted to be chair of the budget committee then i wanted to be chair of the waste and means committee those are the goals i set for myself i achieved those goals i was happy as a clan as chairman of the ways and means committee when um john boehner kind of went down left then kevin didn't have the votes to become speaker and then it kind of came to me um and if i didn't do the job we were basically going to implode as a majority because no one else had the votes so i i did it under those circumstances which was not meaning i wasn't looking for it uh i i did it under two conditions we have an agenda that we that we've assembled together that we believe in that we run on so we run an election that is a choice election not a referendum a choice election so that if we win then the policies we we we ran on we've earned the moral authority to execute those policies we called it the better way um and number two i just want to be home on weekends because of my kids and uh that proved to be harder as time went on because only the speaker can raise the kind of money you need to raise yeah for your majority and your team and so i i ended up just the job conflicted with the family just too much at the end of the day and what's interesting is i believe it's the free i could be wrong on this i wasn't around but i i thought it was the freedom caucus that said no we want paul ryan in there yeah that's right right because because you you've always been a hardcore is about the right word but a very principled conservative on these issues and things that freedom caucus certainly cares about what's interesting though is i think fundamentally the freedom caucus is actually anti-establishment this is this this became more apparent to me as as as i've as i've you know and i have friends i think it's not it's up i'm not saying it's bad it just is that that's that's mostly what they believe and we got to this point on the right and this is what's screwing us is this kind of visceral reaction without defining it against the establishment against the rhinos yeah now i always make fun of people i'm like oh you're gonna go rhino hunting get your get your rhino gun out get him out those rhinos whatever you know i don't use the term i never campaigned on it because it's stupid and it's causing serious divisions and you talk about the difference in in congress between policy makers and entertainers so talk to us about that yeah so um i think they're people who focus more on temperament and tactics than on you know actual you know policies and principles um there are two qualities every politician more or less has inside of themselves um they want to be somebody and they want to do something a beer versus a doer each person in politics has more of one than the other and the person who comes to congress because they want to be somebody be famous be a congressman be on tv be a senator b or whatever that's that's that's the person that is coming in what i call the entertainment wing of the party the entertainment wing of the party is a newer wing of the party and what i mean when i say that is in the old days like 10 years ago if you wanted to succeed in politics especially at the national level and like in congress you had to scale a meritocracy and the meritocracy you scaled like i said this is this is how i rose because it was how anyone rose you to prove yourself and we measured success by you know persuasion and innovation could you create good innovative policies that solve problems and could you persuade people these are the best policies your constituents your colleagues your country my budgets were a good example of those in the early 2000s that i wrote um and and then that was how you rose and you had to put a lot of time in i mean i did 10 terms in the house so you know i didn't get i became speaker in my what my eighth term so uh and it's because i rose the sort of meritocracy uh leg but because of decentralized information because of digital platforms you know facebook instagram twitter cable talk radio you name it there are rows an entertainment wing of the party where people realize oh i don't have to put in decades or years scaling the meritocracy i can just be really good on tv i can give barn burner speeches be awesome on twitter and on facebook and have really good followers and entertain and i can leapfrog the entire meritocracy and i can become famous real fast and that fame gets me power it gets me the ability to raise money online it gives me gives me exposure so i can leapfrog these guys who are policymakers and be a player right away i mean the ultimate entertainer donald trump got the nomination in 2016 and he beat ted cruz who came in second for for the nomination and ted was it was in congress like two years before he did that so what i'm saying is that there is a new um dynamic an incentive structure that says you can entertain your way faster to the top of the field than work your way through through a meritocracy and and the entertainment wing basically measures its success by provocation and entertainment can you provoke and can you entertain yeah and invariably that's going to require you to eschew and prevent common ground compromise to do the kind of legislating the founders envisioned when they built the system the separation of powers the bicameral legislature all of those things were designed to bring people together to reach consensus to govern as a country if your goal is to win and scale the entertainment wing of either party both parties have entertainment wings because we now hang out in our informational cul-de-sacs you know we we are we are refor enforcing our bias because of where we choose to get our information that's just how society works these days then you have to be against compromise you have to call a less perfect conservative a rhino you have to do those things and more importantly it is based on it is based on basically um not policies or principles but based on tactics and temperaments it is based on populism populism what worries me is untethered principles and so it basically is a temperamental thing which is i'm going to scale the entertainment wing by being more populist than the next person and i have to go against um you know watering myself down compromising um pushing certain you know conservative policies that may not be popular look i gotta tell you taking on um the entitlement programs medicare medicaid i i authored all the social security reform bills in the early 2000s those weren't popular and so i still feel they were necessary though if we're going to escape a debt crisis you know so populism populism is telling people what they want to hear not the truth that's what i firmly believe populism is i don't know why it's gained popularity as just as a word as a term in our party it shouldn't right that's how you get to two thousand dollar checks for everybody uh even if they've never lost their job i know that we are right up against your your next thing so unless you're willing to give me another 30 minutes uh because i can talk your ear off forever um i really i really appreciate this paul you bet dan nice to see you yeah time went by fast i noticed that yeah yeah yeah well hey you were on a roll that's i was like yeah i don't want to stop you but i don't want to screw up your schedule um i i might add a lot to what you just said for the audience uh but i know you've got to go all right man good to be with you really appreciate it appreciate your service speaker paul ryan thank you thank you see you so speaker speaker ryan had to go but um worth got i said a lot of good things there and i want to expand upon it a little bit um and my thoughts on this you probably heard them before but it strikes me that they're that's completely right there's policy makers there's legislators there's statesmen these boring guys who they're not born they're cool but they're uh but they know their policy and they're helpful to us they're what we want up there they're not exciting they don't tweet and it's very easy for a lot in our base to say oh they're not fighters they're not doing anything for us maybe they're not doing anything for you they're writing the policy that you say you believe in meanwhile we do have people who are pure entertainers now look i jump out of freaking airplanes for for ads like obviously i i fall into that wing i'm not i'm self-aware here but there's the problem becomes when that's the only thing you do if you're a fan of this podcast you know i also dive pretty deep into every single policy issue every single one um that's what we need i think that's the the the path to success in the future learning what fighting is right is fighting running around the halls of congress screaming at your colleagues no that's just being a child fighting means persuading as as paul just said he's you've got to understand the legislation be creative with it be innovative and persuade people with it that's that's fighting that's what we have to do that's what we have failed oh we haven't failed i mean look we're on the verge of failing because of this inner conflict in our in our party it's so important to realize that and it's so important to understand what that entertainment wing that paul's talking about is really doing they're very self-serving um they use that sort of that sort of resentment politics the purity politics the i'm fighting against the establishment for you what the hell does that mean they use it to raise money they know that people will donate to it and it's completely self-serving and they when i say they could be politicians could be people uh influencers on social media uh could be pundits as well it's it's all the same the incentive structure is the same and here's the worst part oftentimes they become stronger personally if we're losing as a movement there's an incentive to lose i'm not saying they all fall into this category but there seems to me to be an incentive to lose for some of the more extreme on at this on this wing so the way to the future is having the best of both worlds you can't totally exclude this this this new age of entertainment and politics again i i i i kind of created a lot of it like i'm kind of a pioneer in it um not kind of i mean oh i'm going to give myself some credit i think i am i have this podcast we do crazy videos i mean we have a lot of fun with what we do but that's all for not if we're not adding substance to it if we're not adding sophistication to it it is so important so important to remember and it's important to remember do not do not reward the bad behavior the the manufactured divisions that are occurring right now by some of these people both the entertainment side and you know on the other side the ones they attack and it's it's all bad it's all wrong we need to get our heads straight and we're going to win as a result that's all folks thanks

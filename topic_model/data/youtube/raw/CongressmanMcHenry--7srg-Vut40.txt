Thank You chair Yellen I'm so does the Federal Reserve have the legal authority to implement negative rates I'm sure do we have the legal authority to implement negative rates so this is a matter that the federal open market committee considered around 2010 and we didn't fully as we were exploring our options to provide accommodation we decided not to lower interest rates either ioer 20 we're into negative territory and we didn't fully look at the legal issues around that i would say that remains a question that we still would need to investigate more thoroughly and one of our document requests that 2010 memo that I assume was connected to that policy freshman that's right raised significant doubts about the feds authority that they currently have to charge to pay interest on excessive excess reserves so and whether or not that same authority would allow you to demand payment for that dotar so I I don't know of any doing that with that memo indicated was intended to indicate that the legal issues had not been seriously considered have they been time that wins at the FOMC they've been seriously considered since 2010 well in the spirit of prudent planning we always try to look at what options we would have available to us either if we need to tighten policy more rapidly than we expect or the opposite to loosen policy jus so we would take a look at it but the legal issues I am not prepared to tell you have been three really examined at this point so at this point it's unclear whether or not the Fed does have legal authority to implement negative rates I am not aware of any anything that would prevent us from doing it but I'm saying that we have not fully investigated the legal issues that would read that still needs to be done so let's move to regulation right a significant part you you run the largest regulatory organization in the United States of America perhaps in the globe likely in the globe and as such you know I believe in the independence of the Fed to make monetary policy but as a regulator Congress should have significant oversight of your regulatory action should they not yes okay and as such as a matter of regulation the Chairman raised this question with you the last time you were here about Federal Reserve regulators bank examiners demanding to be a part of board of director meetings at member banks and you've exchanged multiple letters on this matter we still hear that this is in fact taking place would you pledge to this committee that you would direct your bank examiners and regional bank examiners to stop this practice well I will I will look into what you've already looked into it you've exchanged letters and you gave the Chairman insurance last time you're not aware of it I assume you're now aware of whether or not this is taking place are you know I think there are occasional situations in which that occurs I believe that's appropriate i'm i'm not i'm not certain that it is inappropriate i want to get back to you on that okay well this was raised about six months ago by the Chairman you've exchanged multiple letters I'd like to have some greater assurance this is not meant to be a gotcha this is a well-worn question and we're we are hearing and in fact there's a press report that the Fed directed one of your member banks to incorporate two additional members of their board of directors and the Fed directing a private enterprise to change their Board of Directors seemed somewhat perplexing do you believe that's appropriate authority for the feds well I think it is appropriate as a matter of supervision to to direct and shoot ensure that a board of directors of a financial company that we supervise is appropriately constituted and fulfilling its corporate governance functions that is a part of supervision at x bar finally the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from New York mrs.

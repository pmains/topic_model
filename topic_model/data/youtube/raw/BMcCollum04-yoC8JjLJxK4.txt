I rise in opposition to this legislation a misguided bill that ignores the urgent needs of the American people the federal government's fiscal year started October 1st 2017 a hundred and twenty eight days ago instead of using that time to get their work done Republicans have focused solely on partisan politics when it comes to the essential responsibilities of funding the federal government Republicans can't be bothered now we are asked today to vote for a bill that funds the Pentagon for the rest of the year while funding our schools and our hospitals for just 43 days mr. speaker our national security begins at home with investments in the future that keeps our families and our communities safe strong and moving forward in this bill ignores those needs it provides no certainty for our law enforcement professionals no long-term funding for each urgent repairs to our crumbling infrastructure no confidence for investments in life-saving medical research and it doesn't even provide a full year funding for the veteran's health care while it's encouraging that Republicans are finally reauthorizing vital health care programs like our community health care centers paying for these programs with cuts to the CDC prevention public health fund which is currently providing life-saving vaccines in this severe flu season is the height of your responsibility discord and delay that's no way to run a government but under Republican control that's exactly what we're getting mr. speaker unlike the president I do not want a government shutdown we need a budget agreement that keeps our government open protects our national security and meets our commitments to hard-working families so let's stop playing games and get to our work and get to it now

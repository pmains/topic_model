thanks for joining us i'm jennifer franco the house oversight committee holds a hearing on equal pay for men and women joining me now to discuss the hearing and other headlines of south carolina congresswoman nancy mace hi congresswoman thanks for joining us good afternoon and thank you for having me so you pressed world cup champion megan repino and house democrats for their representation of equal pay um you're arguing compensation should be based on work and not gender so i just want to play a clip from that hearing on what you said for our viewers to see and then and then we can discuss so once adjusted for factors such as hours worked and compensation packages family and marital status the gender wage gap i believe is significantly smaller than what we're talking about today and in most cases when you look at the data you look at contacts we're talking at context we're talking about between two and ten percent so i'm not saying there's no gender wage gap i'm not saying uh it's statistically unlikely women earn less than men i'm just saying that it's not because of widespread discrimination okay so rapino is suing u.s soccer for gender discrimination she's still in court fights to be equal to men's soccer so explain your position on the matter for us right and it's like what's ironic there too is that the women's soccer team earns more per game than than the men do and we had that discussion also in that debate this morning but but two people who have the same education working the same job the same skills should have the same pay regardless of their gender and democrats when they talk about this issue and this massive discrimination that they claim they don't look at all the data and they don't take all of it into context and context is really important because as women many of us many work full-time but some work part-time some work in the home there's context that is missing from that data and i do believe that the wage gap is far smaller than what they're claiming to be and i think that's a really important distinction that we deal in facts all right and aside from from that legislation and that fight happening we're also seeing democrats pushing a pair of gun reform bills which have support from the white house now one of them targets the so-called charleston loophole which of course is named after the massacre of nine black church-goers in your state in 2015. so democrats want to change it so if essentially if somebody is trying to buy a gun they would have to clear a background check in the three days that the fbi has to investigate it otherwise they could get denied so do you think that this would help curb gun violence like the democrats are saying it would it wouldn't and the events of mother emanuel that happened five and a half years ago were horrific and heartbreaking like the violence that we saw unfold in boulder colorado and last week atlanta these are horrific events and we often times see the left we see democrats never letting a good crisis go to waste and their these pieces of legislation do not solve the problem and would never have printed prevented oftentimes this violence from actually occurring and it goes back to my to my theory that we've got a deal on facts and not fiction when dealing about these issues and we're only learning now that this case on on monday in boulder colorado that there may potentially have been ma major health mental health issues going on here and so the other thing that we're learning too is the fbi might have been aware of this individual and so when you when you peel back the onion and you look at the actual root cause of the violence oftentimes mental health issues arise but also information on criminals is not in one place for the fbi always to do a quick background check this is 2021 our information when you're doing a background check shouldn't take three five days or even a month i mean this should be done within a few minutes if all of our information was in one place and so i want to get to the heart of the problem i want to solve the problem without violating the rights the second amendment rights of law abiding citizen our republicans working on any sort of counter to that to address what you just mentioned um this is an issue that i actually have worked on at the state level i learned after mother emanuel after parkland florida that many states information whether that's their state law enforcement division their courts their state uh state trooper databases none of that information is actually shared with other agencies freely willingly or quickly at the federal level i have co-sponsored legislation with my colleague out of myrtle beach congressman tom rice to allow when you're doing a background check right now you can't even use the internet or email you can only fax again this we need to update our communication systems and allow the fbi to do their job right and do it in a quick manner right time is always of the essence when you're discussing these sort of things um and i want to shift gears senators held a hearing earlier on sweeping election reform legislation that passed in the house the democrats are arguing that these changes are needed to make sure that voting is easy and accessible to to those who qualify but then we're also hearing from republicans say that it's right for fraud so what specifically in the bill concerns you that maybe democrats aren't being transparent about how the the changes would actually impact voting in actuality and not just in text right well and many states and states actually um they determine their election law not the federal government it's actually unconstitutional to federalize the election process at the state federal or local or local level um this particular issue that we're talking about with democrats and i'm seeing it today there's a there's a significant hypocrisy speaker pelosi right now this week even is trying to overturn the results of a legally certified duly elected member marionette miller meeks they are seeking to decide this election in washington with politicians in dc rather than the voters of iowa and um you know this particular issue if this goes through this gets rammed through it's going to change elections in our country forever and that was not the purpose of it the states actually have the ability to determine how their elections are handled now one thing i do want to mention you take voter id for exam for example democrats want to eliminate voter id i mean they want to make it um easier you know easier to vote than buy a pack of cigarettes in this country and that's just wrong right and i've heard a lot of republicans share those concerns and compared to other countries where they're saying you know it's not necessarily a bad thing to ask for for you know credentials to for people to verify their identity and they're saying that it actually does not disenfranchise people democrats are still arguing that it does what's your response to that look if you got to show an idea to buy a beer you should have to show an id to vote the other thing that they're talking about too is is mass mail-in balloting we saw this election cycle mass mail and ballots being sent to voters in other states that were registered in another state and they were actually registered in two states and so when you when you have that that is a there is propensity for voter fraud more propensity for voter fraud with mass mail and ballots and in-person voting with an id if you're doing mass mail and balloting there should be a witness signature to that as well and that you should be able to match those signatures and so we've got to make sure that congress understands the role of the federal government what it what its role is and is not and determining how elections are handled like the state of south carolina i don't want california determining how we vote we did a really good job in november to make sure we get free and fair elections and i want to make sure the federal government doesn't impede that all right south carolina representative nancy mace taking the time to speak with us today thank you so much we appreciate it thank you for having me

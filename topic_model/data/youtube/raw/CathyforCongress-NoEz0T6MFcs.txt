I just wanted to take my family on vacation So they denied his passport until I could provide a better picture So I wasn't sure exactly what kind of better picture they wanted because he did exactly what he was instructed to do The first one said he had an exaggerated expression and the second letter said that he wasn't focused on the camera he doesn't follow Guidelines as far as exaggerations, you know He has a hard time even interpreting other people's expressions and if you try to make him make a certain expression he cannot mimic that I I told them the story they faxed over or emailed a form that I could fax back to him sent that back to him Explaining what the problem was and within two hours I had to call back saying it's handled So yeah something that took me three weeks and I was spinning my wheels getting nowhere I got back got the response that I needed within hours. Surprised? Yeah. Never occurred to me to call there   I don't understand why nobody could acknowledge either one of my letters explaining his disability I just think that they were wonderful the way they handle it It was just fabulous that we were able to not worry about it anymore and have it I had it in my hand less than a week later and now you can go on vacation? Yeah. Yeah, we can go on vacation and not stress about that Cathy represents and helps me.

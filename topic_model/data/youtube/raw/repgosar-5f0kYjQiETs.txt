and now from the rooftop of the Rockies its backbone radio with Krista Kieffer and welcome back to backbone radio med gun and krista caper really honored to be able to be with you this evening as we reach across Colorado 7:10 can us of course 1460 kzn T down south out of Colorado Springs and tell you great pleasure to introduce our next guests into the program a congressman from northern Arizona from the fourth District it is a dr. Paul Gosar and like myself he and I have a few things in common he is a dentist and he's practiced dentistry if I recall for 20-plus years down in Arizona representative Gosar he's really from Rock Springs Wyoming so he's not too far from actually here where we are speaking from and he came into office in 2010 he won the election the new york times branded him a tea party candidate because he took on the incumbent Democrat and kirkpatrick and it was a very divided very challenging primary that he went through in the republican party to get that nomination Paul Gosar was successful then he went on to defeat the incumbent and became a congressman from northern Arizona and just been following his progress very proud of what he's been up to at in Washington DC without further ado Paul Gosar welcome to our program well you bet and as I said great to have a dentist out there Washington DC and I might just have you Coloradans might not know who you are but if you could just you know tell us a little bit about who you are and and what you're up to out there Washington DC absolutely and you said earlier I was born and raised in western Wyoming and the first of ten kids overachieving family you know a number of Democrats and Republicans were divided family so you know we get different perspectives across the board but I went to school at Creighton University in Omaha Nebraska I got my dental school there as well and then moved out there is ona where I practice dentistry for 25 years and was very involved in dentistry in regards to my State Society in national politics and regards to a patient-centered patient for any type of health care and accountable care on that so when I ran that I was actually asked to run by my patients because they liked some of the things I stood for and some of the things that I was able to do by listening to people something that a healthcare provider brings to the table and incorporate those visions and ideas into a cohesive idea so you're a big fan of Obamacare as a medical professional I'm guessing absolutely my patients weren't real happy with Obamacare and if you think the honest with ya Krista is I wasn't happy with what I had before and I didn't have to like what I saw here you know I've been one that looks at a competitive model very patient final patient family patient-centered I wanted to see the break up of the monopoly of insurance industry I wanted to see and to be able to compare apples to apples when you purchase an insurance plan and then that you were entitled to those benefits that you actually purchased so on a very different individual when it comes to healthcare but I want accountability and it means we got to get back to the building blocks of what made our healthcare system great well it's such a great asset to America to have somebody in there to have leaders in there who do know a thing or two about healthcare and there are a few of you but only a scant few I think most people actually went to law school route to Washington DC but I might ask you yeah you know Congressman Paul Gosar President Obama did a kind of a spike the football sort of a triumph dance this week when he talked about the 7.1 million people that have signed up for Obamacare and he says that the the debate is over on whether or not Obamacare is to be ended he says it's here to stay it's gonna be the law of the land so take that how do you respond to President Obama's taunting so to speak well you know yes you have to take the president his word that there were 7 point 1 million signups you know we've never been able to see the data that's problematic we also have to start functioning and start looking at the data very carefully that as you understand you know statistics you can you can play statistics whatever you want with it with an unaided eye you know those are almost 8 million people they or that lost their healthcare and so a number of those followed the letter of the law to refine up so a lot of those individuals also went into the Medicaid expansion so there's a there's a lot to be done here and particularly you look at those the problems you know with the future bailouts for the insurance industry you know Humana is going to be asking for 450 million dollars that's probably a success story when you're starting to look at applications and buying of insurance you know there's a lot simpler ideas here and and we've just hit one going crossroads of of what the president thinks was success there's got a lot more problems coming around the corner it's write that over and over again we're already in the death spiral of this case and my worry is that he's going to move us into the do a single-payer plan and that just that just totally odd for or odd for somebody like me this patient-centered patient friendly I did go by well I can honestly say having just experienced nationalized health care with a friend out in England that it is anything but patient-centered it is very much bureaucracy centered as you know the only way we can really make any headway against this horrible act obamacare is to recapture the Senate and hopefully at some point the White House are you feeling it all optimistic about the next election I am you know I don't want to play timid either I want to be play bold because if you see this this administration they have been absolutely lawless in their application both of the Constitution and to inquiries into to the rule of law you know Eric Holder the Attorney General United States has done the bidding for this president and it it's outright defiance to the Constitution and I think that if we have a dialogue you know when we were talking about Obamacare a dialogue with the American people I have been one of the alternatives and and that's misnomer the people have been told by the media that the Republicans are not offering something and we are we've actually helped pan it what we want to do is utilize it as a starting point Krista though you know health care provider for 25 years and then what you do when you're trying to solve a problem as net well tell you as you sit by the patient you listen to the symptoms you find out what's wrong and you try to engage that patient to find out what that diagnosis is so you engage in America into rebuilding this healthcare system the president has called me the party of Nell being a Republican I am the party of now I can o W it so I do understand what I'm doing here and there's a methodical aspect of rebuilding the system and you know we're hardly going through the process in a proper fashion and the only reason that we're at this playing time is that this administration has been lawless in their applications they've sidestepped Congress and it's and its rightful jurisdiction and to be a co-author a legislation you could be more right about the administration I think for them the Constitution and laws just sort of guidelines that one may or may not use in administering the law I I think that the lawlessness is borderline impeachable it is it's it is disgusting from a rule of law standpoint that we've got rulers that put themselves above the law in terms of this new bill though I've read about it a little bit why don't you tell our listeners what it would do is make it patient friendly patient-centered and make sure that everybody competes that means doctors hospitals insurance companies all competing for the patient reanimating what health care and insurance can be so one of the things that I put in is it breaks up what they called insurance monopolies it's called mccarran-ferguson and what it does is has the federal government break it up and make sure the insurance compact companies compete with each other for your dollar it also puts tort reform into this into the bill so that we have some compliance based upon state law and it embraces state law states rights found was a was a a tort and a health care issue and so we want to return that and we want to incentivize states to actually get to that point and if they don't have one then we backed off with the Federal Tort Claims Act we also look at redefining public health because it's been part of the problem and then last not least as we start building a high-risk pools in which an we start to incentivize best management practices at a number of states were showing some incredible applications to and this would also individuals to put away $7,500 per year pre-tax dollars like businesses they should be treated just like the same and it was roll over and and families much more over $20,000 and this is just a starting point Krista that we initiated we want to see the American public what they want to come up with and and incorporate their ideals and so I don't want to pass anything without going through the full committee hearings I want to talk to America I'll engage them well how do you see this Congressman Paul Gauhar how do you see Gosar how do you see this playing out politically is we about 90 seconds in this segment how do you see this playing out heading into November 2014 politically you know the president has has initiated is only that what he'll call is the first step by trying to avoid the catastrophic results of what he's actually instigated what we have to do is we have to engage America that there's something better America has always been dreamers but what we've asked I also have to do is reward people with trust and you know they don't trust Republicans they don't trust Democrats and so we want to engage them in that aspect then we also have to hold do the rule of law and I've been one of those people that has been calling for a vote of no-confidence in Eric Holder that's my resolution and make sure the president says you know it's time for him to go and and it is an impeachable defense something that we can make sure that this attorney general who's defied the rule of law over and over and over again goes by the wayside before this election cycle well I'll tell you we're talking with Congressman Paul Gosar of northern Arizona represents the fourth District he's been in Congress for coming up on about four years now he was the teak Tea Party candidate he got in and around 2010 and remember that Tea Party wave well this is one of the fruits of that and I'd like to see another wave 2014 Paul Gosar it's certainly worthy of your support look him up when you can when we come back we're gonna talk about some other things that Paul Gosar is up to including the no welfare for we DAP after this

not selling to fact on radio with Matt and krysta [Music] you do all right Congressman Paul Gosar one of the great ones out there rising star he's from northern Arizona he's practiced dentistry for 25 years which when I look at somebody's resume and I see that I think that is just awesome I heard a drill in the back of my mind but now regarding say budgetary issues what we might call the waste fraud and abuse that might go on and Washington DC President Obama has been pretty much on record as saying that there is no room for more cuts anywhere in the budget anywhere you just can't cut anything in Washington DC and he is he's look these tried he just can't do it can't find it I've no Congressman Paul Gosar do you agree with that sentiment or if you found maybe some avenues where things could be cut or made more efficient oh absolutely Matt give you a quick example you know the Government Accountability Office audits different agency defendants in 2012 they audited I think 2010 they audited certain industries that are agencies within the federal government and one of them is davis-bacon and this is a prevailing wage it's the average increase of 22 percent over all government contracts so certain unions to have those contracts what they found is in those calculations that they were a hundred percent fraudulent by the Department of Labor and wages and what we discovered is is that if it was done by somebody else we could save tens of billions of dollars a year even as much as a hundred billions of dollars a year when you start in court including Homeland Security and Department of the defense and it's all about you to calculate it so if we were to move it to the Bureau statistics for calculation we could save that and what I'm proposing is is just to leave it into those accounts allow more people to get more more projects done everybody that says that's a useful aspect for the federal government for infrastructure product while people go to work more tax revenues so it actually generates money I'm always stunned by how many projects are wasteful or fraudulent I know that Senator Tom Coburn puts out a list that just represents a handful of these things but in his in his reports always you know dozens of goofy research projects absurd programs and so forth and I feel sort of despair as a taxpayer what is Congress doing I think your bill sounds like a great idea but is there under this president is there any possibility that as a taxpayer we will see I know a balanced budget is too much to ask but at least a curtailing of some of these programs I think once again it's getting the right people into Congress that have a spine that had come from the private working sector that they're not book smart and and street stupid you know you want to make sure that application you know they signed the back side of a paycheck on both sides of that paycheck there's opportunity but but America's willing and walking somebody to stand up they want their freedoms and but what they want to do is they they want somebody to stand up and be counted and I think that comes back with a rule of law and I think that comes back with some you know getting the defendant in the house and start pushing people and it all comes back to what I think the tea party stands for and that is accountability you need to bring bringing the people we elect back to come from Congress and the Senate governors and our state law officials and hold them accountable for their actions in the house well you know one thing that does affect color ads in particular is the marijuana issues and in fact as we know everyone in the world knows Colorado was the poster child for legalizing marijuana I believe Washington has followed suit they were a couple months behind us so we have the honor here in Colorado but you may be a co-sponsor of a bill that is the working title is no welfare for weed just curious how could you describe that to us out here in Colorado actually it is my bill congressman Gosar yeah so when you start looking at our snap program which is our food stamps and our temporary assistance you know 50% is administrative just for those so for every dollar you put into these programs 50% goes to the bureaucracy before it even gets to the people and then you add 13 to 17 percent fraud to it and you're talking about a program that significally is inefficient and what happens is we'll make sure that these programs are efficient they should be lots of like other nonprofits you know seeing how much of every dollar goes to where its constituents we should be I admit that that governor government should be a part of that so maybe 25% might be something more affordable well we got also stopped is making sure that people aren't utilizing in the wrong fashion you know both movies uh programs eliminate this from from liquor stores casinos and strip clubs but it did nothing about marijuana shops no matter and it should be about how you feel about the issue you know no matter how you should feel about it that they shouldn't be utilized for food in that regards and so what this does is it prohibited and it is much more comprehensive than any of the other bills that are out there you know what I'd also like to see in addition to prohibiting welfare funds for being used for drugs I'd like to see people get tested for welfare benefits I'm not talking about Social Security and Medicare but the other kinds of benefits that the federal government does that the state government does to essentially pay very often able-bodied people who in turn are using taxpayer funds to purchase and use drugs you know I know that be fairly controversial but has anyone thought of doing that well we actually did that Krista the House and Senate actually agreed to allow states that they wanted to do drug testing in order to get welfare to allow it through and the president actually removed that from the law once again that law was application of the right of law in building a bill that goes into a law the Congressional support once again that shows you that the the broken record that I become is that we've become lawless in Washington DC and it starts with how the president and breaks us up and when I would he smirk oh well you know we had a great tea party wave of 2010 of which you were a part of with a courageous and well-fought campaign got out to Washington DC your patients probably miss you though and you in your office in Arizona but they they know that you're your you know helping out in a different way but do you see the Tea Party is staying strong here in 2014 or are some of the Tea Party skeptics that say that the Tea Party is a has seen its best days you think that they have any any point in making those claims yeah III I just count them because you know give me somebody that's motivated that cares about our Constitution that wants to be you know in a land that has opportunity that goes by the rule of law I'll take them any day they can outwork somebody 20 times over you know and that's the passion is is that you know they want to get back to this accountable government of smaller government personal freedoms and personal accountability and I think what ends up stopping them movement again is is the desire to get America dreaming again that we can solve these problems it just takes fortitude and it takes application of upholding the rule of law so I discount that and I think if we play bold and and and true to our word that's one of the things I I want to do is I told people I would come out and see them and I do I live in a car I have tons of coffees and then open town halls and freely accessible there's no question that's beneath me but the thing that you have to worry about is is that I open it up to everybody and before I'll answer your question you've got to have a solution and once you you know you're ragging on an issue I ask you what's your solution does we need America to be incorporated in have skin in the game well Congressman Paul Gosar last 20 seconds you have a website where our listeners might be able to follow you and you know follow what you're up to absolutely and this geo SAR thank you very much congressman for being with us this evening thank you and thank you very much

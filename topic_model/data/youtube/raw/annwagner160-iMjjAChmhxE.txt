I thank Thank You mr. chairman for organizing this hearing and thank you to our witnesses for their time following up on my friend and colleague mr. barreras line of questioning dr. cha you and special representatives for North Korean Steven vegan who governor Richardson has spoken so highly of has noted that even as United States pursues a direct leader-to-leader format for the current talks with North Korea it is supplementing sub summit level meetings with intensive working-level negotiations do you think this strategy will better ensure the u.s. walks away from annoy with some sort of acceptable deal agreement um I think what certainly what was better in process with regard to this summit was that there was a lead-up of intense as you said right working-level negotiations that Steve began led the first summit in Singapore is you remember was just an announcement that they were going to meet and there was no working-level effort so that those working-level meetings are important to help the outcome of the summit be successful it's not just happening at the summit let's be clear - sure it is happening in the lead-up to the summit in a very intensified ways from what I understand it said your understanding yes yes and that is that's the way it should be done great wonderful governor Richardson you have spent decades working through formal and informal channels in North Korea to secure the release of American citizens held unjustly by the Kim regime informal exchanges like the relationships you have built over the last several years can be highly effective in promoting mutual understanding how do your efforts support and intersect with official talks oh I I think you you asked a question about special envoy vegan I think he's very effective you know the administration consults with me they don't listen though Ellen to me either they don't even talk to me they do theirs sometimes but my point here congresswoman is I think you need yes presidential the president that's good personal relationships but you need the staff work in preparation Frank and sometimes I wonder because of the president's style that that doesn't happen as much as it should I hope he's listening I mean we're going to find out in two days whether this summit is a success or not he listens the secret envoy vegan secretary Pompeo you know she had to negotiate with a North Korean spy chief ever since the first summit or before the first summit my worry is and before I think you came in I said it's better to negotiate with the foreign ministry types in North Korea rather than the intelligence people because they're more flexible we'll see what happens in this next summit we were kind of hanging on to the result but you would agree that both formal and informal lines of communication are important correct absolutely absolutely you know on prisoner exchanges on rescuing American servicemen on remains yeah I mean we thank you for your leadership in that in that regard Russia and China appear to be weakening on sanctions enforcement although US negotiators are working to solidify support in advance of the Hanoi summit Russia how worried should we be about Chinese and Russian compliance and how can the u.s. convince the international community to kind of hold the line so it is I think it is a real problem congresswoman be any agreement we make with North Korea has to be enforceable and enforceability means also sanctioning if they violate the agreement and China holds a lot of cards when it comes to sanctioning I mean I think the only the only way to really compel trying to do this is to be willing to say very sanction I mean to go after Chinese companies that are will it willfully and knowingly violating US law and that's the only way to it you found the secondary sanctions can be very effective I think I think they can they certainly spread the net of who is responsible when it comes to this I mean China is a UN Security Council member so they should be complying with the eleven UN Security Council resolutions with regard to North Korea on particularly on trade but they they really haven't been for about fifteen months now well thank you I think my time is about to expire so I yield back mr. chairman

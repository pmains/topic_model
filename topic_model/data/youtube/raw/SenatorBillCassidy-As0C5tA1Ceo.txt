mr chester um i'm struck that i can speak about chemical providers in wuhan sending chemicals here that are precursors for fentanyl that are used by mexican cartels are all shipped directly you can acknowledge it in your testimony now we think of china as an area where they have surveillance cameras on every corner in which at any point someone may be arbitrarily imprisoned i could go on but we know what the go on would be so how much collaboration are we getting from the chinese in terms of this because someone has suggested this is a form of bioterrorism yes senator no thank thank you very much for the question i i could tell you that that we engage regularly with with the people's republic of china on on this specific issue and although as you know we have a very complicated relationship with china this is an area where u.s and in in prc interests align uh and we have made progress in the past the most notable was our work up until may of 2008 let me stop you though i'm sorry yes sir but if we know who those chemical manufacturers are the chinese know who they are so yes there may be collaboration right but there's a fundamental breakdown here right yes sir and the first thing is uh ensuring we have open lines of communication so the information that we have that we understand about seizures in the western hemisphere can be sent to the chinese so that they can they can take action on it the the second part of that is and something that we've clearly communicated to the chinese uh and you you mentioned in your opening statement i think you i think you brought up a very good point when you talk about the mislabeling we we have asked the chinese government to do three very simple things the first one is agree with us on the list of unregulated chemicals that are used to create precursor chemicals that bear increased scrutiny that's the first thing the second thing is to properly label their chemical and equipment shipments in accordance with the world trade organization and the third one is uh that they know their customer and put into put put know your customer uh procedures into place those are the things we should expect of any responsible country we've asked other countries to do this as well and we and we look forward to working with the chinese for them to implement these procedures to reduce the flow of these precursor chemicals into the western hemisphere now we've been raising this issue with the chinese for several years now i guess what i'm after which i'm not sure i'm getting is a level of collaboration true collaboration as opposed to hey we're with you as opposed to no we're knocking on doors and we're shutting down people and we're throwing them in jail right um i i would tell you that in in the relationship that we have with chinese with with the prc has given us uneven progress i won't disagree with you on that i think that there are areas where the chinese government has taken quick and decisive action at a request to the united states and it's had good results i think there are there are other times that we have differences with the with the government of china procedurally on certain things that we ask them to do and uh and we have to ensure that we continue to communicate with them and press to them how incredibly important this is not just the united states but to the rest of the world and other countries and secretary blinken brought this up in his speak speech about china uh other countries should expect two great countries like the united states and the prc to work together on this global issue and they understand that now looking at mexico now you have a sense that mexico is always teetering on whether or not it's in control or not and several states apparently are not in control of the central government but to what degree has the mexican government collaborated with us if these cartels are bringing these these these drugs from china to then bring across our border to what degree are we getting collaboration there um we we have a a good and long-standing relationship with the government of mexico which was solidified in the bicentennial framework for for security that was signed just a few months ago that replaces the previous merida initiative uh that is a little bit more holistic and uh takes in more of the more of the contributing factors within mexico not not just the security side of the house and we have on the ground we have a large embassy down there we have deep law enforcement relationships with the government of mexico and we have had cooperation in the past and most recently obviously uh the uh the apprehension of rafael caro quintero is a good example of cooperation with the government of mexico that actually bears uh that bears fruit now but i had a sense that recently there was some uh back likes like like increased liability for some of our agents who might be down there should something go wrong uh and uh and i also have a sense that uh president or i'll just call mamalow the president of mexico has um less affection for the u.s than perhaps some of his predecessors any comment on that um what you're referring to is the national security law that was that was put in place in january of last year that inc that created a bunch of increased procedures for collaboration between mexican and u.s law enforcement uh agencies i think on the ground that has been worked out in practical terms that it's not had a devastating effect on law enforcement cooperation in mexico that's not uniform across all agencies but i think in general terms the national security law isn't a barrier from us working with new mexico but i think it is clear that president lopez obrador sees really two things the first one is he wants to go after the root causes of criminality and the second thing is he continually looks at the u.s mexico relationship in terms of mexico's interests as much as united states interests and and so it's it has caused a recasting of our relationship with mexico uh but we have made some progress on this particular problem when working with the government of mexico thank you

Thank You mr. chairman miss Dixon congratulations on your nomination you have a beautiful family I'm sorry to see that the youngest it isn't continuing to enjoy and entertain the hearing just like many of our members senator in in more ways than one the question senator Blumenthal was asking you I think are serious questions the FAA has long been referred to as the gold standard for aviation safety and I believe the events surrounding the certification and crashes of the 737 maxes have drawn that reputation in the serious question The Wall Street Journal article from yesterday contains many dismaying reports it begins by saying an internal FAA review is tentatively determined that senior agency officials didn't participate in or monitor critical safety assessments of a flight control system for Boeing 737 max jet later implicated in two fatal crashes according to industry and government officials it goes on to say the certification process for the 737 max Boeing didn't flag the automated stall prevention feature as a system whose malfunction or failure could cause a catastrophic event and the article later raises the very simple question also at issue is whether agency officials performed any assessment on their own about the system's initial safety classification that suggests a serious breakdown in the certification process the department transportation inspector general has previously raised the concern of agency captor capture do you agree that these reports suggests the possibility of serious breakdown and what should be done to fix it well thank you for the question senator and I I again the reporting externally - it's hard to tell exactly when some of these things happen exactly how they occurred but I can commit to you that if I'm confirmed I will be looking into this very specifically and the the group the review processes including the inspector general including the special committee the the joint authorities technical review and the the Technical Advisory Board all of that will form the basis of of actions in addition to my own diligence within the agency to make sure that that any adjustments are made to the process that need to be made again the highest priority is always going to be safety for the traveling public whether it's within the US or aviation products around the world that's going to be my top priority I agree with what you said a minute ago about not jumping into conclusions at the same time if you are confirmed getting to the FAA the easiest thing to do will be to do nothing bureaucratic inertia is powerful and the natural instincts of any agency is protect itself protect the status quo and admit no wrongdoing and so what I'm asking you to do if you're confirmed it's be pissed off the 346 people died that is not a small matter 346 lives that were snuffed out and at least the early evidence suggests that was preventable and not just those lives that are no longer with us but millions of Americans millions of people all across the world get on planes every day trust their children strap their children into planes billions and commerce travels on the aviation industry all of that depends upon the confidence of the flying public that the planes they're getting on is safe so mr. Dixon I would ask you not to give in to the natural bureaucratic reaction that defends what happens but stead ask seriously and vigorously could we have prevented these crashes and what can we do to make sure we don't see another one because of agency mistakes or because of the risk of it of agency capture well senator thank you for that for raising that issue please do not interpret my demeanor as you know satisfied with this situation or in any way saying that that any accident is acceptable is not and if I'm confirmed I promise you I'm going to be the captain of the ship I'll be a steady hand on the tiller which i think is what what the American public needs but that doesn't mean that I'm not going to be asking the tough questions and making the changes that need to be made and will you commit to this committee to vigorously figure out what the hell went wrong absolutely thank you thank you senator Cruz and let me note that I appreciate chairman Cruz's leadership on the subcommittee with jurisdiction over this issue and my thanks goes to him and his committee subcommittee staff on that also

I grew up in the time in which veterans were coming home military men and women were coming home from Vietnam and this country didn't treat them very well and that's always stuck with me so one of the things I want to make sure I accomplish in my work is that those who served our country get the care and treatment that they are entitled to and if they get the respect from Americans from their neighbors that they have earned and so we work to make certain that that happens and we need a Department of Veterans Affairs that is worthy of those people's sacrifice for our country you know this country needs to get moving again we need jobs created we need economic growth people ought to be able to pursue their dreams and we need an opportunity it's what the federal government to be focused on Congress ought to be working with the President to create a circumstance in which people who are looking for opportunity can find it and the startup act as part of that we introduced legislation brought Republicans or Democrats together to do it and it says that we're gonna change the way that the tax code works that we can access Capital we get some regulations and permits out of the way so that people who want to start a business can have a shot a better shot at having success and I've always known that when somebody who wants to start a business is successful in doing so that's the American dream but it also creates the opportunity for people who go to work for that business to live their American dream you know I know in my own life that teachers made a tremendous difference I was I was fortunate to have parents who understood that the value of education encouraged me to you know do well in school but I had teachers who found me and grabbed a hold of me and said let's make something of your life and I hope I honor them by doing that but what this country is about is creating opportunities for kids to grow up and have their dreams lived and education is the way that we do that and I have the Holden highest regard that teachers the educators who do that every day and I'm of the view we change the world one person at a time and it's much more important what happens in a classroom in Kansas probably than what happens in Washington DC

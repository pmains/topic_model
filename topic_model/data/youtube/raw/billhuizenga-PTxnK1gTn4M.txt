we continue to follow breaking news out of Washington DC tonight where the US Senate has passed sweeping immigration reform legislation the historic bill would put 11 million people living in the US illegally on a path to citizenship and establish a military-style surge on the us-mexico border the vote far surpassed the majority needed to send that bill on to the house but the bill will face strong opposition from conservatives there Republican congressman bill Huizenga joining us live on the phone right now congressman good afternoon how are you I'm doing well Andy thanks for having me on we thank you for your time they're calling it the border security economic economic opportunity immigration Modernization Act of 2013 it's a mouthful but not since the Reagan era have we seen this many of your constituents will fall into this category of undocumented can you tell us how you'll vote if it does come to a boat in the house we know though that the Senate bill isn't going to be taken up as is in the House the Speaker of the House and our leadership has has said very clearly that we've got our own process that we're going through and at the end of the day Andy I want an immigration reform that works for West Michigan that works for national security and is good for our economy representative heisting it does have lots of bipartisan support in the Senate were you surprised to see so many of your Republican colleagues getting on board with this and what are your primary object objections to the bill as it is now well it's about a third of the Republican caucus actually voted for it there was 14 out of the out of the 46 47 members that they have and part of the problem is is that we're not sure exactly what all is in it this is a 1200 page bill that was passed and by the time that they had struck the agreement on border security I mean there was a lot of people at the beginning of the week in the end of last week that were predicting that this was not going to pass the Senate at all Wednesday is when they did the border security agreement that seemed to bring on the the real momentum but there was a huge amount of text and provisions that have been added in less than 48 hours and I'm afraid that we are going to once again see a bill here that they had to pass to find out what's actually in it the house is going to take a much more methodical process to tell me what you think about the border security surge we're talking 20,000 more patrol jobs and also of course hundreds of miles of fencing bill doesn't that seem a little incongruous with allowing 11 million illegal immigrants to be naturalized US citizens well it's 46 billion dollars is the price tag attached to that as well and it is truly the largest militarization of a border that we've had since since probably any of them any of the wars and security there the you know part of the problem that we that we have here is that we are in this situation once again you know 1986 there was border provision border security provisions that were put in place we went from three million people that that received the amnesty and that was an outright amnesty bill this i would i would say is is different than that but now there's an estimate of 13 million what we need to make sure there isn't is a third wave of that another another time where we're going to be having to deal with this so we know that we have to have a secure border we have to have enforcement of current and future laws and we have to build a long-term system that works and and so far i'm not convinced that the senate bill does that but we're going to be taking a much closer look and we'll see how this issue fares in the house shortly here congressman bill heisting of representing michigan's 2nd district we thank you for your time tonight hey thanks good to be with you and we continue stay on top of the immigration reform debate and we'll let you know just as soon as anything on that develops meanwhile nelson

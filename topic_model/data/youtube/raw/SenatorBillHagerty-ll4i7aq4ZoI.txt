more on this let's bring in senator bill hagerty he's on the senate banking committee senator thanks for joining us so can democrats actually get this passed through congress though i certainly hope not i appreciate the opportunity to talk about it tonight because this would have a devastating effect on our economy the exact opposite effect that we should be looking for right now is we're coming out of a pandemic look if you want less of something tax it more that's exactly what's going to happen with capital gains you want less capital investment raise the capital gains rate we need to be turning our economy around right now and capital investment begets more jobs more economic activity that's what america needs today you said the white house pushing back on this the the economic adviser brian diese thinking that the capital gains raising it would not have an effect on the economy and i want you to listen to what he said today listen to this okay for these highest income individuals number one and number two we can use those resources to invest in areas that we know where there is convincing academic evidence empirical evidence that investments for example in early childhood and in our children return enormous dividends in terms of their own academic success reduce costs in the health care system productivity uh and growth in the future so do you believe them that raising the capital gains won't affect the economy and then two will get some huge gain down the road at some date absolutely it's not going to help the economy nor will it increase the investment dollars available for the programs that he just mentioned because people that have capital gains have the ability to time when they realize those gains they're going to outweigh the biden regime people just aren't going to realize capital gains and what it does is it traps productive capital people just won't sell they won't release it that'll reduce the flow of capital investment into better higher growth producing activities so it's going to have a negative effect on the economy and frankly it will reduce capital gains tax revenues this is a nonsensical idea you know when you go back to the 70s even the capital gains tax never reached above 40 percent now the administration is looking at 43.4 with that plus up charge for the with obamacare now even john f kennedy says a tax on capital gains directly affects investment so how do you build back better when you undermine the capital needed to build back you're so right i've been a businessman all my life i served as the economic development chief when we brought my home state of tennessee out of the last recession what you need is more capital investment what you the way you get more capital investment is you make a more favorable environment for that capital this is the most hostile tax rate that we've seen on capital in america certainly in my lifetime do you feel like there is any reach across the aisle on on raising capital gains will it be any discussion with republicans uh to try and come to a compromise this is just a typical of the biden bait and switch you know iran is quote a moderate but as soon as he gets into office he proves that he's being controlled by the liberal wing of his party and that wing has been very non-receptive to commonsensical approaches to our economy i hope that we'll find a better path but raising capital gains rates is going the exact wrong direction i'd be in favor of lowing them further and do you think that this could be the reconciliation process that they would have to use for this uh you know we've seen uh some some hesitation uh with uh senator manchin but will do you believe this will this will be worked through the reconciliation process i hope colleagues like senator manchin will realize that something like this would be so damaged to the economy that they shouldn't use a tool like reconciliation it's totally partisan as as you saw happened in the last process that they used not a single republican vote for the 1.9 trillion dollar package that they pushed through that's in the face of all the coveted relief that was done in 2020 that was done on a completely bipartisan basis over 90 votes on every package so if they move this direction it will be again a completely partisan maneuver it's something that republicans are wise enough to see and call what it is this is a job-killing endeavor the biden administration should not be not be undertaking this following yeah i want to switch topics quickly senators we're coming up we're going to be talking about the republican-backed infrastructure plan now do you see an actual infrastructure plan being passed or will progressives pack that other stuff inside the bill here's a place where i hope we may have some real bipartisan support i was just back home in tennessee this past week people want to talk about infrastructure when you actually have the opportunity to invest in roads highways bridges broadband something that will yield an actual return on investment that's something where we ought to be able to find a bipartisan solution so i'm more optimistic there do you think it could be a breakout then i hope so hard to say right now given this environment have you had conversations uh with with other republicans or even democrats about this issue we've begun the conversation but there's a lot more to be talked about senator i appreciate senator bill hagerty from the great state of tennessee thank you very much for joining us great to be with you thank you so much

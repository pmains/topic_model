joining me now North Dakota Senator the great Kevin Kramer you know Senator Kramer I was just talking to John Katz and matites who's in the oil business as part of his great successful Empire I mean Russia is still doing 10 million barrels a day still which is self is really something and whatever the price is I don't know eighty dollars they're going to pay 70 they're going to pay we're still down here uh we're a little over 12 million barrels a day we ought to be at 15 million barrels a day I don't get this I don't know why more people aren't talking about this because of Biden's war against fossil fuels he is helping Putin's War again in Ukraine and to me that's just nuts there's no question the higher the price multiplied by the barrels you sells generates more revenue for him to to fight against Freedom loving ukrainians with but you know we often use the term Larry energy Independence but remember president Trump used to talk about energy dominance I always like the term energy security because I think the term energy security gets right to your point what would it what would the difference between be if we were growing if we were producing 15 million barrels instead of 13 million barrels a day it'd be more than Independence it would mean that we'd be the price maker instead of the price taker on the global markets it means that our allies could depend on us for some some cleaner and and uh and friendlier energy to provide for them fortunately this last winter has been a pretty mild one in Europe so Europe wasn't quite as dependent on on natural gases they oftentimes would be throughout a winter although the winter's not over there's so many reasons for the United States to be the energy producer of choice of all types of energy Larry and and uh and this Administration just does not seem to get it or they more more likely don't care I mean it's just a you know I I connect the dots you know we're doing 12 million barrels a day uh as you say 14 to 15 million barrels was Insight a few years ago um right Russia is doing 10 million barrels a day they've not cut back the sanctions have essentially not worked I know China India are buying it whatever they did but they're making 300 billion dollars a year 300 billion dollars a year off this stuff and that's the only money they have but it's money they're using in Ukraine you know we're pwning up what 100 billion now a year plus for Ukraine we're giving it to Russia Biden's war against fossil fuels is enabling Putin's war against the Ukraine there's a certain Insanity there what is it Sarah Sanders said Governor Sarah Sanders said the other night it's the difference between normal and crazy this is crazy what we're doing well as Mr katzum Adidas mentioned obviously a lower price if we got if oil was 60 a barrel we'd be flourishing in the United States producing more of it plus reducing the cost of everything that energy goes into which is everything we grow manufacture produce move from Market to Market whether it's government or going all of that would be better for our economy plus it would lower the take for Vladimir Putin who's benefiting tremendously from this this really what is an above market price you mentioned two important countries though India and China that's three billion people half of whom are supposed to be our allies I think we have to get a little bit tougher with our friends as well but we also have to be there for them Larry if if we're gonna if we're going to insist that that other countries friends or Frenemies whatever they might be should purchase more energy from us then we need to make sure that we're providing it for them as well and right now we're a pretty unreliable producer because of our president's policies you know for another segment Senator Kramer but you are so totally right you are so totally right we need to get tougher with China and we got to have some tough love with our supposed friend in India and

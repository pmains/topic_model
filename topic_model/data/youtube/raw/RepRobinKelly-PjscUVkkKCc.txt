hello everyone it's congresswoman robin kelly from illinois 2nd congressional district for hispanic heritage month i wanted to feature a member of the latinx community who is doing great things to serve our district let me introduce you to hennika rodriguez henika is a proud alumni of depaul university's honors college having obtained her bachelor's in political science and a minor in latino studies currently she serves as a latinx student outreach and retention coordinator at prairie state college in her role she works mostly with first generation latinx students helping with every step of the enrollment and registration process hello jennica and thanks for joining me thank you for having me so as our um first person we're we're doing this with so congratulations to you and being highly can you tell me a little bit about your job and the importance of having someone like you at colleges and universities uh yeah i mean you you summarized it well um i have the privilege of assisting our latinx students in our community at our community college and i assist with every step of the enrollment and registration process um so that includes a lot of whatever the student and their family needs and i say family because i find it just as important to include the parents to include the siblings have everybody on board for what's going to be this next chapter of the student's life which is college and as we know it a very difficult transition for a lot of us so i take it upon myself and i pride myself in providing what i think is a holistic approach to crafting an academic plan that works best with the individual students needs their financial situation we know it can change from year to year so tweaking it if we have to but ultimately working with the student every step of the way to make sure that whatever goals they have academically and professionally that we help them reach that i think this work is very important um and that we should have somebody at all colleges and universities assisting this demographic and let me clarify it's important to have somebody with that title that students know they can go to directly but i think it's important for staff and faculty at every college and administration to understand the richness that this culture brings to their institution and making sure that each institution does their research to know what the needs are for the latinx communities that they serve i'm in the south suburbs so those needs may look a little different than some of our students closer to the city and so it's important that we have that liaison that one person that students can feel comfortable reaching out to when they you know encounter an obstacle as we know that they will because all of us do and um and at that point then we have a whole village that can help them to stay on track and be successful now did you know that you wanted did you even know a job like this existed or did you know this is something you wanted to do or was did it come from your experiences in college yeah so if you would have told me years ago that this sort of thing existed i would have been like i'm all over it that's exactly what i want to do i always knew i had a passion for my community um i was going to go a different route but uh i ended up in higher education because i started working for a trio grant which at the time was serving middle school and high school students basically talking to them about what college was taking them on college visits so i mixed my two pensions for the first time which was helping my community and college um and i realized that i did like working with the younger children or the younger students but the ones that had my heart were the seniors or nearing senior status because they clung to me and they had all kinds of great questions for me they wanted to know how somebody like myself who was like them also mexican american how did they how did i manage to go through college how did i get scholarships how did i study abroad they wanted to know how i did everything and their parents wanted to know more about uh you know understanding the financial aid and uh just the college process in the united states and so i realized that there was a huge need um just like we have in every field to serve the latino community but specifically in the south suburban district there was a huge need for seniors in the area to have somebody that could assist them and answer all their questions as you're working with uh latinx young people what do you see as the biggest need maybe even the biggest challenges what's what what's important to them um so many things right but um i think the pandemic came and mixed up you know kind of shook us up a little bit and changed slightly what students are you know afraid of and what their what kinds of obstacles they're facing when the pandemic hit i i my heart broke for my students because i realized so many of them already had so many barriers so many obstacles and i knew that something like this pandemic and moving to virtually a completely different environment could change the way but um that they approached higher education the good thing is that even in spite of the pandemic the students have persisted and our community is very much still seeking to get that higher education seeking to better their communities their own professional lives but also their communities and so even though the pandemic has been an obstacle i don't think it's been the biggest obstacle i think the biggest obstacle still remains the financial not all of our students can get financial aid obviously or in the same amounts and so most of our students are working i think they're overall for our latinx community something that is a huge obstacle like for example our daca students some of our hardest working students at the college and our undocumented students um you know they need more assistance and being able to bring the financial burden down just a bit so that they can really if they're already succeeding in these fields you know really motivate them to continue to to be the you know the shakers and the movers that they have been in our communities everywhere um when the pandemic hit you know many of my former students who are daca recipients are the ones on the front lines in the hospitals as nurses and it was uh it goes to show you know right we need to support our community so that they can continue to help all of us you know make a better community for all of us well i want to know we've been talking about work uh what do you do outside of work uh what volunteering do you do or what are your hobbies what do you do for fun uh i am a new mom so given the pandemic and me becoming a mom for the first time that takes up a good amount of my time right now but before the pandemic and hopefully once it's it's safer for for us to be out um volunteering is something that i like to help our students at the college uh participate in uh is within the community so that was you know me me being alongside with them for that um volunteering at local churches there's a big church in the area that we like to work along with a lot of our students are you know belong to these churches and so they want to help give back um the college participates in a lot of things like food drives um and halloween fest and stuff like that and so i like to make sure that our students and their goal you know with myself included that we volunteer and help you know bring the community onto the college campus bring resources to the community whenever an opportunity arises connect our students to volunteering opportunities that could potentially turn into internships or scholarship opportunities so um so that's what i've been up to recently though the new baby congratulations on the new baby and i just want to thank you so much again for joining me and and just applaud you for all the work you do uh in the second congressional district and it makes me so proud to have someone like you serving in our district so thank you so much and the best to you and enjoy the baby thank you and a huge shout out to all there's a lot of fierce warriors out there who are also assisting these students and that i've had the pleasure to run across run into meet i've had the privilege of working with all over illinois so there's a lot of

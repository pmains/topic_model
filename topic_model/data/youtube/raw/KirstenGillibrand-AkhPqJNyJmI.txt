so the first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox The Oval Office the second thing I'm going to do as I will re-engage on global climate change and I will not only sign the Paris global climate Accords but I will lead a worldwide conversation about the urgency of this crisis the greatest threat to humanity is global climate change I visited a family in Iowa who water viewed into her home Fran Parr it tossed her refrigerator up and all the furniture was broken all the dishes were broken and mud was everywhere that is the impact of severe weather right now on family's lives and so the truth is we need a robust solution when John F Kennedy said I want to put a man on the moon and next in the next 10 years not because it's easy but because it's hard he knew it was going to be a measure of our innovation our success our ability to galvanize worldwide competition he wanted to have a space race with Russia why not have a green energy race with China why not have clean air and clean water for all Americans why not rebuild our infrastructure why not actually invest in the green jobs that's what the green new deal is about thing not only will I pass up a tile put a price on carbon to make market forces help Thank You senator

Mr Speaker I rise today to join my colleagues in welcoming president moon jae-in of the Republic of Korea on the occasion of his visit to Washington this week this visit is an important opportunity to further the strong bonds of cooperation and friendship between our two countries as North Korea continues to threaten our allies and pursue its destabilizing missile program including tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles this meeting comes at a pivotal time the United States and the Republic of Korea must continue to stand together to contain this threat and ensure the security and safety of this strategically important region earlier I sent a letter urging Speaker Ryan to invite president moon to speak before a joint meeting of Congress so all members can hear firsthand his perspective of these shared challenges if not possible during this brief visit I'd hopefully he will address the body in the future once again I extend my heartfelt welcome to president moon and express my commitment to furthering the vital economic security and cultural relationships between our two countries and I yield back this is the gentleman from Colorado

tonight I was glad the president delivered a powerful message what a unifying message about the importance of us rallying together as a country around a number of major issues facing America immigration reform national security infrastructure investment protecting American workers all of these things need to be priorities moving forward and I hope we can come together for the common good to make them happen I was also glad the president reflected on the many accomplishments that a Republican president working with the Republican Congress has been able to achieve over the last couple of years from tax reform which has created 45,000 jobs just in the state of Indiana since passage to regulatory relief to many wins on the national security front to the confirmation of 85 federal judges and Counting there's a whole lot to be proud of but much work remains to be done

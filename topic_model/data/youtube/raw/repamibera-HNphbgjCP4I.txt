I just walked off the floor of the House of Representatives we voted unanimously Democrats and Republicans to pass the survivors Bill of Rights Act this is a simple act that's going to protect survivors from sexual assault you know it's the right thing to do as a doctor I've worked throughout my career to make sure patients have the necessary care they need and that those survivors of sexual assault get the cure but that we also capture the perpetrators what this bill does is it makes sure every rape kit is process to help us get through the backlog it helps bring justice it's the right thing to do for survivors so I'm proud that we passed that bill and I'm proud that we passed it Democrats Republicans unanimous way

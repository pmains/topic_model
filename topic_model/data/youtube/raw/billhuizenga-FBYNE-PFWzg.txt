someone who has worked in the housing and construction industry and development industry I believe that this is a very important issue not only to me in those industries but more importantly to all of our constituents across the country you know excuse me the the qualified Mortgage or QM ability-to-repay rule is mandated by the dodd-frank Act went into effect in January of 2014 the QM rule is the primary means for mortgage lenders to satisfy its quote ability to repay and quote requirements additionally dodd-frank provides that a QM may not have points and fees in excess of 3% of the loan amount as currently defined those points and fees include among other charges one fees paid to affiliate but this is the important part not unaffiliated title companies to celery's paid to loan originators three amounts of insurance and taxes held in escrow and again that's an escrow not not an income stream for loan level price adjustments those are commonly known as points paying points to buy down a down a rate and v payments by lenders to correspondent banks credit unions and mortgage brokers in wholesale transactions so not necessarily specifically to that particular mortgage transaction but in totality and a wholesale transaction well as a result of this confusing and problematic definition many affiliated loans particularly those made to low and moderate-income borrows borrowers would not qualify as QM Zoar qualified mortgages without that designations it's unlikely that the loan would be made and if it were it would only be available at higher rates due to heightened liability risks consumers would actually lose the ability to take advantage of the convenience and market efficiencies offered by one-stop-shopping and previously in different hearings over the years I've sort of said that this is like telling a Walmart or at us here in the Midwest a Meijer or that they can carry groceries but they can't carry school supplies you know the you can't have this one-stop shopping and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me so I along with my friend from New York Greg Meeks representative Meeks reintroduced HR 1153 bipartisan bill that would modify and clarify the way that points and fees are calculated this legislation is very narrowly focused remote access to affordable mortgage credit without overturning the important consumer protections and sound underwriting required under dodd-frank sibility to repay provisions very similar legislation overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives last Congress as well as the Congress prior to that in 113 I think it's important to note that when I had first introduced this bill in 2012 it did look substantially different however working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle we made necessary changes to this legislation and the result has been a truly bipartisan effort every step of the way in this legislative debate and while I personally believe that we we are going to have to deal with the ability-to-repay provisions at some point that is not what this bill is doing this this bill which is the exact same legislature exact same language that had passed last Congress received overwhelming support both here in the Financial Services Committee and in the Full House of Representatives specifically it would provide equal treatment for affiliated title fees verse and the unaffiliated and clarify the treatment of insurance held in escrow again those are payments that are not an asset those are just being held so I think these common-sense changes will promote access to affordable mortgage credit for low and moderate income families and first-time homebuyers by ensuring that safe and proper underwriting mortgages pass the QM test and frankly whether you're now you supported dodd-frank it's clear that the law requires some tweaks to ensure that qualified borrows aren't locked out of homeownership and the beneficial features of a qualified Mortgage so mr. chairman Congress has the opportunity help more Americans realize a portion of the American dream not by some grandiose law or decree but by simply reforming a burdensome regulation home ownership has been a pillar of American life for generations and today we can reaffirm that pillar and reassert the home ownership can and should be an attainable goal and I'd like to thank my colleague representative Meeks for his work on this and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of HR 1153

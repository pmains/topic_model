joining us now is California congressman Adam Schiff of California he is the chairman of the house intelligence committee he led today's hearing of the January 6th investigation sir I know this has been a big day uh thank you very much for taking time to be with us here tonight good to be with you it is my estimation having very closely watched today's hearing that there were four main points um that you brought forward the first and I think most prominent the most important of those is that you explained how president Trump personally took part in cajoling and trying to persuade people to overturn election results in the states he then personally took part in escalating from that to new tactics that would bring threats of violence and intimidation against those same targets and we saw that I think in in Stark detail today is that the main point that you and your co-investigators wanted to convey today yes really just how premeditated it all was how it started with a big lie that the president was told over and over and over again by his attorney general a deputy by his U.S attorney in Georgia by others was a big lie but but that didn't matter he used that big lie as a bludgeon to try to get these state legislators and elections officials to bend to his will to overturn the election but uh but he ran into resistance by courageous public servants who said no I'm not going to violate my health you may be the president you may be the head of my party but there's something more important to me and that's my oath and and that's my faith uh and I'm glad the public got to see these heroic people cartoons Nicole Wallace um violence and it's Donald Trump's proximity to it whether it's with Mike Pence um or with the proud boys and The Oath Keepers has been a constant theme and the committee has gone farther than anyone else ever has to putting him not just adjacent to the violence but cheering for the violence indifferent to the consequences of the violence does this story deepen I mean do you have evidence that puts Donald Trump in the command and control position over the violence meted out by the proud boys and The Oath Keepers and the other insurrectionist groups well you know I don't want to get ahead of our committee presentations but you know I think that one of the hearings where we explore what the president was doing what he was saying and what he was thinking while the violence goes on goes to this very Point uh it goes to the point of of dereliction of Duty goes to the point that uh that he he incited this violence he incited this hatred uh he riled up this base and and then what did he do while it was happening he sat back and watched it watched it all play out and uh you know to see uh today the human consequences of that just a small part of it these election workers in Atlanta who were just going about their job who had no idea they were about to be hit with a club uh this this false claim the likening of what they did to to drug deals it was just disgusting and you see how people's lives were turned up upside down and ultimately uh how lives were lost on January 6th hi Congressman Ari here you have this evidence of all these different people uh submitting false electors including potentially to the government do you view this as something where some one or more people have broken the law through that act alone well I share the view of Judge Carter in California that this plot to overturned the election which had many facets likely violated multiple federal laws and and likely implicated the president of the United States you know whether one specific aspect or another violated particular statute I will have to leave to the Department of Justice but I certainly believe there's more than enough evidence for them to investigate each of the crimes that judge Carter set out and I think the more evidence that we've presented just strengthens the case for a federal investigation Congressman I'm just going to jump in real quick here with a follow on Ari's question I just wanted to ask you about the response from Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin today after this uh so his connection to this part of the plot was aired today in in the hearing Senator Johnson said today that he was aware that his office had received the forged certificates these fake slates of electors but he says he doesn't know who delivered them um that struck us all here on the panel as odd because if you got something from somebody you don't know who the first instinct wouldn't be that you volunteer to hand deliver it to the vice president on January 6th um but that's what he says he says he doesn't even know where he got them from he was just a courier does that jive with what you and the committee understand about Senator Johnson's involvement well you know I can't go into uh you know what the committee's evidence or understanding is um I watched that same clip with a lot of uh interest today as Senator Johnson essentially said that he knew that something had arrived in the office is chief of staff was being asked to deliver it to uh or being asked to help convey it to the vice president uh this is January 6 we're talking about and the idea uh that he wouldn't know what it was or anything about it I think begs a lot of uh questions Congressman this is Joy Reed I actually have a question about a senator as well as Rachel did um but it's about kind of the dog that didn't hunt today um as I was watching the hearings today I kept waiting to hear one name that I didn't and that is Senator Lindsey Graham um who we do know from the reporting also put pressure on uh Brad raffensberger and others in the state of Georgia um to hand Donald Trump the votes you know the flip the votes that he needed in order to win that election can you talk a little bit about your process about who was included who was not included and will we hear more about um Senator Graham's involvement in this pressure campaign on particularly the state of Georgia well you know in terms of the process as you might imagine uh there's a volume of evidence a mountain of evidence to try to communicate through each of these hearings uh which you know are only lasting between two and three hours uh and so we have to kind of ruthlessly say what's most important to convey to the public and that means a lot it's The Cutting Room floor now ultimately we intend to open up and release our files and let the public know uh the much bigger volume of what we have obtained I can't tell you exactly when that's going to happen but we do intend to share a lot that we couldn't cover in these hearings but yes some very difficult decisions are made with each of these hearings what is most important knowing that we can't convey at all or even even more than a small fraction congressman Adam Schiff Democratic California member of the January 6 investigation who led today's hearing uh sir I um I hope it's not weird for me to tell you that part of our job of recapping the hearing was I think made easier tonight by the fact that today was um so cogent um and so well organized and we know that in large part that was your doing along with your staff and your fellow investigators but thank you for your service today in presenting this so clearly and thanks for joining us to help us understand it tonight well thank you and I'm just so glad the country got to see some of these heroic public servants

mr president when we began the budget debate in senator murray's committee last last week i said that senator murray's challenge gave new meaning to the idea of playing a tough hand and many thought that her task was essentially mission impossible the fact is mr president for all of us who know senator murray well she has spent her whole life coming up with solutions to those matters that people said were mission impossible she's spent her whole life coming up with accomplishments that actually solve problems and i just want to commend senator murray for all of her work on this matter and i think it's very clear that when we get the kind of bicameral bipartisan agreement that addresses the major concerns we're debating here on the floor it is going to be to no small measure because senator murray continued to reach out to all sides i just want her to know how much i appreciate that mr president and colleagues i think we all understand that these are complicated issues and at the same time the challenge of coming up with a bipartisan agreement here is not rocket science in terms of identifying what the issues are there are two issues here mr president one of them is taxes and the other is medicare and the two of them in fact are inextricably linked in many respects because i've heard some on the other side of the aisle say i'll look at ways to reform taxes if colleagues on the democratic side will look at ways to protect medicare and at the same time hold down its cost and we've heard other senators say the reverse and so these issues are really inextricably linked and one of the reasons that i support this budget this evening mr president is that i think this budget provides significant space significant space for democrats and republicans as this process goes forward to produce bipartisan solutions on those two issues the tax question and the medicare issue in the days ahead and let me take just a few minutes senator coats talked about our bipartisan efforts i've had a chance really for the last five years to work with two very thoughtful conservative republicans senator coats and our former colleague senator greg and senator begich and i have been part of a bipartisan team that is in effect seeking to modernize some of the principles that a very big group of democrats and ronald reagan agreed to in the 80s which is to clean out some of these outlandish special interest tax breaks and i see my good friend senator levin here tonight and he is going to outline just some of those outlandish tax breaks we ought to clean them out and use a portion of those dollars to hold down the rates and keep progressivity and in the two years after democrats and republicans did that in the 80s the country created millions of new jobs no one can say that every one of them was due to that tax reform effort but it certainly uh helped and we had senator enzi on the floor earlier this this evening and i've been working with her on something that i think really has been missed in the tax reform debate and that is senator enzi has said when are people going to start talking about the transition rules that you would need to actually implement the tax reform plan because today in a global economy and senator murray and i come from a part of the world that's so trade sensitive here we've got senator enzi talking about something very practical that ought to be very attractive to the most progressive member of the senate the most conservative member of the senate and under the murray proposal those are the kinds of ideas we could be looking at in the days ahead so let me now turn if i might to the medicare issue mr president which again we all understand is right at the heart of when senator murray and congressman ryan and all those who are going to be in a bipartisan conference or negotiating i continue to believe that it is critically important to protect the medicare guarantee something i have battled for since the days when i was co-director of the oregon great panthers and we can do it in a way that will hold down costs this is another area where senator murray has given us a chance to look at some of the solutions that could win support on both sides of the aisle and i'll just touch on them briefly for years now we have had advocates on all sides of the political spectrum talk about the value of merging part a which is the hospital portion of medicare with part b the hospital excuse me the doctors and outpatients part of the program here's a chance colleagues to save billions of dollars while also helping vulnerable seniors hold down some of their out-of-pocket expenses it is there for the doing under the murray budget i think we can forge bipartisan support for it let me move on now to the question of chronic care this is where mr president more than 70 percent of medicare costs go for those who are suffering from heart and stroke and cancer and diabetes now the accountable care organizat organizations which are an important part of the affordable care act are clearly going to help with respect to how we look to treat this population but it is not going to lift all the boats mr president and there are a lot of very effective plans and group practices around the country that are going to give us the opportunity to put in place integrated effective plans to help the sickest among us we ought to pursue it the murray budget is going to give us that opportunity and i'll close simply by saying there's some very good ideas for promoting medicare quality and holding costs down which cost very little such as the approach that senator grassley has given me the chance to partner with them on that would open up for the first time the medicare database so that we would really get a sense of what medicare was paying various doctors and providers for various services so i know colleagues are waiting to speak and i will just wrap up by saying that on the biggest challenges of our time which i think really come down to two issues taxes and medicare the murray budget gives us a chance to come together in a bipartisan way we're not going to get it all done obviously this week but we're going to have a chance to do it and i think in both of these areas taxes and medicare there are senators on both sides of the aisle who can pick up on this budget and find a way to help senator murray and others who are going to participate in in these discussions get us to the solutions that we need that will strengthen our economy and protect our people mr president i yield the floor

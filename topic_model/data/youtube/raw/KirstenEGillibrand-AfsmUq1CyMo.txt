Madam Secretary last month the NTSB issued reports on two rail accidents that occurred last year in Queens New York and Hoboken New Jersey in these reports the NTSB found that engineer fatigue caused by undiagnosed severe obstructive sleep apnea resulted in the crashes in both instances this is not a new issue the engineer of the train that derailed in the Bronx in 2013 also suffered from undiagnosed sleep apnea and this is a problem in other modes of transportation as well including trucking addressing this problem is on the NTS b--'s most wanted list for transportation safety improvements all of this is why I was very troubled when the Department of Transportation announced it was withdrawing a proposed rule on screening rail engineers and truck drivers for obstructive sleep apnea given you have withdrawn the proposed rule making what does DDOT intend to do to address this very real and urgent safety concern senator since you brought it up I would take another look okay thank you very much

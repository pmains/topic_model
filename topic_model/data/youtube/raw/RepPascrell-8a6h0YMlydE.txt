this is CNN the most trusted news news with the revelation that high-level advisors close to president Trump are in constant communication with Russians known to US intelligence during the campaign the issue the president's tax returns becomes more and more critical as our political analyst Carl Bernstein report in the last hour an investigation could touch on potential financial ties if any between mr. Crompton Russia the tax returns could also answer a lot of questions about that as you know he's not releasing them however Congress could actually make it happen Phil Mattingly explains how the only one that cares about my tax returns of the reporters tax returns tax returns tax returns Donald Trump's tax returns people didn't care they voted for him aren't going to be released any time soon let me make this very clear most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like well president Trump is in office not what his look like but even as Trump staff sticks to the line that they won't be released until the completion of an ongoing audit there is actually a way they could become public all I'm trying to do in the Congress what the president couldn't do for himself and that is give us tax returns here's how it would work two committees in Congress have jurisdiction over tax issues the chairman of those committees through an obscure 1924 law actually have the ability to obtain any Americans tax returns including Donald Trump and they have the power to reveal that tax information for any American including Donald Trump it's been done before when it was decided for the public good that lawmakers would vote to release a staff report about then President Richard Nixon's confidential tax return information and that according to congressman bill Pascrell is the same reason he believes the committee should pursue releasing Trump's taxes now the America people on the right path I'm just a conduit here to get the information out to the American people they deserve to know this they deserve to know if their president is dealing in the foreign affairs of other country and whether other countries are dealing in our foreign affairs and if you don't think I'm talking about Russia you're wrong but at least for the moment it's unlikely to happen here's why it's Democrats who are clamoring to use this power and Democrats don't control anything on Capitol Hill that law directs us to look at tax administration only look at private tax returns in the case of the tax administration that is clearly not the case here and congressman Kevin Brady chairs the House Ways and Means Committee and has pushed back hard on the idea that this lines up with the intent of the law at all if you let Congress begin rummaging around for political purposes in the tax returns of the president what stops them from doing it to everyday Americans if that would be an abuse of power Brady's point despite Trump breaking nearly 40 years of precedent on candidates releasing their tax returns there is no specific administrative reason that would force the committee to act and until that arises don't expect Congress to provide any more insight than Trump himself has up to this point and Anders the question is what happens next if Republicans aren't willing to go along with this I asked congressman pastor all that needs to look there's no necessarily a plan B there's an expansion of plan a he's in this for the long term the long game and he believes that every time kind of a new revelation comes out related to Donald Trump and his relationship with Russia or other foreign countries that that could help build support for this he said he's been talking to members on both sides of the aisle he's been talking to his leadership and it's worth noting the Senate committee also has the power to do this he's been talking to them as well but he recognizes it is a long path forward and as I noted in the piece chairman Brady Kevin Brady makes very clear he does not believe this lines up with the intent of the law and until that changes it's very unlikely at least on the house side of things it's going to change anytime soon yeah bill not only full of thanks very much joining me now is former labor secretary newest UC berkeley professor of public policy robert rush author of saving capitalism for the many not the few and with us again CNN political commentator and trump supporter Jeffrey Lord Secretary Rice I mean what do you make of this is this a step the Congress should take it trying to obtain the president's tax returns I do think it is a very important the Congress should take and in terms of it being an administrative matter I can't imagine a more important administrative matter than making sure that our president has not been engaged with a foreign power in this case Russia in basically loading the election and turning the election to his favor now I'm not saying that he's done that but a lot of evidence is accumulating Anderson and every day that goes by they distrust of the public rose and I think one important step that Donald Trump has to make is to disclose his taxes in 2008 for example Donald Trump jr. told a real estate conference that Russia Russian money is pouring into the Trump Organization and that a disproportionate cross-section of their assets come from Russia and he presumably he was talking about Russian tycoons and oligarchs well that's important information that would show up in the tax returns because you can see in terms of interest on loans exactly who is who is who Trump is those miners imagine a more important set of issues my understanding of what he was actually referring to was I guess some a very rich Russian guy bought it wanted a mansion from the Trump's in Florida paid a huge amount of money for it my understand that's what he was referring to but again we don't know for sure because we don't really know the extent of any business dealings they may or man and we need to know I mean I understand if this were just an idle kind of a question about oh wouldn't it be nice to have tax returns it's too bad Donald Trump for the you know violated and broke the tradition for 40 years that would be one thing but we are in the midst of a potential constitutional crisis there there are positives possibly treasonous behavior in terms of staff members or perhaps Donald Trump himself working with Russia and Russian operatives a to actually interfere in the United States 2016 presidential election on behalf

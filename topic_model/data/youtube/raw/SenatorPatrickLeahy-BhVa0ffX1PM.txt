today we're going to hear a testimony from dr raj shah who is the administrator of the united states agency for international development on the agency's fiscal year 2012 budget request most of us know dr shah well and i welcome for being here you know about 15 months ago as administrator he took over took charge of an agency that struggled for many years with serious management programmatic weaknesses i told him at the time to offer him congratulations or condolences but i was delighted he was coming in there we first testified my first testify here last april i said that too often the subcommittee and others had encountered usaid instances of arrogance and detachment from the impoverished reality of the people in countries where usaid operates and we've encountered in the past and i'm saying this in the past poorly designed projects mega contracts that were touted as success stories but which enriched the contractors more than they helped intended beneficiaries and taxpayer money was wasted if you want to change the bureaucracy in any bureaucracy and the change the culture it takes time usaid is no exception i continue to believe strongly that needs to become a more efficient accessible flexible less risk-averse agency towards creativity focuses on building the capacity of people in countries in countries and governments and countries where the united states has interests of course that's just about everywhere in the world but i have seen steady and significant process under administrative shot i i compliment you for that i i mentioned out back and we're talking i've read your speeches i you've not whitewashed where problems are you've talked about them you've addressed them directly and i and i think that's why we see the successes and i believe for as long as i've been either chairman or rank and member of the subcommittee and i have said that contrary to what some say usaid has an essential role to play in projecting u.s global leadership and helping to protect u.s interests around the world i hear that from people in business i hear that from our military i hear it from everybody of your essential interests anyone who doubts that has not seen what i've seen whether it's when president george h.w bush asked me to go to to vietnam and see whether we could use the leahy war victims fund through usaid there or to the west bank and afghanistan to so many other places there are countless examples where usaid has had a profound positive impact in ways that directly advance u.s interests recently i was in haiti that country is going to face daunting challenges for years to come no one can dispute the usa ideas helping save lives and help the people of the country to recover and no one should doubt the fact that when this is right in our own hemisphere if we weren't helping you can imagine the reaction around the world saying nothing about the members of the haitian diaspora and the fact that live right here in the united states so it's uh it's not a question of whether your mission is integral to our national security everyone from president reagan to general petraeus has recognized that it is but i want to know doctor how you're making the changes to ensure that usaid carries out that mission the most cost effective way senator graham staff my staff and our their counterparts and on the house have been working extraordinarily hard to try to one stay within our budget constraints but also make sure we we spend the money wisely uh more than half the fiscal year 2011 has passed we're only now finalizing the budgets which was going to require usaid like other agencies scale back the president has requested significant increases in funding for usaid in fiscal year 2012 because of our security interests around the world i believe much of what he requests is justified i believe it is in our national security interests do more to help build stable democracies and vibrant economies around the world we don't end up in many wars with stable democracies they mentioned people somewhat misinformed about what foreign aid is they think it's a recent poll national poll said that between 20 and 40 percent of our budget of course is less than one percent of our budget and they assume there's a charity in the giveaway but usaid spent 1.6 billion dollars on goods manufactured in the united states 100 times more than it's spent on goods manufactured outside the u.s that's why everybody leaders presidents republicans and democrats and our military leaders have have supported it but there is going to be there will be cutbacks i assume there will be programs eliminated what are some of the give me a couple good reasons to support foreign aid give you some idea of what you think may be cut well i i appreciate the the comment and and the question we you know i believe our performance in places like afghanistan and pakistan are central to our national security priorities we have over the last 15 months dramatically increased our oversight capabilities and operational presence in those places consistent with an integrated civilian military plan that we are enacting with general petraeus in afghanistan and with our colleagues in pakistan we have pursued i think to great effect a strategy and an approach in southern sudan that enabled our diplomatic efforts to be successful by supporting a successful successfully conducted referendum we now keep our fingers crossed and continue to work in partnership to ensure an effective and non-violent resolution to that process in that part of the world and i think in haiti we're making real progress in certain areas i'm proud of our efforts in mobile banking that i think are going to develop an innovative and important mechanism for banking and financial transactions based on mobile phones that will reach many many more patients than the older systems that were more traditional we've seen our efforts to get clean water to people and to build basic systems that do that generate real results and help prevent the further spread of critical diseases like cholera and we know we're making progress on efforts like the industrial park in the north that will create 20 000 jobs and basis for improved housing and economic opportunity in all of these settings our work contributes and is a critical part of our national security and it is how we project our values abroad it is enabling our economy to be more vibrant and dynamic and it's helping to create jobs at home i am at the virtually the end of being willing to support activities in afghanistan when we're not getting the support we should from the afghan government i look what's happening in pakistan they tell the cia don't don't go and attack those people out there killing you or we'll just make sure that we allow people to kill those who are bringing your uh bringing oil to your soldiers who are risking their lives that would just kill the truck drivers as they have several times i mean i i just my frustration was very very high and that's a new england understatement

uh the current democratic majority in the senate have an epiphany and decide to allow a vote they've been blocking for literally years our leader on the keystone pipeline from the beginning uh to the present has been senator hogan the senior senator from north dakota i want to call on senator hope and to give you his thoughts about going forward on keystone pipeline which it looks like we'll be able to do in both the house first and then the senate uh next week john thank you leader i appreciate it just take a minute to talk about the game plan on a keystone xl pipeline approval bill as you know we have a bipartisan bill and we've worked out unanimous consent for a vote first in the house that house vote will be tomorrow friday and then we'll vote on it in the senate on tuesday and this is a bill that it's bipartisan but it's got all 45 senators on board so this is an issue that we've been pushing for quite some time and that we believe that there's very strong support for it's about jobs it's about energy it's about you know building the right kind of energy plan for this country which is important for national security as well and the american public overwhelmingly supports it so we've been working to get a vote for some time on this bill now that clearly the house will pass it overwhelmingly tomorrow but then we'll vote on it tuesday we've got all 45 republicans on board matter of fact all 45 republicans are co-sponsors of this legislation so we need 15 democrats we'll see what happens on tuesday we hope to have 60 votes we'll see but the point i want to make is this all along we anticipated that we'll win on this issue because the american public wants keystone xl approved so in the new congress if we don't get 60 votes on tuesday in the new congress we will have 60 votes and again if you just go through the election results not only did the american people speak but when you look at the candidates we have uh you know 60 votes for the bill then it's up to the president uh you've seen his comments one of his spokespeople that's traveling with him in asia said that that he wasn't fond of the bill and sounds like he may veto it but if he vetoes it then we'll have the ability to bring it back and either attach it to broader energy legislation or maybe an appropriations measure that we think he won't veto again this is about what's good for the american people and so i think we've got a good plan to advance keystone and i want to thank not only our leader but our whole caucus for getting on board and getting behind this important legislation thanks leader

Madam President since this debate began we've heard a lot about how the America Invents Act will help unleash the American inventive spirit i know the distinguished presiding officer has spoken about that let me with a matter of personal pride point out the Vermonters / monitors have a long history of innovation and invented and as I creative spirit that has given rise to some interesting and even revolutionary inventions few people may know the Vermont issued the most patents per capita of any state in the country pure still may know that the first ever patent issued in the United States reviewed by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and signed by George Washington was granted to a vermonter in 1790 who is Samuel Hopkins of Pittsburgh he began the great tradition of American innovation but throughout America's history Vermont has contributed to our economic prosperity with inventive ideas Thaddeus Fairbanks a saint johnsbury patent the platform scale in 1830 it revolutionized the way in which large objects were weighed Chow's orvis a Manchester the founder of the well-known sporting goods retailer orvis patented the open fly fishing reel in 1874 I wife Marcel and I went by the orvis plant just a few months ago and it's fascinating to watch and to see their display of the fishing reels from 1874 to the present but many other inventions originated from Vermont in the early years of America including an electric motor an internal combustion engine and from our landlocked state the paddle wheel steamship today that innovative Vermont spirit continues Vermonters are contributing to the American economy through innovation event every year exploring new ways to modify existing products limit their environmental impact as a quintessentially Vermont idea researchers at the University of Vermont developed by now seeking a patent for a wood finish that releases fewer toxins into the air than standard finishes they do this by utilizing whey protein w aty protein instead of petroleum in the State of the Union address President Obama noted the advances in green technology will be a key driver of our economy in the 21st century by Al Vermont inventors have been and will continue to be out in front of this area in computer technology will also be a driver of our 21st century economy Vermonters are active in producing the next generation of this technology as well viewers across the country were fascinated by the recent appearance of IBM's Watson supercomputer on jeopardy by all components used to power Watson were invented by IBM researchers in vermont and i am sure those Vermonters Bart's proudly is watson defeated jeopardy legends ken jennings and brad rudder the recent man versus machine matchup hi my chart show 1792 2010 obviously there were tens of thousands of other patents in between I'm modernizing the patent system going to help to ensure that Vermont inventors will still be able to compete not just a national stage but in the international marketplace that's something important to every single state represented in this body if we want to compete with the rest of the world I believe Americans can compete with anybody but we have to have a level playing field if we have the cards stacked against us it's very difficult to compete and if we're the ones who stacked the cards ourselves all the worse if we want if we want to have a level playing field area patents we've got to come up with the rest come up to a par with the rest of the industrialized world much has changed in Samuel Hopkins received the first US patent in 1790 but the need for a flexible and efficient patent system is remained concert vendors from Burlington to the Bay Area require the appropriate incentives to invest in the research required to create the next platform scale or the next Watson computer or the next life-saving medical device over the last six years I've worked a meaningful comprehensive patent reform legislation during that time I kept in mind the tradition of great Vermont innovators like Thaddeus Fairbanks and Charles Horvath but has also pleased that we had key Republicans and key Democrats who worked together to get this legislation before the Senate the next generation of Vermonters is as eager as the last to show America in the world what they can produce Vermont may be one of the two smallest states in our nation but it's bursting with creativity America Invents Act was sure the next Samuel Hopkins confers fall into the 21st century

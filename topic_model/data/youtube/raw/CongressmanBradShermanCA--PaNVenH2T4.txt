thank you i now recognize myself for five minutes i'll point out that uh chairman gensler came before our full committee twice last year he'll be coming before us i believe later this year uh more is better but we are certainly doing our job the ranking member points out that the sec has a number of regulatory projects i commend them for having those projects because as the ranking member points out we need clarity uh we need cl there if anything we need another uh project and that is to define a security uh particularly with regard to digital uh the digital world um i would also point out that investor protection is the very best thing we can do for capital formation when we tell it may be a hassle for the individual issuer but when we build a system where investors are confident that's what causes people in this country to invest in in growing businesses now the first question relates to spring-loaded stock options we uh the sec has analyzed these as to whether they are insider trading i'd like you to focus on whether they are in effect a fraud on shareholders in their annual filings they file statements saying that they have a stock option plan in which stock options are going to be granted at fair market value on date of grant well if it's 6 p.m before the the next day you're gonna make the big announcement and you look at the market price with the market not knowing about your upcoming big announcement you can say well that's the market value because that that's what ignorant shareholders bought and sold the stock at but the directors having and and compensation committee they got approval for granting the stock option at fair market value they know the fair market value is going to skyrocket the next day because the big announcement is coming why is it not why are you not enforcing against spring loaded stock options when shareholders are defrauded when those uh when they're told that the option will simply give the grantee a share in future appreciation after option grant date thank you for the question chairman while i can't comment on specific investigations that may or may not exist at this moment i would agree that your hypothetical raises serious fraud concerns the facts that you've laid out would implicate accounting issues on how those options are being accounted for and they would implicate disclosure issues as you mentioned what did the the issuer disclose in its filings what did it say about how i i would hope you would go back and look at the many instances of spring-loaded stock options particularly when in the headline the shareholders who are asked to approve these plans or made knowledgeable plans told that it's going to the option exercise price is going to be fair market value on the option grant date and then they may define fair market values what the market closed at which is usually true except the market closed right before the big announcement i want to move on to another question uh you've gone after xrp because xrp is a security but you haven't gone after all the major crypto exchanges that process tens of thousands if not far more transactions if xrp is a security and you think it is and i think it is why are these crypto exchanges not uh in violation of law and is it enough that the crypto exchanges have said well having committed tens of thousands of violations of the past we promise not to do any more in the future is that enough to get you off the hook for enforcement so again i can't talk about what matters we're looking at or not looking at uh we have brought exchange cases we brought one last year against poloniex i share your concerns that if the securities are it it's easier to go after the small fish than the big fish but the big fish operating the major exchanges did many many tens of thousands of transactions with xrp you know it's a security that means they were illegally operating a securities exchange they know it's illegal because they stopped doing it even though it was profitable so if they know it's illegal and you know it's illegal and i know it's illegal i hope you'd focus on on that uh and then um uh finally uh we have tether which is broke and a mutual a money market mutual fund in every way um it broke the buck um can you i realize you're reluctant to talk about individual matters but can you tell us why you went after tara but uh but not tethered again it would be inappropriate for me to comment on who we're going after or not going after but i i understand your concerns and we've added resources to our crypto assets unit to to look at issues that put investors at risk including the issues you've raised in your questions add fortitude and courage as well you're going to have to take on some cases that you're not certain of winning

let me just take you quickly to what my district looks like and I can tell you that the tax cuts and Jobs Act has been nothing but positive and so I feel bad for my friends they haven't had that experience but this is reality of what actually happens in the Indiana second district I would take you to a place where there's hard-working Hoosiers middle-class families in Indiana and this is what I see with them working families that really benefit from the doubled tax credit that we talked about earlier a remarkable three and a half percent unemployment rate which is lower than the national average a great American manufacturer in my district named smoker craft has raising wages they've been awarding bonuses and reinvesting capital I've got a community bank not only raising wages but increasing tuition reimbursement awarding stock to its employees and almost by far lower electricity prices across my whole district in the state of Indiana all this and more is what tax cuts and job X is about and so I can proudly in boldly stand here today and talk about the fact that the my constituents in my district have more money in their pocket these are hardworking people hard-working Hoosiers they're not the 1% that you all have been arguing about one employee at a company I was touring told me just recently that these aren't the benefits that he has right now are not the crumbs as speaker Pelosi told them and told the country it's real money for him and it's real money for his family and so dr. you can just wanted to ask you given the dynamics of what you just heard about one place in this country what do you believe could have been the primary drivers of what I'm seeing as economic growth in the last two years because surely what I'm saying can't be a nuance it can't just be coincidence and it can I have happened by accident I think there are a couple things to point to one that hasn't been talked much today but is enormous has been the deregulatory efforts of the Trump administration during the eight years of the Obama administration it enacted a costly regulation at an average rate of one point one per day the total self-reported cost of those regulations with eight hundred ninety billion dollars of a hundred billion each year and in the the first two full years of the truck ministration that regulatory burden has declined by 1 billion so it essentially just stopped it in his tracks in all of the the business surveys this is a key component of what they perceived as a better business climate probably reflected in in your in your district the second which I outlined much more detail in my testimony was the the sort of increase in business investment were rapid economic growth feedbacks to tentatively productivity and certainly we've seen wages rising the timing of that coincides with the tax cuts and javac some of that may diminish over time it could be just short run but the incentives on the business investment slider are quite strong I'm hopeful will persist but time will tell and I'm glad you brought that up because I am very thankful to this President to president Trump for coming in and with the Republican majority at the time one of our first priorities was repeal regs and set people free to do what they want to do to hire we're a very large manufacturing district one of the largest in the country we export we're the fifth largest exporter and I saw that in the state of Indiana as well when mitch Daniels was our governor and we had an opportunity to come into our state roll back those regs investment boomed and skyrocketed there was an uptick in in employees as well and I much appreciate that appreciate the this administration's effort on that as well thank you for your comments and I yield back my time mr. chairman thank you I thank the gentlelady the

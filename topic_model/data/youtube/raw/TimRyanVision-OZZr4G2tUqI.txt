first and foremost I think we're learning a lot mr. speaker about what it really means to prepare young kids for an education today and i believe the brain science that is unfolding in our country and around the world is helping us better understand exactly how young minds work and our own brains work and i think it's smart for us to send more power back to the local districts and then support programming that can help kids learn better and the component of this bill the student support and academic enrichment grant program allows through helping to educate well-rounded kids focusing on well-rounded education folk safe and healthy schools gives local school districts an opportunity to invest in programs like the social and emotional learning programs that are going on around this country it's an interesting study a meta-analysis of about 213 programs 270,000 kids who are participating in social and emotional learning programs saw an eleven percent i'll point increase in test scores that closes the achievement gap we've seen a ten percent increase in pro-social behavior a ten percent decrease in antisocial behavior a 20-percent swing and the behavior of the kids and we have great programs like the mind up program which goldie hawn started that's having a tremendous impact across the country in my own congressional district in warren city schools we've seen the inner resilient social and emotional learning program in one of our schools we've seen a sixty percent reduction and out-of-school suspensions sixty percent reduction and these programs are having significant benefits if you look at the qualities that a young person needs I believe this bill helps us get back to redefining what the common core is and in my estimation the common core is are we teaching kids mental discipline the ability to be aware the ability to be focused the ability to cultivate one of the key components to a successful life and that's the ability to regulate your own emotional state this comes well before science technology engineering and math teaching these key fundamental characteristics mental discipline physical discipline focus concentration self-regulation key components before you even get to the academic side of things the other component in here is creating healthy schools this gets into the shizz this gets into the food that these kids eat if the kid is not getting if the student is not getting healthy foods they are not going to be able to concentrate they're not going to be able to have a high energy level they're not going to be able to do well academically to me the self-regulation the awareness the attention the healthy foods the healthy environment those I thank the gentleman those are the building blocks before we even get to the academic component of what happens in the classroom so I want to I want to thank the committees and the conference committee for putting this all together and just recognize that I believe there is a new way of educating our kids emerging here there's a new Common Core developing and that's the mental discipline in the physical health of our young people and I yield back the balance of my time how you

Thank You mr. speaker this past week President Trump and Secretary Pompeo took a bold step to affirm Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights I support this administration and our longtime friend and ally Israel in this fight to protect their homeland I've sit on those mountains of the goal and where Abraham and his nephew lot parted ways some four thousand years ago I could hear the cannons and the missiles and the tanks just miles away in war stricken Syria we learned how in a matter of hours during the Yom Kippur War in 1974 Syrian forces over in the Golan jeopardizing both Israeli and American security this small range of mountains less than 125 miles from Jerusalem serves as a buffer between Israel and its many foes who desire nothing more than to wipe them off the face of the earth from the 3rd millennium BC the occupants of the Golan Heights have included the amorite s-- arameans israelites assyrians Babylonians Persians the Israelites again Alexander the Great and the Roman Empire in later centuries Christians crusaded Mongols ruled and they occurred the land starting in 1885 in 1885 Jewish families but and lived in the land in the Golan Heights and stayed there until 1920 when riots drove them out for the next 40 years the valerie's of this area were debated and defined by the French and the British we all know the State of Israel was born in 1948 and the Golan was mutually shared with neighboring countries this however led to constant raids and civil unrest in the region and debate over a scarce item in the area water finally in the 1960s Syria ignored previous water agreements and attempted to divert water from Israel this led to the armed war over water which is won by Israel in 1967 and pushed the Syrians out of the Golan leaving Israel in control once again and this is where most leftist naysayers will begin their history as if Israel had no claim to the land in the first place or as if it never had been contested this matters for America for a variety of reasons set aside the fact that Israel's our most loyal and strategically viable ally in the Middle East let's look at Russia Americans are rightly concerned learn about the cyber and geopolitical moves of that adversarial nation the Golan however is example where those on the left are turning a blind eye since the time of Peter the Great and Catherine the Great Russia has sought a warm water port in the Mediterranean and to stake their claim to land south of the Black Sea not only does the Syria provide them both it also prevents an opportunity for Russia and their ally Iran as our leaders have said to wipe Israel off the map we cannot let this happen we mustn't let this happen we must continue to stand up to thugs like Putin and Assad and with our friends in Israel mr. speaker no collusion no collusion no collusion that's right after two years mr. speaker let me say that again there is no collusion after two years and a cost of more than 25 million first that's $50,000 a day's spin on this witch-hunt of taxpayer money there was no collusion and indeed there was no pot of gold at the end of the media's rainbow nothing besides fool's gold yet again mr. speaker how can you spend fifty thousand dollars a day on an investigation as I think back we may have been the first person the chamber to call this investigation for what it was a witch hunt I'm not a lawyer but Kansas common sense which suggests if there was no collusion no corrupt intent by the President and no crime committed there would be absolutely no case for an obstruction of justice charge but I'm sure Kansas common sense is the last thing on summing of members of Congress's minds so now during every waking hour for 675 straight days Democrats in the media I've had a field day smearing the president his friends and his family they've hired 19 lawyers 40 FBI agents and this issued nearly 3,000 subpoenas all which have further confirmed what we already know before the investigation started there was no collusion importantly Mueller conformed that no one with the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government additionally we found out through this investigation the Russians made many attempts to offer to help the Trump campaign and time and time again the Trump team stood up and rejected Russia I want the media who spent thousands of hours painting a picture of collusion and conspiracy to cover these mueller findings that show the president stood firm against the russia's multiple attempts I asked the Democrats who missed the putt misled the public for months to come forward and speak the truth but instead what is the biased media and Democrats say in response to Mueller's verdict absolutely nothing you can almost hear a pin drop as I walked through the capitol day it's so quiet and no Democrats are here today for morning hour debate why does that say so I stand today on the House floor today I have but one question for this chamber and for this nation can we please move on and work rather than against him and focus on policy rather than fantasy I miss expired Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back the chair now

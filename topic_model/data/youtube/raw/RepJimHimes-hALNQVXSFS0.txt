Mr Speaker I have the privilege of serving on the House Intelligence Committee and just yesterday in a hearing entitled worldwide threats i SAT with the Chiefs of our intelligence services to learn about those worldwide threats the meeting was classified but the summary is this there are people out there who would count it a smashing success to reap death and destruction on the homeland and yet my Republican friends have engineered a situation where in two days the Department of Homeland Security will shut down and it's not because they don't have an alternative to get in the way of the president's immigration initiative a judge in Texas ruled with them now I think that judge is going to be overturned but a judge ruled with them and yet they are going to shut down the Department of Homeland Security I don't understand that but I've got two questions if we shut down DHS and heaven forbid there's a natural disaster that destroys a community in Oklahoma in Connecticut what are we what are you going to people if heaven forbid one of those people who wishes this nation's ill succeeds and the Department of Homeland Security is shut down what will we what will you tell the American people

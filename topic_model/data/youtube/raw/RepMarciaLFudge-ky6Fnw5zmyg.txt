miss fudge I think you're next thank you very much mr. chairman and thank you all for being here for your testimony mr. chairman here we are again we are here at the same place we were before talking about states rights here we are again moving back in time to a place where we want to ignore established law we want to once again put States in a position to make a determination as to who should work and who should not we have a come to a point where we are disproportionately once again affecting populations who are poor in populations of color I listened to the governor talk about what happened back in 1953 mr. Nix talked about what happened in 1944 that was before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 it was before the Voting Rights Act of 1965 it was before non-discrimination labor laws so let's not talk about the past let's deal with established law

Arts in the country and he is committed is to dance for excellence creativity and innovation for the benefit of individuals and communities all across the country for this leaders 2018 we have an operating budget of 163 million dollars to give you a sense for what the NIH funds on the left-hand side you can get a sense for these eligible infused to apprise me in game and it's important to note that we support projects so on the right hand side adults to me so the MU times nonprofits local government agencies educational institutions and tribal communities you see on right hand side a quick little short summary of activities and entities that we are not able to fund and this really includes general operating support we're asking for any applications who commit a particular project to police suggestions purchased or renovations as well as great individual artists so let's just run through some of the basics without possibility to apply to the onion there's the requirement you must

be creative that's how you meet that once one map and it can be achieved in a variety ways including your income conceded sale or in-kind donations of space the magico for the accommodation abuse or consider volunteer hours or services towards the process to give you a sense for how the NEA reviews applications to our grant program first we conduct all of our application reviews by a peer review panel this is made up of experts in the field the panelists are diverse and terms of geography gender ethnicity and expertise and reflect the particular artistic disciplines that you might be assigned to the review criteria for all of our applications and those are at legislative review criteria that we follow in our application review once the peer-review complete service tell emergency service minutes the National Council the arts for review and approval and finally the last step that use of the council makes recommendations for signed off by the NEA chairman now it's really important to note but it's applications not recommended for grants we encourage them to find out why by calling it so close best comments application is to support you as you put together your application just to give you a sense with its various funding categories at the NEA the first is our partners disagreement we also offer grants or organization necessarily going to be the bulk of what I'm going to talk about today with all of you and last we have grants for individuals which are limited to creative writing fellowships and translations projects notes that each application and submit one application for organizations for here with some exceptions besides cover so the best thing I mentioned were partnership agreement and I bring up the slides it's important to note that the way the NDA operates is we grant out funding 40% of our funding so the 50 designated State Arts agencies territories and regional arts organizations Illinois arts implementation agreement each year with the NEA and so that's also one of the source for funding as you pursue your projects so this is gives you an overview as well as of the six regional art agencies that support your region so now let's get into the NEA artworks category this is really the bread and butter of grant portfolio here at the NEA and we typically meet around 2,000 grams each year's organizations all throughout the United States applications are submitted to one of our 15 discipline programs and we have a deadline or July deadline each year so you must select which of those two deadlines you will suffice you funding is available for all stages of the artistic process including creations presentation exhibitions arts education and enrichment as well services to the field such as art common business professional development it's important to note that we fund the large and small projects existing a new project and promise sexy place in any part of 50 states DC and US territory already require at least one Clemente as I mentioned before and in the art market category rain from ten thousand to a hundred thousand dollars in grant funding and typically for others it stands one two years up on the screen now you'll just see these 15 program disciplines across the agency as you are selecting an application to go into the NEA for review you're going to want to take a look at which discipline you should apply for based on the content of your project in our discipline programs have different product types which you can see on our grant guidelines change on our website you can be thinking about a specific project or instead of activities and not an entire season or your programming please keep in mind as of February and us deadlines and note that some different project types might be funded at each deadline furnace communities and design two of those disciplines have only a February deadline so you definitely want to take a look at the guidelines there and just reminder that each of these disciplines have dedicated staff and we're very accessible every employee of use and smell odor website as well as the direct contacts or program specialist to help guide you through the application process so we certainly encourage you to reach out to us in addition artwork challenge Marisa is our other program categories so an organization must decide whether to apply to artwork or challenge America versus butcher this category is really what we like to call the gateways to the NEA it's an early support smaller mid-sized organizations that are focused on extending the reach of arts underserved communities under the skirt is defined by organizations or communities that are limited by geography ethnicity economics or disability we have an annual deadline in this category which is an angel and these are all straight ten thousand dollar grants with very specific project types you can apply this for a guest artist project which would refer to an arts event or events that will feature what a were deaf artist could apply for cultural tourism specifically the unifies the most enough community-wide art exhibitions or the development of cultural tourism projects or you could apply to public arts project which is intended primarily support visual arts such as murals earth sculptures that are felt throughout a meaningful community engagement process so Cory are $10,000 to still require that one's one that the next category of program that they have here at the NEA for grant making use our town so keep in mind you get an application both to either the art work or telemedicine category as well as the arts and grant programs and this particular two programs that I managed under graded placemaking so this is for critics leading projects to support the integration of arts culture and design activities in the efforts of strengthening communities by advancing local economic physical and words social outcomes and there's two types of funding that are available in category the one that is probably most relevant to the folks on the call if I play space program place-based projects that include arranges arts engagement cultural planning design activities or creative industry support and requires partnerships between of local governments and a non-profit and one of the partners must be arts culture or design organization as well as have the letter of support from the highest-ranking officials within your community so that could be a title in theatres it could be the mayor or your town manager and this program that has an annual opportunity in September and grants generally range from $25,000 so we currently have from the art grant guidelines of water with so take a look at those and a great resource really get started is our exploring our town three books which features case studies of various projects that we have funded through the our town program the path you can dive into these 77 specific studies of communities of all shapes and sizes to really get a sense for what might be competitive in this program category so this website includes large sites small urban projects rural and tribal projects as well as the wide range of artistic activities that take place I'm going to very quickly glaze over our individual categories because there it's very limited to literature fellowships these are fellowships for individuals in the areas of creative writing for streamflows this program for individuals having large deadlines and these are straight $25,000 grants that do not require an excess amount there is also older two zones - for translation which is our December deadline so these are for individuals individual services for translations that enable recipients translate work in prose poetry drama from other languages into English and in some sources like that this is our only category for particular individuals the way that we encourage artists and designers to use in project mannequin doesn't support is by working with an organization on a particular project activity we have one of their categories here at the NEA that I wanted to cover which is our research artwork program we have a really robust office of research and analysis and the research artwork strengths support research that investigates the value and work impacts of the art we have surveys of the Scoobies enough over deadlines and rich generally ranging from thirty thousand to a hundred thousand and include projects that might be experimental or quasi-experimental designs oftentimes these projects come from the universities and lastly you certainly spend some time on our website you can be any introduces a wide range of research publications and analyses on topics affecting artists and arts organization we do an annual

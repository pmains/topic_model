I thank the gentleman for for yielding and also for engaging in this dialogue with other members about the challenge that we're facing to reduce this country's deficit spending and reduce the accumulating debt and at the same time to make certain that quality affordable health care are available to all of our citizens and as the gentleman has pointed out very very able those two challenges are intricately related in fact one of the main reasons for supporting health insurance reform is because we simply must reduce our deficit spending and must reduce this country's debt one of the main contributors to our country's escalating that is is the kind of escalating of health care costs that we've seen in recent years it's one of the greatest threats to families to businesses to the overall economy health care has become the fastest growing component of the of the federal budget as the gentleman well knows last year health care accounted for 17.3 percent of GDP that's more than twice the average of other developed nations now the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act corrects the failures of the current system without compromising the many strengths that we know that it has and so it's very disconcerting here in this first week of the new Congress to see our Republican colleagues not only going after the protections in the health care law but also almost immediately abandoning their a commitment to fiscal discipline now the figures that I saw this morning show that this is Congressional Budget Office the nonpartisan arbiter of budget decisions for for this body the Congressional Budget Office has has said that the repeal of of health insurance reform as proposed by by the Republicans would cost the federal budget 230 billion dollars over the next ten years that's a revised estimate I understand even greater than was earlier earlier thought that that is an astounding figure our Republican friends have made a big show out of their commitment to deficit reduction but they've made an exception they've clearly made an exception for the repeal of health insurance reform so not only is this a bad health care no not only would it for example say to families who only now are being able to ensure their children with pre-existing conditions no we're going to go back to the back to the old way where the insurance companies can deny coverage to your children what about those families that now are able to include their 24 25 year olds on their family policies no they're saying go back to the old way where where that wasn't possible what about our Medicare recipients who finally are going to get some relief from these uncovered drug expenses the so-called doughnut hole they're saying oh no you're going to have to once again pay those full expenses so it's certainly bad policy in terms of health care but then to add insult to injury adding two hundred and thirty billion dollars to this country's debt burden over the next ten years is and to do that without batting an eye without any kind of recognition that this has an impact on the budget deficit that that is that's just almost unbelievable that the Republicans would be so audacious has proposed this in the first week of this new Congress and then to add another insult of the injury they're violating their very own pledge of openness in the way this is going to be considered I'm sure the gentleman has been watching as I have the Rules Committee all day today it's astounding yesterday there was this commitment to open rules to open debate to the offering of amendments today they're saying we're going to shut it down it's an up-or-down vote maybe we'll get around later to to some of these other questions some of the repair aspect of a repeal and repair but right now we're just going to we're just going to repeal it and let the chips fall that is that is horrible procedure it's a shutting down of this Congress before we even start it's horrible budget policy it's horrible health policy it's a very very bad way to start this Congress and I appreciate the gentleman for calling us together tonight to to to to talk about this because we need to talk about it we need to think about it we need to fight it in every way we can thank you very much mr. price

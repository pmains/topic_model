I'm also here is a boring one reminded me of the last time he was that we were together back in the 90s and the furlough days of the dot-com bubble when there were a group of us who on paperwork all their very wealthy for a while and these to bring in startups and a mid-weight consider depending on how many glasses of wine you even got a thumbs up or thumbs down Bruce reminded me of the fact that he was one of the only three companies that actually I return on the investment in a nightmare thank us for that in the running a over success start each better in resting so you know I wear that hat is what a couple of other housekeeping and time I thank them y'all ready going to development folks for letting us use on this case you are the odds here to play 21 this kind of conversation I'm going to also recognize Alan Burke who is a former president of George Mason University how many have you know in the notion of how we think about universities as potential incubators both on the equity side and on social purpose side and I hope we want to make sure that the subjective heartless conversation I also want to recognize a couple folks from my staff to in particular in a big way and that votes were did all that work to give us your pain that managed to harass my lang you all to get you out to relatively early on a Tuesday how much today this morning and you know I also i was thinking this morning whether i should come you know new world were old tires my second season eight eyes but considering the fact that I you know worked on me a tech investor into a politician I thought it were like you I do acknowledge probably community that in the Senate I am with my background it telkom particularly comment since I was profound with nextel and the only politician says okay give yourself up on probably the only we've got about 75 different investments most of all telecom nitey space people assuming that I'm very well technology first the truth is is that come through in the conversation I was very current and most everything on the technology side circuit two thousand foot means about a decade behind but that still puts me at least a decade we had approached of my colleagues you a little sense of what we're dealing with when we talk about something with as much potential for also potential pitfalls as proudly since I am useless without at least 12 hour presentation and I promise I'll not go through we all my whole powerpoint on the budget and happy deficit i'm going to try to do this whole thing today without mentioning those terms again but i didn't want to take you through a couple of quick slides just to set up the panelists who will be coming on and all them take my seat and anxious quieres is as everyone here from a lobbyist for some of the leading lights in this area harshest if you listen to last night's debate between the presidential candidates you get this constant refrain every elected official says you know we love small businesses the truth the matter is if you look at this good data recent data by Kauffman Foundation if you look at where all the net job growth has come in America in the last 25  30 years it is not coming on what we would call traditional small business it's not much i'm elated you know dry cleaners the barber shops and hardware stores are expanding an exponential rate and we also know that it's not coming from fortune 500 even though mix that fortune 500 companies to change in traumatic virtually all of the net new job that are great at the Great America last 30 years have company starts companies they're calling the cell phones i'm not sure what the terms correctly the correct way to describe it turns out most of them are technology with my no means are they all technology i think about the tremendous success story at the Baltimore of our own in terms of apparently hold the in terms of food there's a lot of startup activity going on but we've seen that sort of different particularly sense of financial crisis of 2008 start your compliment this is an interesting slide but a little bit a little bit I think deceiving in that it sources where do these startups where do these measures find their finance resources you look at this most of these show that mistakes all businesses and remember that the vast majority always to sail something that we're going to have to make sure we help educate the crowd is they start to think about Ewing in crowdfunding namely social good activity into potentially every hundreds but most of the original source financing comes from the soul pride from their personal resources family credit card the amount of bad ones again disproportionately to our sole proprietor if you're talking about the start of companies that are actually generate employees those numbers on the back side and go down to that the venture capital trouble is really quite small now again I'm biased too much cabbage we always thought our money was more expensive than others because we thought there was going to be value add that money in terms of in terms of being able to help nourish and support a adventure through its through its growth I will say and probably 200 companies that I investigated I have never ever seen an entrepreneur ever me whose number forget intimacies listen that anybody is going to ever make a straight line the success just isn't the case and as we introduced the ability access to a whole new message making sure if I understand that no matter how good the spam books if chances are it's not going to play out that way it's going to be a challenge to make sure we upload next slide this just reinforces what we all well even within the venture capital funding humanity we've seen a dramatic decline of dollars invested from a peak of a 40-plus billion dollars in 2010-2011 about 10 billion dollars in the financial crisis washed out about half of the venture capital funds in America the amount of private equity that is growing in startups gone down and the venture capital companies that happen there are still in the space the vast majority of them have moved out of the very very early seed-stage funding cycle because the suggest the ones have gotten more and more daughters behind me and it's harder and harder for a venture capital fund with its expected rate of return to do that early early stage CCAP so what are we looking when you have a time of receipt capital we're looking at the fact that most of the angel networks of America that work not just the kind of dinner club we had here Greater Washington area that we're all over stinking ear but most of them have been failures and while it remains a vibrant angel network for example and missile invalid the idea of angel networks even in major metropolitan areas like Washington DC have dramatically decreased and that's here in an area Washington particularly in Northern Virginia where we have a higher percentage of tech firms and virtually anywhere else in the nation think about as challenging is it maybe if you are an entrepreneur in this province point of starting up here as hard as it is here thank you were trying to do the same start in handing over chicken or enrollment pitcher and the potential who are proud from the entire solution to be a tool in small and mid-sized market america is really one of the areas that i am most excited about in the end of the panelists the continent because my feeling has been to an event on microgravity but the part of the the opportunity that came out of the information age revolution was the fact that no matter what venture it is you could go anymore between them more cosmic being held in delhi and shanghai well they're going to be built in those cities they ought to be able to build and wealth and martinsville part of the products information is that we have not gotten light in this country's shouldn't have to leave your hometown the final five job in that promise is going to become a reality and you've got that ability particularly we can both give nothings in you know just do that start up in that small community you're going to have to find access to capital and again I think crowdfunding even kind of the traditional sources of financing particularly for smaller communities can be a potential one true win now what are we at here where we have today you will notice most of crowdfunding today in terms of prior to this the JOBS Act which in the moment crowdfunding has been not based upon an equity return model it's been more based upon what kind of perks what kind of product placement you know what are the upside potential short of effort and there's been some wonderful success stories we let the founder of indigo who is one of the most successful woman here scores of Kickstarter we know about these platforms but one of the things that has changed and in doing the only cross-section of people in the Greater Washington area that actually know there was something called the JOBS Act there was actually legislation in congress passed in a bipartisan fashion this year that i offered the JOBS Act be home my original version start from point O and as the small bill that nobody may have heard of it may change the world jobs at did basically two things one y job back said let's make it easier for companies to go public one of the things we found in the Acrobat at the dot-com bomb and bubble was that that the process of foreign public was some of the scandals around him on and so forth we came in and tightened up reporting tightened up County and get a number of things were starving Ashley because perhaps to access Capital Markets public markets is too easy in the 90s but is often the case of the same with all of the case Congress never gets fully light first time we are over tighten those regulations the jobs at the jobs at from one basically release and remove some restrictions and sarbanes-oxley so if we get to the state and ventures can access the public market it will be much easier the source of what we want to talk about today though is this notion of can we use private money as a source of equity just start of interest we this is very much a work in process again wish to speak to this and I'm nutshell for those of you who don't follow it as closely a decision kind of first time and it basically said eventually can raise up to a million dollars for folks under $100,000 in relatively small increments so the risk half over the set the lesser of our great working for 2005's on your income if you are greater than one hundred thousand dollars in income you can do up to ten percent of your income up to a capital A Thousand what this may also find an honor thank the folks from openings to you imagine as the conversations were yesterday one of the one of the outcome of crowdfunding trousers maybe that we discover a much larger pool of accredited investors then that's oh I said kind of technology again one of the things about the securities law mr. said most of you will probably notice we assume that anyone that doesn't meet the criteria of a credit investment Lee involves net worth of two hundred thousand dollars in income is basically I'm not very sophisticated investor and needs extra protections we assume that everybody that passes those magic lines is brilliant and can lose money landing him I'm not sure that cliff is the exact right of dividing line but there needs to be something like I think anisha's going to speak to this in his comments and again I like this this tool this is real time trying to figure this out the SEC Brad any of you supposed to get there the regulation is finished by the end of the year part of the challenge is we we've given the SEC an awful lot to do in the last couple of years I am terms of God finance regulations do in to fail it's a little curious at the same time we've given them a lot more gentle particularly some of my colleagues house basically cut off all the time another such story but you need to make sure they get this balance right now I see to that are our hands and again we're going to see then you go you know that we've got to go around every that's not the folks here this is the question that I won't even panel with one how are we going to make this determination between accredited non-accredited investors what's the white cuts how do we get this right number two how do we think about these platforms in the standpoint of hope not only private equity raise but hybrid public-private moms are there going to be social purpose with the potential of some earthly upside is there is there a collaboration model that curve this question again around you know how do we use this tool not just in communities like our region here where there's lots of our high tech savvy people but are there ways that we can help jumpstart this kind of tool in smaller communities that are candidly and leave this kind of opportunity as much as any because of traditional black of traditional fancy you can be factored things just aren't going to be back in this model of early-stage fancy on any sophisticated basically and funding how do we make sure and this is going to be the challenge we're in zeal and some of us bring to the table that we've got to get right how do we make sure that the crowd makes these investments are going to be educated enough to understand that even when you have a successful company I've had many many early early stage investments where if you don't do the follow button out you washed out of there would how does it explain if a company is up on top of five years later and that early stage crowdfunders who puts in a small amount of money somehow didn't realize that they were having to continue to invest in maintaining the position how we going to make sure that not only our future capital calls every time how are you going to get all of this right and how do we not do it with so many cumbersome regulations again that we snuff out this tremendous opportunity at its outset this is an extraordinarily exciting tool I think if we did this one it could democratize the ability to access to capital in white unprecedented I think we've got a lot of work to do about you know also on the scanner standpoint of how much value add platforms going to put in terms of assessing the quality the plans for coming forward that is a wide open question that I'm again anxious to hear what panels to go through and so I grateful for everybody being here I'm grateful for this great panel with God he's going to acknowledge the run a lot more under go ahead and introduce emotion particular background I thank all of you competing this is an exciting exciting opportunity 20 days from now we go go to Lynette repress the United States when we add one hunnit oriole comment not a partisan life but I quite frankly think that getting our debt getting a budget deal done and figuring this out this tool loud may actually have more positive economic impact on job creation over the next five to ten years and anything was talked about last night yeah Belinda and you know for politician and and great questions by the way thank you this being a panel on crowdfunding we want to make sure it's also a panel that take a lot of crowd-sourced questions as well and we're hoping to have a very lively discussion today and with your in hope so we're talking about something that's very near and dear to any entrepreneurs heart access to capital capital it's absolutely critical to being able to invade and to be able to create jobs and grow our client which is pretty as we all agreed so we all know how hard it is to raise capital and especially the post 2008 what is considered early stage is much later I can test to that and all my efforts to raise capital and so this is a very exciting development and we don't really know yet exactly how it's going to play out so let's get started I want to introduce first from the venture capital an early stage seed-stage funding perspective tom white men he's the managing director of CIT gap punt sketchy gap focus on in c stage eglee more than 30 equity CDH investments 30 million dollars in private e private equity investment into its portfolio companies 9 portfolio companies to series a investment and several to actually so that's always a thing i want to also introduce Aneesh Chopra maybe if you know him as President Obama's chief technology officer he is also the senior advisor to the advisory board before he joined President Obama it was Virginia's secretary of Technology and previously a managing director advisory board for those of you who don't know it publicly traded camping tank slava rubin CEO and founder of indy gogo indiegogo as you soften senator waterslides is one of the preeminent crowdfunding platforms Slava's been some very interesting working there's millions of dollars week by week raised for companies around causes entrepreneurial creative and slava recently was at the White House at the sign of the moon Jones Act Alice mean joins me now she used kickstarter as a platform for your patent pending invention alice is the founder of top caps and ask you lots of questions about how that worked for you I'm entering the founder and CEO of small not it is a community crap platform for very small businesses it uses a partner and the board model I want to find out a lot more about how that works so what's coffee cups yoga studios small business leaders in the community being able to get access to capital which is very hard to get from a bank so I am Linda wittstock I'm an entrepreneur and the founder of music which is a crowd sourcing platform on mobile big data and it is my third business and this is one that's been tough to raise money or we bootstrapped faith or ocean finally close to revenue were finally close to closing an equity man touch review so I'm very excited and self-interested I suppose to hear about all the different ways that crowded one day so let's start by putting crowdfunding in context some 2.8 billion dollars in 2012 according to my solution research company will be raised using crowdfunding platform so it's not exactly new I wanted to know from Slava first how do you think this is going to change the world the equity component of all of this is it as a game soon as we think it very well could be no one collection here was alive back when Los Angeles which was about nineteen thirty three houses away Securities Act 9 30 degree but just to give a little bit of background let's do a really fast history so in the lady chief engineer the Statue of Liberty dispatch in the reinvention crowdfunded was you were going to know this but dispatch the base was free sorry the statue was free but the base costing like three hundred thousand dollars so private investors were able to provide half of it and at a time Joseph Pulitzer used what his meeting with technology was the newspapers be able to reach out I know where few weeks raise the other half of the money the amazing thing is not so they raised the money in the rather off the average contribution was something like 83 cents so that's how many people have you gotten well they got no I put in return I do a name on a break they just got to be part of freedom and it really works so that can happen in the late eighteen countries what can happen as you move forward so then you have a 1933 these passes which doesn't allow anybody to invest and less credit investors IPO is all that good stuff fast forward again anything other than PR and the kind of show that you can use the radio and TV and you can actually raise money through a crowd and get more people to start funding things passport again you have the internet social media and what happens is in the middle there back when 93 happen and sorry i simplify this but you have people who are not so nice arms you as we say grandma in rural Virginia and Standard Oil in Oklahoma so you should just get these to this narrow it is a great on the way of my one other attorneys and what happened was there was no oil return that she do in the oil they brought his grandma that just sucked he could grab a place and she said to like the local government people the senator that hey I don't want to be the products they had to figure out system okay no one else can't talk to Grandma you know know what grandma can invest so we're going to be sec or an idea or whatever Frederick message now the interesting thing happens in you know eat / watches in January 2008 and just to give a tiny bit of background I'm sorry me over one he rode here but the reason we've got to this is my dad died of cancer around the canned sauce 14 and you can remember the middle of the last decade were all old enough to remember the middle of last decade which was you have 2005-2006 you can think about it that you quite a long time ago so you have a Twitter nascent YouTube is not owned by Google Facebook is smaller than myspace Obama practically not a word except for maybe in this town and making money on the internet was actually quite challenging so my too profound and I want one on the board with here the other I've been raising money through Investment Banking with for small businesses and filmmakers and I have been trying to raise money for a cause we're all sharing our experiences and at the time prosper would brand new to purity Ramon and Amazon's are you doing well and ebay was very doing well you Kiba yep darling president clinton it's kind of like there's something very interesting here but why is it that this all about gatekeepers gets the funding so we thought why not launch an equity crowdfunding platforms is problems or a concept and right away found out about the laws so maybe we should do that but we thought that there was there there we thought that even though can't get equity in return people with still funding because there's really four reasons why we fund anything in life number one because they care about the person the cause of the idea number to us but they want the purchase in return the product the service or experience number three they want to be part of the community like statue liberty or number four they won't profit they want to give one doll and they want to get five dollars back so we thought the other first three are interesting in the gut and the SEC will establish so we respond to Gary 2000e now distribute million dollars every week and at a meta level two years ago there was a campaign on IndieGoGo called the crowdfunding campaign to change without funding law and he was actually the campaign that got the money to create the petition to send to Congress I'm not trying to take credit for the entire job that exciting but they call Spinrad was one of Africa's people invited to the White House as part of the society because pop stimulate some discussion let's make it all meal so there's Samantha from a person from New York but she's from upstate near the equivalent of you know middle of nowhere Virginia and she had an incredible small business two years of operable small business with his dessert company and she went to the local bank back in 2010 to get a loan and all signs point that she should be getting alone profitable two years past that clip or banks whenever to be alone so she could get a loan in and give her alone it was really disappointed so she came on TV go to raise money the amazing thing is now she sells her product in over 40 states in America and she's hired many people she was actually the only person on stage and correlating the crowdfunding with President Obama right because he basically was like oh command issues like who is going to you like 24 years old like this is what it's all about right this young woman creating jobs and everybody else that's kind of that by the short answer is yes it's a game changer we have a lot of things we have a interesting road to navigate here and we're excited I mean no one will really know for the future will hold lots of people of opinion but I've never seen it before and you Alice how transformational has it been for you first of all how much do trades on Kickstarter and what hasn't mended practice so I actually raised why needed 15,000 there is about 19,000 and it really meant the difference in a lot of some ways for my business because what I really originally came up with was an invention joy you know I think not they get stuff like that my high and idea that i made work that I figured from my analysis actually had a good chance of doing well in mortgage like it seems clear worked for but then what I needed was funny not enough to worry any type of you know PC Riley are actually you know great for capital really rounded there's no way I would get a loan for it because of the convention get there are all these expenses are coming this place like legal fees for IP just like tons of the big one no I didn't have the time or resources really put into learning all that stuff up front so Kickstarter was the crowd funding for a new bed at the time the target a lot of press because of the pre pebble but it is still right around all these campaign and so it was perfidia living situation if I didn't raise enough nothing would be lost or can you know Haley no one would lose anything so it's me gaming video say do that she's media success from it was number one that I raised enough funding it was very very easily received within two weeks of the campaign ending which were took 30 days I having absolute literally six weeks from the time of launching that I had the name i guarded from that came a lot of press and on a lot of additional just research that I had been in power been able to do before so recognizing a movie market getting a lot of feedback as to how where my people would use this improvements I could make you know preferences for colors and so basically all of the market research that I originally thought we'd caught multiple millions of dollars I was able to receive from that and then additional prizes and from there I actually ended up making a bunch of approaches that helped me get to the next stage so permeate all the difference at the time I used it in the way available for every yet another that's a whole other thing that's something you go down not now will I be useful to you to raise crowd on its equity I think that for me at this stage not yet but I can see where it would be very people live with other people have support right now the model allows you basically to the other two can't actually access yet so many more times for every I think with I believe that will actually open up all the different reasons for why people do that it alive when it comes to the regulation of the rules around it as a start-up to deal with that many investors so that's also another consideration and almost like if it was at the crowdfunding the legal fees that we to deal with all the disasters or everything tastes are they ok so I just wanted to bring in jail not and how you see the JOBS Act and the crowd funding provisions are very small not platform is it something that is not benefit from as well yeah lots of the retail shop coffee shop you drive through the head and so when you look at the job site to see a lot of potential life if the way set up now they look like you let me back to be content to look at the growth of actual investments seem difficult for your normal so we see that as well developed down the line we think early for developments where a lot of innovation is possibility that the child back type of security tends to go down to level but of the time being we remain apart some part of these models because most people that complexity of securities whether or not your contemplation yeah we're going to get into that then the point about the accreditation and how we protect grandma you know for the land scam all that kind of stuff that some of us remember Tom what's your perspective on this here in QC state fund and again a lot of companies may come to you all Stacey they're not quite ready for sea in a way they need to develop their product and a lot of stuff in marketplace so we figure out and raise a lot of crowd funded equity how do you been good that when you come to say invest in the next round and do you have any tips for entrepreneurs question let me offer that the vantage point from which I speak we are at an age 70 adventure time the instruction we are part of the nonprofit the center for media technology we have my vision for the Commonwealth of Virginia limit of mentally the Recovery Act and some private participation from corporate strategic in the life sciences area can be invested high-growth startups that are / Doris island and expressed a willingness to grow and provide store economic development candidates for the Commonwealth of Virginia silver it's been my experience to work with this spirited and somewhat delusional subculture individuals could start and punch high-growth companies and network the way I the library through the content with basket we've got very source of funding federal funding sources from the SBIR another grant program amid downstream us venture venture clubs so how would you react I went to see me you know we might be active backbencher fun like react to a company that comes in with interceding for the crowd source funding and it would probably take someone or forgiving the pro me who are you looking for some of the same basic parameters investment that downstream the larger investment the investor we look for we would certainly want to understand the structure of deal in terms of which the previous finally had that had participated and we would want to want to be sure that was a manageable structure of moving forward so we tend to like to see individual investors bike over there so the purpose I'll see rather to have you know a very long and complex a part of online active lets up in the downstream investors we generally want to see as well so I think it really comes down to the structure of the understanding of the Turkish making sure their own market in line with our expectations in terms of dentistry funding sources and secondly I think from a governance standpoint extreme builds you that those basic parameters I need senator Warner mentioned the volition of accreditation I mean at what point is that dividing line and also how does one protect the investor what's your perspective on the best way the SEC should go about figuring out these pools well I actually think it's a combination about the SEC fines at the floor and what communities do to spend beyond the base but maybe if I can put this in context on the shared three parameters as to how we are where we are a little bit of history a little bit about higher education about the rules that are coming which is going to answer the question then the suggestions for us in Virginia I was in the president's advisory team focused on this particular topic because of the President's commitment to hydraulic entrepreneurs he wants to startup America as a public-private partnership to promote more globally generated communities to focus on these opportunities rates of entrepreneurship roxley calling event when they're supposed to be going up as a period speaking on the stress poor folks will instructor businesses I out a story of leshoure in Southwest Virginia as the sort of crystallizing scoring relief so I wanna share free I visited as part of the president's rural jobs tour and I was asked to visit blacksburg which was a the course that me knows Virginia Tech University tally and a soft word Virginia Tech shacked up at this incubator called tech path where he and one other co-founder I've met have been August of exactly a year in couple months ago August last year we met and he was building than the facebook app now as you know the math facebook opened up its velvet platform so jobs all over the country or milk leveraging on facebook platform and Nathan lock cam was representing two of those jobs and his company was basically very straightforward health mainstream businesses in America build facebook fan page and it was simple and profitable I visited after I left the White House to host this hope he helped otakon begin folks to build apps and health care and they can put a team together and he was already up to 1.7 million revenue profitable and very low price points because he hit this market needing he's now a cook who was at that point up to 15 employees and he was scaling rapidly but he faced a problem he needed capital growth he received the turf sheet from a venture firm in austin texas for the half a million dollars he was looking to raise great news Allen Burton what was the bad news he would have to move his company headquarters to Austin Texas but he loved Plattsburgh he bought had access to great talent and engineers great quality of life so he was committed but he was stuck in a profile of angeles and in that ecosystem he was able to connect to accredited investors that opened in Plattsburgh but was to discover a story like lizard he attracted the attention of two very prominent angel investors David Colin at techstars and dave McClure 50 new startups these are in the high tech community the rock stars of angel investments and they essentially bet on faith which unlock local accredited investors in blacksburg the combination of the 2 raise to half a million he needed and Governor McDonnell was now there are not even a year to the day I met him for the first time and now sink that with the capital Nathan race he'll create 50 jobs in blacksburg over the next few years yeah what did we learn about that story how does it relate to the jobs and there are three elements to the JOBS Act that I think could answer the question about a credit in turn on investors point number one the JOBS Act broke over the door of secret santa road meetings today you wanted to go raise capital you know Silicon Valley and you sort of you know the lords of finance and Silicon Valley for your startup because you could publicly disclose you were raising money we have these solicitation rules for securities well we've all been done in the JOBS Act a provision called general solicitation and what that means is I can leverage the internet to let people know that I'm looking to raise capital and it starts with a very principle that accredited investors in blacksburg don't know you invest in my company but here you have Blacksburg company getting validation from Silicon Valley angels unlocking local accredited investors in Blacksburg so you do the math just accredited investors alone ignited by the potential that connect to securities through online channels will for create billions of dollars of late capital did you put the startups appoint one so provision of the jobs act before we even get to the crowdfunding legal structure is the opening up of the online tools credited message will have itself a benefit but today the accredited investors as Senator Warren pointed out they don't get investor protection as the center worker said they're just expected a here's my business plan on a napkin you can invest legally because you're a genius or your millionaire but that's not sufficient so the foot one is the accredited investor who goes through a crowdfunding platform where the SEC will set basic investor disclosure rules without more investor protection to the general fund and I you talking that social validation and what kind of transparency measures well so you have the three elements of social validation point one now I can have the SEC consent what the company has to disclose it's not going to be 10 years of audited financial will be something Iliad based on an anti-sea at continental set those rules the better than zero number two as we use these online platforms because of social web you'll see validators every community at Virginia has that respected elder community and who can invest in startups the signal of others that it's okay to come in and that effect and then finally at this point it's not just equity crowdfunding it's also all securities which instead one of the opportunities that I had was to help seeing some of energy incubators for the White House we put a project together to close the solar financing gap a crowdfunding platform is raising debt securities to allow post to crowdfund solar panel installations on community buildings when they get paid back as a share of the savings on the energy so when you combine the social power you combine the investor disclosure the last leg of the stool is is shift the pivot to wealth as the blind to the answer your question it's education as the line if I can take a series seven and I can be a securities trader or I take Merrill Lynch's exam to justify what I want to invest in terms of our semester something north of Merrill Lynch's exam in south of series seven exam we should create community wide that would allow us to solve this particular problem and so the knowledge base would be sophistication as the lever as opposed to welcome so swap I'm kind superhuman I want to go get your Wanda street you can or katek this exactly has as you want how would you handle the protections for investors so I'm going to give to other stories real quick to set of context and only answer that question which is a story number one so their question about will investors ever come in call on crowdfunding so there's a campaign on IndieGoGo from these two engineers that California that one supporting free bc Sand Hill Road all that discover and they said a William fund us and every single bc sorry many bc said them upon them every single pc turned it down and this is how they turned on because it would have turned out sound like it goes i love this this is amazing all you need to do is bring this to market show us that you can sell out your first line of the product and as soon as you can show us the revenues on that come back and we will grow this business point that is a clear know as these months now the takeaway here this was a really cool tech product gadget no data to discuss strategic we can't scale pinwick but in terms of margins but they went online on Tiki go go they got funded they got 130 days and within three weeks they raised a million dollars of investment money after you go the reason is they actually accomplished everything the vc's asked them to do in 30 days they prove that those market they sold the part of the show the revenue they truth everything sure the market everything was done I got a million bucks there now partner to an apple they're told you well bubbly great every story at number one number two is their opportunity for social validation here is a hallway the first story of the kind that soon will be many many many as 10 works in the world which is Nikola Tesla you know are you in person just be in competition with Edison he has a laboratory in New York mo Island the original laboratory were in created almonds exploration and it's about to go for sale and it's going to probably turn into a dunkin donuts literally it's may get demolished and turn into a dunkin donuts so there are some local people know like this is the travesty how can this happen I know it well the guy who owns with you want to sell it for 1.7 million dollar that is what it is so they've got together and you're able to go to New York Steve the government are like how are you letting this happen knowing what we can't come in and exclusive private property and fiber okay new york state taxpayers government said we will give you 850,000 who would you can pass the money if you can prove to us that actually people care about you have to go raise this money on a platform shows that people care and will give you the other half I going to be builder and you're able to raise that aims if you download i think in 60 hours and we were able to raise head neck like 1.3 million dollars that gets anally 50,000 our Bachelorette we're talking about the essence of public-private partnership here right this is taxpayer money being deployed based on how the local taxpayers really are telling good I mean that's pretty exciting how to answer your question there's actually four five reason why this five reason why entrepreneurs a new crowdfunding and you really mentioned some of this already which is number one you get to gauge the man's which is really exciting so you have to spend money foolish number two is you get to test your marketing do gold women like your product of the young girl old men young boy you could really be nimble with that number three you get more promotion that you ever could on their own social discovery exposure number for the hands down most important you're probably not using dimension this is you get the data you get to nurture the relationship not just have a transaction probably still in touch with all your customers you have the information and number 50 yet you get to have money so that's really good how would I architect it and in my opinion I am more like his odd geez and I think that when ecommerce came out you know the government had an opportunity in the 90s to do the exact same thing you know this fancy internet for film and people keep Fried ebay amazon is really going to happen this millions of dollars and somehow industry would be able to convince the government be like he'll give us a little bit of breathing room here we have to run a company you want to be profitable we want to make a really good business we'll figure this out and government said okay you have a short leash but go ahead and now you have the internet which happens to be doing quite well with Commerce right in my opinion the worst thing that could happen is the government can come in and say we know a lot of incidents and how to manage no sir you know he will tell me I've been doing this since January 2008 and the SEC or somebody right before the other worried about fraud when it happened I've been worrying about fraud in 2006 when we came up with an idea we deal with fraud every single day my desk pal at part of the super sauce IndieGoGo but you know we want to be a profitable business right we don't want to have pies be prodded we don't want a fat brand you don't want to have campaigns that are stealing money sure all those things right I mean we are actually liable for specific campaign but all those things are the best interest of a half work to do well so what I was saying is I would love for many of these educational items many of these points about being able to see my name financials I think that should be the market figure it out these campaigns that get funded obviously are doing something right campaigns that don't get funded are obviously not connecting with their audience yes there needs to be some level of information sharing the audience will tell us you know our funders complain to us you know they say we have not gotten this amount of information yet we figure out our problems improve it mins just a matter of time this will all be built into the product user experience right right now you're saying lighter notices their campaign or not because I can't trust it it's just a matter of time before there's functionality will show you a barometer of how much you should trust us but everything that you think you want to know will be built into a product where there's a need it will be best because you have trust which would sorry how many transparency can you provide community that's one of the reasons we was painful what we doing things political geography would happen to take this concept you put in community I think by doing that we have built it apparently on the accountability that is coming with the Prada conference to steal our brothers yes how social enforcement take the very horrible that when someone doesn't pretend to have a reputational sort of the tour tremendous built a which I think it was the recipient that it's hard to get everything that the system's themselves generate and a way to avoid it and for us you have the additional layers you are with me all of the dry cleaner or local coffee shop you're able to walk down the street watch it and see how I was doing you can see is this place MZ it involved is it terrible is a coffee break if they clean my clothes this reversal giant states don't air by having that sort of global accountability you're trying to bring real-world relationships so for us human very folks the hopeful for specifically had to take the realization to happen to Bill demoness allow that as negative 4 Tom I would recommend this issue of using these platforms for you know market testing and a way to kind of prove social traction it's not something you're seeing is that a valium when you say to some companies that approach you me joey is one of these platforms see how you do and then come back together so we have a tremendous value that we kind of 25 reasons like why you money and greeting until get get funded you better circulation platform ideas there's to pick up like that last one like this opportunity investing highly localized investor have to be that natural for this so and each I want to ask you a little bit about you know different ways the SEC could play out here that may help or in their this what are your biggest toes and what are your fears in terms of the way they might well clearly the biggest fear is that they over engineered this to the point where we never get out of the gates so to me begin in the aim is that the SEC sets essentially a floor which allows for the innovation created in flourish but that individual pockets of communities experiment with how to bring it to life in their communities so here's the theory Lyceum highway to the Virginia recently was awarded an innovation grants and commerce department called Virginia innovation partnership this is you VA Virginia Tech and sr I co-managing is statewide program for research ideas out of universities into the commercial markets we've spot $50,000 grants to get them to that proof of concept stage and in the proposal that was awarded by the Commerce Department the proposal included crowdfunding potential foreign equity investments in those startups as they were moving from from a person age too early annual investor Brown Derby on so here's the analogy the SEC allows for this platform to exist but Virginia sets up the Virginia angel st. indiegogo / Virginia innovation partnership and now that sub-community sets its own rules within the overall framework and that would say things like maybe we want to have an investor protection test so they'll be in the accredited investor and some of ebay type subtly to create these so globalized markets so we might have more trust as a lot of attackers our DBA or Mason or what have you to invest in the professors that get a chance here we have that social identity and we have greater level as an investor protection because there's more disclosure or there's scientific validation think I hope you'll see yin and yang collaborative community Virginia birth this law this is a bipartisan Eric Cantor Mark Warner and creation and the president call toward signed it it's got to be Virginia that brings this to life in our neighborhoods with enough broad freedom of the national level so we can experiment and you know this is lean startup is learn or reactive pivotal they better judgments and over the next several years will get a fight here's the map water slide show ten billion dollars of angel investor of equity capital in the early stage of our name fred wilson at union square ventures is none of the most respected VC's in America has estimated this say 300 billion dollar market a 30x increase on the last data point you saw center work that is a market to fight for that is a market to try to exploit if we can get foundation yes you see an experimentation and Virginia to test validating scale profess pursue so in that case slug iron here expecting a bit of competition then I imagine this could be a lot of new entrants into the parking place a lot of folks yes in dee goes with a large fun park in the world and ask me any idea when I say that is your judgment is your generation which is very interesting if you start kind of for-profit business could be probably wouldn't do that still we color still would experience for good enough because we would even like to luminosity let's be open market decide I'm telling you this is because we have competitive platforms finally done in yoga platformers day we're going to be better than IndieGoGo which is great it's great between there's actually like 750 competitors right now I think it's an enormous market I think there's plenty to figure out that this is all better in terms of you have to be for some of the rules I think that one there's the whole of whether or not you need to be a stamped by Jesse see but you can work with you guys they're standard or not stamped on this is really strategically bad for me to say but I'm not pro spam but I should be prospective gluteus damn right and most people not just am yes you can you stand plus it means that you're not allowing for openness for others to drive it should be potentially like you can get like better business bureau like hey they're doing good work but we believe in that bleachers they don't go to them you're not allow good as soon as you don't allow them your stop it's kind of like saying can't create a competitor amazon they're not good enough your buy stuff from its kind of not open innovation again specimens review then the next thing the absolutely terrible in my opinion is be really clear is there's this these have an audited statements for raising over five hundred thousand dollars that's like full-on ridiculous I mean if there was actually one piece of feedback that just needs to be cut not even discussed it just needs to be eliminated I mean both these companies that come to you with five and 11 other investments around we have audited statements like never right no it needs to be just removed he only crowdfunding the cost of their labor but everything I wish I wanted really clear it shouldn't be debating it should be removed and the one thing that they would be really really important to discuss is we offer purchase right now often on campaign when you get that product really interesting to me is whether or not be able to invest into the same company that you can get parts right when you be able to get the product and get a share at the same time does it have to be two separate financial transaction I think that would be really interesting it was marketplace what about the dilution issue on follow on rounds is presumably you know the example that you gave you know they they raise money and what comes to all their original folks well in that situation there were the equity investors so no got diluted I would imagine if you want to treat it the same way that are going to be just crunches right before their what now there's this new phrase called the seed round and you can never be a serum it was called an era was your first round and besides he now those friends and family we just create new tranches and figure out how to bring them forward on the ladder I mean I think that's fine in terms of managing lots of my investors yeah there might be some BK user experience com lawyers and we're there that manual problem there will be some startup that will figure it out in Y Combinator with a little bit of software it won't be that hard and they'll make some money right and yep okay how much are a little bit to some of the changes also in the app that make it easier for companies to file as an organ growth companies reg make the relations that sort of thing she wanted time in letter so again when the president listens entrepreneurs describe the challenges raising capital growth but we heard this that they brought a challenge from the earliest stages to the public effects and the key provisions in the later stages as Senator Warner describe it are there are several of them in a relevant from Virginia so let's go as an investment of an order of priority to be the most important thing is you created the opportunity for companies to test the waters for public offering why is that relevant let's assume your company that you're thinking about going public the data suggests that maybe twenty to thirty percent of those companies actually no public but if you today filed a no problem to choose not to all of your investment thesis your s1 all your all your data is out there so basically your competitors know everything about you even though you have not actually not a problem so there's a bit of a chat to say well am I really going to go through with this what we've created is an opportunity for testing the waters so companies can actually have privileged conversations from the SEC assisting like the facebook IPO for a minute remember the facebook IPO had this back important the SEC over things like mobile advertising revenue but imagine if there was an opportunity for them to have that conversation the SEC during this test the water space the law requires you when you mention illegal public to have at least 21 days of disclosure of that entire conversation that you have in the SEC all red lines so now the investors would know what actually happened during that conversation to make them had it earlier also you can talk to investors you can talk to people who like when I tell you whether they want put money into your company today that's a very constrained conversations now you can have a confidential discussion so those pretend finally for those of us who care about equity research the research analysts today can't comment on the on the security for 40 days after they go public now they can have investor reports research of corisande month so you as an investor don't have to wait say hey what are the experts they've got this covered so those are really important revisions to increase the positive probability that companies are going to want to go public there's also a few forbidden to say I want to go public but any more than a billion dollars integration problem regulation a today is capped at raising five million dollars in private placement well now we have the opportunity raised up to 50 million dollars there are lots of companies that they don't want to go all the way to public offering but water raise 50 and that's enough business and again happening to be accredited investors and qualify the investors institutional investors who have the authority to invest in today health is reggae is not really giving the last tool so going from five to fifty might there be tested that's growing in that little place so if you think about the map the big picture is this our economy especially in Virginia is heavily dependent on defense contractors right it's like ten percent of our gdp ish imagine now we have the potential to see more companies go public which creates jobs companies that can stay private but raise capital will try new market opportunities especially in areas of health traders and education which you wrote and we have this long tail of startups in Blacksburg and roll open in Danville who have the chance even if they have modest road man measures that will return to their an angel investor around and that full ecosystem is now legally allowed if we put leadership to fixing this to making an organ rejection that's where we are today sorry crowd money we keep on thinking that equity crowdfunding is for that tiny little company that we will get off the ground chances are structured correctly it's the companies that already have a base actually happy making continued small millions of dollars are funding of revenue right five and twenty million dollars of revenue they have customers they have affinity group they don't want to go to these evening than with themselves by twenty to thirty three percent they're going to want to go quickly to the market right and say hey customers not really are we going to refine validation whether or not this is good the product you want to give you a piece of the action on the upside here and their own market will fund them right so thanks forget which pcs we approach our so it's it's not really a matter of thinking like a mom and pop be able to have their real companies we're talking about transformational humiliating five Tom are you worried about being disrupted you know from my perspective before we operated were disrupted that's good business full of go Goa I try to apply Virginia scarce resources into another product we'll say and I'm the data from the data authors but you know we ever seem to see how this plays out to see what what the what to meet a map raised by my company's is under this place or be orderly applause statically racism that will truly supply as conventional investor ok I want to bring in our audience I assume that you guys had a lot of great questions there are two my positions actually I think I can handle I bike oh you got one there as well please your question not disruptive I don't the technology product today did not plan to the future and a better point where I mean collects my impressions that the crowdsourcing models are not society companies like mine but I have a great Bob and I think about what's going to understand earlier about companies that have these numbers that they don't they look at the game five hundred Liz those companies five years later they're so what your thoughts are companies like mine that one funding need funding but aren't necessarily a technology program today completely one thing we failed its best they said i think is really critical for the power of this is the creation of these trusted local communities a lot capital opportunities soap in the Indian American community we formed these angel investor networks of 90s and 2000s where we allowed for more of the opportunity for folks that we're not getting access to capital in the traditional markets to get support from the community is believed in this broader cause of empowering those felt left out I think the single biggest opportunity for crowdfunding broadly is the unlocking of these you but i would call trust in community networks so what will happen is I actually think african-american chambers of commerce I spoke to the group recently about that can self-organize to say let's shine light on these entrepreneurs about you and your story as much as it is the details of the business I think there's a this university alumni networks for so let's bet on a George Mason the lung they're going to see regional networks let's bet on Alexandria zone or Blacksburg phone and these sort of social discovery tools there might be a few that will believe in your story and then validate you to their peers now easier less costly transaction so that you can be discovered that more on you as an individual in your story and necessarily the details whether it's tech business or privately business or what have you because you'll have that validation cycle I think that's likely one element that would be hopefully turned on as these communities of interest yeah briefly James are away the small nod to tell ya I mean I think my brother's thing is that we really use its equity plus people buy shares of may avoid having I'm here are the exact texts I don't think that necessarily torpedo small businesses so keep your eyes open for other pod from the don't just do share offerings there might be other ways doing whether it gives your debt for the mechanician solution a lot of ways invasion theory that are you more fit for your business it's not you look the same way and a high-tech touch interview mike is no further than i did sting a little bit of that happening right now but i don't take that on when you put project SPX I also think there are some things that are having that I'm all partnership problems are you looking for example will be you sweetheart the blender so what we do it you look for a larger side loan we really mean it together crowd one full glass and that both lateral that handle bang bang to give you a loan so there's ways the source capital that tone just simply go and what you doin that is different way for arranging structures that well you know traditional capitals in a locked room features though you know have to talk more about later there are a lot of different solution Denmark is David is loud and start of equity crowdfunding that are unlocked when about that thank you for us to make and yes hang on my name is dr. michael morgan a company that helps science and technology startups gain access to federal grant or contract I'm curious is this type of crowd funding platform on the agenda of the current administration it will help divert some of the costs and risks associated with science and technology developments for the government let me give you an a good example the defense advanced research projects agency darpa a lot of their grants in their contracts require caution so startups generally in order to get a grant from the federal government needs who have maybe five hundred thousand or million dollars worth of funding a lot of these startups don't have access to them are you going to open that gate to allow the US government agencies to do cost sharing with crowdfunding platforms that's a great question for Senator water to take to the administration to feedback but I would say there's no legal structure for that today but we are trying to keep democratize access to government contracts so when I left the administration we were forming 18 startup that is now called RFP easy and theory is for if you're a web developer or started getting something simple that we understand if you can provide web development services to the government from contracts value nor thousand dollars you don't need all this convoluted nonsensical procurement of nonsense you can go straight to Dartmouth essentially on match.com platform present your pension figure out their contract regiments so we are harnessing the internet for simplifying procurement of your comment culminating in pink cost share there's certainly no limit Afghanistan and that may be the kind of innovation that small amount might be able to bring this a hey you're an SBIR company if you want to be able to create a culture you might offer that as a pod it's not restricted it's just not actively describe anything yeah I did speak with the director at Darwin and they said it's a great idea they just don't know how to navigate through the regulations and rules to help astronics race Shawn green loves the sba's innovation program where they everywhere for an already arrested our programs and sean is the leader the white house to help bring policies forward in this area so you should make sure you can connect the sean that anyone else wants to offer feedback shawn green of the SBA is a terrific resource the question good morning my name is Andrew part from the Avenger LLC arrested rajendra we talked about this morning primary and domestic sources now they had marketers global have you ever considered looking for getting funding and international source example there is a program called eb-5 program in windows what the eb-5 is that wounded at no investment creating 10 jobs I like to have a pounce opinion including Senator Warner any pro and cons opinion a person like us engage in ballistic armor material US military there is any pitfall soliciting funding from foreign citizens foreign fabric art form of 1 million dollars investment in the US company creating ten jobs I left any member panels prawn consultation yes we ever on the start of Geppetto that takes that million-dollar cast down to honor thousand there go to the park i will give up that low sub space between that million-dollar 1085 to a much lower threshold it is always going to be challenging when you get into parts presentation I'm chair because you cannot just trying to salvation they practically stuff put it back and forth I think I think it's going to be Earl terms of I think a scale down hard for every level of not guilty is a great great the follow-up questions I think that's a reduced amount of investment are you referring to none federal gun related how do you fair whether or not that would you say we need to greatly expand the five program because they've got calves too hot district and we go what we basically have a now h1b visas spray headed west coast and those basic people we are into these almost become indentured servants the companies that they look for because their ability then go out in Sparta there happen we pushed ordinary Mother's Day people out of there if they asked what will come out first that's not making sense the other why has not been passionate about their time we are start to cuenta y parks you've got are probably owes those punches for students Jerry Moran and probably won't happen plane it also includes a green card for stem fractures thank you thank you very much it's a different angle but sixty one percent campaign on IndieGoGo raise money from more than one country and as I campaign raise money from our game and I was that handled on at all the different you know currencies and that's of your pleasure does the president saw the eb-5 program as a huge opportunity administratively so we have streamlined and tweaked the program so we'll play the state of Utah has built an investment pot where they've raised roughly 50 million dollars mostly from Mexicans who want to get a green card to us so what happens is the fun commits to higher in the ten workers and these folks pool the money so now the club is accountable for job creation in the US and it's a creative public-private model where they're going after this case University spin-offs and other opportunities but the good news is the existing law has created the there's no leaks that are worth exploring and have it hard to offline and then obviously senator Warner's legislation is just a slant on button but would previously referred to as the startup visa movement and that whole theory about talented individual the educate here our diversity should stay and grow the because the data is overwhelming those for startups that had a huge impact on our economy thank you very much you

hi good evening my fellow coloradans uh good to have you all back tonight uh for the next installment of our digital job series uh as you all might recall last year we held the first ever congressional district six uh job fair uh where we uh brought in about a thousand job seekers and connected them with 60 different businesses in the community helped many people get new jobs or to move their career to the next level we were really excited to kick that off as you all know unfortunately we can't do that this year because there are just restrictions on bringing everybody under the same roof and bringing together large groups of people we want to make sure we're abiding by health regulations so what we decided to do was hold a series of digital uh forums like we're doing both for employers uh and to address business concerns and business owners but also for job seekers about how to interview over the phone how to uh uh better their resumes and a number of skills that they need uh as we deal with a enormous economic crisis and tens of millions of americans facing unemployment so we're excited to launch this series this year for the first time we've done a number of these uh already these webinars and forums uh from everything from again resume building and interviewing skills to what to expect as a business owner so tonight we're really happy to have jesse esparza join us again from the north metro small business development center to talk to us about what to expect between now and the end of the year and what do you need to be thinking about to prepare your business and your family to weather the storms both the health and the economic storms and just some of the considerations and also to take your questions but before i turn it over to jesse i wanted to talk very briefly about two really important programs i'm in washington dc right now sitting here tonight because we're working really hard to get an extension on the unemployment insurance program that expires today there are millions of americans and thousands in our community that desperately need that assistance to pay their rent and their mortgage and to buy food and their utilities and to support their families we have to make sure we're extending that program as this crisis continues uh the other thing we're working on is some extensions to the ppp program that's delivered a really important critical aid for our small and medium-sized businesses throughout the communities we want to extend the program we want to do another round of funding and we want to change the way we implement it so that we're preventing abuses to the program that we saw in some of their initial rounds of the funding but we're also getting the funding where it needs to be the most to the small businesses to businesses of 10 or fewer employees and to other businesses that have been hit especially hard we're working hard to figure out how to get that done with the us senate so with no further ado thank you for joining us i hope you find this valuable you can always contact my office if you have follow-up questions that we have a staff that can help connect you with federal resources and agencies and we can try to answer your questions and help you out it's one of the most important things that i do in my office does as a representative is provide direct services to all of you so with no further ado uh jesse esparza with the north metro small business development center uh jesse thanks for joining us again and i will turn it over to you thank you um congressman carl i think i really appreciate all you guys do up in washington i know it's a busy busy place these days um and i want to just uh emphasize that here in colorado we are just as busy trying to help small business owners i'm going to move over here just a little bit while i'm going to share my screen and start the presentation this is a presentation that oops sorry um that is really an intent to help all of you work towards preparing your business for the rest of 2020. we are a um the small north metro small business development center if you haven't heard about us we're basically one of 15 sbdc's in the state of colorado most of all our resources and services are free of charge we provide services in the one-on-one uh counseling for anything that you need to work your business to operate to provide to get you set up for some financial assistance to help you set up with some marketing uh to do some operational and of course to help you manage um all of what is occurring uh during this covet 19 crisis so um here is you know my um phone number and of the east i'm sorry the front range we're under front range but um we do operate as a north metro small business development center you can go to any sbdc in the state of colorado you don't have to belong to any specific region so just look up you know the colorado sbdc and you'll find your region and have the ability to access some additional resources so what we're going to cover on this evening um i want to be able to just talk about uh the role of your business responding to covet-19 um the effects of what kovic-19 has had nationally excuse me i want to be able to help you assess your financial damage and there's going to be some things that you can do to work through that process redo your cash flow projections i want to talk a little bit about that um and then even have a discussion a little bit about how you can redo your budgets which will ultimately help the whole process of at least determining what's going to be part of your your peaks and valleys as you go through december 2020. i think developing a strategic plan is going to be important for the next six months and then even at this point once you have done some of these things to be able to consider uh some additional funding to have the ability to continue to recover given the situation we don't know what's going to happen we don't really know how this um the virus is uh going to continue to affect cities and businesses and as you have noticed it looked like it was getting better things are getting worse and so we're just really on a day-to-day week-to-week process of trying to get in front of this virus and then i want to be able to at least give you some additional resources that will help you through these difficult times in the next six months that our sbdcs have put together and can offer um your offer for some additional assistance one of the very important components of small business owners is to really try and look at what is occurring right now with your employees um trying to seek some additional information you know communicate gather of their concerns get some input and then i think implement some activities to decrease the spread of covet 19 as best you can this is going to be important because we all want to continue to minimize um the spread um and ultimately continue to maintain a healthy work environment because of course when uh employees get sick then it starts to trend downward and your business begins to also begin to suffer extensively as you all know so if there's any way that you can continue to coordinate with state and local health officials continue to receive information about the latest issues i know that there's been you know the ups and downs on the testing and i think that's still the issue that we continue to try to get more into the hands of the business owners as well as employees and in the communities [Music] i think obtaining timely and accurate information is another very important thing that is occurring we're trying very hard to keep up with all of that ourselves at the sbdc's so nationally it was very interesting there was a a national survey that was taken um and we saw that um in the first survey that was taking 92 percent of small business employees were negatively negatively impacted due to the outbreak of the virus and then we saw that the 10 days later we took another national survey and um obviously noticed that there was even some more impact so the difference between just 10 days where we saw that 74 were impacted 10 days later later we saw that 92 percent were impacted my point to this is that in 10 days we have seen such a drastic change can you imagine what is occurring now there's been many more surveys that are still being taken as uh the months go by and i think that this is just another indicator that um a huge amount of businesses are suffering due to the the virus this is another very interesting uh component of a survey that was taken in terms of how long will you be able to operate your business under current economic conditions and if you'll look at that um gosh one to two months it's uh if you add all of these it's going to be a huge number that i think are going to be affected and i think that's another reason as a congressman crowe has indicated to continue to try to assess what other resources that washington can continue to provide small business owners in different uh impacting areas and i think that's going to be very important and we hope that that'll be something that'll come through quickly because you know some of these other programs will be renting out soon the effects of code 19 nationally in terms of the majors that were taken i think that we know that it is important to continue to disinfect your work spaces continue to utilize the healthy measures of washing your hands and creating social distancing that's very important because those are all critical and areas where reduction can continue to exist towards having a healthy environment and continuing to grow businesses as we move through the next six months so these are very important daily activities that will continue to be very very important to many of you and i'm hoping that that's something that you're all taking seriously as you move through this next six months this is just an example um i thought this would be very interesting to note the type of industries that were contacted and the type of industries that actually actually responded to the survey um as you can see the the largest number were construction type of companies but as you look through and down it probably includes almost 90 percent 85 90 percent of all the industries in the united states so um it was a very good i think effective survey that brought us some good information nationally about what has been occurring throughout um the first couple of months from march to today and so now i think as an important aspect is what do we do now so one of the first things that is going to be very important is to start looking at your hard numbers and by that i mean that um you must be looking at and hopefully you're you're assessing and looking at information such as your cash flow statements your profit and loss statements looking at the data that will help you compare what has occurred the first six months of 2020 with the first six months of 2019 that information will give you some important um data relative to where it is um occurring and where those numbers are diminishing relative to some of your cost of goods some of the revenue streams that have been coming in where they were coming in from all of that is very critical to be able to begin to assess and you begin to compare last year's numbers that will help you begin to determine how you're going to act upon july through december and have the ability to at least begin to uh be proactive so for example to establish the losses for each month that have occurred but also look at the quarters because um each month may be a little indicative of what has occurred in the example of what i said earlier is that things were getting better in the state of colorado many uh cities opened up and then things got worse and so some of the data could be showing that it's it's beginning to it was beginning to get positive and in a quarter in a month it could have been positive but in a quarter it could have been a negative so having um the information from those different sources will help at least make some better decisions i think collecting the sales and the profits and cash flow information is going to at least help you determine the comparison of what your sales were um six months ago what they are on a monthly basis between now and december um how your profits have changed and also the kind of cash flow that is occurring on a month to month and even sometimes at this juncture it's probably important to look at how your cash flow is working every single week there are other ways that you might also look at collecting data of how your business has been affected such as um you know how many days have your employees been at work um how many you know illnesses have you had you know what has been you know some of the clientele um that has been affected by the uh virus and have not come back i mean some of those data sources are really going to at least be critical in making some important decisions it's important to compare at least two years of your data with 2020. why is this important because at least one of the occurring situations for the the resources is that um some of the sba loans are going to ask for the effects of coronavirus uh in comparison to what you've been doing so some of this will be really important to gather so that you have that data already in your hands when you basically begin to do some applications for some additional resources it's important to collect of client information from the past year as well this will tell you in terms of the clients in relationship to how much they're spending and um what kind of services that they're requesting will help at least give you some sense of whether less clients are buying more or less clients are buying less and you know which clients have not come back um and how often have the clients that you had um how often were they coming back in relationship to how often are they coming back now that is going to be important as you begin to plan the next six months inventory is another very important component towards your business um for the next six months so if in fact your inventory has decreased due to less purchases um then do you have excessive inventory and how might you use that excessive inventory is there a probability that you might want to begin to do some sales is there a probability that you're going to use that inventory for some um collateral i mean those are things that inventory can at least provide towards some decisions in the next six months to stay alive and stay within the cash flow opportunities to continue to do business also if you look at your comparison of fixed costs as related to your variable cost from january to june um in those two frame of references you might be able to get a good sense of of what your fixed costs are doing to your business because usually fixed costs don't change and then if you had borrowed some money or if you work through some of the grants that came through how were they able to provide for fixed costs in comparison to what you're going to need for july through december those are going to be really important decisions to make and having that information will help at least in making those decisions it will be important to do a projected budget for july to december and then therein lies some of how you can use the data that you have collected so when you start looking at all of the data from what we've just discussed the projections of what your budget needs to be is going to be based on much of that data collection information that you've just gathered so if you can do a july to december cash flow projection as compared to what your budget is now you're beginning to see the difference in terms of what are some probable outcomes as you move maybe a quarter three in comparison to quarter four but also as you move down through every month into december uh 2020. when you're looking at your p l projections this will help you at least look at um some of the expenditures in terms of the employees as compare compared to what some of the loan programs have provided and what and when those programs are going to end what you're going to have to do relative to your profit and loss actual versus your projections and so when you begin to look at maybe the cost of goods if you are a product oriented business then really the p l is going to indicate um how those the other the the cost of goods are going to be expended or determined to be able to be used for the products you're going to sell and so if you're selling less then how different are the cost of goods compared to the first part of 2020 or compared to the six months of 2019 this is going to help at least for you to begin to reduce um the product uh that you're selling and and also reduce your cost of goods those might be things that you're going to need to really begin to work with and i know that most of you have met pretty much already detail but just to sort of remind some of these little details that create the ability to work to um the next six months of 2021. so therein lies the ability then to project your sales based on what you are doing and what you've done in say this second quarter because the third quarter probably is going to be much different and so is the fourth quarter um and the third and fourth quarter are probably not going to look the same or at least in terms of the increase or decrease but they're going to be very um [Music] hard to determine in even in a projections based on what is occurring with the virus and the um the growth of the economy and the decrease of the economy due to closing businesses again due to the growth of the virus those kinds of things i think it's important to work with your clients and determine how many are going to stay with you so whether you're a service oriented business or whether you are a product or you're in the business surely you've seen some decrease in client participation client purchases and or client needs for your services i think it's important to look at these and begin to determine how how this is going to affect the next six months obviously it's begun it's beginning to decrease so you're probably needing to determine how many of those clients or which clients are not coming back and to determine if in fact they are going to come back some of those are going to be important um just to be able to plan out even into 2021. obviously whatever you do in this whole sense of gathering the data creating some projections in your clash flow pnl's and also the sales and services of your products and also determining the clients what's critical is that you establish an exit plan regardless of where you think you know your data has defined it it's good to create an exit plan where you can begin to uh maybe phase one phase two phase three look at um you know additional um loans and um some borrowing power uh look at you know what you're gonna sell to get out of the situation and and or how you're going to [Music] decrease your your employee numbers to stay within the business that you need to stay alive during this very difficult time so once you have gathered data and you've looked at some of the critical information that is going to give you some power to make decisions better decisions based on the data that you've collected and information relative to your business now it's time to do some fine tuning one of the important components of fine tuning is to consider can you pivot and adjust this business what talents do you have what strengths do you have that can provide you towards pivoting this business into a new dimension and possibly uh creating a new product creating something that is in a higher need uh creating a service that is going to be relatively much more needed than what you had i think it's going to take some brainstorming it's going to take some risk-taking and it's going to take some collaboration in gathering data relative to what is occurring and where are the new needs that are occurring through this um dire situation that we have in this nation so it's important to at least analyze your overall industry what is occurring in your industry as um you noticed in the survey um the construction had probably the biggest impact and i think it would be important as an example what is happening in the construction industry um it may have still been growing but we can begin to see the the the downturn as the economy worsens and so what can you do for example in this industry to pivot based on the the coronavirus detriments that are occurring it's important to pay attention to trends that are occurring so that you can find the opportunities um and and you know we all know that there's been some changes that have had to occur uh with some huge big businesses i mean again an example is you know the ford corporation shifted into you know making the the the ppe providing services i mean i think small businesses can do some of the same approaches of working their their mechanical services their equipment towards creating what might be the industry need at this point so those are just you know one example of trying to look at the overall trends and focus finding some opportunities that can create some better opportunities to keep your business alive think about your strengths and weaknesses redefine those in terms of the business at you as the owner look at the strengths and weaknesses of your employees of your managers determine what might be some areas where you can pivot some of their strengths to continue to grow and divert some of the resources to changing what you're doing as a business for the short term and and maybe that's going to become for the long term but that really is part of just thinking out of the box and attempting to um continue to to communicate attempting to work with other business owners to determine where the strengths and weaknesses can support what you're doing throughout you know the communities that you belong to and so ultimately is what can you do to adjust to continue to improve and remain competitive as businesses begin to have a downturn and even some going out of business what position does that put you in say of the same industry to take over and and to continue to support those business clients in terms of of their um needs that they still have for some of the same kinds of products that your competition um was selling and now you have to step it up so these are all very important in terms of some of the communication that you can continue to to work with within your industry within you know the communities as you work through the next six months so it's time once you have gathered some good data and once you've analyzed that data and once you have determined that um there is some importance in making some shifts and pivoting it is time then to revisit your business goals and to redefine them to make them a little bit more realistic obviously the goals that you started with um in january are probably in for most of you are not going to be accomplished in 2020 so it's probably important to redefine that process re-look at the goals that are a bit more realistic and assess and compare what occurred quarter one and two because you had those goals and adjust them to quarters three and four and then be able to determine that and how it's going to change your business plan if you didn't have a business plan you must have had at least a strategic plan and we'll talk a little bit about that but um it's it's important not to abandon the plan that you had it's important just to try to readjust it because a good foundation of a business is the overall plan of your your brand and how you're going to continue to discuss the process that you're going to continue to go through so that the goals can continue to be realistic and have a at least a an outcome that is important to the success of your business determine how and what you need to change that business plan now that you've got some data and you have collected information about your strengths uh the strengths of your employees um some of the shifts that are occurring in your competition with your competitors um so now it's time to look at how you can change that business plan and then begin to gather some additional data that's going to help you analyze and then make the kinds of projections that you're going to make so that the goals that you have made changes on can be a little bit more realistic and can be assessed right on a month-to-month basis i think that's going to be important as a business owner for you to have the ability to look at that goal on a month to month determine the milestones of those goals and determine how how they're doing how how it's moving to towards the intended outcome or how far away you are even after the first i'm sorry the third quarter is over that's going to be very important to keep close to the data so therein lies that if you had a business plan and you did create some changes in the business uh goals then really what you've done is basically you've created a strategic plan for the next six months and now you have the ability to follow that into 2021 and ultimately as you work through some of these milestones the strategic plan will give you the ability to assess based on the data that you've gathered how well things are moving along so based on the new data that you've gathered then it's a good time to establish the goals based on a short-term basis when i say short term meaning that you want some milestones to occur every month you want some milestones to occur every quarter that will get you to the fourth quarter in a positive way or at least to break even and with the ability to determine what additional resources you may need as you move through on a short-term basis of your goals compare every actual cash flow that you get every month with what you've created as your projected cash flow for that month and for that quarter assess your monthly cash flow needs by readjusting and downsizing as needed every month and that will help at least as you work through determining that you may need to downsize and then the next you know month or two you're going to need to um add some more resources and grow because things are moving we don't know what's going to happen we don't know how this virus is going to continue to affect every city every business so it's going to be really important to keep an eye on every aspect of your data as you move through month to month it's going to be important to redefine your existing physical resources as well as your human resources and by that i mean of course the employees as well as any physical resource that you have is going to need to be defined as an asset or a a detriment depending on how it's is sitting in your your business and how it's not being used or how it will be used given some of that information that you've just gathered now given the fact that you have a set of short-term goals you've done some projections you've got compared the actuals with the projections it is now a good time for you to determine whether in fact you need some short-term loans given this information it gives you the a better ability to go to the lender provide the data and then begin to tell your story that gives the lender the ability to know where you're going and how you're working towards getting out of the the short situation or the the exit strategy that you have put together it will help um for you to obtain some workable grants that the cities might be providing in the next six months the counties i'm sure will begin to continue to try to support small business owners through grants in small loans um and also the state so in every city in every region there are some community loans and i think those will be helpful for you once you know what the data that you have relates to what you need so as you work through this data and as you work through the process you may need some working capital to jump start your business into 2021 and it may be that you're holding very steady uh even uh assessment of your business but come december it could be that you need to jump start your business with with some additional capital at that point so it would be important to consider some additional loans micro loans um 7a sba loans there could be some opportunities out there given that you have collected the kind of data and the ability to tell your story you might even have have the opportunity and ability to access the line of credit for your business if you can keep it positive or you can begin to access your business credit card to keep the short term jump start process going if you have accounts receivable then this is a good time to determine what that's going to look like does your merchandise cash advances have the ability to give you some additional capital will your inventory that you have give you some ability to finance that inventory to be able to use some some additional capital that's quick and also maybe even your purchase order financing if you already have some extended purchase orders that show some um additional um revenue they could be possible sources of of uh some additional financing on a short-term basis and we know that each of the options is going to have their pros and cons uh obviously you have to evaluate those on the basis of your business what are the consequences in the short term what are the consequences of the long term and you have to really do some analysis that is going to be in your best interest and the best interest of your employees and your business so those are going to be important decisions but with additional data and the kind of data that that you gather will help you make better decisions and determine whether they are pros or cons so let me real quick i want to be able to just give you an overview of what the the um colorado small business development centers have gathered in terms of resources um so i am going to get out of the screen so that i can get into the colorado sbdc resource so i hope all of you can see this screen and the the colorado up here you'll see colorado sbdc.org is uh probably a good place to go to if you want to find out about more resources that may be available to you obviously we have some of the resources of in the terms of webinars for the programs that sba has offered in the form of the eidl also the the care act if you want to know more about what the care act is providing um we'll continue to provide these and update these as um we get them available um as we get them and we'll put them there for you um to be available to you and um you hit that more and there's more uh opportunity this is about the paycheck protection program and i'm going to show you a little bit about the details if you haven't already i'll tell you more about the paycheck protection program and as um congressman crowe indicated um you know washington is attempting to um revitalize and open up some additional components of the ppp as it will close august 8th we're hoping that um there'll be some additional um opportunities that come from washington to add some more resources or continue that that that long program this is uh information i mean we've set it up on federal options obviously the sba express bridge loan will help if you already have a loan it'll help you bridge some additional capital um during this you know drastic covet 19 disaster um the small business relief program that one is going to help if you already have an sba loan um it's going to help you at least the sba to carry the loan for six months while this disaster gets uh we overcome it and then there's initial debt relief and then of course the payroll tax credits that occurred the pp loan um you can basically see the the very specific opportunities that the paid paycheck protection program has it's got all the information about the eligibility who uh you know how do you apply um what are the rules um well how this uh the loan is all of this is really specific if you're looking uh at applying and if you haven't already um as i said august 8th it's going to close there are still some um banks not very not very many to be honest with you but we do have some micro lenders online services that are still open to um taking applications for the ppp the uh the e-i-d-l um obviously um the the advanced portion of the e-i-d-l is no longer in existence but the eidl is still open until december uh 30th of 2020 as alone it has the 30 years of payback and at the rate of 3.75 interest for that duration of the time it doesn't have to be for that entire time you can do it for less but um you can still apply for the eidl and here are all the information components and then of course um there's these other resources if you're playing for re-entry in your business there's some great resources that will help you to gain some information procedures that the state has put together osha has put together some templates that you can use for reopening and also some of the other variables of guidance that you're going to get from cdc in those areas if you are looking at some statewide resources there is a lot of resources that may apply and it's always worth coming to this website to determine what might be available that is relevant to your needs and i just again there's so many resources i want to show you how to access them it's not difficult federal resources we kind of talked a little bit about that loans and grants if you're looking at employment if you're in the marketing or the tourism some things you can do to continue marketing you're in a business of manufacturing there's some resources of course the restaurant um artists some of those areas so i want to just emphasize that um we keep this website updated as best we can and um there is a lot of resources so we would ask that you visit them again there's no cost to the website it's all there for you to have in terms of your needs so without my friends i want to just try to see if there's any um questions or that i can answer from you i really appreciate your tenacity of sticking with me if there's any questions out there please let me have them if you have questions you can actually go down to the chat box and you can write your question and i'll try to answer i think i have a question um from peg are there any loans specific for keeping people employed well um again the ppp is still alive and well until august 8th that is a loan that actually is a forgivable part of the loan and if you have employees that um you want to keep them working you apply for the ppp and that will help you pay for the salaries of your employees and that portion is even forgivable which is really a good opportunity to keep that moving towards um keeping your business alive um i would suspect that um as congressman crowe indicated after august 8th if for us to keep a good eye and ear on what is occurring in washington because if in fact there is an opportunity to re-visit the ppp i suspect that that loan is also going to be the type where there could be a forgiveness for um the employer using the the loan to pay for the employee salaries it may be a looking it may be looking a little different but it looks like that could be a really possibility so keep that in mind um also um you might there are some cities that are creating grants that can help your employees so just you're going to have to keep really close tabs on city websites to determine what might be out there i know thornton has some commerce city uh has has some some grants and loans and um also um there are some micro lenders caller enterprise fund is a program that um is um in the ability to borrow money to help pay for businesses like yourselves to help employees from scott um i have a capacity to hire right now but only for part time do you think it's advisable to try to hire for these positions now and or should i wait um yep i i think that's a good question scott i would say um if you have the capacity to hire right now um look at the data as i had indicated look at what if you're if your business has downsized and if you have less employees i'm sorry less clients buying your service or your product try to work with the employees you have and if in fact you can do that then you're saving some um some cash flow to move into the next months that will at least keep you going i think it's important to analyze what is occurring and then hire only as needed based on the data that you gather that's i think will just really be an important part and and i think it is important obviously you're going to worry about unreliable employees because if you're hiring on the fly then you may not be doing as good a job in doing the assessment of the kind of employees you're looking for and so even if you're not hiring right now it's good to start doing some assessment of employees if you have the time and we're hoping that with less safe services or less products that you're selling there may be more time for you to develop a plan that is going to do a better job in assessing the kind of employee that you want determining the job descriptions look at what the outcome of what you want so that even though you don't hire them you're still creating a good process to get that established and when you do hire him you have a good plan in in effect for to take action that is going to give you better results from anonymous if i have to close my business are there resources to help me figure out how to do that yes that's what we do here at sbdc ironically and said to say um i think in the last six months i've helped at least seven or eight businesses close their doors in a very dignified way looking at trying to minimize the losses by all of their um their their existing inventory uh their existing um capital um any future you know um clients that they might have had that they can be um purchased by uh another business i mean though all of those things can work and if you do have to close shop there's ways that you can work through that so that you minimize at least all of your um your your debt in terms of what you have to to deal with that so i would say contact uh your svdc uh and and contact an advisor a counselor and they will help you work through that whole process from curtis can you talk about diversity observing diversifying products i've been thinking about switching my production from tailoring to making mess and selling them in my store can you talk about that definitely you know uh actually what's kind of ironic about that curtis just um yesterday i had a client that is looking for a hundred masks and doesn't want the cheap mass doesn't want you know just the the cut the cloth mask they're looking for some good quality mask and at this point in time those are hard to be found and uh very much in demand so if in fact you have the ability to diversify and create something that is quality um believe me right now in the nation and i'm not even talking about colorado or even your community if you start working and for those of you that are out there talking about pivoting thinking about going from direct sales to online sales this could be a way to keep your business moving in a positive way so yes maybe redefining what you do selling masks because they're in demand could be i think a lucrative opportunity to keep your business going do a little bit of research of how that's going to occur and what you have to do and move right into pivoting so yep that could be a very good aspect of the pivot concept okay well thank you very much i want to just say thank you to all of you that provided the questions i'm hoping that this has helped um every one of and and the process of uh what you can do for the next six months please don't

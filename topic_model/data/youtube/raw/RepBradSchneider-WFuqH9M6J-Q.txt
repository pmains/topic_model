Mr. Speaker,
This shutdown is an unnecessary, self-created crisis driven by an unwillingness to compromise. The American people deserve better. There are bipartisan solutions available that
responsibly fund our government AND address urgent priorities from Children’s Health
and Community Health Centers to DREAMers to disaster relief. I’ve been meeting with members on both sides
of the aisle, including in the Problem Solvers Caucus, and there is real willingness to get
this done. What we need is congressional leadership and
a President willing to negotiate and allow a vote. We are almost four months into the fiscal
year with no budget. We’ve already passed three continuing resolution
since September. We cannot continue with these endless short-term
patches. They are irresponsible, hurt our nation and
hamper our military’s ability to plan for the future. The Navy Secretary likened it to putting “$4
billion in a trash can, pouring lighter fluid on it, and burning it.” The clock is ticking. The last shutdown in 2013 cost our economy
$24 billion. This won’t be resolved by one side going
it alone. Let’s end the political games, stop the
finger pointing, and do the work the American people sent us here to do.

Jon's question is what federal assistance will use support that can help revitalize the rural economy of Maine you've touched on some of these points but are there any other ones you like well I'm a big believer in infrastructure I found an incredible quote from Abraham Lincoln in 1826 when he was 23 years old running for the Illinois legislature you know what he talked about roads and navigable waters infrastructure the other thing and I we talked about this down in Brunswick a month or so ago and that is providing providing decent broadband service to rural Maine it not being able to get broadband in a rural area today as a death sentence economically I don't think the government supposed to create jobs but again creating the atmosphere to create jobs i think is what it's all about absolutely i think we haven't done a good job with trade and we're allowing countries to sell here totally freely without having to abide by anything like the rules that our businesses have to provide have to abide by you know these guys up the road these companies that i saw today have to abide by very stringent environmental rules and osha and you know labor protection and all those kinds of things and they're competing against a company that doesn't have to do any of those things it's hard for me to look them in the eye and say yeah that's fair

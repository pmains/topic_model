you send it to Bill Cassidy republican from Louisiana joins me now Senator an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal calls this a quote dirty oil deal what do you think totally agree and with that Wall Street Journal editorial points out is that the administration just killed alone to Guyana which is right next door to Venezuela a democracy in which has been an ally of the U.S instead of helping the guillainians build a build infrastructure to take advantage of of what is called light sweet crude off their Coast incredible economic development for an ally they kill that loan but at the same time they are helping the Venezuelans this is wrong if you want to support democracy support the democracies that are already in place by the way including ours there's a lot of Americans working in Guyana it's a way to create jobs in the U.S as you go down there the administration doesn't care about these jobs and meanwhile we continue to ask for uh Senate you know look we continue to ask OPEC plus to boost production to bring prices down we're doing a deal with Venezuela allowing Chevron to expand all of this is utter nonsense because the answer is right beneath our feet in this country how infuriating is it it really is infuriating you cannot separate energy security from Economic Security and National Security and by the way from climate either if we produce oil with our energy with our environmental standards it's less carbon footprint it creates more jobs for the average American better paying jobs it increases our national security and the security of the Europeans this Administration has chosen to focus only on carbon emissions which means that we get more carbon emissions they're burning coal in Europe because we can't Supply them with gas and oil but at the same time we lose jobs here our national security weakens our Economic Security weakens this Administration their energy policy is wrong on all fronts that is exactly the place where we're going to have to leave it and it says it all Senator Bill Cassidy uh Senator thank you so much for uh jumping in and joining us this morning we do appreciate it uh meantime senator manchinson's

  GOOD FRIEND, MR. PALAZZO, THREE  MINUTES. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM MISSISSIPPI IS  RECOGNIZED FOR THREE MINUTES.  MR. PALAZZO: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. AND I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF   S. 2511, THE COMMERCIAL  ENGAGEMENT THROUGH OCEAN   TECHNOLOGY ACT, AS AMENDED.  ALSO KNOWN AS CREMBINGSNOTE. THIS BICAMERAL, BICOASTAL  LEGISLATION ADVANCES THE   NATIONAL OCEANIC AND   ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION'S   USE OF UNMANNED MARITIME   SYSTEMS BY COORDINATING THE  PRIVATE AND ACADEMIC SECTORS   WITH THE NAVY ON EVALUATING  UNMANNED MARITIME SYSTEMS AND  TECHNOLOGY AND THEIR UTILITY,  SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT.  THE LEGISLATION HIGHLIGHTS THE   UNIQUE ROLE THAT NONDEFENSE  INTERESTS SUCH AS NOAA,  ACADEMIA AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR  PLAY IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF   UNMANNED SYSTEMS WHICH CAN   GATHER A WIDE RANGE OF OCEAN   DATA WITH FISHERY MANAGEMENT,  1/2 GATION AND ECONOMIC BEN --   NAVIGATION AND ECONOMIC  BENEFIT. IT CAN -- AND THE EVOLUTION OF   UNMANNED SYSTEMS CONTINUES TO  PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES TO   REPLACE, ENHANCE, REINFORCE  TRADITIONAL TOOLS AND  INFRASTRUCTURE.  SUCH AS MORRINGS AND MANNED  RESEARCH VESSELS WHILE   MINIMIZING OPERATIONAL COSTS.  DEMAND GREATLY OUTPACES SUPPLY   IN THE FIELD OF THESE ASSETS.  SPECIFICALLY, NOAA IS CHARGED  WITH THE DIFFICULT TASK OF   MAPPING, OBSERVING, AND  EXPLORING OUR OCEANS WHICH   COVER OVER 70% OF OUR EARTH'S  SURFACE. IT IS NO SURPRISE, THEN, THAT  80% OF OUR OCEAN IS UNMAPPED,  UNOBSERVED AND UNEXPLORED. BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF  FUNDING AND FIELDING, NOAA   CONTINUES TO SLOW -- CONTINUES   THE SLOW PROCESS OF MAPPING. HOWEVER, LEGISLATION LIKE THIS   CAN ASSIST IN THE PROCESS. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE   NOAA TO LEVERAGE THE TECHNICAL   AND PROCUREMENT EXPERTISE OF   THE NAVY AND OTHER PARTNERS TO   ASSESS EXISTING CAPABILITIES   AND INITIATE ACQUISITION   STRATEGIES.  ULTIMATELY CENOTE IS A WIN FOR   DEFENSE, COMMERCE, FISHERIES,  ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND   RESEARCH AND DISASTER PLANNING   AND RECOVERY.  I ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO   SUPPORT THIS BILL AND FINALLY,   I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN   BENEFICIARY OM AND HIS   PROFESSIONAL STAFF, BILL BALL,   FOR ASSISTING MY OFFICE AND  BRINGI

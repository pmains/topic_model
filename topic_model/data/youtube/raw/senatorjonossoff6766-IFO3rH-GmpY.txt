mr scharf follow-up for you obviously as lenders you have obligations to do share obligation shareholder obligations regulatory obligations to assess the credit worthiness of borrowers and that's part of your job how can creditworthiness be accurately assessed without using methodologies with unintended consequences that might for example discriminate on race or other lines well i think you know one of the things that we talked about earlier is the the need to continue to try and refine fico scores which i think we're all doing work on a lot of it's being led by the occ uh but we all have our individual efforts as well to look at things like rent payments utilities um phone bills and things like that because those very often are the consistent payments that uh more diverse people uh wind up uh building their credit upon and aren't always reflected in a fico score thank

you are on detention policy I would argue the administration's detention policy quite frankly been a failure how many people have we captured and interrogated under the law of war every time we capture a terrorist if we don't kill them that just been a handful we bring them into the civilian court system and read them their rights that's got to stop now about Guantanamo Bay it's not about the location of the jail I don't mind if we try to find a place to move it into the United States what I want is a legal system consistent with being at war and the reason we haven't closed Guantanamo Bay is we don't have a plan to close it and you need a plan you need a plan that would reassure the American public that we're not talking about dealing with people who robbed a liquor store but terrorists and we're going to have a legal system that would allow some to be tried in military court some to be tried in federal civilian court were appropriate some to be released when appropriate and yes some to be held under the law of war because if we let them back out into the system they will kill us twenty-eight percent recidivism rate law of war detention only makes sense if you're at war under domestic criminal law you cannot hold want anyone in definitely under criminal all nor should you be allowed to but when you're at war and you capture a prisoner you can hold that prisoners long as they're threat the problem this warrior to be a war without end so we got to find some long-term detention review policies to deal with the law of war captors so they get more due process but I will not sit on the sidelines and embrace the option you need the trimer let them go because that's a false choice and a dangerous choice about the overarching theme that you can't kill your way into safety and when the worth of killing count me in for that concept but mr. president what you say in what you do are totally disconnected you talk about supporting democracies and countries in transition that are trying to reject radical Islam but your actions speak louder than your words a rock was a country that went through hell was inside the 10-yard line the surge did work and is falling apart because the president chose not to leave any American soldiers behind when ten or twelve thousand would made a difference so mr. president I agree with the concept that we have to stand by those in the region and give them capacity where they have to will because we can't kill our way to safety but when you're given the choices you made a poor choice in Iraq and you've undercut our commanders four times in Afghanistan what I hope to find is that the president's words will match his deeds there are parts of this speech that I could have given you cannot kill your way to victory you have to help those who will be willing to live in peace with you but our track record in Syria Iraq in Afghanistan is very disturbing so I would just end with this thought about drones I've stood by this president because it's a technology that makes sense there are parts of this world that are governed and we don't have any troops and a drone is the best way to protect us and our allies against radical Islamic terrorists I would like it to be more transparent and if you want to send it over to DoD I won't object if you can prove to me we're still going to use the technology to make us safe I believe we're in a war that's not winding down we're in a war that's morphing and that's the theme of the speech was that this war is winding down I have relentlessly pursued the al-qaeda leadership there is no justification behind politics for Congress to bring us from closing a facility that should never have been open the justification were closing Gitmo is that we've destroyed the al-qaeda leadership in bru Linton's relentless in our pursuit of terrorists that is not a good justification cost that is not true the enemy is morphing it is spreading their more theaters a conflict today than they've been in several years and our policy towards Syria and Iraq our n decision about leaving troops in Afghanistan is creating instability our allies are more afraid than I've ever seen our enemies more emboldened i support the concepts that the president talks about in many ways but if he doesn't change his policies the Middle East is going to blow up and we're going to get hit again here at home no matter how hard we try we could get hit any way but we are setting in motion policies that I think make it more likely that embassies and consulates will be attacked the Mideast and terrorism is on the rise in our backyard and I will end this thought we told President Bush to his face in 2006 mr. president your policies are not working in Iraq to President Obama your foreign policy is not working you need to adjust it senator Ayotte

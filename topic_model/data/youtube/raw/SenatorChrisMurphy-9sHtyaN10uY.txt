my name is Henry Bolden I live in Hamden Connecticut I served in the US Army from 1953 to 1956 I was what they call Sam s am surface-to-air missile mechanic working on Nike guided missiles they call your atomic villains because of your being exposed to ionizing radiation you became known as a guinea pig the major thing I got out of that was multiple myeloma the trouble I had access to the information to apply for the benefits that I deserve was that the repository that houses of military records burned down in 1973 which made it like a catch-22 for you to get your records senator Murphy's office was instrumental and straightening our veterans military papers I met with flawed and the office of the Inhofe were very instrumental and guided me in the right direction they finally acknowledged the cause of my multiple myeloma as I am now what's called 100% permanent and total I will be receiving assistance financially from them for the rest of my life [Music]

[Music] there's a lot of good stuff in this interview with the former cdc director robert redfield it was done with fox news medical contributor mark siegel who did sit down with dr redfield dr mark siegel and louisiana senator republican senator john kennedy joins us now as well gentlemen great to have both of you with us um mark just to sort of follow up on something that was said here that really stuck out to me um is that dr redfield is saying you know yes generally a virus goes from animal to human over a very long period of time very evolution long evolution he said but what's different about this virus is that this is the first virus that we've had with a pandemic that came after we started gain of function research and this virus looks a heck of a lot more like what was made in labs in gain of function experiments than it does like what occurs naturally absolutely structurally it does it has a site on it that increases spread and as you said before we came on before it exploded around the world that's not how it goes in nature viruses have to acclimate they have to slowly mutate over time it doesn't suddenly explode around the world and cause this inflammation doesn't dr fauci know that i think dr fauci should know that and and i think that uh people i've spoken to off the record have told me that he's biased on this not that he's compromised but that but that he's but that he believes in this because he believes in that gain of function research one other point martha is that dr redfield told me that if he had been allowed in this lab in january he thinks he could have proven this in two weeks but he was not allowed in and he kept applying and he said it was very suspicious because why should he have to make a formal application anyway right he has cdc right down the street from the china cdc and and if as they say uh there was no covet 19 in that lab they should have just opened up the doors nothing to see here doctor please come in i want to bring in senator john kennedy who is requesting more investigation about where all of this money is going and i thought senator kennedy that that was the other really interesting moment in this interview is when dr redfield says well you know the u.s funded this gain of function research too and so those people who are involved in that didn't necessarily want people looking in the lab your thoughts well the the more i hear martha the more disgusted to my core i become it's very clear dr fauci has a conflict of interest and he's had one since day one and he should have declared it now dr fauci through his friend dr peter dazyk gave a lot of u.s taxpayer money to the wuhan lab to study bad coronaviruses but dr fauci didn't monitor how that money was being spent uh if it turns out that uh uh this this virus came from that lab then a lot of questions are going to be asked from dr of dr fauci they should be asked anyway so dr fauci had a vested interest or at least the appearance of it of a vested interest from day one to be so adamant that it could not have come from a lab now i'm not saying dr falcio lied i'm saying that he's got a conflict of interest as big as dallas and on day one he owed it to to public health to the american people to stand up and say look i'm not the best person to ask on this because i've got a conflict here you know senator when i when i look back right at the origin and the beginnings of this virus it's coming from wuhan china right that that didn't come out of nowhere it was just all of a sudden we heard about wuhan china most people probably never heard of wuhan china before so i got to believe a lot of bells and whistles went off in the heads of the people who were involved in gang of function research because there are only three labs that do it there's one in north carolina there's one in texas and there's one in wuhan china so why didn't you know so so if it's the case that they kept moving everyone away from this theory oh definitely came from the wet market down the street absolutely came from the wet market down the street i mean that starts to really smell bad senator well let me let me be blunt dr fauci funneled the money to the lab through his friend dr peter dasic they have both been cheerleaders especially dr dasic for the the uh animal theory the natural theory of the virus i guarantee you when this thing first broke both dr fauci and dr dasic both thought to themselves oh my god we gave taxpayer money to the wuhan lab what if they did gain a function research as it's been done 11 times since 1992 and and the virus escaped now that i'm not saying it did or didn't but they both should have stood up and said wait a minute i've got a conflict of interest here i gave them money we didn't supervise them and i'm the wrong person to weigh in on this subject yeah or at the very least said you know look here's what we need to explain right now let's get all of this out in the open right now because we have a concern about this we know that that lab had you know security issues that were reported by state department investigators not that long before we went there and we're concerned about that lab it's always the cover-up mark yeah always you know it's it's really uh it's it's chilling you know when you look at all of this and you know i i wonder dr siegel let me just bring you in here as well what happens now because now they want a new who investigation senator kennedy wants to do an investigation into where this money went exactly for gain of function research first of all the who is deeply compromised as dr redfield say they shouldn't even be involved in this at this point but they've been carrying water for china from the beginning and as far as gain of function research i want to agree with a point he's made it's a network of researchers around the world as much as i blame china for this if it is a lab leak we are also indirectly or even directly involved because these are a series of the same researchers it's not just xi jiang li she also does work with with dr barrick in north carolina this is a same group so it's an international problem yeah let's pull up this is video that um comes from sky news australia um so it is it's of bats in a lab there is some discussion that this is that these are bats in the wuhan lab um but this is you know as as brought to us by sky news australia you know and another just line that jumps out at me senator kennedy before we go a last thought dr redfield the u.s funded a lot of that research and yet when we watched senator rand paul question dr fauci he said that wasn't true well martha it seems to me that dr fauci and dr dasic and dr collins and these other folks that know about this game of function research need to tell the american people that that that scientists all over the world are taking with and without our taxpayer money are taking normal viruses and turning them into super killers and by the way if they escape they could they could kill all of us just the thought that the american people might want to know that yeah absolutely um you know and this this research was originally founded so that they could create viruses and then learn how to cure them as sort of an exercise to figure out if this happens how would we cure it how would we have a vaccine but when you're dealing with you know these kinds of viruses you obviously need to have the highest security that is possible and if there's any chance that this thing leaked out of there we don't know for sure yet um but no we need to do more digging we don't but you've got a lot of self-interested arrogance at work here and and when you have a conflict you need to declare it senator john kennedy of louisiana thank you very much sir mark siegel excellent reporting a great interview thank you very much and thanks to dr redfield for sitting down with with dr siegel because this is extremely important to the entire country and to the entire world

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise as a member of the safe climate caucus to note the extraordinary damage done by wildfires in Washington State this summer it's a fact that our climate is changing we just had one of the driest Springs and summers and more than a century that led to trees and vegetation becoming kin link for the massive fires that we've seen the largest wildfire in our state's history hit central washington forcing thousands to flee and putting firefighters in harm's way we have a wildfire that continues to smolder in olympic national park in a rain forest from Washington to California brave emergency responders have spent this summer on the front lines battling flames with no signs of abating I believe it's time we pay attention to these warning signs if we want a better future for our kids if we want to protect the communities in which we live then we need to confront the threats of our climate change and I yield back the balance of my time

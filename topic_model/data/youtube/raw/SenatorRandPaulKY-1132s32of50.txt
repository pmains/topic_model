thank you mr chairman after more than a year of arbitrary lockdowns and other unnecessary government regulation americans are finally getting some of their freedoms back just a few weeks ago the cdc started to follow the science and admit to the public that there is no need for those who have been vaccinated to continue wearing masks public officials across the nation are finally beginning to allow businesses to reopen and children to get back to school these actions should have been taken months ago and are only the first step as we begin to try to heal our nation and the economy from government's unnecessary intervention in our day-to-day lives as inflation rises to the highest level since the great recession it appears that we are starting to realize the cost of rampant government spending i've heard it from many small businesses who are having trouble filling positions and experiencing exorbitant increases in the cost of materials earlier this month i held a round table with kentucky small business owners from a number of different industries the message was clear economic lockdowns the closures of our schools and rehiring workers are the greatest challenges that small businesses face today mr chairman i ask for the unanimous consent to submit the transcript of the round table into the record today without objection it will be included in the record since the beginning of the pandemic the federal government has spent 4.2 trillion dollars on covid19 relief small business administration has been authorized to spend just under a trillion dollars making it one of the largest spenders in the coveted economy second only to the department of treasury unfortunately treasury secretary yellen is not here today to answer for her department's use of those funds despite being required by law i repeat that required by law in a bill that was passed overwhelmingly to be here she is not here today earlier this month i sent secretary yellen a letter reminding her of that obligation yet i've received no reply mr chairman i asked consent to submit that letter for the record along with a list of the public events secretary yellen has recently chosen to participate in instead of coming to this committee that objection will be included in the record i also hope you will join me in calling on her to testify including voting on a subpoena if necessary now i'd like to welcome administrator guzman a few months ago at your nomination hearing i supported your nomination in good faith with the expectation that you would be and cooperative as the committee fulfills its oversight responsibilities unfortunately this has not been the case since march i've sent five letters requesting data and information necessary for the committee to conduct adequate oversight over the sba's coven 19 programs today we have received only two responses which fail to provide the complete information we've requested the question we have at hand is whether or not groups in our country are receiving money illegally against the policy of the small business administration we have these questions on legality and you are stonewalling us this is money that's being given to the planned parenthood organization we found at least six different loans that have been given among the letters that we sent were multiple requests for specific information about ppp loans illegally made to planned parenthood affiliates since you've been confirmed we found that at least six additional ppp loans have been made to planned parenthood for 17.6 million dollars this money is all in contravention to the sba policy that it's illegal to give money to planned parenthood in the previous administration they made a ruling that planned parenthood wasn't eligible and planned parenthood was directed to send the money back but this administration is continuing to send money to an organization that the previous administration set a policy that was consistent with a long-standing policy on affiliates getting funds when your deputy was here the last time we asked him have you changed the policy he says no the policy's still the same and yet we can't get any explanation from you we've given you the questions in advance these loans were approved in defiance of the law not in accordance with the law and are just one of the many glaring issues with small business administration programs but unfortunately we we cannot be sure due to the continued failure on your part to be transparent and provide the committee with the information we need to do our job i look forward to hearing your testimony and i'm hopeful that we can find answers to our numerous outstanding questions thank you senator paul and minister guzman it's a pleasure to have you before our committee your full testimony will be made part of our record you may proceed as you wish thank you so much good afternoon chairman carden ranking member paul and members of the committee thank you for the invitation to be here and for the opportunity to discuss sba's programs and response to the covet 19 pandemic when i appeared before you as a nominee recently i did mention how this unprecedented crisis has impacted our nation's 30 million small businesses and innovative startups and it really created a sense of urgency for me as well as my team to work harder think more creatively and build more collaboration to meet the desperate need presented by this moment in my first two and a half months as sba administrator i can tell you that my motivation to deliver for our entrepreneurs has only intensified and i have to share how proud i am of my incredible mission-driven team at the sba who despite having had to scale at such a high intensity over the past 14 months remain incredibly committed to our nation's entrepreneurs they've been working around the clock to deliver the american rescue plan's crucial relief programs to ensure our small businesses can survive this disaster and get on the path to recovery growth and resilience we're making significant progress particularly in our efforts to reach small businesses owned by women and people of color who because of long-standing barriers to capital markets and networks suffered disproportionately from this pandemic and by many accounts weren't able to access relief we're we're seeing the impact and the la the latest economic reports do show that small business jobs have begun to rebound and proprietors income levels have begun to recover and we're hearing from the small businesses we serve that both our traditional and our new relief programs have created vital lifelines earlier this month we successfully launched the 28.6 billion dollar restaurant revitalization fund as of monday when the application portal closed we've received more than 372 000 applications representing over 76 billion dollars in requested funds and more than half of those applications came from food and beverage businesses owned by women veterans and people of color who as directed by congress received priority access to the program and we're reaching the smallest of the small food and beverage businesses with one third of the total funds set aside just for them including a specific set-aside i created for businesses with revenues of fifty thousand dollars and under i'm proud of how we rolled out this program in under two months while focusing on my key priorities of meeting small businesses where they are and integrating a customer first technology driven and equitable approach we also launched the billion shuttered venue operators grant program as of may 25th the svog program has received more than 13 000 applications for approximately 11 billion in requested funds we started awarding our svog funds this week and we hope to continue to help our nation's venues hold on until they can bring back the performances and experience that are the lifeblood of our american culture through our paycheck protection program and economic injury disaster loan programs we've now gone beyond one trillion dollars in relief and so far in 2021 95 of ppp loans have gone to small businesses with fewer than 20 employees our priority across all our relief programs is to get funds into the hands of small businesses swiftly efficiently and equitably at the same time we're also committed to maintaining a high level of oversight to minimize fraud and abuse while elevating transparency and open communication we have implemented controls and oversight to better achieve that balance and reverse some of the previous fraud challenges that initially plagued the ppp and idle programs i was pleased to hear both gaos bill scheer and sba's inspector general mike ware in a recent house committee hearing that transparency at the sba has improved under my watch and that our relationship is off to a very good start there is a lot of work to do but we're working diligently to ensure this relief gets into the hands of the businesses for whom it was intended beyond our coveted relief programs we're also looking to the future and our nation's economic recovery with an eye toward equity small businesses are starting to reopen but they're still reeling from major revenue losses and most expect recovery to take more than six months this means that we will continue to see the need for capital which is why sba is exploring all options to open up capital access including direct lending additionally we know that the best thing we can do for our small businesses is to help our nation recover from covid and get our marketplaces and main streets back to normal with more than 61 percent of adult americans who have taken at least one shot of the coveted vaccine we're making progress the sba is doing its part by getting the word out about the american rescue plans tax credit available to small businesses that provide paid leave to employees receiving or recovering from coveted vaccinations there is so much more work to do as the voice for america's 30 million small businesses i will be leveraging every tool at my disposal to bring businesses back create jobs and build an equitable economy that works for everyone i look forward to partnering with you to give all entrepreneurs the tools they need to start sustain and grow into the future thank you mr chairman ranking member paul and all the members of the committee for the opportunity to appear before you today

every time I went overseas into a war zone I made it a point to see every router I couldn't and then to ask them not just the generals and the Colonel's but the sergeants and the privates what's going on what's working what do you need particularly what do you need they told me they needed armored Humvees so I immediately got on the phone on the aircraft that we took off call the commanding general and said you better start figuring out a way to get armored Humvees to our troops i miss the the service very much because it's one of those places that every day you get up it's not about you it's about the country it's a feeling of unselfish commitment to something bigger than yourself Rhode Islanders care deeply about the country and they will serve it and sacrifice for it and they believe that that service and sacrifice has to lead to something more than individual success it's going to be opportunity for all of our citizens I'm Jack Reed and I approve this message

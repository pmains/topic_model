the showdown on the border continues the pace of undocumented women and children crossing the border has slowed but it has not stopped now the Mexico is criticizing the tough response from Texas to beef up our borders and security but texture Congressman Mike McCall also talked about the border crisis today and says the Senate is part of the problem we responded in the house but the sentence reaction was to to go home and do nothing Texas congressman mike mccall says that's the unfortunate state of affairs in Washington in the middle of a crisis that demands action with Congress now on summer recess there will be no action or federal money to help stop the flow of undocumented immigrants into Texas but he says Texas is standing in the gap Texas has stood up now in spite of the federal government and create a surge with DPS with the National Guard and I think anytime you do that when you saturate the these sectors with law enforcement you see a decrease in numbers a decrease in numbers but not a solution congressman McCaul says more needs to happen but this is a phenomena that until we start turning them back and sending them back to their country of origin it's going to continue to happen I've been down there many times very sad situation from a humanitarian side as well but but we need to respond this while the border issue may not be dealt with again until the beginning of next year when Congress gets back from summer recess most of the focus will be on the November elections so they won't get much done probably until the beginning of next year

here now to react louisiana center john kennedy senator so great to see you on the program tonight there's been some talk for quite some time about china's 100-year plan there's no hiding it they want to replace the united states as the world superpower did we just see them take major strides major gains in that direction in my opinion we'll know sometimes falling feels like flying for a little while and china may believe and even boast that it's a net winner as a result of the coronavirus but i think it's a loser i think it's certainly a loser in the the worldwide court of public opinion the chinese people are good people but the communist party of china lies they lie like they breathe they lied about the virus we're now gathering evidence that the virus not only originated in china but it might have originated from the wuhan lab number two i know china says it's doing well economically but once again the communist party leadership lies like it's breeds lies like it breeds we've never been been able to trust their numbers right and number three china was very proud of its covet vaccine the fact is it's a very inferior vaccine china has distributed the vaccine to about 90 countries sometimes china extracted concessions from those countries for example i'll give you our vaccine if you support our position on taiwan but there was an interesting article that came out today a lot of the countries that have used the chinese vaccine are having major outbreaks of the coronavirus well the vaccine center is not the only thing that china is proud of they're proud of the role that the wuhan institute of virology played in this entire crisis they are ready to give the wuhan institute of virology an award so as you lay out all of the manner of sin that china the chinese communist party committed over the past year how do you hold them accountable how does the united states of america hold them accountable here's what we need to do president biden needs to enlist the support of other democracies throughout the world canada the uk australia new zealand the eu south korea japan india and we need to go to china and demand not ask but demand full disclosure we also need to the president president biden needs to have a a a prayer session with dr ted rose who work who runs the world health organization and president biden needs to tell dr tedros that look we put up 900 million dollars the american taxpayer to run your agency if you don't stand up to china you better look elsewhere for that 900 million and if that offends you i'll help you pack well i would love to see some of that accountability china's made no secret of their 100 year plan they've made no secret of their desire to replace the united states as the world's preeminent superpower let's hope that the events of the last year aren't america falling but are actually flying i saw a crazy heart senator i know jeff bridge's song sometimes following feels like flying let's hope we're the ones flying and they're the ones falling in this global struggle for power john kennedy senator john kenny thank you so much for your time tonight thank you

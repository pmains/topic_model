uh thanks for your significant leadership thanks for calling uh this here and today it is very very important uh to our starting a new congress a new presidency uh on uh uh my good friend al shapton would call uh a good foot since last wednesday's um events i have been reflecting on dr martin luther king jr's last book where do we go from here chaos or community that profound book written in 1967 could have been written just as easily today about this inflection point in our history for those of us who were activists in the 1960s we today are reliving much of what we thought was behind us in fact dr king wrote in his 1964 work why we can't wait that he was hopeful that the election of president johnson would implement many of the changes that we had been working so hard for in the run-up to that 1964 election dr king talked about this fierce urgency of now and how waiting almost always meant never yet within four years of his writing of that book we did make significant advances the 1964 civil rights act was passed into law the 1965 voting rights act became law uh in 1965 and of three years later we got the 1968 fair housing law president johnson began a significant number of programs that became known as the great society those of us who have been sitting silently by in recent years as we notice the other side misrepresenting the fact that the great society programs fail i ask you to review the record did head start fail no and it's still with us today did medicare fail did medicaid fail no still with us today did the elementary secondary education act failed no higher education act no these programs were passed as a part of lyndon johnson's great society program and many others and they are still in laws today unlike dr king's determined inheritance about a protest the current occupant in the white house is just the opposite he has called upon the american people to undo much of what was done to help move our country forward much of what we have done he spent all of his time calling for getting rid of the affordable care act and we know what that has done for many of the communities to be represented and i need not tell you uh how deplorable it was to watch him uh use the black lives matter peaceful protest to call upon military intervention to clear the way for him to go and stand in front of saint john's church with his bible upside down and doing what we all know he always does inviting resistance we saw last wednesday mob violence coming to the uh capital of the east united states we saw them waving flags of resistance among them that flag that is commonly called the confederate club flag let me remind you that is not the confederate flag it was never the confederate flag i am resisting it being called out all of these years that's the flag of white supremacy that flag was the tennessee flag used by nathan bedford forest when he was a confederate general and when the war came to a close nathan benfit france kept that flag as his flag and it became the flag of the kukas clan of which he was the first grand dragon that flag has always been living a big lie and we have helped perpetuate that big lie we need to call it what it is that's the flag that the white supremacists in germany now use as their flag because the white the swastika has been outlawed in germany and so my fellow southerners who call that flag or flag of heritage or just wrong and they know they are wrong that flag is a flag of resistance of white supremacy and we need to call it out for what it is so i want to thank you madam chair for having us here and today i hope that we can come away from this hearing uh with a good a bit of momentum to help the new congress 117th congress that's going to be one of the closest divided congresses ever uh but we can stay together if we stay unified it doesn't mean we have to be unanimous on everything we can disagree on many things and still be unified that's what we want to do so i want to thank you for all you do so let me close uh on a very personal note i have been referring to alexa talking a lot these days and i want to close with the line from this two volume work democracy in america de tocqueville said america is not great because we are more enlightened than any other nation but rather because we have always been able to repair our faults covert 19 let's zoom up some fault lines in america we must display our greatness by closing and repairing those fault lines we've got to do what we're taught to do by our faith feed the hungry clothe the neck and do unto others as we have them do unto us

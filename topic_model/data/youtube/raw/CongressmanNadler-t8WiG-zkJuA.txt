Thank You mr. chairman I just want to force up my question mentioning sy understood mr. horn to replied to Ms Norton that you would respond only to request from the Chairman and therefore not to request from any other member of the committee the administration's policy is to respond on matters of oversight to respond to requests from Lee from the Chairman I don't have time so your answer is yes only to the chip time the Chairman novia only to the committee yes so you ignore everybody else I think not to the committee to the Chairman only if a request comes from the Chairman correct yes thank you let me just say that that is an obnoxious and unprecedented I understand you didn't said it was not just an unprecedented contempt for Congress which is intolerable mr. chair mr. horn at a January press conference the president promised to track profits received by his hotels from foreign governments and to donate those profits to charity or to the US Treasury in May in response to a bipartisan request from the Oversight Committee the Trump Organization stated it was quote impractical unquote to quote fully and completely identify all patronage unquote at its hotels now mr. horn do you have any reason to believe that the president and his company that is his private company is following through on his January promise to track and donate all foreign monies received by his hotels that my role is to make sure that the agencies administering the lease and as far as I know that Clause is not in the lease so your answer is you do not know III don't know okay thank you as GSA sought to amend the lease or otherwise enter into an agreement to require the Trump Organization to track payments by foreign governments no it is not my knowledge okay have you contacted the Department of Justice or the office of government ethics and asked for assistance or direction I'm evaluating whether the Trump Organization is violating the foreign emoluments Clause of the US Constitution by not tracking these payments by foreign governments but again our role is to administer the lease will leave judgment about emoluments - but in administering the lease you have to determine presumably whether you're administering something legally you can't simply ignore it that as I've stated the Contracting Officer has made the determination that the tenant is in full compliance with the lease okay now the foreign emoluments clause that has been mentioned before applies not just to the present members of Congress but to anyone holding an office of profit or trust under the United States or any other GSA properties leased by an elected official officer or employee of the federal government I don't know the answer do you make any attempt to find out I'd be happy to look into it and follow up no no but do you make any attempt is it a normal practice to try to find out when someone signs the lease or are you ignoring that provision of the Constitution which is it the it would be a normal practice for the contracting officer who makes the decision about lease award to make sure that the whoever that the awardee was in compliance with the lease but you don't know if that includes looking into whether the lessee is an employee of the US government to the degree that if that's a term and condition of the lease then no it's not a term and condition to determine condition of the Constitution again GSA's role is to determine compliance with the the lease and applicable laws and the Constitution is not applicable but of course it is okay so why don't you make it would seem then they would be incumbent on you to look into that in every case or at least ask about it well again you know we have 12,000 employees that that make these decisions all across the country it's it's their role to look okay and you have no PI job to own we have no policy to obey the law to any other GSA properties help to facilitate payments from foreign governments to federal elected office holders please repeat the question to any other GSA properties help to facilitate payments from foreign governments to federal elected office holders I'm not aware of any okay between October 1st and March 31st lobbyists working on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia spent two hundred seventy thousand dollars on rooms catering and parking at the Trump Hotel in December of last year Bahraini diplomat smoove the country's National Day festivities to the hotel's ballroom in February Kuwait moved its annual gala from the Four Seasons to Trump International does the old post office lease agreement prohibit well is it appropriate for the GSA to maintain a lease that allows foreign governments to make payments as I just mentioned all in each case that directly benefit a government official in this case the president United States so we manage the terms and conditions of the lease the contracting officer has determined that the tenant is in compliance with the lease we don't we don't manage day-to-day operations our job is to is to administer the lease we don't get involved in day-to-day operations of the hotel but you of your legal department has made no determination one way or the other whether payments from foreign governments to an entity least from the GSA by a government official in this case the president knighted States constitutes a violation the emoluments closed or not you're simply agnostic on that point our legal department has supported the decision of the contractors it made it has made an opinion in it the tenet is in full compliance it made in it or anything on it that we can have at least has it made an opinion on that that's my question our office of legal counsel supports the Contracting Officer has it made an opinion during his time as nm got into the question the gentleman as he's writing into the questions time has expired but he should settle my time has expired today was a question but the question was asked after the time has expired it was we'll have a second round there are three basic issues one the contract only restricts an elected official from entering the contract there is no breach - there are no conflicts the president is exempted by law and three there are respected legal experts who say there was no constitutional problem Thank You mr. Horne you've stated repeatedly that the contracting officer made the decision that the lease was in compliance with the emoluments clause and with all necessary legal things correct I said that the contracting officer made the determination that the tenant was in full compliance on the terms and conditions of okay and this was based in part at least on a written opinion from unwritten advice from legal counsel I don't know if it was written advice I know that that there were multiple meetings where multiple GSA lawyers participated in conversations with about media's new ownership mr. Horan GSA has told us it was written advice so someone in your operation knows that it's written advice and has told us that so my question is can you we get a copy of that written advice we're committed to working with the committee NASA I said can we get a copy of that written advice we're requesting that right now we're committed to working with the committee you give me a yes or no question on my request and the request the ranking member I assume will you give us a copy of that written of that written advice assuming it exists we will provide all materials associated with this project when requested by the committee by which you mean by the committee chairman yes where is there so in other words the answer is no you will not give it to us unless the committee chairman requested because you're ignoring the minority party we're complying with the you're coming language he ordered to ignore the minority party and mr. chairman rather mr. Horne our staff has learned that mr. Kushner has held discussions regarding candidates for the permanent administrator position we've also learned he's been engaged in selecting the FASTA board how is this activity consistent with his riku's --all from oak from old post office matters considering the OPA lease is one of the highest profile matters in GSA's portfolio I'm not aware of mr. Kirchner's role at the White House okay let me rephrase the question assuming he has that role that he is involved in screening or interviewing candidates for the permit administrator position would this be a violation of his I'm not going to speculate on my name is speculation saying if that is true would this be not going to comment on hypotheticals okay now you said an answer to a question before that you didn't get monthly statements he only got annual statements I said that I'm not aware of monthly statements I am aware that there's a requirement for an annual report that will that will decide what what the profit sharing arrangement will be if there are where there are monthly reports I have not seen them you're not aware which which is not which is consistent with my approach to this entire project that you're not aware of the requirement not aware requirement for monthly statement that would give the same information as the as the you just mentioned correct okay section 5.3 of the lease requires that monthly statement so I read the whole thing to you sure well I'm going to meet only part of it because it's Lindsay Tennant will furnish landlord on them before the 45th day after the end of each calendar month the following items accompanied by certificate of the chief financial officer of tenant certifying such items are true etcetera etc monthly and year to date statements of income expenses and an accrual basis compare etcetera etc I can give you the rest of it okay this would seem it would seem this requires the monthly statement that you said you didn't know existed so my question is what will you do to make sure a that the monthly statement is being filed and then to answer the questions you can receive from members of the committee regarding that monthly regarding information that would appear on that monthly statement so I'll go back work with the leadership of the public building service to make sure that monthly statements as required by the lease are being received from the tenant and once again were committed to providing information about this project to the committee and are you committed to making those monthly statements available to members of the committee we're committed to you know I we're committed to responding to requests from the committee for more information okay so once again you're saying the answer is no unless unless the Republican leadership of the committee wants it and as long as the cover-up is being continued we're not going to see that information that's what you're saying I'm saying that we will comply with the administration's policy and the okay the administration's policy is that as you as you've acknowledged it is that minority members of committee are entitled to no information and therefore they can continue the cover-up I yield back I thank you

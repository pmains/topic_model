now for one minute thank you this amendment takes us in the wrong direction for years people serving in the military who are openly gay lesbian and transgender and they have served and served this country well for a lot of years we did not allow them to do so openly we finally repeal that for lesbians and gays and now just last year we had the Department of Defense they were and do the same thing for transgender so the people who have been fighting and protecting our country will be allowed to do so openly it does not harm readiness at all these people have served in the military serving honorably and served it well as far as the costs the military pays for people who have addictions who have alcoholism who smoke they pay for a lot of things that are contained within the military this amendment would target one specific group and very unfairly and most unfairly it wouldn't just first of all target transgender surgery it would target that some of the hormone drugs which cost like $100 a year cost absolutely virtually nothing to the military but most importantly this wouldn't just impact transgender I yield myself an additional 30 seconds I was recognized so nothing just impact transgender people who are serving it would impact their children if you're serving in the military and you happen to have a child who is transgender you would now be cut off from this military service all these other things alcoholism drug addiction smoking all manner of different problems would be served but transgender people would be targeted to not be allowed to provide health care for their children this isn't going to help readiness this is a social agenda that has no business being in the defense bill we didn't have it in committee we shouldn't have it here on the floor let's focus on the threats that Miss Hartzler talked about not make this into a social agenda based on the ignorance of what transgender truly is I reserve the balance of my channel

hello warren democrats it is so great to be together for the second installment of we got a plan for that series um warren democrats is hosting the series of conversations between endorsed candidates about important policies and plans that really go to the heart of the movement for big structural change i'm getting in this fight for candidates up and down the ballot who are running on policies and platforms that we need in order to push our country forward you know the way i see it nobody makes it on their own so i'm not just getting in the fight i'm inviting everyone on this call to get more involved by volunteering for candidates in their state to help them win so let me start out by just getting straight to the point we know that this is a moment of crisis for our nation a global pandemic an economy that's being squeezed to the breaking point and protests against racial injustice that demand bold action as a nation we've got a lot of soul searching to do about systemic racism and a lot of changes we need to make today we're going to discuss the need for changes in policing and changes in our criminal justice system the racial violence that killed george floyd ahmad aubry brianna taylor is not new in america and what's captured on video represents only a fraction of the violence that black americans experience it some of it while in police custody so let's face it there is no one and done solution to the systemic racism embedded in our policing in our criminal justice system we need real federal muscle for accountability so here are some of the ways we can start in the senate ed markey and i have proposed an end to qualified immunity and i've worked with senators durbin and hirono to strengthen federal and state government's ability to investigate police departments with the pattern and practice of unconstitutional and discriminatory behavior alongside representative ayanna pressley i've also put forward a bill to hold police officers criminally liable for denying medical care to people who are in custody and i support the justice in policing act that's led by senators cory booker and kamala harris and the congressional black caucus it would demilitarize the police ban chokeholds establish federal standards of force and a whole lot more but state and local effect fed state and local elected officials also have a powerful role to play in reimagining public safety every single elected official from members of congress to mayors and governors to district attorneys must be working to reform our criminal justice and policing systems at the federal the state and the local levels and that's why it's so important to elect candidates that are ready to tackle these challenges head on so tonight warren democrats is proud to endorse this slate of candidates who understand the importance of changing our country's approach to criminal justice and who have plans for how their states can meet these this moment these candidates need your help to cross the finish line in november so i hope that you'll learn more about all of them and about all of our warren democratic candidates at elizabethwarren.com endorsements if you go there you can find a candidate in your state you can get involved in a campaign you care about and you can donate to help them win but before we meet today's candidates we have a very special guest who is joining me to help me lead this call my good friend julian castro put a spotlight on this urgent topic during his campaign for president and so tonight he's here to discuss it with us hello julian hello senator it's great to be with you good to see you to be on tonight uh it's good to see you again and especially to love you know uh treat to get to chat with some fantastic candidates you know i wanted to thank you and warren democrats for your leadership on this issue tonight we're talking about such an important issue where there's tremendous yearning for change out there whether it's on the streets or in city halls or state legislatures or in the halls of congress as you mentioned where significant legislation has moved forward uh and you know there's a there is a a hopefulness about the ability to get something done in washington because of your leadership the leadership of senator booker on senator harris and others uh who have been great on this issue uh during the campaign the issue of police violence and how we can ensure that no matter who you are no matter the color of your skin you're treated the same by law enforcement was an issue close to my heart and what i want is an america like i'm sure you do where nobody has to drive in their car or walk in their neighborhood afraid that they might be stopped unnecessarily or unreasonably or arrested or treated with excessive force and there are reforms that we can make many of them that you mentioned so that we can ensure that we have that kind of america and i'm glad to be with you and our great candidates uh that we've also endorsed from people first um because they're that fantastic you'll find out why um because we know and you and i agree that when it comes to actually getting something done we need to elect people who are gonna have the courage uh and the vision to cast that vote and to put forward that legislation at their city hall in their state legislature or in congress and those are the folks that we're going to talk to tonight so that's fantastic julian you know your new group people first future has had some recent victories in texas i think that's fabulous you know that you have endorsed candace valenzuela and she won and jose garza who also won and who's with us here tonight so let's find out who's here okay today we're joined by three people uh that uh people first future and warren democrats have endorsed and they are committed to the fight to end police brutality and reform our criminal justice system so we're going to chat with them in just a minute as you've been watching this black lives matter protests all across the country which are still going strong today um let's talk about what do you see as the role of elected representatives right now in this fight for justice how do you see it julian well i think that at every level our elected representatives have an opportunity to make meaningful change um and let's take a level where there's a lot of action uh which is the local level for on city councils or if you're a mayor right now the budget season is coming up a lot of fiscal budgets start on september 1 or october 1. that means that right now cities are debating what they're going to find there been there's been calls for additional investment in things like uh mental health services and uh housing opportunity and social workers uh to perhaps better address a lot of the needs that exist out there because we know that out there in our country too oftentimes we ask police officers to respond to somebody who's homeless or somebody with a mental health issue that is not violent uh oftentimes is not violating uh any major law uh you know some cities have criminalized homelessness unfortunately but we can handle these situations better so in the budget season you know what are you doing if you're a city council member or mayor to to address that same thing with police union contracts there's an opportunity to institute significant reforms there on accountability on transparency at the state legislature level um colorado just passed a bill that mirrors a lot of what was in the george floyd justice and policing act that you mentioned at the federal level uh banning qualified immunity banning chokeholds creating more transparency and i'm excited that we have candidates running for district district attorney um as well as state attorney because there's a lot of opportunity at that local and state level to make these changes that's that's terrific so how about if we get started you want to introduce our candidates that we've got here julian yeah so um let's we have with us uh jose garza who is running for travis county district attorney george gascon who's running for los angeles county uh district attorney and kim fox who is running for re-election as the state attorney in illinois and i'm going to start off with a question for kim fox if i can first of all thank you all for joining us for i know how busy everybody is especially right now in the middle of uh of election season but this is a great conversation to have so kim i just wanted to start with you you're running for re-election as the state's attorney for cook county illinois tell us for folks that may not be familiar with this what a state attorney does and what role a state attorney plays in the criminal justice system well thank you first and foremost thank you secretary and thank you senator for pulling this panel together i have so much admiration and respect for uh the both of you in your work elevating the need for criminal justice reform not just in the last couple of months but as part of your ongoing campaigns and so i'm honored to be here and particularly uh with the other candidates that you have tonight um um i am the state's attorney for clint county which is state's attorney is another way of saying district attorney and cook county is home to the city of chicago and its surrounding suburbs what a district attorney or state's attorney does is in essence they're the gatekeepers of the criminal justice system many people know about criminal law from watching law and order and so i'd like to remind people in the beginning of the show there is a crime that's happened and the detectives are trying to figure out who did it and once they've decided that they know who've done it they bring it to the prosecutors to then take the case to court to present the case before a judge or a jury and we're the gatekeepers in that in most jurisdictions a case doesn't get before a judge unless the prosecutor says so so the prosecutor has the power to charge and just as importantly the power not to charge when you talk about criminalizing certain behaviors it is the prosecutor who is the vehicle by which they make those determinations to charge someone with something perhaps they shouldn't uh it is the prosecutor who who makes offers and plea bargains or recommendations for sentences or recommendations for bail when we look at over incarceration rates it is a lot of it driven by prosecutorial priorities and decision makings and distress discretion that they have along the way and so for many people in this conversation around criminal justice reform they have neglected for far too long the power of the prosecutor and it's why races like this are so vitally important because it is that prosecutor who decides whether or not to charge the police officer who has his knee in the neck of george floyd or here in cook county the police officer who shot laquan mcdonald 16 times as he lay in the streets that even though the law may allow you to do so you do need courageous thoughtful and thorough prosecutors to go and do the oath and charge these cases where appropriate and not charge cases when it's not and you you know you mentioned the uh case of lavon mcdonald which captured the nation's attention a few years ago and so tragic uh and so outrageous uh you know during your what do you see now um having served in the office as the most pressing criminal justice issues uh that chicago is facing and cook county is facing and what have you been focused on in terms of uh your outreach to voters during this campaign on criminal justice reform yeah i came into office in 2016 which was another big year in the country in talking about police accountability and justice reform and at the time chicago had much like we're feeling now a horrifically violent year with gun violence we saw uh hundreds of people who were murdered thousands of people who were shot and yet the public was crying out for not just solving for violence but the brokenness of our justice system in a city like chicago where we have such rich communities our jails 86 are african-american and latino our juvenile justice system 90 of the young kids there african-american and latino so the over-representation of blacks and latinos in our justice system again not for these things that keep us up at night but for people who were too poor to pay their traffic tickets who had their driver's licenses suspended people who were being arrested for petty retail theft when i came in the office despite that horrifically violent year most of our prosecutorial research resources were growing after retail theft shoplifting and people who had drug abuse issues and so for me the way that we address violence that is my most pressing issue right now as a prosecutor is to not spend our very limited resources going after those who don't pose a threat to our public safety and really focusing on those who do and calling attention to the racial disparities and the structural racism that exists that allow for so many people who aren't a threat to be caught up in our system so my priorities have been around bail reform reducing people being in jail because of their impoverished states my priorities have been around dealing with the crisis of substance use disorder and not criminalizing people for having an addiction or a mental health issue and righting the wrongs of the past we were the wrongful conviction capital of the united states the false confession capital of the united states in my tenure we've vacated the wrongful convictions of over a hundred men and women just in the last three and a half years we cannot have people believing in the credibility of our institutions if we allow for them to harm communities and do nothing to rectify that well kim that's really powerful you know i want to see if i can pull george into this as well so george gasco you are running for los angeles district attorney could you also say a little bit about what role progressive states attorneys and district attorneys play in the fight to hold law enforcement accountable and and why do you think it's so important to elect progressive candidates in these positions no absolutely first of all thank you so much senator warren for your support and for warren democrats and secretary julian castro for your assistance and your support with people first is really meaningful to us i agree with kim you know this work is has national import and having the support of national leaders like yourself really makes a difference but why is it important to have progressive prosecutors in places like la and and you know say like california first so la county is the largest uh district attorney's office in the country uh about 10 and a half million people and what happens in la has a tremendous impact throughout the entire state of california i mean if you look at the death road in the state of california most people think well california has to be so progressive but we have over 700 people on that road in california and a third of those come from la county we have thousands of children that get prosecuted as adults every year out of la county we continue to prosecute the mentally ill if you look at our jail which has a largest county jail in the country uh nearly 50 of the people in there are people that have a mental health problem and we know science clearly says that the concrete box is not going to fix mental health but we continue to do that we continue to criminalize poverty uh people that are often uh they are houseless and they're out on the streets and and you have prosecutors continuing to to prosecute people for for offenses that are really driven by poverty and the fact that they don't have a place to stay um police accountability you know i know this is a you know the horrendous death that george floyd obviously brought this to the surface the reality for many of us like kim and obviously you guys as well we have known this has been going on for a very long time and it is prosecutors as kim talked about it is looking for a way where it is appropriate to prosecute a case and to make sure that law enforcement understands that they're going to be held accountable now in my county you have a county where there have been 600 police killings in the last seven years one prosecution so the import of having a progressive prosecutor is it goes across the board it's environmental justice is you know it's holding police accountable it's holding prosecutors accountable in itself you know all this comes to the table well that's a that's a powerful stat uh you know it it makes me ask there have been black lives matter protests in los angeles over the last few months how do you think that los angeles and california can lead at this moment what are you running to change yeah you know again i mean this is one of the things where black lives matters have been protesting the current day since 2017 for the very reasons that i mentioned earlier but it's true lately there was a about a week ago or two weeks ago ten thousand people in front of her office uh what is important well let me start with ending cash bail right we know that about fifty percent of the people in our jail are there because they are too poor to pay cash bill they are being in yes and stole your guilty until proving innocent because they have to stay in jail uh because they cannot afford to leave so that would be something that in in the use of cash bill we're talking about again prosecuting children as adults we know science tells us that our brain is not fully developed until we're 25 and yeah in l.a county we're caging 16 17 year olds sometimes 15 years old adult and in the death penalty we know the death penalty is broken but yet l.a county continues to put people on their throat it's holding law enforcement accountable it's focusing on survivors of sexual assault it is holding public officials accountable taking care of our environment those are the things that really drive me and this is what i look forward to trying to do if i get elected in l.a thank you well thank you george let me just bring jose into the conversation uh now jose you just won your election um in a landslide and correct me if i'm wrong i think that you were taking on an incumbent uh you won that primary in a landslide this is travis county which includes austin uh so it's a county of over a million people now well over a million um what does that mean for uh the future of criminal justice reform in travis county and what do you think it signifies in terms of criminal justice reform for our state of texas secretary gossel it's so good to be with you um and i'm so grateful to you and senator warren for your leadership not only on these issues but in our race um there is no doubt in my mind that um we would not be on the cusp of fundamentally reimagining our criminal justice system um if not for your leadership and engagement in our race you know um secretary castro you know as well as anyone that the state of texas has not exactly been a beacon for justice in our country and in fact the state itself has perpetrated gross acts of racism under the color of the law almost since its birth as a state in this country but we also know that it doesn't have to be that way that there is the possibility for a new texas to emerge in this moment and because of the incredible courage of regular people in san antonio in dallas here in in austin in travis county we have the opportunity to see an austin and a texas that leads on these issues and that leads on ending cash bail that leads on ending our failed war on drugs that leads on investing in working class people and people of color that leads on lifting up working class people and people of color instead of locking them up and i am just so grateful to have the opportunity to to try to bring fruition the aspirations of so many people in our communities who have been demanding them absolutely and yes senator i just want you to know that that jose is a san antonio guy uh in fact uh his mom was the superintendent of the edgewood independent school district you may remember that was the school district that was involved in the 1973 legislation on whether education is a fundamental right and the financing of of school districts in texas and the one that my brother joaquin and i started our schooling in and my dad taught in for 26 years uh so many folks are very proud of jose just one quick follow-up you've talked a lot about reimagining justice you know talk to me a little bit about what that looks like what would your first couple of steps be to do that well for for 400 years in this country we have been sold this lie that what public safety is is locking up as many black and brown people as we can that if we would only do that that would make our communities more safe but we know that's not true we know that what public safety is is a good job we know it's access to health care we know it's good schools to send our children and so it is time um to pull back the rug of our criminal legal system that has weighed on our communities for so long we are going to end on day one the prosecution of low-level drug offenses in our community i mean as a starting place i've been very specific about what that means it means possession or sale of a gram or less because as george said as kim said locking people up is not how you address substance use we are going to end the cash bail system here in travis county and we are going to hold law enforcement officers accountable when they kill or harm members of our community we have so much work to do but our community is ready well this is terrific thank you so much jose you know i'm reminded when i listened to you when i listened to george when i listened to kim that you all have real plans and that when you have the power in office as kim has already started doing you make real change this is how we make our system work better how we make it work for everyone i just want to thank all of the warren democrats who've joined us the people first future endorsed candidates for being here today uh it's great to speak to all of you and i'm so excited to have the chance to support your campaigns before we close i'm going to pass this back over to julian to talk about how folks can get involved and help these fabulous candidates win in november because remember we're going to make each other stronger in these fights that's how we win and that's how we make real change julian back to you thanks a lot senator and thank you again for your leadership on

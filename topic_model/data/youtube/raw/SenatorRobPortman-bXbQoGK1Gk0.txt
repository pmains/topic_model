thank you chairman I want to thank you and Senator Johnson for working on a bipartisan basis to put together this legislation I'm a co-sponsor of it I know the house has a different view uh interest I'd like to approach it but we got to get this one done I mean we just heard about the importance of it so I thank you for both of you for working on this issue and it's less than a month when it expires so we've got to move and move quickly I spoke in my opening statement about the appreciation we have for the men and women who you represent we just learned from media accounts that five Customs and Border Protection agents were shot one fatally during a vessel interdiction against suspected drug smugglers off the coast of Puerto Rico um this just happened and uh our thoughts and prayers of course are with the family of the agent who was fatally shot and also with those agents who were wounded but I think it's a silver reminder of the sacrifices that uh the individuals who you represent today here make every day and we owe them our support um it's uh it's it's a dangerous time and uh this is an unfortunate example of that so with regard to the southern border we've talked a lot about this over over the months and years even uh you know how do you take a broken system and fix it because clearly if you look at this chart behind me it's it's broken uh we have we have had all kinds of charts in this committee and all kinds of discussions about it there was an interesting back and forth recently between President Biden's chief of Border Patrol Ortiz who works for you as you know Mr secretary and the State of Florida the Attorney General in Florida has a lawsuit against the department with regard to the southern border and uh I just thought I'd go over that quickly this has been the worst year of apprehensions ever the last fiscal year but the second worst year was last year and so these numbers speak for themselves more than two million people apprehended between the ports of entry in 2022. this summer when the chief of Border Patrol was questioned by the state of Florida he gave his answers under oath and uh I would ask unanimous consent to place the transcript of the border patrol Chief's testimony under the record Mr chairman with without objection secretary I'm going to ask you the same questions that the chief of Border Patrol was asked to see if you agree with him and if you could please just give me a yes or no answer as he did uh the first question uh is the southern border currently in crisis yes or no ranking member Portman the entire hemisphere is suffering a migration crisis we are seeing an unprecedented movement of people from country to Country it is not restricted to the southern border we are seeing an unprecedented movement of people throughout the Western Hemisphere and I think the case of Venezuela is the most compelling example with a population of between 25 and 28 million people approximately 8 million of them have left that country Colombia is hosting 2.4 million Venezuelans I I would ask you for a yes or an answer together Southern board I've been in Columbia twice in the last year I'm very aware of what's going on with regard to the displaced people out of Venezuela for that matter Nicaragua Cuba um but the question is all the more pressing so what are we doing about it shouldn't we be changing our policies at the border to deal with it instead of having this result so my question to you again is the southern border currently incred Isis yes or no we are we are seeing a significant challenge at the southern border as we're seeing it throughout the hemisphere Chief Ortiz stated yes so you know your workbook to received he said the obvious which is yes second question would you agree that the unprecedented number of unlawful migrants are entering that an unprecedented number of unlawful migrants are entering the United States right now yes or no ranking member uh Boardman I believe that the number of encounters that we have had at the border I think it is approximately 2.3 million this past year is the highest on record okay so the answer is is yes by Chief Ortiz and and uh since like you agree with him on that Mr secretary when President Biden took office is the truth the number of migrants trying to unlawfully enter the United States has increased substantially yes or no uh it it has and there are many different factors that um that contribute to that well I ask you these questions obviously his answer was yes um he was candid and he gave short answers we can't fix the problem unless we acknowledge it and we can't fix the problem unless we understand the facts yes we can't fix the problem unless we're willing to be honest Republicans Democrats everyone alike saying we've got a crisis and if we don't fix this crisis that the Border we'll continue to see these same results if I may there's been a problem with our immigration system and acknowledged one unanimously so for years and years the system is known for years and years but again look at this chart this this is the numbers so it's gotten far worse and uh look we don't have time to go into the details as to how we fix it but you and I have talked about this a lot Mr secretary and if the assignment system is not fixed this won't end if we don't give the border patrol more resources this is not going to end if we don't figure out a way to provide for deportations when people are here illegally particularly when they're committing other crimes this will continue so we are unfortunately looking at a situation where you mentioned Colombia if you go to the countries throughout the atmosphere they believe this is a pull factor our policies and the leadership of these countries actually don't want their people moving into the United States that might seem counterintuitive to some people but some of their best and brightest are leaving because of our pull factor because we're not putting in place the right policies to be able to control our own Southern border

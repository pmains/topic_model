and at the same time the U.S Senate is debating a bill that could improve how our country handles the issue of mental health I sat down with Republican Bill Cassidy from Louisiana about why for him this isn't only about policy it's personal every single one of us has a family history a a a loved one a friend someone you know that has serious mental illness if you add addiction to that it becomes even more pervasive now my family's that's my family too and and everybody watching is their family when you say you're a family how so oh my gosh don't make me cry um but I had a nephew commit suicide now it's still emotional after all these years but everybody has such an emotional story now we can either say okay we have this emotion there's nothing to do about it or we can say we're going to attempt to do something about it and I'd like to think that which we're doing was I'm doing with Senator Murphy and Congress is participating in creating the resources for locals and states to do something positive means that that those stories will be different that the person who if her needs are unattended to Spirals downward instead has her needs attended to and that first episode of serious mental illness is her last episode if we can do that we succeed do you think that that could have saved your nephew's life well we'll never know right and he had a lot of good service so we attempt to do things for people and but we can't know for sure um but there is someone out there that the data shows will be helped this is what we're doing is based on something done in Maine in which they took folks who had their first episode of serious mental illness as an adolescent or young adult and again wrap those services around that person and they've found they can make a difference and again instead of serial breakdowns leading to a death and being found beneath a Interstate overpass the person was returned to wholeness and it became a distant memory not a life-defining event yeah and if we can do that then it's great for the person the family in our society my uncle died by Suicide he had mental health issues so it's it's hit me personally as well and it really changed my perspective on the importance of mental health did your um your nephew dine by Suicide change your perspective and if you don't mind me asking when did that happen well that was about 20 years ago even longer I'm a physician and so and I worked in a hospital for the uninsured so I think I always had a group of patients who are more vulnerable now patients in general by definition almost are vulnerable but my practice of liver disease dealt with a lot of folks who had alcohol problems or drug problems not all but some and there's oftentimes a co-diagnosis there's the person who has this addiction but the addiction in a way is attempting to compensate for the mental illness it's interesting because mental health is often separated from physical health why is it so important for mental health and physical health to be treated in tandem well there's an occasional medical condition in which the physical condition brings about the mental health issue so we can have that kind of small subset but when you look at people's serious mental illness the longevity is much less than the general population much less put differently they're more likely to die at an early age and so having serious mental illness often leads to serious physical illness now we spoke about the people who treat themselves with addiction cigarettes or alcohol or drugs but it's also an inability or a difficult in keeping up with follow-up Health Care visits and then sometimes it's our dadgum payment laws prior to the bill that Chris and I wrote um and and others in another bill we worked on Medicaid would not pay for someone to see their family doctor for example and their Mental Health Doctor the same day so the the internists could see the patient see that the patient was wildly psychotic but couldn't send them across the hall to see the psychiatrist because Medicaid wouldn't pay for two doctor visits similarly the psychiatrist could see the person and just diagnose him as being dehydrated from diabetes out of control but could not send them over to the internist in order to have their diabetes addressed had to send them to the emergency room with all the barriers that that it's involved with so it's also our payment system that has worked against people getting the care they need I want to talk a little bit more about that bill with Senator Murray that you've been Reform reauthorization Act do you have do you feel as though members of your party support this enough for it to to pass to they understand the urgency of this how do you convince them this is not government overreach well so this is a reauthorization of a bill we passed in 2016. the mental health Reform Act of 2016. at that time called The most significant reform of mental health laws in 30 years so so this is not out of hold piece fired in September six buyers in September and and of course our bill attempts to take it and refine it what went right what went wrong try and make it better now whether or not it's passed at the end of the year I can't tell you that there's a lot of stuff trying to come together in an end of the year package if not we'll reauthorize it again this coming year try and get the dollars put out there for the state and local programs to continue um I think everyone agrees upon the urgency it's probably just the overall kind of sheer volume of business that Congress has to get done number one and number two in the response to the the the the shooting in Uvalde we passed a whole lot of other mental health legislation and so it may just be okay we've spent a lot of time and energy upon this set of Mental Health uh uh proposals we have to let other things work their way through the system before we return to mental health again

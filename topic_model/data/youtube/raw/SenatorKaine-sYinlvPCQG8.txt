we're about to start our traditional August recess Congress is an interesting place because we not only get a recess a vacation as many Americans do but we're legally required to take one that's right by an act of congress congress is required absent a separate agreement to take a month off during august i learned that just yesterday during a great presentation from one of our senate historians Kate's got this mandated August adjournment is part of the legislative reorganization Act of 1970 and the Act provides that an odd-numbered years the house is adjourned from the first friday in August until the tuesday after Labor Day mr. president there is an exception the mandated recess quote shall not be applicable if on July 31 of such year a state of war exists pursuant to a declaration of war by Congress again the mandated recess is not applicable if on July 31 of such year a state of war exists pursuant to a declaration of war by Congress this provision makes basic sense doesn't it Congress shouldn't go out for a mandatory 30-day vacation when the nations at war it's not right that American troops should risk their lives overseas far from home while Congress takes a month off the Congress that passed this bill in 1970 had an expectation about how serious war was and how Congress the institution charged with declaring war would treat such a serious obligation well we are about to go on a one-month to German with the nation at war in fact this saturday august eight marks one year since president obama initiated US airstrikes against the Islamic state in northern iraq in the past year more than 3,000 members of the United States military have served in operation inherent resolve thousands are there now launching more than 4,500 airstrikes carrying out Special Forces operations and assisting the Iraqi military the Kurdish Peshmerga and Syrians fighting the Islamic state Virginians connected with the USS Roosevelt carrier group are stationed there right now we've made major gains in northern Iraq more recently in northern Syria but the threat posed by the Islamic state continues to spread in the region and beyond the war's cost 3.2 billion dollars through mid-july an average of nine and a half million dollars a day and seven American service members have lost their lives serving in support of the mission and recently we've heard that the administration may be expanding the scope of the war to defend us train Syrian fighters against attacks including from the Bashar al-assad regime we're expanding our cooperation with turkey in the region we even hear rumors of a u.s. Turkish humanitarian zone in northern Syria each of these steps is potentially significant and could lead to even more unforeseen expansions of the ongoing war we've already had testimony by military leaders to suggest that the war will likely go on for years but as the war expands and our troops risk their lives far from home and as we prepare to go on our traditional month one month recess a tacit agreement to avoid debating this war persist in Washington the president maintains that he can conduct this war without authorization from Congress he waited more than six months after the war started to even send Congress a draft authorization of the mission congressional behavior has been even more unusual though vested with the sole power to declare war by article 1 of the Constitution Congress has refused to meaningful a debate or vote on the war against the Islamic state a congress quick to criticize any executive action by the president has nevertheless encouraged him to carry out an unauthorized war as far as our allies the Islamic state or our troops know Congress is indifferent to this war I first introduced a resolution to force Congress to do its job and debate this war in September 2014 that led in December to an affirmative vote by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to authorize the war with specific limitations but the matter wasn't taken up on the floor because the Senate was about to change to a new majority and that party wanted to analyze the issue a fresh six months then went by and Senator Jeff Flake and I introduced finally a bipartisan war resolution jun 2 pride the senate to take its constitutional responsibility seriously after so many months of inaction we wanted to show that there's a bipartisan consensus against the Islamic state the result a few discussions in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but otherwise silence one year of war against the Islamic state has transformed a president who was elected in part because of his early opposition to the Iraq war into an executive war president it has stretched the 2001 authorization for use of military force that was passed to defeat the perpetrators of 911 far beyond its original meaning or intent it has shown to all that neither the Congress nor the president feels obliged to follow the 1973 War Powers Resolution which requires the President sees any unilateral military action within 90 days unless Congress votes to approve it and it has demonstrated that Congress would rather avoid its constitutional duty to declare war that have a meaningful debate about whether and how the United States should militarily confront the Islamic state this one-year anniversary also coincides few minutes ago with a vigorous congressional effort to challenge us diplomacy regarding the Iranian nuclear agreement the contrast between congressional and difference to war and energetic challenge to diplomacy is most disturbing so why isn't Congress doing its job last month I asked marine commandant Joseph Dunford nominated to be the next chairman of the joint chiefs of staff whether congressional action to finally authorized the war against the Islamic state would be well received by American troops his answer said it all I think what our young men and women need and it's really all they need to do what we ask them to do is the sense that what they're doing has purpose has meaning and has the support of the American people a debate in Congress by the people's elected representatives and a vote to authorize the most solemn act of war is how we tell our troops that what they're doing what they're risking their lives war has purpose has meaning and has to support the American people otherwise we're asking them to risk their lives without even bothering to discuss whether the mission is something we support can there be anything anything more immoral than that to order troops to risk their lives in support of a military mission that we are unwilling even to discuss one year in our service members are doing their jobs but they're still waiting on us to do ours and as I conclude oh yeah what about that August recess how can we go away and adjourn for a month in the midst of an ongoing war why that's easy the part of the statute that creates an exception for the mandatory August adjournment only applies if there has been quote a declaration of war by Congress because we haven't even bothered to debate or authorize this war in the year since it started we are still entitled by statute to take the month of August off

under NASA the American space program has been a symbol of world leadership and national pride at this crucial point in our history we must use our investments wisely and work even harder to advance sound policy if we expect to maintain American leadership in the space domain to help NASA centers across the country engage with commercial industry and become better stewards of their underutilized infrastructure we have introduced HR 4304 the NASA enhanced use lease Authorization Act of 2019 this bill will reauthorize NASA's EUL agreement authority for 10 years and is supported by representatives from both sides of the part of both parties and across the country from Virginia to California everywhere in between Administrator can you elaborate on the ways NASA centers across the country have successfully used eul agreements to reduce operating costs and improve NASA facility conditions absolutely so you know I think there's some really good examples of infrastructure that would include buildings for example where a private company wants to use a building that NASA is not using currently and part of the part of the the way they have access to that building is to make it usable and improve it and then after a period of time nASA has the rights to that building again in the future or they could continue their their lease so these are all good things where the we're NASA can partner with the private sector and we have similar kind of agreements for launch facilities and of course as you're familiar with it at Stennis test facilities so I think there's lots of opportunity to improve NASA's facilities by partnering with the private sector is not reauthorize and eul what would happen it'd be really bad for NASA it'd be really bad for our private sector partners that's a please reauthorize it

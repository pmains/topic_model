who should know congressman jim hymes democrat from connecticut serves on the intelligence committee the permanent intelligence committee congressman it is good to have you this morning let me ask you something did you know good morning chris about these attacks before they occurred um it was actually a pretty small number of people in the congress who knew about these attacks look a lot of us knew that they were coming in some way shape or form but as you probably know the white house reached out to the leadership we had uh unfortunately left uh for the uh close of session so i think it was mainly the leadership that actually knew the timing in the terms of the attacks all right well we're in the phase right now of watching this and it's being somewhat celebrated for effectiveness early on but as you well know this was a decision that was fraught with risk the united states entered into it with all due deliberation well uh no i don't believe that the us entered into it with all due deliberation look as a lot of people have said this is the kind of thing that more broadly and i'm not just talking about the specific arming and training of the syrian moderates that we did debate and and vote on but a larger look we're using the word now war is something that if we're going to go into it both abiding by the terms of the constitution but also with the american people having fully understood the implications we need to have a debate and a vote on it in the congress and i i would add look i i am one who would say that adamantly at the same time i support the activities that the president has undertaken in the last couple of days the bombing and that he's been doing for six weeks so i'm not saying that i oppose what's happening i'm just saying it is worth given that this is going to be a long-term thing with reversals for us to have that debate on the floor of congress so the american people understand what it is that we're getting into true two problems with that one it's too late because you're already at war and two even you congressman who's been very open and what you disagree with disagree with some things agree with others that's not how it works everybody's got to be on the same page you have to own the risk going forward and that's why when you see what the uk is doing it almost makes the united states look a little jv doesn't it he calls parliament back they're going to have a vote they're going to debate it they've told him no once before on bombing in syria but they're acting the way they do to have a unified people going into it how could we have done this here again well you know unfortunately one of the reasons one of the smaller reasons i voted against the arming of the syrian moderate rebels was that that was what the president needed from the congress and we just handed it to him uh and that was our one piece of leverage to say no mr president we want to have a broader discussion about what this looks like where are we you know 12 13 years after we first started this counter-terror effort and what should we do right now so yeah look we've traded the one piece of leverage that we had to get a full uh and vigorous debate on the floor of the congress with the president you know one thing i would just uh maybe slightly do you say we don't all need to be on the same page and we won't always be on the same page but we all we ought to at least out the issues have a long conversation about them and let the let the people see where their representatives stand on this very very complicated issue well i think that you're right uh you do not have to agree all the time but you do have to come to a consensus you do have to vote and you do have to have an outcome so that the people know that's the only way for them to know where their leaders wound up on such a major decision and i would say it's not the only leverage you had congressman it is politically because of what the state of play is the only real thing on the table was arming the syrians but the constitution makes it so clear that it's not even an academic conversation war is all you guys all you guys and you've been handing it to the president for generations and now it may come back to bite you no look exactly and that's a mistake and i don't mean to point fingers solely at the white house here the white house obviously this has been true for 60 years the white house has believed they've got more war making authority than probably the constitution warrants but look there were an awful lot of senators and members of congress who didn't want to take that vote and uh you know that's just awful that is an abrogation of a fundamental responsibility i understand it's a tough vote in the context of an election but we're talking about war and peace here so yeah look in in a better world uh we would not be at home right now we would be in washington talking about tough issues you know because again i think most of the congress would have completely backed the president on these air strikes you know we would but we would have talked more about who else is involved we would have talked more about what are the underlying factors that are giving rise to groups like this you know uh frankly the com you know the fact that some of the funding for these guys is still coming out of the very countries uh that flew with us in the last couple of nights and what can we do about that that's the broader deeper conversation than we should be having instead we had a military tactical discussion is it air strikes is it moderate you know moderate syrian rebels we need to really and by the way i give the president credit in front of the u.n yesterday he made these points that this is a global effort involves far more than military it involves some fundamental change and some very broken societies well fundamentally it's the fight over the soul of islam right and that's something that's not going to be decided by force not going to be decided by the united states let me ask you something else while i have a member of the permanent intelligence committee before us uh this threat from the coruscant uh the offshoot of al qaeda i know you can't get into what you actually know but people need to know how specific this threat was is this just political jazz they're being told to justify air strikes or was there really information you were given that show that the use of force was justified to stop something that could happen here in the united states um let me answer the question this way chris uh the attacks that uh that were undertaken against coruscant were were a were in response to a threat that was far more specific and far more credible than any threat that isis had leveled at the united states isis as you know uh has for weeks now been threatening to do this and threatening to do that uh coruscant actually had as one of its core uh reasons for being to plan attacks uh in the west uh some a little bit like the ones that have been announced in the media but um when the president says that he went after coruscant because it was actually a direct and imminent threat uh to the united states uh he is not i forget the word you use but he's not being political you know you're in a tough situation when you're at war with one group but they're not issuing threats as bad against the united states as another group and you need to attack them as well it just really speaks to the urgency of the situation congressman thank you for coming on new day and talking about these issues push your brothers and sisters to come in and debate i still say it's too late but they got to get on record at some point thank you for being with us i'm i'm with you on that chris thank you thank you sir

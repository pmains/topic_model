director Mulvaney thank you for appearing today and I appreciate your comments as I've sitting and listening I'd like to jump back to enforcement actions and you started out by talking about that you are engaging enforcement actions and I believe you talked about having undergoing right now 100 investigations is that correct yes ma'am those investigations started under your watch or prior to you coming into you some of them the ordinary course of business is we sort of add some on a regular basis they drop off there's a hundred ongoing at any one particular time and under your watch of those hundreds some you started yeah actually be surprised to know I'm actually not involved in the decision making to start or stop an investigate but they were either started under some of them worse I would imagine yes ma'am you would imagine but you don't know for sure again I know that sounds strange I'm not involved in the process that's a career decision as to as to who they investigate and 25 litigation efforts you talked about that are ongoing do you know if any of those were started while you were hour while you're under those no I know the answer that question we have not started any new lawsuits since I've been here so there's been no enforcement action say for instance under your watch no new ones we are actively litigating 25 it's helpful does that have anything to do with the fact that I heard your comment earlier you're talking about that the CFPB engages in regulation by enforcement and so you've stopped enforcement because you have concerns about that no again regulation by enforcement is different than enforcement regulation by enforcement is essentially look we don't have a rule we don't have a reg we're not going to tell you what the rules are but we're going to sue you and then tell you after that what you did that we thought was a great for that reason you haven't started any enforcement actions no man there's a lot of contributing factors as to why we haven't filed any lawsuits that might be one of them can I ask has the consumer viewer taken any public enforcement action related to the Equifax breach I'm not our policy I'm trying to see if I get this right the policy of the bureau is not to comment on the existence or non-existence of any ongoing investigations as to Equifax I would point out to you that they disclosed publicly in their last 10 Q that they were under investigation by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection has consumer the bureau taking any public action related to allegations that Clayton Homes practiced racial discrimination lending to manufacturers homebuyers I'm not aware of and again I don't want to comment on the existence or nonexistence if I happen to get back to you as to whether or not well as - I'm not fellating homes as the to the matters you've just raised okay so let me jump back to another issue that has come to my attention in February the consumer Bureau put out a request for information asking for comments from interested parties on the usefulness of the bureau's consumer complete complaint data reporting and analysis yes ma'am are you using this RFI to either damper the effectiveness of the database or completely remove it from public view well the debt that the collection of data is mandated statutorily so we will continue to do it let's be let's talk about this because we're not just saying general data this because these are consumer complaints yes ma'am that's what I'm talking about so you did an RFI right and what's the intent of the RFI are you going is your intent to take these consumer data database off a line out of public view it's not the intent is one option available to me why are you even looking at that because it's not statutorily mandated what's not statutory mandate the public facing portion of the consumer database data so let me ask you this then how are we to gather information and see patterns or practices and how are you going to continue to work with other law enforcement agencies like the Attorney General's across the state when you're looking at consumer protection closing off the public facing portion of the consumer complaint database would not impact the collection of that data in any way so you haven't made a determination as you sit right now whether you're gonna take it off public view no ma'am okay let me jump it again if I were to make that decision that's completely within my discretion under the statute so the bureau has a legal charge to protect people from unfair deceptive and abusive practices we've talked about that yes ma'am and you have the responsibility to make sure financial firms treat similar customers the same the way that you enforce that is by looking at the data and we've talked about that however it's my understanding that you have stopped banks from sharing information with examiner's is that true no ma'am I think you may be referring to the data free that we made we have changed some of the methods by which we collect data for the reasons I mentioned before regarding our security again if anyone wants to stick around we talk it takes two minutes to talk privately afterwards as to why we've done that so as we sit here today what you're telling me is that you have not stopped banks from sharing information with the examiners that's correct what we've tried to do is limit the amount of data that we actually take possession of give you an example instead of having them send it to us electronically we're going to look at it okay I noticed my time is up thank you very much and you'll submit the rest of my questions for the record thank you yes ma'am

mr. president when we went to college usually things were different often a student took out a loan but those loans were manageable and usually there were jobs waiting today too often that's not the case in fact the students today who take out loans will leave school sacked on average with 25 thousand dollars worth of debt and they're going to be trying to get into a labor market where there are more than four unemployed Americans for every available job mr. president it has been noted that for the first time student loan debt exceeds credit card debt and that now totals over 1 billion dollars now clearly investment in higher education today is an economic imperative education is the great equalizer it enables upward economic mobility and it breaks down class structures that impair many countries ability to grow their economies a highly skilled and educated workforce is the basis for a healthy economy and it is the linchpin to our economic future now in every major economic decision our people make they try to evaluate mr. president the value of that decision like prospective homeowners who inspect and assess the potential value of their future home in my view future students should be able to comparison shop and choose a school in a program based on what their return on investment will be now our capital markets work best when we can accurately measure the value of the things we choose to invest in we saw what happens when that's not the case with when the housing bubble burst our economy is still struggling to recover from the mortgage meltdown in many instances consumers who didn't have all the facts bought a Prague product based on misleading information and often fell victim to predatory lenders looking to make a profit off that growing bubble consumers must know what they can expect from their investments and students are entitled to know the value of their education before they go out and borrow tens of thousands of dollars from the banks and from the government to finance their choices right now mr. president consumers don't have this information though the information exists it's unavailable to students and families too often when they're making perhaps the most important decisions that affect their future both their financial future and their career that is why today mr. president I am introducing the student right to know before you go act which would help college students perspective young people get the information they need about of their education this proposal would ensure that future students and their families can make well-informed decisions by having access to information on their expected average annual earnings after graduation rates of remedial enrollment credit accumulation and graduation the average cost both before and after financial aid of the program an average debt upon graduation and finally the effects of remedial education and financial aid on credential attainment and a greater understanding of what student success can mean mr. president for markets to work there has to be good information available and until now it has been extremely hard for students and families to collect this data in a cost-effective way while at the same time ensuring student privacy however the states as we have seen so often the president of the Senate knife talked about this sup from time to time the states have pilot piloted their own programs and proved that technology exists to enable our ability to generate and share this information in a way that students and consumers can use while at the same time protecting their privacy this technology in my view makes it possible to ensure a return on their investment for students for parents for policymakers and taxpayers it's going to help us create a workforce meets the demands of the business that employ it and ensures that our workers can successfully compete in the global economy

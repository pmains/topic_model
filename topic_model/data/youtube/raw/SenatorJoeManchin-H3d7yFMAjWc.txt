Infrastructure impacts
each and every one of us. It's the roads we
drive on, the water we drink, and the internet
we rely on to get work done. That's why I
worked nonstop on the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Bill to ensure our country is
making the critical investments that our
communities need. The Bipartisan
Infrastructure Bill will invest over $3 billion
in federal highway programs in West
Virginia, including almost $200 million for
Corridor H alone. It will also invest over
$312 million in West Virginia's public
transit system, $43 million towards West
Virginia airports, and almost $70 million in
funding for our state's energy program. Around
$700 million in Abandoned Mine Lands
funding, almost $300 million in funding for
water and sewer programs, and nearly
$600 million towards expanding broadband so
all West Virginians can have access to remote
work, education and telehealth. In all, West
Virginia is set to receive nearly $6
billion thanks to the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Bill. These investments in our
nation's hard infrastructure will
create jobs, attract businesses, improve
quality of life, and position West Virginia
for growth for generations to come. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is
great news for West Virginia, and is a
testament to what we can achieve when we put our
differences aside and work together to move
our state and our country forward.

it goes back to the remember mark earlier today when we were talking about the three things i wanted to hear come out of the president's remarks tonight uh one was is this the best economy that we can have we want to talk about is this the i want to hear them talk about is this the best best health care american can have and i also want to hear the justification in his remarks about why we're continuing to spend money that we don't have and and passes a responsibility onto our children i didn't hear that tonight i didn't hear answers to that maybe you maybe you did someone did out there on that and and this we're six years into this administration and we still have 92 million people now that are no longer in the workforce we last year we had the the all the unemployment the bulk of new employment 97 percent of all the new jobs were part-time jobs this isn't an economy that we were looking for so i really wanted to hear more tonight about that about the economy because to me it's all about jobs everything we do should be talking about how are we going to get our people back to work so when people are sitting around their breakfast tables or their dinner tables be able to talk about the future they have tomorrow so they could send their children on to school or to college or someplace and enrich their environment their social life in in west virginia i want few people to feel comfortable in in their job situation but we're not we're not there yet we've had still too many companies going offshore then we go to the healthcare i wanted him to address more on the health care issue but we know it struggled to get out it was a it's a very cumbersome thing but we were hoping to hear more about how we can improve it how it how this can affect our lives how we can reduce premiums not increase premiums how we can get people back on their coverage that their employers are cutting them uh millions of people are losing their health care coverage i wanted to see that but again back to that issue about the the debt structure uh we we're 17.3 trillion dollars in debt and i didn't hear a plan of how we're going to get to a balanced budget but what i did hear was that this was the year of action and that's a clever title and that's fine a year of action but what i want to hear is not i'm not going to work with congress as he said but the president said he can work unilaterally he can work things out on his own but all i can say is folks there still is a constitution and yes he can he can do his uh pen or he can do his phone and and he can he can use the executive orders but what we have in america is a constitution and we intend to enforce that the responsibilities of of a checks and balance system in america should work so oh no it was an interesting speech uh that we'll find out the details in the in the weeks and months ahead but more importantly is i think each and every person have to understand wall street may be doing better but main street's not go to any place in west virginia you'll see people still feel and hear people talking about how they're struggling we've got to be able to reach out and what's happening across the country may be different than what's happening in west virginia i'm concerned about the future of our people in west virginia there's where i've grown up my children have grown up my grandchildren are growing up that's where i want to care about them and this idea of of of uh doing things unilaterally without involving congress that's how we got into this problem we have to work together and i think we can the america and and west virginia deserves better so i hope tonight is just the beginning of where we can start some for some dialogue with that but um thank you all for listening and i hope that we can we can in fact do better

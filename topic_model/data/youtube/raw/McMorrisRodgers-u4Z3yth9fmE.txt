very good Thank You mr. chairman and today we're considering policies to achieve economy-wide deep decarbonisation judging from the majority's memo their proposals seem limited to policies that tax our economy and industrial sectors out of existence and destroy America's global competitiveness competitiveness and leadership in Washington State people have resounded ly rejected two separate carbon tax initiatives because the tax would put us at a competitive disadvantage a federal carbon tax or cap-and-trade would do the same to America on the global level without allowing us to continue to lead in reducing carbon emissions climate change is a global issue not just an American issue it requires a global solution centered around innovation which has made the United States so successful at reducing emissions as we look to decrease emissions without destroying our economy is crucial that we expand our nuclear energy portfolio American companies like Terra power in Bellevue Washington have led the world in nuclear technology and innovation but regulatory restrictions have hurt their ability to deploy new reactors both at home and abroad right now China and Russia are developing and exporting small modular reactors to underdeveloped countries expanding their global influence for America to win the future we cannot afford to sit and allow this to continue professor Gaddy in your testimony you mentioned early efforts by American policymakers to use America's nuclear energy Enterprise strategically around the world in your opinion what caused the move away from these policies and how has that affected our national security and global competitiveness with China and Russia thank you for the question I think over time there were a few things that contributed to it I think we got complacent for one thing I think we just simply back in the 80s and 90s we got complacent in the power sector I think recently maybe we've gotten a little over confidence in our our get a natural gas market we're very lots of confidence right now that we got an abundant supply of natural gas of course what we know is those are those have in games to them I think there's there's also a good bit of we've had market deregulation throughout the country I think that's contributed some of the current coal nuclear fleet being threatened for early closure there's also just a general fear of waste and proliferation things that we've always been able to manage here in the US and globally for decades but but maybe one of the most one of the underlying reasons congresswoman is that I really believe that we've got a general disconnect and I'm seeing this reflection of students that I teach there's a general disconnect of where we are globally right now what the 21st century is actually like what our competitors are now compared to what we they were in the 20th century Russia looks ham-fisted the USSR does compare with what China is now they they have a long game strategy and nuclear is dead center in that a long game strategy to develop advanced reactors closed the nuclear fuel cycle and implant their nuclear culture in other countries President Xi Jinping makes he makes no bones about it that it's it's socialism with Chinese characteristics and if the u.s. does not step up and respond it's going to give the world the impression that socialism with Chinese characteristics is succeeding where capitalism with American characteristics is failing this is something it's it's a sad state of affairs when when when President Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace vision is being forwarded by China in Russia and not us that is he would roll over in his grave thank you so let's talk about how do we make up the ground so in terms of policies to reduce emissions how would we benefit from federal policies to demonstrate technologies like advanced nuclear is it is it a problem that the Department of Energy does not currently have a demonstration project for nuclear technology such as been proposed in the nuclear energy leader leadership Act I think things like Neyland the nuclear engineers are good they are good touchstones that I think one of the overarching concern here is we don't have a strategy for those things to map into we don't have a long game purview and vision of what we want our nuclear enterprise to be in the 21st century for 30 40 and 50 years I wish we would stop rejoicing too much in small victories and look at the big picture in setting ourselves up again to be the world's dominant not a level playing field with China the dominant nuclear provider thank you thank you for being here and I'll yield back

I'm Abigail Span Berger and I approve this message associating Abigail with terrorism is laughable abigail worked on the front lines she chose to do the hardest work that this country asks of anybody she focused on protecting Americans from terrorism not sniping from the sidelines the CIA trusted her with top-secret security clearance for Dave Brett or anybody else to twist that and turn it against her and claim that Abigail aided terrorists it's dangerous and it's unpatriotic

joining us now back with us is house transportation and infrastructure committee member congresswoman nancy mace okay congresswoman you know two all right let's talk about this first two thirds of the 3.7 billion dollars in pork or earmarks they're going to democrats home state projects and now we have this the infrastructure bill is floating a national mileage tax basically the more you drive the more you take the more you pay the government on the number of miles driven i thought the president said he's not going to tax people below 400 000 this is going to slam the middle class and poor people in the trucking industry what do you say right no absolutely i mean the administration says one thing but the reality is totally another in this case and it shouldn't be any surprise to anyone that the majority in power the democrats two-thirds of that spending that you mentioned will go to their home districts um and you know part of the issue with the national mileage taxes how are they going to track it and when they do track it what else are what other kind of data are they going to track on u.s drivers what kind of privacy issues are we going to have with that and if you're going to do that you certainly can't tax us at the fuel pump when we're getting fuel it doesn't that to my knowledge and of course i haven't had time to read 2 700 pages but it doesn't address the fact that electric vehicles they're not paying a tax or a fee every time they refuel their batteries yeah that's a great point i mean the transportation secretary pete buddha judge he's floated this uh trial balloon earlier this year and then he walked it back saying we're not going to do it but now it's in the bill i mean this thing could pass that's the issue right i mean and you're right about privacy we already have yeah go ahead take it take that on no no no absolutely i mean and it will i believe it will pass under the guise of being quote bipartisan but there are many of us that will not vote to raise taxes on the american people particularly in the middle of a pandemic but we're not in the majority um and so democrats i would imagine would have the vote votes there's enough green new deal in there i think to satisfy moderates um it's always say one thing in public but what's happening is entirely something else and the american people the middle class worker is going to be taxed i don't care what the byte administration says or all these different spending plans it's going to happen so you're going to see public awareness campaigns about a mileage tax out of the transportation department with this phony idea that it's not hitting the middle class when and poor when it will or the trucking industry and the your point about privacy is an important one do we really want the federal government vacuuming up where americans drive when the federal government has been repeatedly hacked by north korea china and russia and we have smartphone apps already tracking with location device services on their smartphones where you sleep where you work where you go to business meetings where you go to church which nightclubs or movie theaters you go to do we really want the federal government with all of that information no absolutely not and how many cyber security bills has the federal government has congress passed this year virtually none and just last week the biden administration put an executive order out on cyber security protecting america's data however that was just a memo it doesn't do anything and this bill there's a lot of wasteful spending and amtrak gets what 58 billion dollars in this thing they just got 2 billion in coveted relief funds and their internet still doesn't work congresswoman thank you so much good to see

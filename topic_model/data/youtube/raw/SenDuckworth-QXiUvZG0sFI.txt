give mr. chairman I want to thank the panelists for attending today's hearing and I look forward to your candor and perspective on personnel policies and you know we want to assist you in whatever way possible whether it is whether it be resources or authorities my first question gentlemen is in many cases where a service member reports that they have been the victim of sexual assault service members can face severe punishment or a less than honorable discharge if they are found to have engaged in some form of collateral misconduct like underage drinking or feminization punishing victims for collateral misconduct has many negative consequences and it represents a significant barrier to reporting of sexual assault in the military do you agree that collateral and misconduct and the threat of punishment for it represents a barrier to sexual assault reporting and how can such barriers be lowered or mitigated and would immunity or deferral of action against punishment for collateral misconduct potentially help with increasing the instances of reporting of sexual harassment senator that that's an important question and from the Marine Corps perspective one commander's do have the ability to defer some of the charges but to the to the larger point I think that's something from we can get back to you as far as from the legal standpoint on what exactly the specifics of what can be deferred what cannot be deferred but but but I fully agree anywhere agreeable to anything that will increase reporting and expose some of those issues senator ma'am I again I think it's case dependent again but in general reporting tends to be independent of what eventually ends up being the method of accountability and the specific charges and individuals going to be held accountable against and those specific charges that end up being the ones that a particular commander each commander is going to be advised by a trial counsel a prosecutor if you will in civilian terms that's a specialist in general and in sexual assault prosecution we're going to use every tool at our disposal hold that individual accountable so that they don't walk that's what every commander is going to do so if we you know if there is a sexual assault related article that they can be held accountable towards with a reasonable expectation of success they're gonna they're going to use that charge but reporting and then prosecution are two different things I think in general so the reporting as I see is unrelated but I may be misunderstanding your question I think you are what I'm asking is for the average troop sailor who is the victim of sexual harassment or sexual assault one of the things that can happen is that the perpetrator is saying well yeah but you were drinking underage if you report this you're going to be prosecuted for underage drinking or you're gonna be prosecuted for fraternization and that threat itself the validity of that threat will prevent that victim from reporting and is there any move towards some sort of ability to you know lower those barriers such as immunity or deferral of action so that the average troop knows even if you underage drinking you need to come forward and report because we're not going to pursue that and you're not going to get a other an honorable discharge because you reported this not because of the sexual assault reporting but because of the underage drinking yes senator um all that into that discussion we do think there's a barrier there we do we do think that inhibits reporting and right and so as general Rocco said any any chance there is to increase the reporting and we won't work for so at our US Air Force Academy for instance there's already training ongoing with our commanders and folks out there that talk about deferral of punishment and sort of immunity if you will maybe not in those words used but to allow those folks to come forward and report knowing that there wouldn't be a the focus will not be on the accident that occurred by the member but on the on the actual perpetrator trying to bring that into the rest of the force as well and I do think there is a case-by-case discussion with those kind of things but we recognize that and that's ongoing to make sure that we can increase reporting I'm not very much time that but I if you could answer for the wreck hurt this question you know the greatest fighting force on the planet needs two most talented people from cybersecurity to medical services reports indicate that the services are facing an increasingly smaller talent pool and must compete with a robust job market this difficulty coincides with increasing demands placed on the US military and last year for example secretary matters established the close combat lethality Task Force which identified the need to recruit and retain the service members specifically for close combat infantry how are you adapting your recruiting efforts within this environment to meet the personnel objectives of Department initiatives such as the close combat lethality task force and are there additional authorities or resources that you might require in order to become more competitive within today's job market and if you could do that for the record I really appreciate it thank you gentlemen are you back mr. Chang

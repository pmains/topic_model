Thank You mr. chairman Thank You mr. chairman thank you for holding this hearing Illinois is indeed home to more nuclear reactors than any other state in the nation 11 operating three decommissioned 75 7,500 tons of spent fuel stored in pools and another 900 tons in dry casts four more plants pools are running out of room so we need to find a solution we're struggling to deal with the decommission nuclear power plants and have become de facto interim storage sites for this stranded nuclear waste without consent or compensation these communities and plants are paying the price for the federal government's failure to find a permanent solution to spent nuclear fuel last Congress I offered the stranded act to provide impact assistance and economic development incentives to communities burdened with storing stranded nuclear waste my bill has three components first it establishes the federal task force to identify existing public and private resources and funding that could benefit affected communities this policy is also included in today's bill second it creates economic impact grants that would provide financial assistance to offset the economic and social impacts of stranded nuclear waste in affected communities and third my bill extends tax credits that will bring investment to these stranded communities all the three policies in my build the most critical components is the second that is to compensate communities who are acting as interim storage sites for nuclear waste now mr. fetes do you agree that communities like Zion Illinois who is well that which is one of these sites Illinois should be as I own and Illinois should be compensated now for storing waste yes thank you right now my state has one decommissioned nuclear power plant in a few years that could have even more that's several actually with the kind of proposal you outlined in your testimony effect what happens in my state we think it would it would give the state much more control over the terms by which that nuclear waste is going to remain in your state which by any measure it's going to be in the state for a long time especially as you have all the operating reactors that Illinois has and right now states can essentially as California sees in the in the Santa Ana for a situation that they have no real authority to affect that what what what we outline could change that so you know I look at I look at these communities in alone even if we say Yucca Mountain magically we're gonna proceed with it it's still gonna be a matter of decades yet before this field could be moved in the meantime it sits there in Zion Illinois nobody's building it's in a lake front on Lake Michigan beautiful piece of property and there's nothing they can do and nobody wants to move there nobody wants to buy a house and in Zion and yet there are very good jobs at the plant that is there and people drive into good and and to hold these jobs that they drive from a long way way cuz nobody wants to buy a property there so I think it's common sense that we would make these payments to the local community since they are now stuck holding this nuclear field that the confederal government has failed to live up to in terms of dealing with it I think we can both agree mr. Ferris that it is critical that our existing nuclear fleet operates also as safely as possible yes that's an RT c--'s position I have a bill that fix a drafting error that occurred in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and it clarifies that whistleblower protection rights for do e and NRC employees may be enforced as Congress intended do you agree that whistleblower protections which are disputed at D OE are of critical importance to the nuclear industry yes I do thank you do you want to elaborate a little bit more on on what you were saying about the consent piece and and about I like what you said about the fact that if we need to change the model from forcing this fuel onto someone to compensating the people are already holding it and and and coming up with a way for people to say yes figuring out a pathway forward senator I I do appreciate the conundrum Congress is confronted with the this is a I I think it's one of the first paragraphs in almost every testimony I've read on nuclear waste that this is a devilish challenge technical challenge just signed science alone and then you put the interplay of politics on top of it and it gets turned it gets turned into a hot potato that makes chairman Barossa job or ranking member Carper's job extremely difficult and in fact every member of the Senate but to keep trying to force a square peg into a round hole simply won't work to give you a sense of scale when you said if we magically had Yucca Mountain be licensed and go forward it would still be decades for fuel across the country to get moved at various times with it that's not going to happen though the licensing process if this bill were to become law would go forward and then there would be contentious litigation for we submit despite any deadline decades and if they truncated the litigation they simply open themselves up to legal challenge on that issue so we we can't urge strongly enough there's a better way to do this that's consistent with our environmental laws thank you mister Thank You senator capita

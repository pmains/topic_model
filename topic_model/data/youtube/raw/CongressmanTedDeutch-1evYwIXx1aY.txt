I'd like to ask you in the State Department about a few specific foreign policy topics to get an understanding of the administration's position first in the Middle East we saw a brutal reminder of the challenges that Israel faces in its search for peace today when a terrorist killed three Israelis and seriously wounded others near Jerusalem meanwhile in Gaza Hamas continues to hold the bodies of slain IDF soldiers and Israeli civilians as bargaining chips earlier this month I met with the parents of lieutenant at our golden who was killed by Hamas terrorists using an underground terror tunnel during a ceasefire in 2014 I've also met with the family of sergeant Aaron Shaw all who was also killed by Hamas in 2014 Hamas has refusal to return the bodies of these soldiers to their families for burial is an obvious violation of international law and basic human values so to where we are today Jason Greenblatt is currently in Israel continuing the administration's push towards peace but for many of us we're still in the dark about what that looks like mr. Greenblatt said last week that it is no secret our approach to these discussions departs from some of the usual orthodoxy at for after years of well-meaning attempts to negotiate an end to the conflict we have all learned some valuable lessons so what I asked you at deputy secretary Sullivan is what are those lessons that have been learned what are the unorthodox approaches that are that you're pursuing and is it this administration's intention to present its own peace plan Oh Thank You congressman yes as you know the the White House Jason Greenblatt the president special representative the senior advisor to the president Jared Kushner have been very deeply involved in negotiations between this administration in the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority the president met with Prime Minister Netanyahu with the leadership of the Palestinian Authority last week the President himself is personally committed to this process as other presidents have been I think the the commitment of this administration is clear to the peace process I would have to defer to mr. Greenblatt on on what he specifically meant with those comments I would say that that secretary Tillerson though has been involved as well he was with President Trump when he visit when the president visited Israel in June which all of which were aware of can you tell us whether it's the president's intention the administration's intention to present its own peace plan I would have to defer to the White House okay sir next moving on to Iran the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs said in July that it appears Iran is in compliance with the rules that were laid on then jcpoa now there are very real flaws in the jcpoa including the problematic sunset provisions however in order to be in order to lead an international effort against Iran's ongoing support for terrorism they're supportive the Hezbollah militias in Syria the development of their missile program all of which are outside the terms of the jcpoa we're going to need the support of the international community and our allies and partners in Europe wouldn't a decision not to certify compliance because of factors that are outside the jcpoa risk isolating us from our allies and making the job of combatting aligns malign activities in the region even more difficult well the secretary has has said as as late as last week that Iran is in technical compliance with the jcpoa he said as well however that that Iran is in violation of the spirit of the jcpoa for all the malign activities that you've just described we've been in close consultation with our allies to address both those malign activities in the flaws in the jcpoa including the sunset provision so the president will have a decision in October on whether to certify or not but our work on Iran's malign activities and trying to improve the terms of the jcpoa will continue and finally mr. chairman just if I may my last question that as you know deputy secretary Sullivan Bob Levinson has now been held by Iran for more than ten years the Levin's were Levinson's were told that the UN General Assembly would be used as an opportunity to push forward Bob's case are you seeing any progress and can you commit to us here that bringing Bob and the other Americans be unjustly and cruelly held by Iran will remain a priority for this administration yeah the the Levinson case is a priority for this administration as are all the other American hostages held worldwide just as a note I have met and spoken with the Levinson family on multiple occasions I have a picture on my desk of Bob Levinson reminds me every day that he's our longest-serving longest held hostage in Iran and I have personal family experience with Americans being held hostage in Iran this administration has no higher priority than bringing home all of those Americans including mr. Levinson you have my word on that I'm and I'm profoundly grateful for that thing

tired the gentleman from New York is recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman in your opening statement you mentioned reviewing thousands of pages of documents related to these charges there's the committee majority of access to the unedited transcripts of interviews conducted by the Oversight Committee you should direct your questions to the wit I'm directing my question to the Chairman parliamentary inquiry and please stop the clock it's a parliamentary inquiry we do not think so but do not think that the majority has access it well why would request that the minority at least the majority wishes that's your prerogative that requests a minority of access to these documents the chair will take your request under advisement as we ascertain whether or not your question is answered in the affirmative if so then we obviously think it should be well we're going forward in impeachment hearings that are the purview of this committee i think this committee or to see all the relevant evidence but that's that's self-evident let me just say before I asked mr. kiss kina and some questions that mr. Jordans questions wasn't this true then yes did you know it was true then no did you tell the truth then as you knew it yes that fact pattern shows nothing about impeachment obviously all it shows is that he didn't know at the time he was asked the question he told the truth as he knew then knew it mr. kiss Keenan Thank You Commissioner thank you for being here the Senate Finance Committee the department of justice and the treasury inspector general for tax administration of all and looked into the accusations against you and each of them has independently concluded there is no evidence to support these charges your critics have not made their case nor do they have the votes to force impeachment on the House floor and these proceedings are an obvious sham but because you are an expert on tax policy I do think it serves some purpose to shed some light and have you as the IRS commissioner understand some of the work of the IRS if someone is there anything that would prohibit someone from releasing that tax returns if they want to be they're under audit no thank you now President Nixon discloses tax returns while under or IRS audit have the rules changed since then no can an individual use other people's money run through a charitable foundation to enrich himself or satisfy his personal debts or obligations I know the rules are that would be personal enjoyment knows tax-exempt organization can benefit use its funds to benefit any in effect insider with the following factors affect the the tax exemption of a foundation if an individual used funds from his charitable foundation to purchase a twelve thousand dollar football helmet for himself signed by Tim Tebow if an individual used twenty thousand dollars from the foundation to pay for a six-foot-tall portrait by him set up himself if an individual used a hundred thousand dollars of the Foundation's money to cover part of a legal settlement after dispute with the municipal government or if he used one hundred fifty-eight thousand dollars to settle a dispute with a disgruntled participant at a celebrity golf tournament where any of those actions using tax-exempt foundation money's improper and if so would they jeopardize the tax felt the tax exemption of the foundation I can't comment on individual life to answer the question sir I have just been questioning it in that it's outside the scope of this hearing additionally it's outside the scope and expertise of the witness that's not a proper parliamentary inquiry rules of the committee would permit the gentleman to ask the question and the Commissioner is requested to answer it I clearly the general rules are understood that the 501 seized assets should not be used to benefit either a major contributor or anyone operating the entity the particular facts and circumstances of any case would need to be reviewed carefully and obviously but if those were the facts that I just said would they be improper all I can tell you is that the rules are clear and it would be up to a set of people who do this regularly at the IRS to investigate and make a determination as to whether in fact the tax exemption of that organization would you know violet Commissioner in your opinion if a fact pattern like this one were brought to the attention of the IRS and the IRS failed to investigate it would that be a dereliction of duty or even an impeachable events the Commissioner does not make a determination as to about any audit or investigation we get referrals suggestions sometimes my review urgings to look into a wide range of activities of not only tax-exempt organizations but others those are referred to a detailed process internally and thank you about my role to make that thank you have one last question and that is at the time you were appointed by the president why did he ask you to take to come out of retirement and point you to the head of the IRS what one mission what did he say what mission did he give you actually I did not talk to the president personally I thought to secretary Lew who I knew from years ago and White House personnel and the reason I was asked was obvious the IRS had made a terrible management mistake I've spent 45 years of my career managing organizations under stress including in the private sector and the public sector and it was obvious to me just reading the paper that there was a problem that needed to be fixed and I was honored to be asked and please don't take the responsibility thank you very much my time is expired

talk about this vote and put it in perspective and in context for us a little bit especially as it precedes the election which is barely just more than a week away i think it shows a clear distinction between the parties you know when you looked at the nominating hearing the democrats i think thought it was a health committee hearing and they talked about policy they talked about obamacare republicans talked about character integrity whether or not she'd be impartial whether or not she was intellectually capable of the job and i think she was amazing i mean one of the most dramatic parts of the testimony is when senator cornyn said can you hold up the notes you're using and she held up a blank piece of paper i mean that takes something to go through hours and hours of grilling with all these senators having hundred page you know booklets put together by their staff and she did it all from memory so i think she has the intellect i think she's got the capacity i like that she not only is smart and intellectual and impartial i also like that she's a mother and a woman of faith and i think all those together will make her a great justice do you expect this may change the arc of the supreme court for perhaps a generation or so maybe it's one of the most important things the president does and you know when president trump ran i was one of his opponents and i was unsure how conservative would he be would he appoint conservative justices and he has we've done over 200 to the bench district level and appeals court level and three to the supreme court i think they've all been good picks people who will interpret the constitution as it was written people who don't believe that they're a super legislator and don't believe that they're there to make the law but they're there to interpret the law will it change the direction i hope so but i hope so in a good way talk about the significance of this vote with respect to this issue of court packing uh which is being promulgated by a lot of your uh democratic colleagues you know the court packing scheme came about in the 30s and 40s when fdr became frustrated with a conservative supreme court and he said i'm going to pack it and at first many democrats were for it but then the more they talked about it the more i thought what a bad idea it would be and it would really politicize the court and make it very political if one person came in and put three or four at one time because what would happen is probably neither party is above this if democrats put three on what happens when republicans win maybe they put five on then democrats put seven on and where does it end so i think really nine's not a bad number i think it's good to have an odd number to try to get decisions but i don't think we should pack the chord i think it's a bad idea and the fact that biden won't rule it out means that he is somewhat beholden to the left wing of his party the radicals who want to do that they also want to get rid of the legislative filibuster and if we get rid of the filibuster realize that if they have 51 votes in the senate they have the house and they have the presidency we could very quickly get their green new deal which is going to cost trillions of dollars you know all of the nationalization free college free this free that that's not really free that costs a lot of money so the filibuster actually serves a purpose to keep the country from lunging one direction or the other and i worry should we lose the election and they get rid of the filibuster that all of a sudden you know bernie's socialist paradise will be america but it may not be such a paradise may not be what people think it is senator rand paul of kentucky thank you for talking to someone american news thank you

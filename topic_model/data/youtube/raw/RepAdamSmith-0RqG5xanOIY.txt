Services Committee congressman standby I want to get a quick update on the new Republican push for a health care bill and renewed concerns about a government shutdown with just hours to go before the president marks 100 days in office our congressional correspondent Phil Mattingly following all the late-breaking developments for us Phil what's the latest well wolf House Democrats now saying they will tie their votes in support of a temporary government funding bill to the promise that Republicans don't vote on health care at all might be an empty threat though at this point in time I'm told Republicans don't have the vote for that newest push on health care raising questions when I don't get there at all tonight Republicans renewing their attempt to push through the health care repeal and replace they've long promised we have a moral obligation to prevent people from getting hurt to stop damage from being continued now with the backing of the conservative house freedom caucus who oppose the original health care bill that's stalled just hours before heading to a vote I think we're making very good progress don't have we're going to go when we had the votes but that's the decision we'll make when we have it I would argue that this is a bill that a moderate would more likely want to support the change a new amendment negotiate by freedom caucus chairman mark meadows and a member of the more moderate tuesday group Tom McCarthy the amendment would let States apply for waivers that could weaken several key Obamacare insurance reforms including the price protection in place for those with pre-existing conditions what benefits insurers must cover in their policies and the ban on allowing carriers to charge more based on a person's health background my one and only goal in this has been to try to make this bill something that helps the the health insurance market survive but all eyes now are on the parties moderates who are far from supporting the amendment arguing it will leave even more people without coverage it doesn't help the people I represent one of the criticisms I had about the Affordable Care Act is it made insurance so expensive that people who had it didn't even use it because their premiums will high your deductibles will high their co-payments will high and people with pre-existing conditions you're right we can't deny them coverage Democrats are quick seizing on that opposition the new Trump care will allow states to decide whether or not insurers have to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions it's hard to come up with a cruller bill and ramping up their efforts to slow down the process altogether now saying they'll oppose stopgap funding measure to keep the government open if Republicans push for a health care vote between now and Saturday Trump's hundredth day in office what you see in the GOP haste to pass the bill and Trump trying to cram it down in the last 100 days I think President Trump is really making fools of the members of Congress of his own party but House Speaker Paul Ryan is pushing back saying the blame for a potential government shutdown will fall squarely on Democrats I'm confident we'll be able to pass a short-term extension and I'd be kind of shocked that the Democrats would want to create a government shutdown because they have been dragging their feet White House press secretary Sean Spicer echoing that criticism the Democrats the last minute have come in and thrown a lot of monkey wrenches into the ability for this to get done despite the president doing everything that he can to show good faith to keep this going so it's not just a question of its they keep moving the goalposts and we'll just to give you a little bit of behind the scenes here on what's actually happening on health care leadership has been whipping votes trying to get their members to come on board throughout the day those meetings are actually ongoing between some of the deputy whip team leaders and members that have been hanging out so far up to this point no decision has been made yet they're leaving open the possibility that they do try something before they go home but everything that I've heard up to this point was from lawmakers and aides is that they are still short and they're not totally clear what the pathway forward on this bill may be well all right Phil Thank You Phil Mattingly with the very latest up on Capitol Hill we're back with Democratic congressman Adam Smith Congressman before we talk about the possibility of a government shutdown I want to get your reaction some breaking news we're following just now the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson he revealed that China has informed the North Koreans and formed the United States but as I told the United States it has warned North Korea not to conduct another nuclear test or China would impose sanctions against North Korea your reaction well I think it's a positive step if China is willing to step up and do that they've always been very hesitant to put any pressure on North Korea I mean obviously they're not happy and then free is such a destabilizing influence in their region but they're also mindful of the fact that they sanction North Korea to the point of collapse they don't want a failed state on their border they don't want millions of North Korean refugees pouring across the border so China has been said before they might do this and they never have so I'll believe it when I see it but it's a positive step to put pressure on North Korea to hopefully bring us all back from the brink you trust the Chinese to do the right thing as you know that not a president has repeatedly said I'm going to lean on China to do the right thing I don't trust them to do the right thing I think Bob I'll agree with the President on this he does need to lean on them to get them to do the right thing I don't think we should count on it shouldn't kind of well what happens if the North Koreans do launch a six and maybe then a seventh nuclear test right now and launches another intercontinental ballistic missile yeah what I haven't yeah well no let's say they do yeah um you know these are all you know hypotheticals I think the overarching issue with North Korea is okay we're worried about the capabilities they're developing we're much more worried about the possibility they would use those against us or our allies and look we need to make our deterrence 100 percent clear if they attack us in any way they will be destroyed because you know Kim jong-un is not a particularly stable individual but he is not suicidal and we need to make sure that if he takes those actions that would attack us that that is suicidal we will back up South Korea will back up Japan will back up our allies and we will defend ourselves and we are vastly stronger than he is this is an incredibly tense situation right now very quickly on what's happening up on Capitol Hill you heard Phil Mattingly's report do you believe there possibly could be a government shutdown this weekend then there shouldn't be and look the back-and-forth on both sides here is not particularly helpful um obviously I don't agree with what the Republicans are trying to do a health care I think they're kidding themselves about the reality of what it takes to cover people with pre-existing conditions to be elderly and the choices that have to be made I don't support the direction they're going in on health care we should not shut the government down because the direction they're trying to go in health care I'm still skeptical they'll get the votes but the real big point here is this is just to get us the last five months of 2017 okay 2018 the FY the fiscal year that starts October 1st of this year that's going to be a monumental battle is he going to be even more difficult than the one we're having just to get us through the last I guess it's five months now of fiscal year 2017 well let's say they felt matter II we didn't think this was going to happen our congressional correspondent but let's say that the Republicans managed to get 216 votes on repeal and replace over the next 48 hours or so in the House of Representatives you have heard your Democratic leaders say they will then vote against any funding and there will be a government shutdown yeah I disagree with my Democratic leaders on that I don't think that that is the position that we should take we should do everything we can to stop the Republican health care bill and we should also be mindful of the fact that just because they pass them in the house the Senate has said they don't like this bill at all it isn't it isn't going to become law so no I don't think we should shut the government down over that

Mr Speaker I rise today to talk about the United States Mexico Canada trade agreement and the need for common-sense changed to see that our trade policies with Mexico and Canada better reflect the current economic conditions and the changes that have occurred since the initial Act was put together over 25 years ago administration's trade policies though currently with these tariff Wars I believe are not only hurting consumers but they're hurting our farmers ranchers dairy men and women let's be clear about it these are hidden taxes that consumers pay and that agriculture pays as well the United States Mexico Canada agreement I think would address these concerns if we get it right it's chairman of the Subcommittee on livestock and foreign agriculture opening new trade opportunities for agriculture is one of my top priorities my home state of California is the number one agricultural state in the nation and nearly half of our AG products are exported abroad over 20 billion dollars a year I'm a farmer third-generation I understand the importance of our ability to trade and have a fair level playing field Mexico and Canada combined or our largest destination for these products maintaining these markets is essential to ensure the prosperity for our farmers and the viability of our AG economy we have had 25 years of mostly a successful trading relationship with Canada and Mexico since citing the North American Free Trade Agreement 1994 but a lots changed and it's also resulted let's be frank with a loss of jobs that have hurt American families here and we need to address that this is an opportunity to deal with the flaws that have existed in NAFTA for over 25 years since 2002 Canada has been the u.s. agricultural top export market and Mexico has either been second or third in 2018 we exported a hundred and forty three billion dollars worth of agricultural products to the two countries combined the amount equal over 1/4 of the total u.s. export that is significant the u.s. MCA leaves in place I think the key wins for agriculture established under NAFTA it updates key provisions pertaining to important issues like labor technology and the environment it also provides some new access to Canada's protected dairy market which i think is important the conversations between House Democrats and the administration to hammer out the remaining differences I think have been constructive I disagree with some of the narratives that this has been a delay we want to get it right good trade agreements you must get right our negotiators are making good progress including efforts to ensure that enforcement enforcement to the agreement isn't done but enforcement of Labor Standards continues to remain a concern this is important labor in America doesn't want to have the same impacts that took place under NAFTA and so the enforcement of the provisions are critical USM's EA's labor chapter does reflect a strengthening of standards including freedom of association and the right to organize in Mexico we've had numerous delegations meet with our counterparts in Mexico this spring Mexico passed landmark labor legislation laying the legal framework for compliance with the United States Mexico Canada labor chapter now we must ensure that those labor standards are enforced that's the critical area today House Democrats are working in good faith with the administration to put in place assurances that these standards are enforced over the long term the same goes for enforcement of environmental and biomedical standards commitments to needs have to be enforceable to make this trade a successful agreement these issues are addressed the u.s. MCA would stabilize some of the trade policies that are otherwise unpredictable with this administration including serious concerns that President Trump may as he said kill NAFTA and reject the deal if we don't pass this we want to get it done ASAP for sure but we need to make sure it's done right sound trade policy should not be a partisan issue I will continue to work to make sure that we can vote on us MCA as soon as possible once again though we have to have the insurances I expect strong passage of an agreement if we can get those insurances but there must be a way to address this so that we will get to yes then we can turn our attention to other trade matters an agreement with China obviously is very important and Europe with the European Union let me finally say good trade agreements I think me mean good-paying jobs let me repeat that good trade agreements mean good-paying jobs for all Americans and that is obviously we want to do for our entire economy I yield back the balance of my time

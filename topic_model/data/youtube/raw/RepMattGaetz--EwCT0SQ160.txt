so the lab in Wuhan was unsafe that was obvious to Americans visiting there two years ago and because of the practices there the Chinese may have unleashed a global pandemic on the rest of us here's something remarkable and upsetting the work in that lab including its research into disease carrying bats was funded in part by you by US taxpayers through the National Institutes of Health hard to believe that's true but it is Congress Matt Gaetz represents Florida he joins us tonight to follow up on this story congressman that's one of those stories that if you had said that out loud a week ago I think even I might have dismissed you as insane but it's true how did this happen yeah I'm against funding Chinese research in our country but I'm sure against funding it in China the NIH gives this three point seven million dollar grant to the Wuhan Institute of biology they then advertise that they need coronavirus researchers following that coronavirus erupts in Wuhan and then what's really troubling to me is that either conspicuously or miraculously the Wuhan Institute of biology is able to sequence the virus on January 2nd but China doesn't admit to the virus existing to January 9th and then the Wuhan Institute of biology doesn't release this important scientific information to the world until January 12th so at best Americans are funding people who are lying to us and at worst were funding people who we knew had problems handling pathogens who then birthday monster virus onto the world by the way China is about to eclipse us in terms of the size of its economy if it hasn't already and it seems like it already may have either way why would it be sending any money to China for any purpose there is a far too cozy relationship between US research and Chinese research because there are some research institutions in our country who realized the short-term benefit of Chinese cash but that doesn't excuse our government and what should really trouble viewers is that this is an active grant this isn't something of yesteryear and so I've called on secretary a czar to immediately halt this grant to the Wuhan Institute of biology they have not been honest and at worst they've been negligent to the point of many many deaths throughout the world this will live on for all time as a metaphor for our incompetence and self-loathing it looks like there is evidence that this virus escaped from the lab we don't know that that happened but it's not a crazy supposition and now it turns out we were funding the lab do you think just about a mine at for us that someone can end the funding to the Wuhan is to a virology if we can't do that I mean really well well I believe that secretary a czar can do it with the stroke of a pen and certainly it is consistent with the fantastic news that President Trump gave us today that the United States is no longer going to be a patsy for these America last organizations like the w-h-o and the WTO we've been taken advantage of in those globalist infrastructures for far too long under both Republicans and Democrats President Trump gives us the chance to liberate ourselves from this and to put our people our health and our economy first that would be nice congressman gates thanks so much for coming on appreciate it thanks talker

[Music] i decided to enter this art competition because my art teacher at school brought it up so i decided to submit my work of my grandma my artwork is a graphite drawing that i made of my grandma t and the reason i drew it of her is because she's one of the biggest inspirations in my life and one of my heroes when she was a little kid she was in put into the internment camps with her family and she had to go through many hardships and to be where she is now being able to still smile have such a positive attitude and be such a bright person um it's just an inspiration to me and she's my hero being able to meet all these important people and see where everything comes from and having my representation and having my drawing of my grandma being up at the capitol it means a lot um being able to be here is just such an honor in the future i want to of course make sure art is part of every day of my life i still don't know what kind of job i want to go into but i want to make sure that even if it's just a hobby i want to make sure that i'm still doing art and making things that i love [Music]

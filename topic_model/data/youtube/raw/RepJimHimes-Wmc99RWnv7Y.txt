congressman jim Himes hosted a roundtable discussion in westport today to talk about surveillance programs used by the National Security Agency x was joined by representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Brenes brennan center for justice he says he wanted to explain legislation recently passed by the house that steals back phone metadata collection I happen to think that it's an appropriate and careful step back away from some programs that made people concern but again you know drawing that line is very complicated thing and so that's the point of the discussion today to see where my constituents are on the issues hein says he hopes today's discussion will generate ideas for preserving civil liberties

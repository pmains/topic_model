thank you for that doctor good friend I will just keep this question very very simple and it's an easy one do you believe that we need a government guarantee and the continued existence of a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for housing purposes I think the 30-year mortgage is very popular and useful instrument and I don't believe it needs a government guaranteed banks should be regulated and the economy should be stabilized in a way that these mortgages do you think boxwood would put a 30-year mortgage out without a government guarantee to the extent that we can't we have in place government guarantees if you want to call it that way it's it's something that the Congress needs to decide government guarantee is not a matter for the for the federal reserve so I I'm happy with that at this point okay thank you thank you for caring

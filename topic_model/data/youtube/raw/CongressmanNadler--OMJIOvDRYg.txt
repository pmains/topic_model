joining us now is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler congressman thank you very much for being here pleasure are you confident in the final statement there that I just played you that there's nothing that the Republicans are doing right now in Congress that could result in the end of the special counsels investigation well I don't think they will do anything that I don't think they will dare ultimately do anything that will result in the end of the special counsels investigation to do that well the members of Congress can't the administration would have to fire Rosen Stein and put in someone who would then either fire Mahler or constrain the investigation in an improper ways that they could do I would hope the political pressure would and it would be too much for them to do it the members of the house cannot do that they can simply demand information which they know the Justice Department cannot possibly hand over it's because it's relating to an ongoing criminal investigations the scoping documents they know that if they have already gotten some documents that they shouldn't have gotten that's appeared on Fox News it's become the it's gone to the administration and they've outed the identity of some FBI informants which is highly dangerous this they should not do and the Department of Justice cannot a to aid them in doing is it clear to you that the reason they're asking for the documents that they are asking for is because they want to use them to generate bad press around the investigation or is it that they're looking for things that the president could conceivably use or other people involved in the investigation could conceivably use to try to defend themself I don't think they really believe they're going to get this kind of this information Justice Department can't possibly give it to them they know that we had a letter today which I introduced into the record from the Deputy Attorney General back in 2002 the then chairman of the Rules Committee saying why they couldn't give precisely the same kind of information and the reasons why so I believe that what they're doing is just trying to lay the groundwork to defame the Special Counsel to defame Rosenstein and to to prepare the way so that when the Special Counsel finally comes up with his recommendations or his report whatever that they can say we told you as a witch-hunt we told you it's dishonest and disregard it I think they're just trying to sabotage the investigation now and if by some miracle they can get some of this information I shouldn't say by some miracle but if they should get some of this information it's clear how they'll use it they've already used the information they gave it to the administration mayor Giuliani has told us that they would do that and and and and and they could use it to to harm people watching that hearing today with multiple Republican members of Congress really cutting loose in terms of the way they went after the FBI and the Justice Department the Deputy Attorney General in particular who of course oversees the Moller investigation I felt like there was something that I wasn't getting about what why they're at such a fever pitch right now obviously they've been critical of the special counsels investigation on sort of a steadily increasing crescendo but it feels like something's broken it feels like something has caused them to take this to really another level is that just a perception or do you think there is something new going on I don't know of anything new going on I think it's just the next step I think this is as you put it a suddenly rising crescendo and they're just ramping it up and ramping it up the president is pushing this you know it's a witch hunt etc and I think they're trying to use it I mean that they came out right and said it today they've been saying you know it's time to shut it down it's gone on long enough it's gone on too long I asked the deputy AG roses sign has he gone on too long he said no for this type of an investigation there they're going as fast as possible it's a reasonable time period in a year they've already gotten 20 indictments five guilty pleas and they're going as rapidly as possible and you look at other investigations of of this magnitude of this complexity gone on a lot longer the pressure from the Republicans right now you feel like is being met by the Justice Department the FBI protecting the special counsel I think yes it is I think that Rosenstein and Andray especially roses line have bent over backwards and given them a lot of information that you normally wouldn't give them and they they're demanding millions of documents I think they've turned over thousands I don't know how many thousands but they're doing everything they can but they're not going to bend beyond a certain point which they cannot to defend the integrity they need to defend the integrity of the investigation congressman Jerrold Nadler is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee with a critical post thank you for being here Isis thank you thank you

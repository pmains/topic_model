so while the biden administration continues with its twisted efforts of trying to kill fossil fuels while simultaneously demanding that they produce more democrats in congress are very busy using the law as they would say to smear and convict energy companies with no evidence an example is the consumer fuel price gouging prevention act which barely passed the house with no republicans and four democrats opposing it democrat katie porter a co-sponsor of the bill told a whopper on the bill's passage claiming quote big oil executives are bragging to shareholders about price gouging families at the pump end quote of course you provided no source for that claim because there is none she just made it up such is the integrity vacuum of today's lawmakers one who opposed that bill is our next guest republican congressman of arkansas and a member of the natural resources committee bruce westerman good to see you congressman thanks for being here how many laws by the way are are based on stuff that's just made up uh it seems like anymore david a lot of them are that way uh you know you mentioned i'm on the natural resources committee we had a hearing this past week with all the energy crises and everything else going on the topic of the hearing with big cats so i know that's what's first and foremost america's mind is regulating big cats unbelievable like i'll use one of joe biden's words it's bizarre it's bizarre that he's blaming everyone wants to point fingers uh it's bizarre that they don't understand when they pour trillions of dollars into an overheated economy that it gives a double whammy uh to the economy on the negative side number one they were paying people not to work which hit hurt supply and people have more money to spend which increased demand so prices have gone up we tried to tell them you're going to blow inflation through the roof they didn't listen now there's this attack on energy so uh you know i'm kind of to the point i think they're incompetent to lead uh they're too arrogant to follow would they just please get out of the way and let the people that can solve the problem and solve it yeah and by the way there's also the people that work for the co they they talk about the oil companies as though there's there's a room full of of people that are making all the money uh from from oil revenue when in fact there are millions of people that work for the oil companies uh both in the in the uh the production and the distribution and the retail sectors and everything those are those are good jobs those are jobs that we don't want to kill by a government takeover whatever they have in mind uh let alone all of the people that have stock in the companies it's the shareholders that own the company so they got that now we should mention of course that that this was passed in the house but uh it's unlikely to pass in the senate because you you know you have senator manchin and some other people some other senators who are probably going to vote it down right right and it's it's nonsense we should be focusing on things like the bills that the ranking member on the energy and commerce committee kathy mcmorris rogers and i'll put out the american energy independence from russia act which would require the administration to do an energy plan to open up pipelines and build more pipelines to start issuing leases onshore and offshore and really empowering those american workers to fix this problem because that's what's going to fix it attacking the oil industry is not going to solve anything and in the meantime joe biden's gonna fly to saudi arabia uh emitting all kinds of greenhouse gas emissions but he should be going to say texas louisiana or maybe maybe get into the car and drive back to pennsylvania and look at the the gas there in the marcellus shell yeah we have the resources and the solutions here we just have to utilize them and we have the workers he claims to care about union workers there's so many you there are hundreds of thousands of union jobs that are directly tied in to all of those projects that you talked about and you know you also have the american people behind you the voters are behind you they americans do care more about cheaper gas than they do about oil company profits don't they absolutely and you know we have the resources that's the part and we do it cleaner safer more efficiently than anybody else in the world we lowered greenhouse gas emissions in the united states through the innovation to produce more shell gas replace coal and we could be doing that not only here but across the world yet you see china built 38 gigawatts of coal power plants last year that's one huge coal plant every week uh we could be supplying the energy to europe uh they're building coal-fired plants the the administration the democrats in congress use this guy environment where their policies actually hurt the environment hurt american workers and hurt americans in the in the checkbook and it's hurting worse low income and fixed income americans who can't afford to buy increased fuel and increased food counters congressman you know who else is going to hurt it's going to hurt democrats in the fall and and and it's not just us saying that by the way nbc just came out with a poll uh showing that in fact the question is which party better handles rising prices the gop 55 percent dems 36 in other words republicans hold a 19-point lead in the polls about which party handles prices better so i mean i don't know whether they have a a political suicide wish or not but they're they're going against the wishes of the voters absolutely and the more they point fingers i i think they need to realize when they point a finger there's three of them pointing back it's almost as absurd as when uh putin was blaming ukraine for putin invading ukraine he's blaming uh biden are is blaming the people who can get us out of this mess they won't take any responsibility they won't listen to any sound advice and i think they're going to pay dearly in the polls i just want something better for the country i don't want to have to wait till november to start turning this around and i don't want to dig deeper as we get closer tonight that's right that's right but it's still it's still like five months away we we have to be concerned about how high prices could go up until that point up until they change their mind congressman great to see you thank you for being here

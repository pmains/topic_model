joining me now House Majority Whip Minnesota Congressman Tom emmer congratulations by the way uh Congressman a well-deserved position here I want to ask what kind of compromise are Republicans looking for well it's a little early to talk about compromise we just want to have a discussion uh Charles the White House everybody I think in Congress knows that we've got an impending debt ceiling issue that we've got to deal with House Republicans led by Kevin McCarthy are here ready willing and able to start negotiating not just on the the debt ceiling itself but on real spending reforms going forward that'll put this country in a better position to meet its obligations for the next generation and generations to come you know this will be the 79th time that the debt ceiling's been raised since 1960. so you've had 78 opportunities to do this in the past you have to forgive me and the people watching the show if they're a little bit cynical about all of this and then there are these larger issues Medicaid Medicare Social Security they're propping up they're real issues that don't go away why can't they be sincerely uh you know discussed and maybe some solutions some elegant Solutions applied well the new majority in the house agrees with you Charles and agrees with Americans you've got a government that takes in a dollar and for every dollar we take in we're spending a dollar twenty nine that is not sustainable House Republicans under the leadership of our new speaker Kevin McCarthy are ready willing uh and able to do the negotiations that are necessary uh the president on the other hand has said there will be absolutely no negotiations now he's going to do a speech which I think is a huge mistake for him to dig in his heels on this issue it is in order to do this you've got to be reasonable the reasonable thing to do is to sit down and have a discussion you got to be uh responsible House Republicans are ready Charles and I think eventually the president's going to understand you're going to have to sit down and talk with us because it's not about Republicans and Democrats this is about the future this cut this great nation although there's always public relations involved this White House in particular always seems to be focused on winning that more than anything else and they're going to say Republicans are always reluctant when it comes to the debt ceiling to make any modifications when there's a republican in office but they become even more intransigent when there's a democrat in the White House we've got a chart on the screen right now that shows just the major differences of course both parties are that way but more so with Republicans what do you counter with that when they say this is just typical Republican stuff well try us uh Mr President the phone is ringing America's calling time for you to pick up that phone House Republicans are ready to answer that call we're ready to sit down and have that discussion and be responsible be sensible and be reasonable to get this thing done with uh important necessary spending reforms that'll put this country on a better track a sustainable track for the next generation and generations to come meanwhile the house expected to pass a bill tomorrow that limits the oil Reserve withdrawal from the Strategic petroleum Reserve uh which by the way is at its lowest level since April of 1984. the White House saying is that on arrival what are they missing here they're missing how the markets work first uh at first Charles uh there this is called the Strategic petroleum response act this is the first step of responsible behavior by House Republicans doing the work to restore American Energy Independence which by the way is directly uh influencing inflation in this country it's not just gas prices it's everything about our standard of living and the cost of living in this country Charles essentially what this Administration has done is rather than allow for new production rather than for allow for competition the marketplace to work they've been draining our emergency supply and selling it to people like China it's down to four it's down 40 percent you point out 1984. 40 percent of it is depleted and they don't have any plan to refill it uh that's what this bill is all about again it's the first step in restoring American Energy Independence which frankly the Biden Administration has destroyed Congressman again congratulations and and thank you so much appreciate it thank you Charles

early like to recognize the gentleman from Georgia Mr Ferguson thank you Mr chairman and I just like to point out that this is in fact our second hearing that we've had not our first um and I think there were so many members on the other side that did not attend the first hearing that maybe they just slipped their mind so I'll just point that out I also want to address the the insinuations that that we have not you know that we're the the that we are going after the individual citizen here this listen this was a huge program we sent out money this place DC decided to shut down the country and we knew we had to do something to help our fellow Americans and we did but then we went back to the well again when it was unneeded and when we had an opportunity to put guard rails on it we failed to do so now I just think that's where we need we need to recognize and we need we need our colleagues on the other side to get serious about the oversight and quit coming after Republicans when it's not right so get that off my chest foreign ER in this program I think you said 191 billion dollars in in estimated fraud is that right that's correct all right and you've recovered 105 million of it no I I I didn't say we had it recovered 105. we actually as far as the labor oig we have 905 million that we have uh are not recovered but monetary results 105 million is that not 905 million monetary results and what that is is there may be uh court cases or admin a civil resolutions to some of that and some of it takes time to actually see that the funds all right yes so of of those of those cases um what do you how much do you anticipate recovering what's a what's a good estimate do you have any idea of what that may what that may be uh let me make sure I understand your question first of all let me just clip it's 191 billion that we say is in proper payment and there's 76 of that is uh what is expected to be the uh the fraud rate okay 76 is yes okay I'm just trying to get make sure I've got the the numbers right all right on there okay um and you said you have exhausted all of the funds that Congress allocated to you for for those efforts did you did I hear you say that no you didn't hear me say that but we're on the verge of doing that the 38 and a half uh million dollars that labor oig was given as for oversight yes we are uh close to exhausting those funds Okay so then there was another two billion dollars that went for fraud prevention is that am I am I right on that number as well and we I think you may be talking are you talking about the two billion let me let me refer that two billion yeah there was 2 billion that was given it could be used for fraud it could be used for customer service it could be used uh for these tiger teams that went in so it was multiple uses that there there was that amount of money all right it just seems like the amount of money we're spending on that isn't isn't getting a really good return on investment overall okay if you look the way I look at it all right so we got to be more efficient in that now we've talked an awful lot about fraud okay and as we've said all Republicans and Democrats up here I think everybody in America except the people committing the fraud or against fraud but there's a whole nother part here which is improper payments okay now we we've been we've been going after fraud but we haven't really talked about the improper payments and one of the things I would like to hear very briefly from you today about is the improper payments how did that happen why did it happen and has anybody been held accountable there we talk about holding the criminals that committed fraud there but what about the ineptness of a bureaucracy that is just simply not doing its job and issuing out hundreds of billions of dollars in improper payments because again improper payments as the chairman said a dollar that goes to the wrong spot is not a dollar going to the right spot so in some regard I don't know that we've got so much a Republican or a Democrat problem we may have a bureaucrat problem because it's gone on for two two administrations so how does how do the Improv what's the biggest problem with improper payments how are you going to fix it and who's going to who's going to be held accountable for that Mr Sterner so again part of the let me just clear What improper payment is everybody be on the same page your improper payments this win ever a benefit is paid incorrectly there could be the amount or it could be overpayment underpayment or else it could be going to the wrong person so that's the improper payment and fraud is a subset of the improper payments so I just want to make sure that I clear that up uh and as far as what we're doing we're having our audit work to take a look at that I mean we've had 11 uh audits that we've completed throughout the pandemic we have another another 17 that are ongoing and we have three that are playing work so we are taking a look at that and that's how we're holding the department accountable can I I'm out of time but if the chairman will grant Miss Tower Woods up briefly on that point I think one of the things that's important to keep in mind I know Mr dadara speaks about this a lot these are we're really talking about 54 programs being managed by 50 states District of Columbia and three territories uh it's very important to include in this discussion National Association of State Workforce agencies and state Auditors they're the ones on the front line because states are doing it differently across the country some are doing better than others I think it's very important as we think about this program going forward how much control should be at the federal level how much should be decentralized as it largely is to the states and and how do we figure out what states are doing better than others and um using that model to increase the the compliance rates and the and reduce uh improper payments across the country thank you you're back Mr chairman thank you representative and I also appreciate your attendance at both of our hearings this week the first and today being the second it was an honor and a pleasure sir thank you

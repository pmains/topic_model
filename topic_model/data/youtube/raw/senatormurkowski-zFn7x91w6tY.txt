obviously some some differing views on the committee here in terms of our energy resources and and how we utilize them to the benefit of our country uh certainly to the benefit of places like alaska which is a of course a producing state so i'd like to talk about a few of the the the issues um and i'll be a little parochial here just to start off but on friday the bureau of land management released a draft supplemental eis for the willow project within the npra and i think you saw the press release on that i welcomed that step i can't stress enough the need for the department to to move forward with final approval for the willow project it is my very sincere hope that the department will will soon be able to issue permits so work can begin on this project during the the upcoming winter season 22-23 we have had the conversation madam secretary i've had the conversation with the president i've had the conversation with just about everybody in the administration that will listen to me on willow because i i firmly believe that we need to have a realistic plan for the future of our energy supply and i think that alaska definitely fits within that plan the chairman mentioned the the near record high gas prices that that families are are seeing it's bad all over the country but if you're in a community like yakitat i i follow the the the weekly gas prices in various communities around the state yakitat is paying about seven dollars and 25 cents uh a gallon for fuel it's just tough and so they're asking me what what are the tools that are available what can the administration be doing what can congress be doing to to help to help dampen these price increases that we're seeing and and for me it comes down to to the basics of of economic supply and and demand and i am one who believes very strongly that that the administration and here in this country we need to use those tools at our disposal to increase domestic production to improve our energy security particularly as we're seeing the the global disruptions and and the unrest and i've i've said it before and i'll say it again alaska stands ready willing and certainly able to be a big part of that solution all while we insist on on meeting the highest environmental standards in the world the chairman has mentioned the five-year plan for the offshore oil and gas that the department recently proposed and again given what we're seeing here at home uh over in europe i truly truly believe that our national security interests require that we increase our domestic supply of these resources including from from our offshore areas you know i've heard i've heard the reference before that that oil is is an addiction i recognize that we have a reliance on it but when i think of of an addiction like a heroin addiction i think about it as as as something that um there is no there is no upside to to heroin addiction um our our reality as a country is that we have a resource that not only we need right now but the world needs right now um and it is not just to fuel our vehicles i think where where we're moving to to different transportation fuels but that is a transition but everything everything that we we use practically has some aspect of petroleum in it and and so until we can figure out what that substitute is this petroleum base that really powers and moves and and allows us to function as a modern society is is something is something that is in demand and again we can choose to to look to others to meet that demand and make ourselves more vulnerable more reliant on others and particularly others that don't even like us or whose environmental track record is awful or whose human rights track record is awful so i uh i have said as we transition from a a fossil based society a transition requires that uh there be a a path forward that is sensible for your economy and and sensible uh really technologically and so we got a lot of work to do there i feel strongly when it comes to the five-year plan that the administration has has to move move and move quickly to finalize a plan that keeps at least the current acreage available for offshore leasing including in in my state but your proposed plan included the option of holding no lease sale at all which i i think that that's unacceptable for the department to even consider a five-year plan that would include no lease sales i i just don't think makes sense and i think it's actually harmful to our economy and our national security the national interest demands the administration avoid a costly gap in leasing and that it conducts offshore sales i want to see annual sales and cook inlet not one sale every five years failure to have meaningful oil and gas programs including in the 1002 area where the administration is illegally disregarding the law will reduce domestic investment at the worst possible time for our country and for our global allies i think the president needs to focus on places like alaska not saudi arabia not venezuela not iran and then and then work with us to achieve just that so i've said before madam secretary alaska is is willing uh and able and ready to increase our nations and our allies energy security all we really need is permission from the federal government to get moving get those permits and and we are there

ma'am Chairman I rise in opposition to the M my good friend from from Washington mr. dicks I respect where my friend is trying to go but not only does this amendment not get us there it's downright dangerous downright dangerous let me explain why since the Clinton administration and response to lawsuits and court orders that were crippling the agency's budget since the Clinton administration there has been a statutory cap on how much the agency is permitted to spend on esa listings it's been a statutory cap in place since the Clinton administration a cap on critical habitat spending was added in 2002 the Obama administration requested new caps for petitions and foreign species listed in 2012 in short support for esa funding caps has been has had bipartisan support in Congress and in the White House and was in place when the gentleman from Washington wrote the Interior bill and when the gentleman from Virginia wrote the Interior bill those spending caps were in place this amendment proposes to do away with funding caps all together and gives the green light to those that have made a living suing Fish and Wildlife Service as a result the litigants will act the courts will act and the Fish and Wildlife Services entire operating budget will be at risk of being rated in order to fund court-ordered mandates to list species and designate critical habitat the service will have no choice but to raid other funds from its resource management accounts which is already 146 million or twelve percent decreased in this budget having said that the heart of the issue isn't about funding it's about the fact that the Endangered Species Act is broken and is badly in need of review revision and reauthorization by the natural resources committee committee as I have said before there's been about 2,000 species listed 21 recovered 2000 listed 21 recovered and unfortunately the Endangered Species Act has become not so much about saving species as it has been about controlling land and water I'll give you an example we all talk about the fuzzy and warm animals that we all like and all want to say if nobody talks about the slick spotted pepper grass endangered nobody really cares about the six spotted pepper grass except that it's listed and you know what it does it prevents cattle grazing on public lands and is used to prevent cattle grazing on public lands and move cattle producers off of public lands that's the only reason that the slick slick slick spotted pepper grass is really listed that's unfortunate when you start using what was an act that everyone in bipartisan almost unanimous agreement in the House and Senate was a good act the intent of the Endangered Species Act is right and we need to do it we need to protect species that are endangered unfortunately that's not what it's being used for today and you can't get people to the table the stakeholders to do a reauthorization bill because there are groups that like it the way it is they want to control land and water by using the endangered species at how do you get the message out to them that we need to do a reauthorization the only way I can think of is you say no what this has been unauthorized for 20 years now you talk about policy writers in this bill that you don't like this is a policy writer that you're attempting to add it's an unauthorized program just because we have continued to fund it for 20 years that's not the answer that's the problem and we need stakeholders to come to the table to sit down with the Natural Resources Committee and write a reauthorization that's what this is all about is it is a shot across the bow there are 58 I believe it is 56 or 58 programs in this bill that the authorization has expired somehow we need to send a message that we have a process around here it's authorization then appropriation not authorization expired appropriation and appropriation and appropriation and appropriation the only way those things keep going on we are trying to send them you will find I am supportive of reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act and I am supportive of the endangered species act as it was originally intended but I would urge my colleagues to vote against this dangerous amendment which would undermine the Fish and Wildlife Services budget because it would lift the caps that have been in place since the Clinton administration and Fish and Wildlife Service would have no other alternative but to raid their accounts in order to fund court orders suits and other things that would come along urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment

Mr Speaker I now yield five minutes to the to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland the minority whip and one of the original authors of the a DA in 1990 mr. Hoyer Cummings recognized for five minutes I thank the gentleman for yielding and I rise in strong opposition to this legislation in 1990 President George HW Bush declared a long-overdue independence day for people with disabilities as he signed the historic Americans with Disabilities Act into law as the house sponsor of the ADA a I shared the president's optimism and hope that every man woman and child with disability can now pass through once closed doors into a bright new era of equality independence and freedom I was proud to work across the aisle I'm the a DA and on the a DA Amendments Act of 2008 the only time the a DA has ever been amended we brought together outside groups from a broad range of affiliations to create a framework for policy that would vastly improve accessibility and be agreeable to all unfortunately people with disabilities still face stubborn barriers to full inclusion in the last year people with differing abilities had had to fight for access to health care and the services they need to live independently and with dignity now we have on the floor a bill that would undermine the central tenets of the ADA a the right of victims of discrimination to seek redress for exclusion requiring victims of discrimination to provide notice of a violation before bringing a lawsuit is an improper shift of the burden of compliance on two victims one not required of any other group by any other civil rights law not a single civil rights law gives this kind of provision as the Paralyzed Veterans of America wrote in its letter of opposition I quote veterans with disabilities who honorably served their country should not bear the burden of ensuring that business and their communities are meeting their a.da obligations instead it is the responsibility of the businesses and their associations to educate themselves about the laws requirement now this law was passed some twenty-seven years ago there is no excuse for not knowing the obligations our laws do not require such notice for women African Americans Latinos religious minorities or any other groups protected against discrimination I acknowledge that there are issues and states that have added compensatory damages to their state laws there are no damages in this the national ad a law which was they compromise a problem with state law however should not be fixed that should be fixed at the state level and not with a retreat in the federal law lawyers who file vexatious suits may well be in violation of their ethical obligations sadly we're seeing that almost twenty eight years after its passage and decades of notice as to what is required tax credits so that you can make changes necessary to make your place accessible there are still those who have barriers to full accommodation for Americans with differing abilities contrary to law in fact when we adopted the law we didn't have it go into effect for 24 months two years so that people could educate themselves on their responsibilities people with differing abilities still have to fight day in and day out for the access and inclusion to which they should already be entitled under the law as businesses continued to dismiss their obligations we have a colleague senator tammy duckworth she was a helicopter pilot her legs were shot off she now serves in the United States Senate Sable veteran and an American Hero she wrote the following in the Washington Post about this bill and I quote this offensive legislation would segregate the disability community making it the only protected class under civil rights law that must rely on education rather than strong enforcement to guarantee access to public spaces I will be voting no on this legislation in the name of upholding the bedrock principles of civil rights law in this country and the integrity of the ADEA that many of us work together to enact on a bipartisan basis an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis 400 votes plus for this legislation let us not retreat this day let us not to say to those with disabilities you've got to wait 180 days what if we said if you're an African American and you try to go into a place of public accommodations and they wouldn't admit you and you said well I've got a complaint Germans fired 180 days to have that right redressed that's not right Tillman's time aspire to treat disabilities gentleman from Virginia as second-rate citizens gentleman's time has expired gentleman's time is expired gentleman from Virginia Mr Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to the gentleman from Maryland the technical requirements of title 3 are

joining me now is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee it's Mark Warner of Virginia senator Warner welcome back to the show sir thank you I want to start first with all of the changes that we've seen take place and I want to put up a quote from Charlie dent retiring Republican congressman from Pennsylvania more center-right than conservative right but he said this the spontaneity and lack of impulse control are areas of concern for lots of members on both sides of the aisle disorder chaos instability uncertainty intemperate statements are not conservative virtues in my opinion this was Charlie definitely acting - all of the changes this week what do you make of the changes I think he's right this chaos is not the way you run an organization I was a business executive for 20 years I ran a state what's called the best manage state in the nation when I was governor but with this president I think he thrives on chaos maybe that's the way to run a reality TV show it's not the way to run the greatest country in the world at the end of the day should it there's there's a lot of folks are not happy with the instability but he's comfortable with it should that matter well I think at the end of the day when he took the oath of office it was to protect and defend the Constitution and our country I think we are more vulnerable by having taking out and not consulting with our allies I think we are more vulnerable when you've got a president that wakes up every morning and even his closest advisers don't know what he's going to say or do I think we are more vulnerable when the president United States calls Vladimir Putin and John McCain's words not mine congratulate a dictator on a sham election I don't think that makes our country safer and frankly when the president it√≠d States who still refuses to acknowledge Russian intervention on that call doesn't raise election security or doesn't stand up for our closest - how long why didn't the case why do you think he's doing that you know I can look at a lot of evidence I gave up predicting this president a long time ago I do know this that when the president doesn't act others do have to act for example election security the russians hacked in our elections they scanned or broke into 21 states every one of the presidents top security advisors have said they'll be back yet they received no direction from the White House to make election security a top priority so this is Willie this week just this week bipartisan our committee came out with you know let's make sure we got paper trail on every election let's make sure we help States better information sharing so the president's not gonna have to protect the country in this case Congress is actually stepping up it do you believe the president somehow acting as if he's compromised with Putin it is more than bizarre that 14 months into this president's administration he has failed to ever call out Russia he's failed to ever condemn Putin even after and Putin was accused of killing a British individual Russian British individual in the UK there is something just strange about this and I think it is one of the reasons why mowers investigation has to continue and why our investigation has to continue ask you about Facebook do you think they've been truthful and forthcoming I don't think Facebook has been fully forthcoming I called out Facebook back in December of 16 in the spring of 17 I questioned micro-targeting and the use of this really sketchy firm Cambridge analytic early on for most of 2017 they blew that off they then during the summer acknowledged that there was paid advertising but more importantly that there were a number of Russian accounts that were fake accounts to spread information that touched a hundred and fifty million Americans to have concerned that Cambridge analytic Oh found a founding executive is Steve ban and their their their their financial sort of rain maker or the Mercer family if you hired Cambridge analytical you got Mercer money and it somehow this and then you had Steve ban and was also the chairman of a news organization then they're getting Facebook data it Chuck that's only part of it yeah I mean there are you concerned as all of this is is was designed almost to to create I don't know to create some to weaponize something that we weren't aware of when you go to a video company with political consulting what we saw on 2016 was the broad weaponization of information by Russians and unfortunately using some other tools this same from the recently disgraced CEO reached out to Julian Assange about leaked emails this same firm reached out to a Russian oil company Lukoil about working on trying to get American election data and this firm has a reputation as been in more than 30 countries where it's been using disruptive tactics why would this firm be then used by by the Trump campaign six million dollar contract and I think there are still a whole host of questions you know that Steve Banta was a founding executive I was aware were you aware that there was both from the Mercer family from other individuals that were Cambridge and all that it had at best a colorful reputation no I understand that but did you know that here you had a chairman of a news organization who is I guess I'm more of a principal on this around what bothers me is again this is a firm but even I think the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner bragged about their value then after the election you've seen nothing but the Trump campaign trying to distance themselves right I gotta ask you about this Facebook ad today this is Mark Zuckerberg apology and I hold it up because if you can find Facebook's logo here you've got better eyesight than I do it's very it this looks like a guy that is uncomfortable with taking responsibility this is what he told Kara Swisher things like where's the line on hate speech I mean who chose me to be the person that did that I guess I have to because we're here now but I'd rather not does he sound like a CEO that wants to take responsibility first country companies actions Mark Zuckerberg created in many ways the whole notion of social media it's a great American success story as is Twitter or Google a series of other companies but I think the whole industry has been reluctant to accept the fact that we're seeing the dark underbelly of social media and how it can be manipulated we're still dealing right now with kind of fake posts and fake accounts ago think about the next generation of technology where they can put somebody else's face on somebody's or totally real-time misrepresent words that come out of somebody's mouth this is an area where we have to get our arms around it and frankly mr. Zuckerberg needs to come and testify he says he will the right person well listen I got experts on reason yeah I got experts on my staff but you don't want my staff here you want me here he is the face of you wouldn't go to a voter and say no no let me let me it was not gonna cut it he needs to come out he created this entity he created this industry and he needs to come explain to the American public and the policy with the FTC finds that they violated their consent decree it's a it's a two trillion dollar fine minimum if you take the $40,000 for each instance for each day that they let each instance have 150 million in it I could do the quick math two trillion dollars should that be the level of fine they should potentially be subject to the FTC has to determine whether they violated the 2011 consent decree they'll work through that if they did should you see maximum penalty there will be appropriate penalties but I think it raises the bigger question all of these social media platform companies have said they have no responsibility for any of the content I think we have to relook at that I think in many ways from media companies I think we have to relook at the fact that if if you move from one company to another maybe you should be able to move all your data there are solutions and what I invite mr. Zuckerberg and others is come help work with us Congress is not always at the best in terms of cutting edge technology they need to work with us so we try to get it right I don't want to out regulate these companies into oblivion but I do think people need to have the ability to know whether information they're receiving is honest truthful or at least originates in this country senator Warner I have to leave it there Democrat from Virginia thanks for coming on sharing your views I think if you're a social media company you can drop the word social you're a media company thank you sir

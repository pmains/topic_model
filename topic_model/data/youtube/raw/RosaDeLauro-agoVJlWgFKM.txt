Mr Speaker later today this body will vote on the House Majority leadership plan to cut 40 billion dollars from food stamps and forcing over four million low-income Americans citizens veterans seniors and children to go hungry this bill is immoral it is wrong to take food from the mouths of hungry people it is especially cruel when at the same time the House Majority continues to support crop insurance subsidies to wealthy farmers and agribusinesses let us be clear about this so-called nutrition bill we are voting on today the majority's leadership is making an explicit choice they want us to force the poorest families in America to go hungry at a time of great need while continuing to support and even expand giant government subsidies to the wealthy this is reverse Robin Hood this makes no economic sense even as it left anti-hunger programs in limbo the farm bill passed in July by the majority expanded crop insurance subsidies according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office these crop insurance subsidies will cost taxpayers 90 billion dollars over the next decade USDA United States Department of Agriculture reports is spent 14 billion dollars on crop insurance last year alone keep in mind that means we will spend over twice as much on these subsidies then this proposed cut to food stamps will save us some members of the majority like to argue that these deep cuts to food stamps are necessary and that we the richest nation on earth cannot afford to help feed the most vulnerable members of our society this is untrue a decision is being made to cut 40 billion dollars in food aid to the poor while giving 90 billion dollars in subsidies to the wealthy that is not right so who exactly you're receiving these subsidies that is a good question right now US taxpayers pay on average almost two-thirds of crop insurance premiums for high-income farmers sixty-two percent we pay for these crop insurance premiums and according to the Congressional Budget Office the federal government paid 1.4 billion in crop insurance administrative costs to financial and insurance companies including a bank in Switzerland last year over 10,000 farmers each received over one hundred thousand dollars in crop insurance subsidies and because the program is not means tested or capped 26 farmers made over a million dollars from the federal government 26 wealthy farm owners who we are prevented from identifying and they could even be members of Congress we can't get their names they are statutorily protected and as I stand here we are going to fight every day to get the names of these 26 individuals meanwhile the bill that we considered today would deny SNAP benefits to jobless adults without children whose incomes averaged only about one-fifth of the poverty line and that my friends is twenty five hundred dollars a year let's say no to them for food on their tables we also know that crop insurance subsidies have a higher error rate meaning more waste fraud and abuse then the food stamp program one of the most efficient programs the federal government undertakes and sadly we know that there are members of the majority arguing strenuously for these deep cuts to food aid who at the same time are pocketing millions themselves in crop insurance subsidies they should be ashamed families on food stamps are struggling we hear about seniors who have to choose between buying food and medicine veterans trying to get back on their feet after serving their country students in the classroom who can't even concentrate when others are eating because they're actually going hungry these are the Americans this bill would see grow hungry even as we subsidize doubts to wealthy farmers this is immoral if this is not wrong nothing is wrong but even if that doesn't sway you consider the math this bill would cut 40 billion dollars from food aid while the majority in this body voted to kick 90 billion dollars in crop insurance subsidies it would deny over four million low-income individuals a chance to eat even as we are giving 26 faceless individuals 1 million dollars each I cannot support a bill that hurts millions of low-income citizens children seniors veterans as the majority continues to subsidize wealthy agribusiness historically addressing hunger in America has been a bipartisan effort Democrats and Republicans who've come together to say we have a serious problem of hunger in America let's work to eradicate that was McGovern and dole Javits Kennedy and so many others I urge my colleagues in both Palace parties to vote this heartless bill down and I yield back

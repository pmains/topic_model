thank you let's bring in south cutter republican senator mike brown senator let me just start you with what you heard karine jean-pierre say just then she said our present economic plan is working what do you say when i heard it all i could say was wow unbelievable think about this a little bit south dakota right now my family's here in this state 604 dollars more a month in living expenses than what they had when this president took office those are real dollars for real families uh i'm sorry but his economic plans are not working we know what the answer is let's get back to actually allowing for job creation again by what we did in the first place which was let's become an energy producer again in the united states rather than being a consumer from other countries let's get inflation under control by allowing for that energy to flow into the marketplace and bring the price of gasoline down the price of diesel down that's doable right now and by the way for these folks that think that their economic plans are great when what they suggest to people is is go get an electric car i got news for them there aren't a lot of them there and our electric grid could never handle that in the first place i suspect that some of these people in washington dc that are suggesting that probably have a magic carpet in their garage as well yeah we don't have one of those out here we need real results and that means getting back to what we were doing before this administration came into office let me just put up on the screen if i could the the gas prices and how they have gone up look at this today it's four dollars and seventy one cents a gallon that's up four pennies from yesterday uh up uh 11 cents from last week way up from a month ago and way way up from three dollars and four cents you mentioned electric cars uh they don't fare very well there in south dakota because there are large distances between cities i remember i was there once in sioux city and i plugged in directions for rapid city or sioux falls rather and i plugged in directions for rapid city it said turn left go 340 miles turn left i mean high gas prices are having a huge impact on people in south dakota and it's not just the gasoline it's diesel as well we're right in the middle of planting season right now diesel is over five dollars and twenty cents a gallon those are the folks that are actually producing the wheat they're producing the corn the soybeans and all of those commodity prices are going to go up because these guys can't these guys couldn't even plant it if they weren't getting at least enough to pay for their input expenses this administration has made that very very challenging i'm going to go back to this in the first place we know what the remedy is let's bring taxes down let's not do what the president has just suggested in the end of march he suggested 2.5 trillion dollars more in additional taxes over the next 10 years well look what the market does the market says are you kidding us you want 2.5 trillion dollars more take a look at what's happened to the stock market since the end of march it's not going up it's going down and that's because these folks understand just how serious the trouble is that we can see in the future based upon what this administration is doing in terms of economic policy this is wrong this is just flat out wrong and the sooner we can get back in and start stopping these these bureaucrats from putting in these kinds of rules that the american people have got to live with the sooner we can start getting this economy back under control again your neighbor to the north north dakota is a big producer of shale oil the bakken shale formation produces a substantial amount of the energy that we consume in this country let me put this up on the screen october 19th was the high water mark for balcon shale oil production 45 million and six thousand five hundred and forty five barrels produced in october of 2019 compare that with march of 2022 latest month for which we have figures down 12 million barrels so when the president says we're producing more oil than we ever have i mean there's the proof that we're not well there's more to it here as well first of all they made it extremely difficult to actually get a lease on federal lands and a huge amount of federal lands in the western part of the united states but that's only part of the story about what they're doing to stop energy production not only are they making it more difficult if almost impossible to get a lease that they can explore on but second of all just to explore you've got to have an additional license and then if you do find something there you've got to have the ability to get it out of that location and into the marketplace which means additional pipelines and they have been hell-bent to shut down those pipelines as well so this administration does not seem to understand that we need access to these petroleum products and the sooner we can get them back into the market the sooner you'll start to see inflation at all levels start to go back down again you think about the cost of food going up right now part of it is is just the transportation to get the food to market not not let alone the cost to actually produce the food and the amount of petroleum that it takes to actually produce in the first place well this administration is totally out of touch with what it's going to take to bring back a strong economy in the united states we've got to get these bureaucrats under control well the president announced it already that he doesn't see oil prices coming down anytime soon senator mike rounds the great state of south dakota thanks for being with us appreciate it

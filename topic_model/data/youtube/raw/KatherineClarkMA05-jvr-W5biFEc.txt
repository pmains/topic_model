welcome everybody uh to today's press conference over the course of the last year america has come face to face with two realities about our early education system that have long been ignored child care is essential to our economy and that this vital system is at its breaking point child care has always been thought of as a private matter for families instead of rightly recognized as a public good the truth is child care plays an essential role for families for businesses and for the development of our future workforce and the lack of public investment has created three interconnected problems high costs for parents high costs for providers low wages for workers even before the cobit 19 providers operated on the thinnest of margins then the pandemic hit shaking this fragile system to the point of collapse 40 of providers closed and the effects on parents especially women in the workforce are devastating over 2 million women pushed out of work including 1 million moms we cannot let this system fall through the cracks and abandon women and kids in the process that's why i'm so proud that the american rescue plan included a transformative 40 billion dollars for the child care industry resources that i have been fighting for since the spring last year now we must take proactive steps to ensure the under investment that got us here is not repeated today i am introducing the child care is infrastructure act my bill to fortify this vital sector of our economy with critical funding to support providers and in turn parents and kids the child care is essential infrastructure act will provide 10 billion dollars to child care providers to help renovate facilities which is especially important in the wake of cobin 19. it will assess immediate and overall infrastructure improvements needed to keep students safe and staff create a new loan repayment program to support early childhood educators and increase the support for campus-based child care options for student parents this bill will stabilize the child care providers improve the safety of our child care centers and support the financial well-being of our essential early educator workforce with this legislation we are acknowledging a fundamental truth child care is infrastructure just like roads and bridges and public transportation child care is a part of the bedrock of our economy the economic benefits of child care are well documented but so are the economic losses associated with its inaccessibility and our nation's repeated refusal to invest in child care with the significance that it deserves according to the early learning policy group the child care industry contributes over 99 billion dollars annually to the economy but the council for strong america also estimates that american businesses lose over 12 billion annually due to their employees challenges finding affordable quality care employers are dependent on child care for the stability and productivity of their employees and during the pandemic we learn this the hard way it's also about valuing the essential providers and educators who support our families and the economy 96 of child care professionals are women 40 of which are women of color these women shape the minds of the future and set our children down a path towards lifelong success but they are often paid minimum wage salaries by investing in their education we're supporting their success as professionals and enhancing the quality of care for our kids our kids are our future and it's been proven time and again the access to high quality early education is the crucial start every child needs and deserves for their long-term success in life with that i've invited child care experts and providers to join me today to announce this bill and i want to thank the many organizations and early educators who have helped shape this bill and brought child care to the forefront of our national dialogue including the bipartisan policy center and jumpstart this bill was made possible because of your steadfast advocacy i'm eager to hear from our speakers this morning and the reasons they're supporting the child care is infrastructure act our first speaker is nicole barclan who is policy director at the local initiative support corporation and the co-chair of the national children's facilities network with two decades of public policy experience she advocates for federal policies that forge resilient and inclusive communities of opportunity across america great places to live work visit do business and raise families nicole has worked closely with less national programs local offices and broad cross sector of organizations to develop and implement policy advocacy agendas that drive access to equitable opportunity in local communities her priority policy areas include safety and justice health and child care and early learning nicole began her career as a federal legislative staffer we are so grateful to our staffers and is a graduate of temple university nicole thank you for joining us thank you congresswoman clark for your strong leadership on child care issues and for giving lisk in the national children's facilities network the opportunity to voice our strong support for the child cares infrastructure act we happily heartily endorse this legislation and are ecstatic about its focus on facilities and related technical assistance for providers the legislation for us is important because it takes the long desired and necessary step of providing dedicated public sector funding dedicated federal funding to address child care and early education infrastructure needs now some people may be wondering why entities like lisk and other community development organizations are really interested in this work it's really simple we know that the availability of high quality child care programs in local communities are important to the success of the people who live there they're important to the success of our neighbors and the support important to the success of families we also know that facilities indoor and outdoor spaces are very important to the quality and health and safety of providers you mentioned that child care programs are an essential support for working families and directly influence child development they are in the physical environments play an important role in supporting the health and safety of children and providers the quality of programs in early childhood development a facility can either enhance program quality and safety for children and teachers or undermine it and quite honestly we all have to get past this notion that people in low-income urban and rural communities which this bill does tremendous things to help deserve anything less than high quality fixed spaces and high quality programs the last thing that i'll say is that the covet 19 pandemic exacerbated existing child care inadequacies and created a new sense of urgency to address the condition of physical spaces where child care and early learning take place we know that a part of the reason why providers have not been able to access support it's not because they do not want to it has had to do with the fragile operating subsidies that they receive which we're very pleased to see an increased federal focus on stabilizing the sector um but we also know that it's an equity issue the majority of child care businesses are women owned and bypassed businesses account for the majority of the industry child care providers have long been denied equitable access to capital and financial products to address their needs and they face barriers to assessing accessing capital to improve their the quality of the spaces that they provide so with this new significant federal investment states have a chance to rebuild their child care systems in a way that supports equitable access to quality programs in appropriate spaces we want to seize this great policy of momentum and address the lack of access to quality child care and the health and safety challenges posed by inadequate facilities so once again we are very pleased uh to to endorse this legislation we're pleased about the leadership on this issue and we're really pleased that um providers and their needs particularly their financial needs are being highlighted in this piece of legislation we look forward to working with you to push it across the finish line oh thank you so much nicole and now it's my pleasure to introduce melissa boteach vp for income security and child care early learning at the national women's law center melissa oversees nwlc's advocacy policy and public education strategies to ensure that all women and families have the income and supports they need to thrive prior to joining nwlc melissa spent nearly a decade at the center for american progress and at the jewish council for public affairs melissa has a masters of public policy from the gw from gw and a masters of equality studies from the university college dublin where she studied women in social movements and bachelor's degrees from the university of maryland in government and spanish thank you so much for joining us melissa thank you so much for having me good morning everyone uh and thank you representative clark for your steadfast leadership on ensuring that all families have access to affordable and high quality child care nwlc is proud to support the child cares infrastructure act which would take us closer to that goal the bill would authorize urgently needed investments to renovate child care facilities and support education and training for the early education workforce and this legislation couldn't be timelier the american rescue plan is a massive victory for women especially women of color who have been the most impacted by the pandemic the bill answered our call for at least 50 billion dollars in dedicated relief funding for child care which is the largest federal investment in child care since world war ii but the work doesn't end here in order to rebuild we have to address the underlying inequities that made us so vulnerable to the pandemic in the first place the relief package was about getting us back to the pre-pandemic starting point which had its flaws but now we are charged with building a child care system that meets families needs and provides early educators with the facilities and quality jobs that recognize how essential child care workers are child care is infrastructure it is the work that makes all other work possible and i'm pleased to talk to you today briefly about the child care crisis our nation faces and what we can do to build towards the future of child care and the role that the child cares infrastructure act would play to put us on that path some background on the child care crisis one in six child care jobs has been lost since the start of the pandemic meaning that nearly half of the 350 000 child care jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic have not yet returned these losses disproportionately impact women of color as both early educators and as mothers pushed out of the labor force due to unpaid caregiving responsibilities consider that one year ago in february 2020 we celebrated women comprising half the workforce fast forward today and women's labor force participation has not been this low since 1988. businesses are seeing the loss of employees firsthand according to a december study by the chamber of commerce foundation approximately 32 percent of employees said they'd already seen sorry employers so they've already seen employees leave since the pandemic with half citing child care as the reason hovid has laid bare and exacerbated the challenges in our child care system but as representative clark noted even before the pandemic america faced a quiet child care crisis families were struggling to afford costs if they could find child care at all with fewer than one in seven eligible children being served by federal child care programs and families particularly in rural areas struggling with a lack of care options research from center for american progress showed that over half of americans live in a child care desert or a neighborhood with an insufficient supply of licensed child care on the other hand early educators are being paid poverty wages for caring for and educating our children child care remains one of the lowest paid professions in the united states with recent data showing that over half of child care workers are enrolled in at least one public assistance or support program so the the long and short of it is that our patchwork an underfunded child care and early learning system is and was premised upon low pay for providers and unaffordable fees for families with the most severe impact shouldered by the women of color that are already navigating compounding racial and gender discrimination in the labor market in order to move forward we have to recognize that this is an issue both for families and the economy writ large a study by the century foundation and center for american progress found that without congressional action the risk of mothers leaving the labor force or reducing work hours to assume caretaking responsibilities could amount to more than 64.5 billion dollars a year and lost wages and economic activity and an additional loss of 12.2 billion in tax revenue the good news is that we know how to fix this uh we know if we conceive of child care as a public good of child care as infrastructure that we can rebuild back in a way that centers the people who've been most directly affected and that builds a sustainable system long term when i say child care is infrastructure i don't just mean the facilities i mean the people who do the work the degree to which it's affordable for parents and the choices they have for care that meets their needs i mean the quality of the early educator jobs which are essential to helping us build the supply that we need long term infrastructure holds up our economy it bridges workers and jobs and like physical infrastructure child care does those things it's a public good and with investments such as those in the child cares infrastructure act we will have immediate and long-term positive impacts on families and our economy thank you for having me oh thank you melissa and our thanks to both you personally and to the national women's law center for your partnership you have made this legislation possible and now it's my great pleasure to introduce sarah ritling the executive director of the first five years fund as executive director of the first five years fund sarah is acutely focused on the needs of children living in poverty who would benefit the most from access to high quality early childhood educational opportunities prior to joining ffyf sarah served as senior policy advisor at the education council counsel to senator lamar alexander and for the senate health education labor and pensions committee sarah holds a bachelor of arts from syracuse university and also earned her jd from syracuse university's college of law sarah thank you for joining us today oh thank you i'm just thrilled to be here and on behalf of ffyf i want to thank you congresswoman clark for your persistent leadership and commitment to improving opportunities and outcomes for kids and families and for being a true champion of child care and early learning on capitol hill especially this past year throughout the pandemic we know that access to high quality child care is an essential pillar of america's economy allowing millions of parents to go to work or attend school each day while their children are in safe nurturing environments that support their healthy development there is no lack of data that shows us just how important child care in early learn or early education is for the development of young children and for our local economies access to care has shown to improve labor productivity and economic well-being for parents who can rely on a safe environment for their children resulting in increased work hours fewer missed work days and pursuit of additional educational opportunities and research shows that mothers earn an additional 79 000 in lifetime earnings when they have access to care that allows them to work ensuring families have access has long-term impacts on our youngest learners and lays the ground for groundwork for a child's cognitive social emotional development as they enter school and has proven increased graduation rates by 14 and contribute to the academic and professional successes later in life in order to take advantage of these benefits of child care and early education congress must continue to prioritize thoughtful innovative solutions such as the child care infrastructure act which would lift up and support struggling providers to help address the core issues within the child care crisis access affordability and quality investing in safe healthy child care facilities especially in child care deserts and communities impacted by closures during the pandemic will ensure families have better access to care allowing parents to return to work or school to improve their economic circumstances it is a smart investment that will yield positive returns when more parents can return to work additionally recruiting training retaining a highly skilled child care workforce will ensure that there is no shortage of child care providers which we are seeing as a result of the pandemic and will improve the education and care of our youngest learners these policies have bipartisan support this is not an issue for just it should be an issue for every single member of congress according to our recent polling 74 percent of voters want their elected of leaders to priorities child care and early learning this year and across this political spectrum voters overwhelmingly understand the importance of care as an essential infrastructure investment which is critical as we enter this conversation with 80 percent saying to support federal funding for facilities again we're so grateful to your commitment to your championship of this issue and we we look forward to working with you and everyone here on screen and off screen um day in and day out to get this across the finish line thank you for having me oh thank you sarah thank you for your focus on our youngest learners and making sure that we are meeting their needs and finally uh last but certainly not least i'd like to introduce justin pascarello executive director of the east boston social center which is a multi-service agency serving culturally diverse families and individuals of all ages throughout greater boston including communities i represent in the massachusetts fifth district before his current position justin was the executive director of children's health watch a data collection research and policy center with the mission to improve the health and development of young children justin serves on the advisory board at the harvard kennedy schools taubman center for state and local government and received his ba mba and mpa from harvard university justin thank you for joining us here today and for your support of this bill thank you so much congresswoman club for your leadership in recognizing and highlighting the importance of this critical infrastructure we've seen the need firsthand at east boston social centers highlighted we serve people across the lifespan in the diverse communities of east boston chelsea revere and winthrop some of the places that have been very hardest hit by cobit 19 and related economic impacts we serve approximately 150 children in early education and 150 in school age programs and about 90 percent of those who we partner with receive subsidy or voucher based on family income involved in the department of children and families or other needs when i joined the organization about four years ago now we had three public housing locations where we served half of all the children in our early education and school age programs we had to move out of all three of them at approximately the same time because of public housing revitalizations and to do this i needed significant expert support as i started on this journey i knew very little about real estate and the issues related to building out facilities we ultimately had to find and update a space three purpose rooms in another and find and completely build out a third while serving children and families without disruption and staying financially stable and it ended up that a lot of this had to happen during this pandemic so we're very grateful to you congresswoman clark and to your team for recognizing this need and strategizing with us on approaches and sources of support we've also been very fortunate here in the commonwealth to have an intermediary the children's investment fund that provides technical assistance and early stage financing the legislation being introduced today recognizes the critical importance of these expert intermediaries who fill these gaps in knowledge that that we often don't have as providers to meet these needs we also have to fundraise for multiple sources and we still have to match some from our reserves but we've been very fortunate in the commonwealth to have the early education and out of school time grant program that awarded us a one million dollar grant to support a large portion of the most intensive build out it not only preserves 33 infant and toddler seats but also is expanding our capacity by an additional eight seats to meet the needs in our communities the conditioning quality of facilities have a huge impact on the health safety and development of children who spend hours each day in our programs these funds are enabling us to build the high quality facilities that our children families and educators deserve this state funding source for child care facility improvements is unique in the nation but the need remains greater than even what massachusetts can do many more programs need support in this time of crisis we're all recognizing how essential early education and care are at the same time with changes in the nature of work there will likely be vacant retail and office spaces that can be revitalized as early education and care centers to build back better requires not only investing to maintain current supply but also to build the supply to meet the true need and unleash the full potential of our workforce and our youngest learners this legislation also does more to unleash that full potential given low current pay scales that have been highlighted today many educators can't afford the out-of-pocket expenses to sustain the debt from further education we're grateful that this legislation includes debt forgiveness that will enable our teachers to build their skills and stay in this field congresswoman clark you're known for your deep understanding of the needs of the early education and care field you've worked closely with us to understand the infrastructure needs we face i am so grateful for you taking that time with us at east boston social centers and i'm thrilled that you are introducing this important legislation thank you thank you justin uh we are so proud of our partnership with you uh and and the difference that you make in our communities every single day uh with that i will turn it over to catherine alexander thank you so much uh members of the media we'd ask you to raise your hand if you have a question at this time or put it in the chat box um we will be taking questions for the conversation as well as our guest speakers and uh here we've got our first question from ella nielsen from vox media hi congresswoman thank you so much for holding this call today and thank you all for for joining um i i was wondering if you uh have talked to the biden administration or congressional leaders about where um where child care infrastructure fits into president biden's buildback better plan um and i know you know we haven't sort of seen uh details of that yet but sort of where where this fits into kind of this larger uh potential infrastructure bill um coming down the pike thank you yeah thank you ella for that question and i can tell you that one of the most exciting aspects of doing this work meeting this critical need for child care infrastructure at this point is that the biden administration understands this and has made a care agenda in particular child care one of their top priorities and we know that this administration is not only going to meet the needs of families who are in crisis right now due to the health effects of the pandemic and the devastating economic fallout but meeting them long term so this is our opportunity with a white house and a president that has made this a top commitment to follow through and build on the stabilizing funding that we were able to get in the american rescue plan and move towards permanent changes to benefit our youngest learners and their families and our economy as a whole so they understand with us that there is no recovery without this and that for our future economy as we meet this moment of racial economic and climate justice child care is at the very center of it anyone else is welcome to add in too great um with that um i don't believe we have any further media questions um but members of the press i invite you to raise your hand and correct me if i'm wrong oh here we go one second um great um we're this is karen from uh wbz tv great you should be able to hear me all right yes we can hear you oh good that smile means something um i wanted to ask about vaccine supply and the president's uh promise to um at least get every american on the list to be vaccinated by may first the governor's been very upset about vaccine supply if i recall congresswoman you um called on the governor to change the way vaccines we registered for vaccines in the state um can do you want to update your thoughts on how we're doing and how the federal government is reaching state demand the governor's been pretty critical about the deadlines being missed and not enough vaccine being available you know i think what we have seen is that uh promises made promises delivered from the biden administration about what they are doing to increase vaccine supply and uh you know what i am pleased about is that early educators were recognized as a critical group that needs to be vaccinated um along with our first responders and our our public school teachers and um you know that they are also critical uh to our recovery so we are going to continue uh working with the body administration to make sure that we are increasing the supply uh the administration has called for eligibility for the vaccine to be open to the general public by may 1st i anticipate we will see that here in massachusetts but the key is making sure that we can get vaccinations into arms and that includes our child care providers we will not be able to reopen if we cannot guarantee the safety of child care providers so um justin i i don't know if you or if any of the other panelists want to comment on the importance of vaccinations for this critical workforce it's critically important and we are really grateful that that those opportunities for vaccination are open so our staff are already being vaccinated and we're grateful to partners including neighborhood villages and others who are helping us to remove any barriers that we have i think others need this as well so we're getting support for transportation for our staff and and we've also had partners at east boston neighborhood health center boston medical center working to help educate people and and discuss any myths related to vaccinations so that our so that our staff will be able to get vaccinated yeah and i think we are going to see uh just we've already seen a marked difference in how this administration is approaching vaccinations we will continue to build on that work and i'm very confident uh that as the president set forth that by 4th of july we will hopefully have a return to normalcy and critical to that is supporting child care as a public good if we want to get back to life as we knew it um but not just back to the status quo but even more inclusive economy this bill is going to be crucial to getting there we now have a question from michelle from nbc michelle take it away not we cannot hear you michelle should be unmuted all right well i will read her question which she has sent to us um can you lay out the numbers comparing the investment uh and the return on investment is it a 10 billion dollar investment um at what point does the bill pay for itself in terms of boosting the economy oh thank you michelle that is a great question and there are so many um really hard things about child care but one thing that is easy is that the investment has such a high rate of return the estimates are from a low of we get seven dollars back for every dollar invested to a high of 14 or 15 dollars back so wherever you want to choose on that scale this investment in our children is is one that we know uh through reams and reams of data and and research is one that is not only critical to supporting families and our economy but is one that is just one of the best uh investments we can make of public dollars with the return rate that it has does anyone else want um oh nicole you go ahead i'll go after you oh great thank you you know um one of the things that uh we talk about in terms of our our work in this space is uh there's the return on investment but then there's just the dire need for uh front-end health and safety fixes right and so there are going to be returns on this in terms of improving the health and safety um and the condition of children and providers prior to the pandemic a 2015 investigation um conducted by the health and human services department inspector general found 96 of child care inspected during unannounced visits had one or more potentially hazardous conditions and non-compliance with health and safety requirements and those uh non-compliance issues weren't because providers uh didn't care or providers didn't want to improve the condition of facilities it was literally a financial barrier to addressing direct health and safety concerns and additionally there are a couple of states that are you know tackling this and have com conducted comprehensive national needs assessments and their findings have been disturbing we're talking about poor ventilation systems absence of classroom sinks no indoor gross motor skills space and equipment playground safety hazards and asbestos these are things that even prior to the covet 19 pandemic post serious health and safety concerns for providers children and families but also contributed to health costs right you know you have kids in communities that are asthmatic you have providers with multiple health conditions so we believe that this direct investment not only contributes to that quality return on investment that is attached to access to quality programming but also to basic health and safety concerns um and this is why we're very much excited about this bill and i just want to add in terms of the framing this up as a question of it's the the cost of child care right now and who is bearing it so it's not as though child care doesn't cost things it's that or cost money it's that right now those costs are being born by parents who can't afford it and by providers who are making poverty wages and if we are conceptualizing child care as a public good similar to infrastructure where you know we can't individually build a road or a bridge uh but we recognize that it is in the public good to have roads and bridges and so uh for all of us and so we pay into that uh similarly for child care um we we have made it such an individual burden and made it so difficult for both parents and providers to function in this patchwork system but in reality it's a public good that helps all of us and it's part of our critical educational infrastructure as well um and so i would note that earlier i said that um the the cost of women being pushed out of the labor force of the economy is about 64.5 billion uh according to those estimates by the center for american progress and the century foundation and so i think in addition to thinking about it in terms of the cost of action i like to think of it in terms of the cost of inaction great and our next question is from matt murphy from state house news matt you can unmute thanks catherine and thank you congresswoman for doing this call i i wanted to talk to you about vaccinations and education in massachusetts the president had called for states to make vaccines available to teachers beginning in march and governor baker complied with that beginning last week but he is continuing to to push forward with a plan to bring all elementary students back to classrooms for in-person full-time learning by april 5th and without increased supply the demand among educators is is outpacing the state's ability to put shots in arms so i'm wondering if you think vaccinations should be a requirement for a full-time return to the classroom thank you so much matt and you know part of what we are trying to do on the federal level in working with the state is in passing the american rescue plan allow them to increase the supply of vaccinations but also the funding to reopen our schools safely whether that is for hvac systems partitions ppe and an ongoing testing program that is robust for our schools and so you know we believe that that teachers and child care providers should be part of the uh essential workforce that receives vaccinations because they are essential to getting our economy reopened there have been problems with the rollout as you know i have called for a central registration system from the beginning and there were decisions made to take this to sort of scrap the plans that had been in place for years about local administration and and bring it to more mass distribution sites that were privately administered so the state legislature and their oversight committees are looking into all of that and what we are pressing for is that all of us want child care reopened all of us want schools reopen let's use this federal funding let's use an administration that is committed to this to getting this done and done safely for families for teachers and child care providers great and for a final question this is on the bipartisan nature of child care how can we convince republicans that school infrastructure such as child care facilities and school facilities are as important as roads and bridges well i think one of our best indications that we have bipartisan support is the 40 billion dollars that just was signed uh by the president uh with you know uh not a single vote but also without opposition from republicans in the senate in the house we can have another conversation about the lack of support from republicans for the rescue plan and meeting this moment for americans but it is important that this you know in every single congressional district in this country there are parents of young children who need child care and there are child care providers who need to be able to perform this critical work and be paid a living wage to do so so this is the nature of this this is not a partisan issue this is fundamental as any road or bridge to our recovery to an investment in infrastructure and that is why it has a support overwhelmingly from the business community who understands this connection and so with this bill i am hoping to build on that stabilization funding and the changing paradigm of child care that we will now finally acknowledge that it is as an essential public good and fund it as such uh we know the margins for child care providers were very thin in the best of times and this is not the best of times but let's not return to the status quo let's make the investments that are necessary to support our children to support addressing poverty in children to support families and working women and the providers who are providing this crucial early education all of this has a big step forward with this child care is infrastructure act and i am so grateful to everyone on this call and to everybody who's partnered in making it a a bill that has such broad support and will help us build the bipartisan support that we need to fund child care at the levels that are required going forward

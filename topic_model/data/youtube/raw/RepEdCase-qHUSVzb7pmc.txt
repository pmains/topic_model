spotlighting hawaii's leaders we want to bring in governor david good morning mr mayor lieutenant governor good morning thanks so much for joining us mayor derek kawakami thank you so much senator for being here spotlighting the issues where is the virus right now in our community how much is this overall going to cost the state how are you responding to the community's concerns talk about the level of citations that you guys are writing spotlight hawaii with yunji de nies and ryan kalei-suji on the digital platforms of the honolulu star advertiser well happy aloha friday thanks so much for tuning in this morning i'm ryan kalesuji joined by yunji de nies and this is spotlight hawaii uh of course there is so many news that so much news that's happening here locally but a lot of news is actually happening nationally that will impact residents right here in hawaii and today we're going to speak to somebody who's working directly on working for the people of hawaii all the way in washington d.c that's right we're joined live from the capitol with congressman ed case he's joining us from his office in washington this morning congressman thank you so much for joining us great to be with you good afternoon to law capitol hill right here um i want to talk to you you know you've spoken with us on this show throughout the pandemic and early on you talked a lot about the kind of calls your office was getting calls for help but specifically a lot about ppp uh getting funding for local businesses how has the nature of the calls for assistance that you're getting uh how has that changed and what does that tell you about the needs here in the islands well we are seeing a reduced overall number of calls having to do with covet 19 assistance um i and i think that that is uh twofold first of all i think the federal assistance which which is uh you know coming up to somewhere in the range of uh 20 billion or so to hawaii overall or more at this point actually did work did stabilize people and businesses as much as possible during that very terrible uh the heat of the pandemic um but also um you know the economy is coming back and so i think i think there's just a little bit uh more of a more of a groove to things uh we we definitely still have calls there's a lot of questions for example unemployment insurance right straight through uh was the very top uh concern of folks that were calling my office which was frustrating because i'm not in charge of unemployment insurance so that's a state issue i could i could help them and that is still a top issue but we're starting to see um a tapering off of you know assist of questions uh whether you know somebody got their direct payment or or some other assistance we're starting to see some some related kinds of assistance requests for example we are starting to see people that were backed up in terms of processing passports or immigration or wanting to bring their families here uh those things are picking up um again uh but the the direct covet 19 related calls in my office are down by about half this year in the first half of this year of course they're still up by a half over a year before that so there's still a lot of need out there one of the concerns of course that was spoken about yesterday by the governor is regarding the evictions moratorium that the governor will be lifting uh in in just a few weeks here and there is that concern of a potential wave of people that will be losing their ability to pay rent and being forced to evict the state announced a program that will help in that transition wanted to get your thoughts on what this is if this is a concern and something that you folks are working on on a national level well it absolutely is a concern it's a it's it's a very difficult uh situation i mean we've we've had an eviction moratorium in place at the federal in the state uh level uh for 16 17 months now and i think that that was necessary i think it was necessary not to kick people out of their homes if they couldn't pay their rent i think that was the right policy call by both the federal government and the state uh we did try to compensate uh landlords uh uh with uh you know assistance to landlords whether it be uh ppp assistance or direct landlord related assistance we tried to compensate renters for that matter um who if they could pay should be paying uh to to their landlords and so you know we tried to we tried to get ourselves through again uh the the the economic consequences of kobit 19 to a place where we can start to pick up the economy again but you simply can't continue a full-on eviction moratorium forever and so the question really from a policy perspective is well okay are enough people stabilized so that you can actually reinstate the normal rules but have a good enough safety net that you will be able to help and still you know catch folks that that are just not back to where they need to be at some point you need to make the call that it's time to time to dip back in that direction and i think this probably is about the right uh time to do that um i i think it's important to note also that um although sometimes people think that you know landlords are all big corporations that that can absorb these kinds of losses of income that's actually not the case many uh if not most are small businesses or families and they they have foregone their own income as they had their own mortgage obligations so this is a a chain that um that has to be unwind at some point and and i i think we've got to go back in that direction but we definitely need to make sure those safety nets are in place the federal government has certainly helped with the aid that we have sent to the state and the county governments and and and as we know uh both the state and the county governments have with that aid set up their own assistance programs to take care of those that are particularly impacted but yes it is going to be a difficult time as we as we readjust it's sort of peak season for you if you will there in washington appropriations week tell us about some of the work that you're doing right now and what hawaii can expect to to gain in fiscal year 2022 well i'm of course on the appropriations committee that is a uh the the committee in congress it's actually the oldest committee in congress uh going back to the the very early years of congress uh and we are responsible for um allocating federal funding for the year so it's a very influential and wide-reaching committee and every year we have to produce uh the federal spending for the upcoming fiscal year we do that in 12 separate bills ranging from you know defense uh to uh justice uh to housing to transportation to foreign foreign affairs and you know everywhere in between and we have been uh here in washington this week uh although the full house is not in session the appropriations committee has been meeting every day all day uh to crunch through those bills and and we just finished the last bill just about just about half an hour ago as a matter of fact it's been a full week for me here um i've certainly been trying to pursue not only programs that are of of benefit to our country and make the right decisions there but of specific benefit to hawaii across the board uh one area for example would be in in in defense of course um you know our our our defense uh presence in hawaii is not only something that i think we owe to our country but it is it is our second economic generator and in fact for the last year and a half it's been our number one economic generator to so to consider a hawaii that had both tourism go down without the backstop of defenses to consider um far more of a disaster than than we saw and so um from that perspective i've been involved for example in trying to maintain funding to improve pearl harbor naval shipyard our largest industrial uh employer which is a which is a which is a key economic driver for our hawaii um other areas would include you know native hawaiian education native plant health care certainly our business communities help to tourism transportation and the infrastructure our ports our harbors uh it's really been a week in which i not only took took a broad range of of views across the entire federal government but how could i get the federal government through the appropriations process to attend to hawaii's specific needs both specific to hawaii but also to the indo-pacific sorry about that yunji is usually one that doesn't unmute herself i unfortunately did that today we got one a show uh you know one of the areas of course that continues to struggle is the restaurant industry here in hawaii although there have been some changes on the city and county level here in honolulu that do allow for restaurants to open to full capacity with vaccination verifications and possible negative testing many restaurants choosing not to do that just because of the staff that it requires and and just the protocol so many continuing to stay with what the state has mandated for those restaurants and we're hearing a lot of those businesses continue to struggle with employment as well as just saying in business we saw a number of long-time restaurants close their doors we know that you are also working in this area as well if you can update us on some of the things that are happening in that area well of course the entire tourism industry was the most severely impacted industry in the entire country in fact the entire world because of kovit 19 for obvious reasons and when we think of tourism um we we forget uh sometimes that that's not just hotels uh that's not just uh you know um um the the activities around hotels that's everything that happens around tourism that that is our restaurants our restaurants rely primarily on our on our visitors um of course when we have local residents that are sitting home that that doesn't help things either but also our entertainment venues uh there are just uh our wedding operators there's a host of folks that that that that relate one way or the other to to to the uh to the visitor industry and um in the beginning of covid for the first a year plus we were focused primarily on general assistance federal assistance to all of small businesses regardless of whether you are a restaurant or a steel mill or whatever it was and trying to help folks out through a variety of programs but it became evident that that there were particular industries that were particularly hard hit um airlines would be an example and restaurants was a definite example and so in the american rescue plan that we passed earlier this year we set up what we referred to as a restaurant revitalization fund which was targeted assistance to our restaurants of of which as as you've already noted hawaii restaurants were particularly hard hit um and we set that up at about 28 billion dollars and we put it out there and there was tremendous uh you know the the system was overwhelmed uh right away uh to the point that um roughly uh i forgot what the figure was but just hundreds of thousands of applications of which about half were actually funded before that program ran out of money the same thing happened in in hawaii where we had about 2 000 restaurants that applied only about a thousand uh received assistance and so it was clear that we needed to plus up that program uh i'm part of an effort by a lot of the folks across the country have a similar situation to to add another 60 billion uh to that restaurant revitalization fund which is actually the shortfall that we're facing right now in estimated demand on that program so we're trying very hard to get more aid to our restaurants i want to ask you i know that it's not necessarily in the federal purview to set this policy but you know governor david ige has is holding fast to his benchmark of 70 fully vaccinated he's counting the entire population that includes children under 12 who cannot access the vaccine to get to that 70 percent uh there's been some pushback here locally against that but you know even in the comments right now there are some people who are saying the cases are going up we're not doing well so there are a lot of concerns what are your thoughts on the indoor mass mandate here in the islands and do you agree with the governor for holding fast to that 70 percent yes i do agree with the governor i think that the governor from the beginning of covet 19 has placed the public health advice the public health uh goals the public health uh mandates uh first and foremost uh and that is unlike many other parts of this country in which uh you know people started to uh you know feel that somehow they could you know beat covet 19 uh without those kinds of protections and somehow if we just you know revitalize the economy without those protections it would take care of covid19 and that was proved dead wrong in fact i think if you look back at our history in in hawaii um one would one would have to conclude that when we actually did relax our our our mandates um in the summer of 2020 um when when everybody else was saying oh this is over uh we let our guard down and we got nailed because of that and so and that was a a decision that i think was was was perhaps uh not putting the the strict public health side of it first and trying to get you know trying to get back to a normal life and and you covet doesn't allow you to do that it is a non-discriminatory disease it is as we as we know uh very adjustable uh we have variants out there right now and you cannot relax your guard on it and and so i don't really care if the rest of the country um you know feels that somehow we're being we're being too protective i frankly think the rest of the country has let has let their guard down uh too soon and we are seeing that now because we are seeing a resurgence of covet 19 across a great uh part of our country including parts that are nowhere near you know our vaccination level which is the second best in the country but even second best in the country um if you're not vaccinated from covet 19 you're at total risk when you start to to open up again and that's what we see happening right now with triple digits um in the in the last week and so i think the governor um is being cautious and i think cautious is what you have to do another concern that we're seeing here locally is just the blending of visitors that are coming to the islands we're seeing those record numbers continue to come in week after week as more visitors look to make their vacation plans and destination hawaii because of the limitations of travel both domestically and abroad and so many people coming to the islands and there seems to be this tension between local residents as well as visitors and just the capacity issue of how much our state can really accommodate all these people that are flying into the islands i wanted to get your thoughts on where we're at right now if do you think that this is something that the state needs to consider and and what other ways and mechanisms can the state uh use to control the amount of visitors that are coming into the islands i absolutely do think we have to consider this um this was this was building to a breaking point before covet 19. um you know when we got to 10 million visitors a year and went past 10 million visitors visitors a year when when when we you know you know started to just um um you know see visitors and every single aspect of our lives as opposed to being able to go back to our homes and and uh kind of you know have a home life without an illegal vacation rental next door and without a bunch of you know tour helicopters flying overhead disturbing our our our piece of our neighborhood and when we you know couldn't get into our beaches uh to our to our trails uh when when we had litter throughout hawaii when when the level of tourism got to a point see tourism in hawaii which has had a long and storied history as we all know has always depended on one thing and that is the acceptance of residents because people don't come to hawaii just for our beauty they come because they feel comfortable they feel welcome they feel that this is this is a safe place and when you when you start to lose um the support of the residents themselves that gets around and pretty soon visitors say well that's not a friendly place to go why should i go there and so we have to be very very realistic about this what happened during covet 19 was that that um a terrible pandemic gave us a glimpse of a hawaii without tourism and we all liked it and so we're reluctant to go back to a world in which we have 10 million plus tourists where we again we have illegal vacation rentals where we where we're facing all of these consequences and so i think this is a very very real discussion that we have to have that may be a sea change in a in a three generation now um you know um march uh towards uh you know highest volume tourism uh possible and i think we got to have that discussion now sometimes i hear people say ring their hands and at the state and county level and say woe is us we can't do anything about this you know people get to come here if they want well yes it's true that people can um constitutionally for the most part fly to hawaii if they want but um you know if you've got you know half of your your hotel rooms um or dwelling units um that are illegal vacation rentals and you haven't cracked down on your illegal vacation rental laws well then that's a that's a no-brainer about how to go after this uh uh because if you if you if you if you dry that up then you will have you will have higher hotel prices but that will have the effect of lower visitors and this may seem like treason to some people but i think this is the reality um you don't have to build another uh set of gates at the airport and increase airplane capacity um you don't have to um you know you can impose reasonable uh resident versus non-resident user fees at all of our attractions so we have uh tools in our toolkits that in the state you don't have to zone you know new hotels um you don't have to make it uh so easy to to renovate uh old hotels uh to to much higher density and room uh purposes so so there are things that we can do and this is a discussion we need to have because to go back to the you know um as best lawyers say this you know the status quo empty before the uh before covet 19 i don't think is going to result in a good solid tourism industry for us going forward we're going to have uh the kind of open revolts we've we've started to see against tourism you know we've been talking a lot this week in the news about possible candidates for the governor's office and your name has been floated as someone who might run wanted to get your thoughts on if that's an office that you would consider looking at is that something that you're exploring right now well you know on that one level yes of course it's tempting because there are many many challenges that hawaii faces uh that really cannot be solved at the at the federal level i mean i can help but the state and county government levels are where those decisions are made and and sure i think about uh you know taking a shot at at uh you know helping my state at that level but i think my better uh utility my best utility for hawaii where i can most help hawaii given my you know my experience and my seniority and and uh um you know my time in washington um especially as as our as our delegation goes through some transition with congressman ellie coming on although he's doing incredible in terms of his first six months um i just think my my utility my best utility for hawaii is here and so i mean i have filed my papers for for re-election the next time around and and uh you know i guess i'm at the point in my life when when i i never say absolutely not i've because i've said absolutely not before and then you know it hasn't worked out that way but but that's what i'm doing i'm i'm not a candidate for governor i'm not trying to be the governor uh i'm certainly interested in it and i certainly hope that the candidates that step forward for governor are candidates that that um that i think can can lead a change in hawaii that is needed at the state and the local level you know on the federal level we know that there are uh really these excuse me expansions of programs that are being available for families most specifically you know with some of those new aid that is being made available to those who have children with tax credits and such if you can spend some time diving a little deeper into those programs and what people from hawaii can expect to be receiving through those types of federal supports and programs that are currently being distributed uh throughout the country okay well i think you're referring to the child tax credit um under our under our federal tax laws we we provide uh uh many uh people throughout the country that that have um minor children with a with a tax credit uh to help them to raise those uh children um that tax credit it depends a little bit on what your income is above a certain income you're not eligible for the credit but uh but uh most people are eligible for the credit it's two thousand up to two thousand dollars uh per child a minor child uh um it was in in the um emergency assistance that we passed for to respond to covet 19 we we increased that child tax credit to 3 600 max per child uh this was for um the current tax year um and and and we did that because we wanted to help families throughout the country families were struggling and that was another way uh for us to to be able to help families that needed help especially families with children especially families uh like so many in hawaii uh who have to work two jobs in order to in order to in order to support themselves and their families and have to pay for things like you know child care which as we all know is uh uh cripplingly expensive uh in hawaii um and and so we we include we increased it to 3600 but we also did something else which hadn't been done before and that is that we allowed uh for half of that credit to be advanced to people in a monthly payment it used to be you had to kind of wait for the tax year to be over and then you did a look back at your got your credit at tax time now we're advancing half of that that just started yesterday um and and i think that that was warranted um i think that that will help folks and so if you think that you are in that you know category of folks that are eligible for that and uh you have any questions whatsoever about whether you're getting it it should come as a direct payment um if you have paid your taxes in past years if if you're not kind of on record with the irs already then it's a little bit like the direct payments we went through this uh you know long effort to make sure that we got payments to people in in various ways from direct deposit to bank accounts to checks to sometimes it was a lot more complicated if people were you know not filing tax returns or whatever but um uh if you have any questions about this that's one area that my office can definitely help with there are some who are saying that they should be made permanent that this you know it's just for this tax year but do you think that they should be made permanent and also there are some concerns that people who as you mentioned perhaps don't file taxes really the families who perhaps need this money the most will not be able to access it what can be done to make sure that the neediest families get this and then part two should this continue beyond this year well certainly like any any program like this when the federal government uh changes the program or updates a program uh education is everything and the effort is to um send out to as many people as possible um to everybody exactly what we've done and why we've done it and i am absolutely sure that we're going to go through a period of months in which they're going to be many many questions about this um and you know the fact of the matter is that uh the folks that need it most are often the folks that are least connected with government and so that's that's on my shoulders uh and and my colleagues here and my federal government is to pursue every effort we can to to educate people on on the availability of this program which was really no different than many of the programs uh that we had to roll out on an emergency basis over the last uh 17 months of covet 19. so we're right in the middle of that right now um you know and and just and just and just to make this point um you know uh there are there are people that legally don't file their tax returns they don't have to file their tax returns and so the question is um how do we because you know they don't have they don't have the income that requires the tax return to be to be um filed and so um you know these are folks that many times are the ones that we need to reach the most so there are many many organizations out there that are trying to get the information out our non-profits are being very very good about this uh to many many of our communities but it's like i said it's going to be a it's going to be a lift to get that word out nobody's going to lose out um if they are eligible for it they're not going to you know lose out if they if they if they if it takes a little bit of time to get get the word um but um you know the money is available right now if people are eligible and it's needed out there as to whether to make it permanent that's part of a much broader question that we are facing in in congress right now because we've we have in fact um sent out somewhere in the range of 5 trillion dollars of emergency assistance uh in the last um in the last 17 months uh all of that needed i believe all of it borrowed uh so we've we together with together with the fact that it was needed um and we did borrow it we worsened our our our federal budget uh about as severely as ever since the second world war and that has to be a consideration we have several uh programs uh that were temporary emergency programs that people now want to be continued and and of course some of them probably should be continued but from my perspective the question that i have to ask is well what are the priorities to continue them and then how do we not how do we pay for those how do we not worsen our federal budget uh even even more so to extend the current increase in the child tax credit uh 10 years would cost somewhere in the range of 600 billion dollars so if you take that against a normal federal budget of 1.5 trillion dollars which is what my appropriations committee has just been doing this week that is a lot of borrowing and or money and or increased taxes or reduced revenues in order to pay for that so it's it's not an easy policy choice it may be the right thing to do um but there are there are trade-offs all over the place that we're having to deal with right now our time is almost coming up to an end here we thank you for spending this morning with us but wanted to provide you a final opportunity any final message for the constituents and your constituents here in hawaii and a message that you may have for local residents as we head into this weekend well i think the first thing obviously is everybody knows this we're not out of covet 19 not by a long shot it's going to be with us um i will state very frontally that i believe that vaccinations are are the way forward uh we know that 98 of the people that are getting sick in hawaii right now are unvaccinated and are getting sick from people other people that are not unvaccinated but there are people that are vaccinated that are being exposed and getting sick so um i think this is where we need to go we need to keep up the good work that we've already done that is still our answer um in the in the in the uh in the midterm at least uh so that's the first thing i would say um and the second thing i would say is that that again as as it has been for 17 months of a terrible crisis my office is is completely open uh to anybody that that that does have any questions i don't care whether it's a you know i don't care whether there aren't any stupid questions i mean people say that but i i promise there are no stupid questions uh we want to help uh we're we're here to help and the best way into my office is case.house.gov case.house.gov congressman ed case joining us from his office at the capitol in washington dc thank you so much for being here this morning we really appreciate your time thank you so much for having me well we covered a broad range of topics there ryan i thought it was interesting to get his thoughts he said never say never on running for governor but right now he's filed papers for reelection for his current seat uh not completely ruling it out but probably not for now yeah saying he's not a candidate but really focused on what he's doing right now and uh also agreeing with the current governor of course governor david e is benchmark of that 70 saying uh that the state has done a good job of setting that benchmark and making sure that we are heading towards that direction rather than moving the goal post of where we need to be saying that he believes that getting everyone vaccinated to that degree is important and not lifting those mass mandates that he said well he's seeing throughout the country and of course we know that many states are now actually going to be re-implementing some of those things that they have some of those restrictions that they have loosened up so he agrees also with governor ige and where we're at with that 70 benchmark that's right and you heard him talk about the benefits that are being extended to to families with children under the age of 17 that tax credit going from 2 000 to 3 600 those direct payments started going out yesterday so make sure if you are a tax filer that you check to see if you've gotten a payment of course it can take the federal government a little while so if you didn't get it yesterday doesn't mean you're not going to get it but he did say that his office is open to take calls from families to try to assist to bridge that gap but in case you think that you're eligible for that money and you haven't received it make sure to definitely check out case.house.gov he also talked about restaurants ryan and that's a topic that we'll be exploring in more detail on monday that's right we're going to be talking with those who help to lead that industry to get their take on what's happening with some of the restaurants here in hawaii the changes that they've had to make we know that this is an industry that has had to adapt through the various tiers of the tier system as well as accommodating these large requests that are coming in for people who want to dine in and have that experience once again we're seeing these reservations that book up a month before uh it stayed and so a lot of people really wanting to get back out there but because of the limitations of capacity as well as just the overall demand on the workers we know that this is a industry that continues to struggle we're going to hear from them on monday that's right we'll be joined by the head of the restaurant association along with the head of the hawaii retailers association because retail faces a lot of the same challenges as the restaurants so we'll be speaking with those folks on monday then on wednesday uh we'll be talking to the head of the department of labor and industrial relations if you're still receiving unemployment benefits if you're recently separated from a job or if you have just questions about that program please do join us then and pereira eustacquio eustaquio is fantastic at answering all those kinds of questions so she'll be here on wednesday and then on friday and always popular guest lieutenant governor josh green so a full week ahead yeah looking forward to all those conversations we thank you for being a part of today's conversation and thank you to congressman ed case for being here as well have a great weekend we'll see you right back here on monday aloha

okay thank you for coming on since this report came out Friday you say you're not happy with what you're hearing for most congressional Republicans which you say is not much tell me what you want to hear from the other side of the aisle well let me start with a positive Senator McCain and Senator Graham both on the Armed Services Committee in the Senate taking this very seriously they want an investigation they want to look into it too many other Republicans in the House have been completely silent on it and of course the president-elect has dismissed it and the important thing here is this goes beyond our election this is what the Russians have been up to for some time and it's been well documented what they're trying to do and what Putin is true it was make the world safe for autocratic dictatorships and towards that end he is trying to undermine liberal democracies this is a major battle it's not just in the u.s. they've been implicated in the brexit vote in Great Britain in the vote in Italy that led to the fall of the government Russia is trying to undermine democracy and freedom because they think that their model of an autocratic dictatorship is the better way to go China is up to some very similar stuff this is this is sort of the defining national security struggle for us in dealing with Russia and China so I hope we get away from the politics of a Republican versus Democrat and take this seriously as a national security threat and some critics say that the report that was released to the public was thin that much more information is being kept classified the former head of the CIA told CNN he's also disappointed but that some things must be kept secret do you agree with that or do you want to see more do you think more at least absolutely I served on the Intelligence Committee directly for a couple years as ranking member and the Armed Services Committee I'm an ex officio member of the Intel committee so I've dealt a lot with the CIA and with intelligence and what they want to protect is their sources and methods they don't want to tell the world how they know and how they found out because then the bad guys in this case the Russians will know what we know and they will try to get around it next time but it's been very well documented in the press the way the Russians have used their government agencies they've used criminal organizations and hackers simply to advantage of what you know cybercrime can give them because look Russia has an economy that is that is in collapse they don't have a lot of money but this is cheap cybercrime the fake new stuff that they've done their efforts to undermine the Alliance and what mr. Trump said during the course of the election about how he didn't think that the US should be you know as invested in NATO shouldn't be you know as invested in the rest of the world was music to their ears they want to send those alliances fall apart I want to just get a reaction to what Donald Trump has said about this and what he recently tweeted when he said Julian Assange said a fourteen-year-old could have hacked Podesta why was DNC so careless also said Russians did not give him the info what is your reaction to that I mean the implication is zero the DNC sort of brought it on themselves no it's irrelevant I mean Julian Assange I mean they make a big deal at WikiLeaks about saying they make a point of not knowing where they get their information from so for him to come out and say he knows it didn't come from the Russian just makes him out to be the liar that he is and a couple days ago on Donald Trump said I don't like Julian Assange whoever implied that Assange aside I mean more about he's basically pointing at the DNC we've heard every other Republican say this that like a D&C but that's made themselves vulnerable I have big ups to be hacked that is hardly the most important point I'm sure that is true that the DNC made it easier for Putin and Russia to do what they did but for the Republicans to focus on that is ludicrous I mean this is the president elect a foreign power interfered with our country to affect the election I think that foreign powers interference is what we should focus on now I don't know that much about cyber stuff but I'll go ahead and say sure the DNC was careless but the port and the important point is what Russia is doing not just to the DNC but all around the world undermining the Alliance's that have kept peace and stability in the world for the US ever since World War two the European Union the different groups that we have formed the alliances we have Russia wants to see that crumble and I hope we can get past the partisanship look I saw your earlier guess the Democrats are always complaining because they can't get over that they lost the election well I for one am over it Donald Trump won he's the president okay I hope he does the job I hope he stops worrying about how this makes his election look and bring about what the Russians are trying to do to take away the very freedoms that so many Republicans claim to hold dear all right

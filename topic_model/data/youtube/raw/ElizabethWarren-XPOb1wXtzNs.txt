shouldn't we just tell the American consumer that no matter what we do there will be bank boom and bust cycles no matter what the laws and regulations you can't protect every now that is just wrong why look at the history I'm living history we were builders was in both drivers were going to Dutch alone my sister now from 1797 to 1933 the American banking system crashed about every 15 years in 1933 we put good reforms in place for which glass-steagall was the centerpiece and from 1933 to the early 1980s that's a 50-year period we didn't have any of that none we kept the system steady unsecured and it was only as we started deregulated you start hitting the S&L crisis and what did we do we deregulated some more and then you hit long-term capital management at the end of the 90s and what did we do as a country this country continued to deregulate more and then we hit the big crash in 2008 you are not going to defend the proposition that regulation can never work I didn't say regulation never works edited by far and away and I agree there were fewer bank failures in that time after glass-steagall increasing of the big ones zero volume in Illinois was the seventh biggest bank in it would fail 50 years to get but sooner you're on the record you're on the record say quest Eagle glass-steagall would not have prevented the financial crash all by itself that's absolutely right but what glass-steagall can do is it can wind some more of the risk out of the system it can help bring down the size of the largest banking institutions don't forget you said there was too much concentration in the banking industry in 2008 now here we are in 2013 and the big four are 30% bigger that puts too much risk back in this is another way there's other ways of shrinking them obviously with all due respect senator every report I've read every person I've spoken to says that there's a very very very slim chance at this of this even passing well let me put it this way if you don't fight for it the chances are zero and remember who my partners are in this one I've got John McCain standing with me I couldn't ask for a better fighter we've got Maria Cantwell we've got angus King we've got a Democrat a Republican and independent all people who are willing to do you know what the prospects are the house has voted 37 times to you know on Obamacare to to defund it and it I mean is this any different I mean you're making a statement but but we want Congress to do things that actually have a chance of happening and become law this seems like more the same going on but I was just going to say you know I remember going on television multiple times including here when I talked about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau when the big banks were spending more than a million dollars a day lobbying against it and when everybody told me you'll never get that thing through why are you even trying the chances of passing it are slim to none and yet look around we now have a good strong Consumer Financial Protection Bureau it's recovered a half a billion dollars for families who got cheated it's out there working on behalf of military families on behalf of seniors on behalf of students we've got that agency because we got out and fight fought for it I actually believe in

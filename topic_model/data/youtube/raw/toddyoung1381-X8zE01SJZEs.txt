Thank You chairman well I want to thank each of you for sharing your views on this important issue it's really important to people that I represent we've dealt with this issue of robo calls in the state of Indiana in a very public way for decades now in fact for a period of time I characterize this is the number one public policy issue among the Hoosiers getting what they regard as annoying calls dinnertime interrupting their daily lives still today I it's not uncommon I'll hear from Hoosiers they get I get ten calls a day from people they don't know they didn't ask for the call and and so forth so I'm I'm glad we're having this hearing mr. chairman I'm glad we're taking some action to crack down in 2018 you male it's a third-party software company they've indicated that approximately 725 million robo calls were placed to Indiana recipients now if used properly I want to acknowledge robocalls they don't have to be burdensome if you have the proper consent between parties and and all that's worked out many services utilize pre-recorded calls and they share important information with constituents and in customers but at their worst as you know they're they're criminals out there who have the ability to steal people's information to steal their resources and and to prey on unsuspecting American citizens so again I'm glad we've moved forward with the first step here with the Tres to act but we have to continue to review this issue and I look forward to working with all of you as we do that to see how we can empower regulators and if necessary consumers additionally to combat this problem constituents tell me that often times I hear they're on the National do-not-call list they're on our state's Do Not Call list and yet they still receive unsolicited phone calls and they can't figure out why that is that doesn't seem right to them as it's currently envisioned the shaken ster standards with authentic each call and allow the recipient to answer the phone with confidence however with the current use of voice traffic over the internet phone spammers can route calls through a private telephone network based here in the United States if marked as spam under these standards the operators can easily reestablish another operation so my question for the panel is how would you suggest adapting these proposed standards or national enforcement to stop private telephone network operators from setting up operations all over again to continue making making these unsolicited robo calls senator thank you for that question it's it's a very good question and I think the tray stack does two things that are going to help with that the facilitation of the interagency working group shake and stir will make finding those actors easier and faster but I really think at the end of the day the the criminal enforcement component so that when they get caught that first time they can't set up shop again because they're in a jail cell you know the only thing in senator I'd like to thank the state of Indiana because I know the attorney general's office in Indiana was has been one of the leaders among the AG's in this fight along with Missouri I shout out goes to Attorney General Carter and Attorney General Zeller in our state they were very active on this front and I know that the effort continues with their current AG AG Hill yes I would just to me the the regulations will be important and I think having the opportunity for the FCC to get the input of the states we consider to be an important effort but this acceleration of technology I think was is always going to be our challenge and that's why the industry's cooperation is going to be so important Miz Sandberg's Sanders I'm sorry I can't see your nametag yes do you have anything to add to that no sir okay

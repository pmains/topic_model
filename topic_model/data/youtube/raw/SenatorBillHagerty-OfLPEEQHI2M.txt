uh next senator hagerty thank you chairwoman club char i'd like to call up next hagarty amendment number 27. okay hagar amendment number 27. i'd like to remind everybody that what this overall bill is is an attempt by the current majority to use their current power to remain in power forever what my amendment does is prevent the current majority from changing the rules of their elections in an attempt to keep power and to avoid future competitive elections therefore my amendment is going to delay the effective date of the entire bill until july 1 of 2027 that way no one voting on this bill today will be in a position to change the rules for their own election thank you response i would just say that i don't think our democracy can afford to wait until 2027 when we see these over 350 bills that have been introduced in states across the country with now two of them having passed in in states of georgia and the state of florida with one on its way in texas and i will say in a number of the provisions in the manager amendment which we've gotten some support for certain provisions in it but not all of them we did extend deadlines just to allow for more time for implementation especially in rural areas of small jurisdictions with under 3 000 people we made some significant changes but to simply say that we're going to wait till 2027 which is a significant time away for the entire bill i think that just doesn't make sense to me uh given that joslin benson the secretary of state of michigan said that she was able to make these changes in a year the fact that we have 15 states including alaska and georgia that already have automatic registration 21 states having same-day voter registration including idaho wyoming and iowa 43 states that have early voting with the average length of 19 days 34 states requiring no excuse voting by mail in 2019 including florida and alaska and 45 did in 2020 during the pandemic 40 states have online registration including alabama florida and iowa and our point is this is clearly workable but there are some states that aren't doing these things and we all know things like um which many republicans talked to me about after the 2020 election the states waiting so long to start counting the ballots created a lot of confusion nationally in a presidential election that's one of the things that we fix something that people have reached out to me about on the other side of the aisle and i just think that we don't want to wait until 2027 to make these changes i suggest that the sense of urgency may be for a different reason madam chair and i'm going to quote a political article just that was just recently published may 3rd i quote many in the party referring to the democrat party privately worry that front-line democrats like warnock or house democrats that are vulnerable to redistricting could lose their seats in congress if congress doesn't pass this legislation i believe that's the concern here i think this is an attempt to change the rules while you have this slimmest majority and put in place a system that's going to make it much easier to hold on to that power again i'll go back to what i said earlier this is something i would expect from communist china are from venezuela's maduro that's exactly what maduro did okay so what i see is going on around the country right now is attempts to limit votes and i you know elections that i've seen in the past when a party loses a presidential election in a major way or they suddenly lose states like georgia since you brought up senator warnock they step back and they say okay what do we have to do to reach out to voters in a different way what is it about our positions on issues that caused us to lose the presidential race or how do we do a better job of communicating with voters or what should our candidates be when we put them up that's usually what parties do when they look back both on democratic and republican side in the past after an election and instead what i see here with these voter limitations and the impingement on the freedom to vote in these states it's instead looking at it the opposite way and that is saying okay a bunch of people voted in 2020 because they figured out and they made it easier for them to vote by mail or they didn't have to get notary signatures through a hospital window while they had coveted in order to get an absentee ballot or they allowed for early voting in bigger ways because it was more healthy and safer in the middle of a pandemic and so what i see now is a rolling back of those changes and to me the answer should not be let's make sure these people don't vote again the answer should be how do we reach out to people to get them on our side to vote for us so that's why i have a problem with waiting on this madam chair senator cruz i just knew you'd want to respond to that well with all respect that that was a wildly inaccurate and partisan assessment of what is occurring and i would note that this bill was drafted following the 2016 election after donald trump beat hillary clinton and senator from minnesota suggested when a party loses they reassess their positions the democratic party didn't do that the democratic party insisted for four years that hillary won and the election was stolen and it was russia that stole it and for four years we heard that over and over have been in the same electoral college room madam chairman i'm i'm speaking you voted the democratic party did not reassess any policies but instead the response to losing that election in 2016 was to introduce this bill to cause millions of illegal immigrants to be registered to vote to vote for democrats to cause felons and criminals to be registered to vote to vote for democrats and i would note that now in the 2020 election there were a number of closely competitive senate races including in the state of iowa including the state of north carolina inclu including in the state of alaska including in the state of montana that democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to win and they lost and so what does this bill try to do change the electorates and let's get a whole bunch of illegal voters to change the composition of the electorate along with a partisan federal election commission that will be counted on the chuck schumer election commission like clockwork there will be an october surprise who are the vulnerable republicans who are republicans in close races boom the chuck schumer federal election commission will announce investigations and and fines directed against them this is a brazen power grab by the democrats because you've decided democracy isn't worth it you want to fix the game so the voters don't have control over our election okay so i have so much issues with what you just said because i'm thinking back to 2016 when in fact hillary clinton conceded the election when in fact we had an electoral college i know because senator blunt and i were in charge of it and vice president then vice president biden was presiding over it and it went through we didn't object to those results then let's fast forward to the day of the insurrection to january 6 when in fact you senator cruz not all of your colleagues here today you were contesting the electoral college you were leading one of the leaders on the effort to say that the election results were not correct and so you wonder why we want to make sure that people have the right to vote well it's because of this kind of rhetoric and this kind of behavior and an insurrection at the capitol and a former president that is still maintaining that he somehow won the election when we all know it's not true and so that's why if you ask why we are still interested in protecting our democracy from that day of january 6 on i think that's your answer well chairman klobuchar this bill had nothing to do with the 2020 election because it was drafted four years earlier this bill has everything to do with democrats trying to rig the election to stay in power and to disenfranchise voters that's what this election is about and by the way hillary clinton insisted after the election she didn't lose and not only that hillary clinton advised joe biden under no circumstances should you concede so so so so the a historical rewriting of what occurred it is not accurate and rigging the system to take away the rights of voters this is designed to keep democrats in power for a hundred years and it is fundamentally corrupt and it is worth noting that when republicans had a much bigger majority than democrats have right now democrats have a six-seat majority in the house and a 50-50 slimmest possible majority in the senate we made no effort to rig the system the way democrats are doing and that is dis dishonoring the promise we made to our constituents anyone senator king madam chairman i i worked here 40 plus years ago mike mansfield was the majority leader and one of the principles that he enunciated at that time to the members and it filtered down to us on the staff was that you debate the issues not the other person's motivation and i'd like to suggest that we could elevate this discussion by talking about the provisions of the bill not who intended to do what i because i frankly senator cruz i i i don't like some of your statements because i i know what i believe and what why i'm supporting not all but many if not most of the provisions of this bill and it doesn't have anything to do with keeping democrats in power it has to do with making sure the maximum number of americans vote it certainly doesn't have anything to do with making it so illegal aliens can vote if there's a provision in here that you believe facilitates that let's talk about it but let's not attribute i'm happy to do so okay thank you okay uh should we have a vote on this amendment okay for feinstein no by proxy senator schumer and no by proxy senator warner no by proxy

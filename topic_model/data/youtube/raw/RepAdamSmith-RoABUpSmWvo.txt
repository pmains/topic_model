by the former United States ambassador to Syria Robert Ford was a fellow at the Middle East instituted washing and a professor at Yale University's Jackson Institute as well as democratic Iran Adam Smith he also judges from the state of Washington congressman let me ask you about this what is our policy towards Syria are we trying to dump the Assad family get them out of there are we trying to live with them what is it all right now Trump doesn't have a policy so we don't have a clear policy but look I think there is a policy here and that is to recognize that as long as Assad is in power there will be chaos in Syria there's no question about that he is an illegitimate ruler and that is the way most Syrians view him frankly both the extremists and Isis and the moderates who started the protest gosh five six years ago now so as long as he's in power there's going to be chaos but the trick is number one it's not easy to get him to leave and number two what comes next and that's where our policy has always fallen short this is what President Obama tried to do he tried to build up a coalition of Syrian moderates who could offer an alternative to Assad you know did the US military going in there and just taking him out would not be a good policy but it's also not a good policy for us to say that Assad is somehow okay he's very clearly not what do you mean by legitimate or not legit but if you except for Israel which has democratic elections I'm trying to forget the Baptist of the monarchist in the Middle East who has elections what is a legitimate leader in the Arab world as you see it kind of you that's how much you hated what you just said is not legitimate who is el-sissi well vadala which adult I mean are they all in gentlemen as you see it it is a very complicated question but a leader like Bashar Assad who has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own people is clearly not legitimate look there is a huge problem with governance throughout the Arab world legitimate governance that has the support of the people and respects human rights but I think we can all agree that Assad has taken that to a level way beyond any of the others in terms of the way he has systematically butchered his own people and destroyed his own country I don't know you know what you would say about the folks who haven't stepped over that line but Assad unquestionably has stepped over that line it is no longer a legitimate leader for people that he's more interested in killing that he is in leading pretty tough Lee said let me get a ambassador ambassador what do you make of this investor for dude why does he do something that the whole world hates him doing using chemical weapons I mean is he that desperate I didn't think he was I thought he was stabilizing the situation Chris he does not care about world opinion let me say that very clearly it does not care about world opinion he cares about a balance of power it's a police state and so especially with Russian and Iranian help he's winning in the civil war he's not going anywhere basically the war against Bashar al-assad is is winding down and Assad is going to stay does he have tickets for an airplane to the south of France or to Moscow he doesn't have much plan B for these guys because you think he's definitely going to stay after Willie he's going to stay he took a lepo the last major opposition-held city of the eastern part of Aleppo he took it in January and the war is winding down and oh it as much as all of us who had hoped to see Syrians gain a chance for accountable government that better respected human rights it's it's not going to happen well this is pretty pathetic anyway Secretary tillerson said just listen this first set aside state was up to the Syrian people late last month just five days before the chemical weapons were used in series anyway and then he appeared to contradict himself this our Secretary of State this past Thursday before reverting back to his original position on Sunday morning and yesterday Senator John McCain said the tiller sins original statement before the chemical attack was partially to blame for Assads behavior using the chemical weapons let's watch McCain do you think the administration did anything to encourage this behavior by the Syrians by saying that the Syrian people would determine Assad state and that removing him is not a priority things that were said before the use of chemical weapons I think it probably was partially to blame and I am and Secretary tillerson basically saying the same thing after kind of contradicting himself and then saying the same thing argues it was vigorously for a plan and a strategy well here's how secretary to us an address the question of whether his statement was responsible for embolden Assad are you worried at all that that was taken as a green light by Assad to launch that chemical attack George I don't I don't see how that could be the case you know this is not the first chemical attack launched by Assad in fact there were two other chemical attacks so this was just the latest of a series of violations ambassador what's our policy it is that the dump Assad or not we try to dump Assad or not I can't I'll be back to the Congress on that he said we don't really have a clarity there what is it policy in Syria clearly in the Trump administration as it was in the Obama administration's last several years is first and foremost to defeat the Islamic state to take its territory in Syria in the United States and it's allied forces in Syria mostly Syrian Kurds are actually making a lot of progress on that there is no particular policy now about getting rid of Bashar al-assad and we couldn't anyway Chris there are tens of thousands of Iranian and iranian-backed militias there there are Russian four to five thousand Russian soldiers are the days of thinking that we the Americans can just go in and sweep Assad out are gone it mentions restoration ministry but it's it it is what I suppose is that accepted in the hill I say I think it is I think it is unfortunately the Ambassador described a situation perfectly you know when the Russians have to be held accountable for this the Iranians have been helping Assad for a long time but Assad was actually in trouble until the Russians stepped in gave him air support gave him you know ground support stepped in and really made the difference but look the policy is is frustrating and difficult because Assad is everything that has been described as push it how do you get rid of him you know what's the cost of data grid I mean what comes next and look Assads no dummy i mean he let Isis people out of jail as as the revolution was starting because that's who he wanted to fight that's who he wanted to pit himself against but I will say that if it comes down to Assad still being in power I don't believe we can defeat Isis as long as he is out there when it has a symbol of oppression then you will have people who you know support Isis still coming into Syria to fight Assad as an illegitimate ruler so it does no clear path there's no easy path we cannot just say we accept Assad period that sends the wrong signal well okay thank you gentlemen thank you very much ambassador Robert Ford in Carson and said I'll just say the American people will not stand for that point of view it is a fact however that we have to get rid of Assad before we going to get rid of Isis but if we can't get rid of Assad we're stuck with Isis and I don't think the American people are going to that for eight more years let alone four more years anyway up next to trump resistance three special elections in three states are giving Democrat

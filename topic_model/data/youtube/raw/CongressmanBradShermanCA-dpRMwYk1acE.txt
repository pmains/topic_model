i have a couple of comments on comments made by republican colleagues first on inflation thank god democrats pushed for fuel economy standards if we were still getting the fuel that economy that i got in my 1975 plymouth fury we'd have to buy three times as much gas we'd have triple the demand uh for gasoline and so uh we would have much higher prices and we'd be buying three times as much um there are those who say we should end the conservatorship i think the gses are and should be government agencies they make money for the government and uh they give us much lower interest rates than we would have otherwise they do so because we have a government guarantee of the debt risk while the private sector assumes the interest rate risk if we didn't have fannie and freddie we would etc we would not have a 30-year fixed-rate mortgages the shareholders were wiped out in any economic sense in 2008 they do not have a right to have us at our cost rehabilitate their private banking entities and what we saw is that when you have the gscs strive for profits for private shareholders but have a full government guarantee you have socialism for the well-connected and the rich and you have a bad system uh now ms thompson you in response to one of my republican colleagues appointed asked you why you don't limit the gses to in effect lower middle class loans and you correctly responded because congress has told you to do uh really the entire middle class um and under the formulas we have a conforming loan rate of 647 000 in most of the country and 970 000 in high cost areas and that's pursuant to congressional enactment and that 970 thousand 000 loan gets you a three bedroom home in my district whereas the 647 000 get you a four bedroom or five bedroom home uh in uh in nebraska or kansas so um the question i have is why do we have higher fees on some conforming loans those in higher cost areas congress has said the that a conforming loan is a conforming loan and a high cost area conforming loan is up to 970 and the gses have decided uh conforming loan there's real conforming loan and there's not so real conforming loan and the two three bedroom houses in sherman's district will not well we'll be subject to a big fee um why are we treating all conforming loans equally let me just say that the conforming loan limit again is required by statute as you you've stated and for many of the conforming loans even for first time home buyers especially in high cost areas if they have an area median income less than 100 there is no fee and that's that's true across the board so i just wanted to say somebody with an income above average uh in nebraska gets a conforming loan and somebody in california gets a penalized conforming loan that's not what congress provided but i want to move on to another question and that is these pace loans uh in effect the agencies uh you oversee draft all the mortgages that are used in the country those mortgages contain a paragraph 4 that says you can't have a superior lien but under these pace loans you in effect do have a superior lien why aren't you requiring these gses to modify their form so as to clarify that prepare that under paragraph four you can't get around the uh requirement of turning the first mortgage into a second mortgage just by calling it uh a a a part of your property taxes why don't we amend paragraph four yeah and and uh say and uh protect the agent the uh the gses from this well certainly that's something that we can look into the the enterprises having a priority lien status is is pretty important but we can start and and under these pace loans your first is turned into a second well that's that's a requirement and again we can look into that i look forward to working with you on that and finally i hope that you would change the lending caps on multi-house on on multi-family we have a crisis the rents are too damn high and people are sleeping on the streets i yield back

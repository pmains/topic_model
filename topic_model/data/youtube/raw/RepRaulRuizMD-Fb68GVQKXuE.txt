Congress must act to help our veterans exposed to burn pits and must act now in Iraq and Afghanistan the military used burn pits to get rid of huge piles of trash exposing our men and women in uniform to toxic chemicals and carcinogens in the air and soil veterans like my constituent and my friend Jennifer Kepner a mother who died from pancreatic cancer in October 2017 that's why I urge a vote on HR 1279 the help veterans exposed to toxic burn pits Act that I support and co-sponsor this bipartisan bill will create a center of excellence within the VA that will help diagnose treat and rehabilitate veterans who were exposed veterans will be served by staff with specialty expertise needed to address the kinds of health conditions those exposed now suffer this bill also directs the VA and DOD to establish a program to train their health providers to treat veterans exposed and to study the long-term effects of exposure so I urge all of my colleagues to support this critical bill and bring it to a vote immediately to help save our veterans lives

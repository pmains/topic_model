joining me now democratic congressman jim hymes of connecticut member of the the house intelligence committee congressman let's talk about the ideal in-game here beyond just a temporary ceasefire what is it well um obviously a big setback with hamas choosing not for the second time to abide by a ceasefire you know as long as they are sending rockets over the border as long as they continue their uh you know incursions via these tunnels obviously the israelis are going to respond uh it is imperative of course that these um uh that these aggressions stop uh and then all of these we can begin to talk about them around uh around a conference table which is where this stuff needs to be to solve needs to be solved if we're not going to see the daily toll of the dead that we have been living with for now well over two weeks the new york times uh reporting that support for hamas is spreading in some parts of the region notably now in the west bank one resident telling the times quote i give my children to hamas my son who is 10 is asking how he can join these people if the shift in hamas popularity in the west bank if that shift continues what's that going to mean well it's of course moving in exactly the wrong direction and and you know you sometimes get the dispiriting feeling as you think about this conflict now you know coming on 60 years that uh the the more violence there is the more fighting there is the more people seek desperate solutions to their problems but of course that's exactly the wrong direction to go in look hamas cannot win hamas is not going to militarily defeat israel so frankly uh their continued military activity is both pointless and continues to put their own people at risk and at some peop at some point the people of gaza are going to have to understand that they are being ruled by a group of people that the rest of the world considers terrorists and that are whatever their complaints against israel and uh you know both in the west bank and in gaza there are people who have a long list of complaints against israel against israel whatever that list of complaints may be being spoken for by people that the rest of the world considers terrorists and who by their activities show themselves to be terrorists is not the way out of this mess let's let's turn to libya now uh we know that u.s officials were evacuated overnight from the embassy because of raging violence between local militias there what what more are you hearing about about all of that well um tripoli has obviously been going downhill for a couple of weeks now the central government there has no ability to insert control out of a very small area of the capital city and these militias that frankly we were helping uh when they were all sort of had their guns pointed on muammar gaddafi are now fighting each other not unlike what we are seeing in afghanistan and elsewhere and and craig you know who knows who knows when it will be safe to put our people back from tunisia into the embassy in tripoli but you know there's a larger lesson here that i hope is not lost as we think about syria as we think about iraq uh you know we were all in along with the arab league in a lot of other countries and bringing down muammar qaddafi which you know let it be known very very bad guy but we always need to be conscious about what happens the day after when a very very bad guy goes away we need to keep that in mind as we think about syria as we think about egypt as we think about iraq it sounds as if you're suggesting congressman that perhaps some of these bad guys like bashar al-assad it sounds as if you were suggesting perhaps we should not uh be so active in in trying to get them out well you know interesting question and i'm not sure i'm ready to suggest that assad is an awful human being but if you think about syria and you ask yourself the question does the u.s critical national security interests lie in uh focusing on assad who is a bad guy with no particular ambitions with respect to the united states or the west or israel or is it to focus on isis which now has about a third of the nation of syria and a good chunk of iraq the answer is kind of a no-brainer on that one our net critical national security interest is uh in in in going after isis uh look if assad is replaced by somebody better you know god bless but uh there is a cautionary note here that these countries that have been held together for strong by strong men for a very long time uh it gets an awful lot worse after they're gone we hope it goes here but before it gets better congressman jim hymes congressman thank you thanks craig

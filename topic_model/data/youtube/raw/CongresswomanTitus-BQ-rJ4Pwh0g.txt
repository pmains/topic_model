MAY CONSUME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEWOMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MS. TITUS: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF MY BILL, H.R. 5574, KNOWN AS THE TRANSLATE ACT. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE, CONGRESSMAN DAN TAYLOR OF TEXAS, FOR ONCE AGAIN JOINING ME IN INTRODUCING THIS LEGISLATION WHICH WILL EASE T.S.A. SECURITY PROCESSING AT OUR NATION'S MAJOR AIRPORTS. THE TRANSLATE ACT IS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION BUILDING UPON THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO INCREASE ACCESS FOR NONENGLISH SPEAKERS AND FOR THOSE WITH VISION AND HEARING IMPAIMPLETS AS THEY NAVIGATE THE SECURITY SCREENING PROCESS. IT DOES THIS BY DIRECTING T.S.A. TO ANALYZE COMMON LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH THAT ARE SPOKEN BY BOTH OUR INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO RESIDE IN THE NEARBY COMMUNITIES. AND THEN TO DEVELOP AND EXECUTE A PLAN TO DISSEMINATE SECURITY INFORMATION IN THOSE LANGUAGES TO EASE THE SCREENING PROCESS. I REPRESENT THE HEART OF LAS VEGAS VALLEY INCLUDING MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ONE OF THE NATION'S BUSSIEST AIRPORTS, WELCOMING PASSENGERS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. WHO COME TO ENJOY ALL THAT SOUTHERN NEVADA HAS TO OFFER. NAVIGATING OUR AIR SYSTEM CAN BE STRESSFUL ENOUGH IF YOU TRAVEL BACK AND FORTH YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. EVEN FOR THE MOST WELL-SEASONED TRAVELER. REMOVING POTENTIAL LANGUAGE BARRIERS TO EASE T.S.A. PROCESSING IS NOT ONLY BENEFICIAL FOR THOSE TRAVELERS BUT ALSO FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC RUSHING TO CATCH THEIR FLIGHT. SOUTHERN NEVADA'S COMMUNITY IS RICH IN DIVERSITY. ONE OF EVERY THREE CLARK COUNTY RESIDENTS SPEAKS A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. NATIONWIDE, THAT NUMBER IS JUST OVER ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE RESIDENTS. YET MUCH OF WHAT T.S.A. COMMUNICATES TO TRAVELERS AND TRANSPORTATION WORKERS THROUGH SIGNS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, VIDEOS, AND ONLINE COB TENT IS IN -- CONTENT IS IN ENGLISH. LET'S BE CLEAR YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MISSING A PLANE AT AN AIRPORT IN THE U.S. JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. EXCUSE ME. MAKING TRAVEL AND SECURITY INFORMATION EASIER TO UNDERSTAND FOR NONENGLISH SPEAKERS AND FOR THOSE WITH VISION AND HEARING IMPAIRMENTS WILL HELP CREATE A MORE COMFORTABLE AND EFFICIENT AIRPORT EXPERIENCE FOR RESIDENTS AND VISITORS ALIKE. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY FOR THEIR UNANIMOUS SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION LAST MONTH AND THE CHAIRMAN FOR HIS ASSISTANCE IN GETTING THIS PASSED AND URGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THE PASSAGE OF THE TRANSLATE ACT.

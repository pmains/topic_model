kevin thanks for putting this together i want to thank everybody for participating and steve thank you for for your efforts look this it's really important we look at this from an individual perspective and right now uh basically one in every four americans have over the past year have been unable to meet their own basic needs because of what's happening with energy costs we have seen a doubling of gasoline costs to refuel your vehicle we have seen a near tripling of natural gas cost which in some cases there's a little bit of a lag there in higher electricity bills but but let me go back to what i said before one in every four americans have been dealing with this false choice of of having to decide am i going to buy groceries this week am i going to fuel my car am i going to pay my electricity bill am i going to get some of these fundamental medicines that i need just to be able to sustain my life i mean these are false choices and and what's the worst thing about this is as leader mccarthy said these are unforced errors these are self-imposed crisis that this administration and that that this democrat congress has caused just yesterday in the house natural resources committee we're all well aware that this administration that this leadership in congress that they're opposed to oil and gas and as leader mccarthy said as web scalise said president biden secretary hollande have made it crystal clear from the beginning that they were opposed to oil and gas but yesterday it's not just oil and gas they're also opposed to renewable energy it is it is none of the above president obama said all the above it is none of the above under this administration just yesterday shutting down access to things like lithium graphite cobalt nickel copper critical minerals that are needed for renewable energy there's going to be a 400 to 600 increase in renewable energy graphite and lithium alone a 4 000 increase and we watched yesterday shutting down access to those minerals right here in the united states so what does that mean it means even higher prices now look so so let's look at what this administration has done whether as steve mentioned in your tripling of dependence upon russian oil that we saw uh last year under this administration it's a 6.3 percent increase in emissions as as mccarthy noted whereas under president trump we saw reduction in emissions so doubling in prices increase in emissions and and energy insecurity what are you achieving here now lastly we're watching as they come in and they say okay we're going to ban russian oil which absolutely we never should have become dependent upon it but but look at what's happened you've actually watched vladimir putin get a 50 increase he's making more money off of his oil today and guess who the primary buyer of of that oil of that energy is it's china so china is getting a discount uh on oil because of its russian oil they're getting a discount on the oil vladimir putin's making more money and it's dirtier energy i mean this is the most insane energy policy that i've ever seen in my life and i'm going to circle back one last time as i close and at the end of the day who is this impacting most it's impacting those who can least afford it it's forcing people into energy poverty as a result of unforced errors other countries would kill for the resources that we have right here in the united states would kill for the oil and gas for the coal for the resources we have we can do it cleaner we can do it safer we can do it cheaper and this administration is forcing millions of americans into poverty as a result of their flawed policies so we're looking forward to to being able to turn the corner on this and to actually play our cards right to use the the resources we have here in the united states help bring costs down help achieve energy affordability and and help ensure the the protection of the environment as we move forward

THIS MOMENT BEGAN BY SEEING HER  FATHER, A MAN RAISED IN THE JIM  CROW SOUTH, STUDY HIS OWN LAW  BOOKS. SENATOR ALEX PADILLA OF  CALIFORNIA SERVES ON THE SENATE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME. WE JUST GOT SOME SOUND IN FROM  VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WHO  PRESIDED OVER TOY'S VOTE, AND  I WANT TO YOU HEAR WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT THIS MOMENT. >> I THINK IT MAKES A VERY  IMPORTANT STATEMENT ABOUT WHO WE ASPIRE TO BE, WHO WE ARE, WHO WE BELIEVE OURSELVES TO BE. IT'S A STATEMENT ABOUT ON OUR  HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND WE  WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S GOING  TO BE FULL REPRESENTATION AND  THE FINEST AND BRIGHTEST AND THE BEST, AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED  TODAY. I'M VERY PROUD. >> YOUR PREDECESSOR IN THAT SEAT THIS IS YOUR FIRST VOTE FOR  SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. WHAT DID YOU FEEL TODAY? >> VICTOR, GOOD TO BE WITH YOU  TODAY. TODAY IS A DAY OF CELEBRATION. TREMENDOUS NEWS NOT JUST FOR,  NOW JUSTICE JACKSON, BUT FOR  AMERICA AND FOR OUR HISTORY. JUST AS WE SAY IN ELECTIONS THAT OUR DEMOCRACY WORKS BEST WHEN AS MANY AMERICAN VOICES AND  PERSPECTIVES ARE INCLUDED AND  REPRESENTED SO IT IS IN THE  JUDICIARY BRANCH OF OUR  GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND AND NOW THAT  JUSTICE JACKSON WILL BE THERE,  WE ARE CLOSER TO HAVING THAT  MORE PERFECT NATION AND BECAUSE  OF NOT JUST THE TREMENDOUS  QUALIFICATIONS AND CREDENTIALS  BUT THE MUCH-NEEDED PERSPECTIVE  AND LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT SHE  ADDS. >> WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE  PROCEEDINGS TODAY, THE VOTE HELD OPEN FOR SENATOR PAUL WHO RUSHED IN IN CASUAL CLOTHES TO CAST A  VOTE, SENATOR GRAHAM WASN'T  WEARING A TIE, REPORTEDLY, SO  HAD TO VOTE FROM THE CLOAKROOM. WHILE DEMOCRATS WERE CHEERING,  REPUBLICANS SILENTLY FILING OUT  QUICKLY. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT? >> YEAH, AS SENATOR BOOKER, I  AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, SAID AT THE END OF THE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, WE'RE NOT  GOING TO LET ANYONE STEAL OUR  JOY BECAUSE THIS IS A MOMENT  THAT SHOULD BE CELEBRATED. THE NOMINATION OF NOW JUSTICE  JACKSON WAS HISTORIC. THE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, LOOK, I'M GLAD MOST MEMBERS OF THE  COMMITTEE, ALL THE DEMOCRATS FOR SURE AND EVEN SOME REPUBLICANS,  CAME TO THE COMMITTEE WITH  APPROPRIATE, THOUGHTFUL  QUESTIONS ABOUT JUDICIAL  PHILOSOPHY AND THE LAW. SADLY SOME MEMBERS CAME IN WITH  BASELESS ATTACKS SEEKING TO  UNDERMINE A MORE THAN QUALIFIED  NOMINEE AND THE ANTICS WE SAW  TODAY FROM SENATORS PAUL RAND,  WERE DISRESPECTFUL TO THE  PROCESS, TO JUSTICE JACKSON, AND DISRESPECTFUL TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. THAT NOTWITHSTANDING, WE WILL  NOT LET ANYONE STEAL OUR JOY. I WILL ALSO ADD THIS, VICTOR, AS THIS CONFIRMATION IS DONE,  PEOPLE ARE NATURALLY LOOKING  AHEAD. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT  VACANCY ON THE SUPREME COURT  WILL BE OR WHAT THE NEXT  CONFIRMATION PROCESS WILL LOOK  LIKE. BUT TO ME IT'S A REMINDER OF THE STAKES OF THESE MIDTERM  ELECTIONS. WHEN SENATOR GRAHAM SAYS SOMEONE LIKE JUSTICE JACKSON WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN A HEARING IN  JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OR WILL NOT  IF REPUBLICANS RESUME THE  MAJORITY, THAT'S TELLING, RIGHT? THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY  COMMITTEE IS TO DEEM THE  QUALIFICATIONS NOT TO BE BIASED. IT'S SENATOR GRAHAM AND  REPUBLICANS THAT ARE FURTHER  POLITICIZING THE PROCESS OF  SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS AND  CONFIRMATIONS, AND THE VOTERS  WILL HAVE A SAY INTO WHETHER OR  NOT TO ALLOW THAT THIS FALL.  >> WE HEARD SOMETHING SIMILAR  FROM MITCH McCONNELL THAT HE  WON'T TALK ABOUT THE STRATEGY IF REPUBLICANS GET CONTROL OF THE  SENATE AND THERE'S A NOMINEE  FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IN '23 OR  '24. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ANOTHER  TOPIC, TITLE 42, THE PUBLIC  HEALTH ORDER THAT THE WHITE  HOUSE DETERMINED WILL BE LIFTED  IN ABOUT SEVEN WEEKS USED TO,  THUS FAR, KEEP 1.7 MILLION  MIGRANTS OUT OF THE U.S. WHO ARE SEEKING ASYLUM FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER MOSTLY. THERE ARE AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN  DEMOCRATS WHO BELIEVE THAT THE  PRESIDENT -- OR TRYING TO BLOCK  THE PRESIDENT'S LIFTING OF THAT  ORDER UNTIL AT LEAST THE PUBLIC  HEALTH EMERGENCY IS LIFTED OR  THERE IS A PLAN TO STOP THE  EXPECTED SURGE OF MIGRATION  ACROSS THE BORDER. WHY NOT WAIT UNTIL THAT POINT? >> A COUPLE THINGS, VICTOR. NUMBER ONE, LET'S ALL REMEMBER  WHAT TITLE 42 IS. TITLE 42 IS NOT IMMIGRATION  POLICY. AND I THINK WE ALL ARE REMINDED  OF THAT. IT IS LONG PASTIME TO MODERNIZE  IMMIGRATION LAWS. IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER  BECAUSE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND WE SEE WHAT'S GOING ON  ACROSS THE COUNTRY. RESTRICTIONS ARE COMING DOWN,  VACCINES ARE UP, CASE COUNTS ARE DECLINING. WE'RE LOSING OUR MASKS. IF THE JUSTIFICATIONS ARE NO  LONGER THERE, THEN I THINK WHAT  THE PRESIDENT IS SEEK TO GO DO  IS A POWER PLAY, AND THAT BEING  SAID, WHAT WE DO WANT TO INSIST  ON IS A SAFE, ORDERLY AND HUMANE PROCESS WHEN IT COMES TO  IMMIGRATION LAWS AND IMMIGRATION PROCESSING. IT IS NOT ILLEGAL. IT IS ABSOLUTELY LAWFUL FOR  SOMEONE FLEEING PERSECUTION,  FLEEING VIOLENCE, FLEEING  NATURAL DISASTERS TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES SEEKING ASYLUM. WE NEED TO HAVE A PROCESS IN  PLACE TO CONSIDER THOSE  REQUESTS. AND SO THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS  THAT WE ARE ASKING. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE  HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE  ASKING QUESTIONS OF SECRETARY  MAYORKAS MAYORKAS. >> WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOME  BORDER STATE DEMOCRATS WHO  BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE  SOME CAUTION PLACED TO

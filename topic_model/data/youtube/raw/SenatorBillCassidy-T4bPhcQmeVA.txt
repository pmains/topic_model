with that i will turn it over to senator cassidy for his opening remarks thank you madam chair and i thank ranking member burr who allows me to lead this meeting as a physician i took care of patients with addiction but it doesn't take a physician taking care of those with addiction to know that we have a fentanyl crisis everyone here and everyone watching knows of someone who has died or who has suffered from addiction related to opioids if you read of a young person who dies the teenager or in college most often it is related to a drug overdose and you think about the tragedy of that child whose whole future was before she or he and now it has ended affecting not just their life but all those generations that would come after them from that wonderful person it is incumbent upon us to address this issue now the statistics fentanyl is killing over 200 americans a day in 2021 we saw the largest annual increase in opioid deaths in 50 years in the 35 years between 1979 and 2016 600 000 americans died to overdose and a hundred thousand died last year i'll speak of my own state louisiana's drug overdose deaths hit a record high of 2100 in the 12 months leading up to march of 21. overdose mortality increased statewide by over 56 percent from 2020 to 2021. new orleans was up 51 in 2020 with 365 overdose deaths jefferson parish up 69 percent st tammany up 35 and saint bernard up 64 percent and we know the cause of this it is fentanyl illegal fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances are flooding into our market from our southern border in unprecedented amounts with the bulk of this ultimately originating from a handful of manufacturers in wuhan china fentanyl accounted for 64 of the hundred thousand overdose deaths last year two out of every three people who die from opioids it is from fentanyl or fentanyl-like drugs now congress has to continue to pass tools to fight this from multiple fronts first we need to make the classification of fentanyl analogs as schedule 1 drugs permanent several my colleagues and i introduced the halt lethal trafficking of fentanyl act last year to do just that secondly we need to educate americans just how deadly fentanyl is two milligrams is enough to kill someone i was proud to join senator marshall and other doctors in the congress to record a psa informing americans about the risk of fentanyl health experts and public officials need to continue such efforts thirdly the border last year the dea seized 20 million fake pills and 50 000 pounds of fentanyl enough for 400 and 440 million lethal doses when i went to the border i saw this big cage of illegal drugs i said how much do you think you're getting they think we probably think we're getting about a third of it so if we seize this much that much more went through we have to recognize that a policy at the border which has been feckless and ineffective as this administration has had not just allows people to come here who are not who are illegal illegal immigrants it allows drugs to come across as well we've got to control that border if there's a message i wish the administration to get use your tools to control fourth we need to combat the drug cartel's ability to finance the production and smuggling of illicit fentanyl into the united states selling synthetic opioids laced with fentanyl is a major source of revenue for cartels drugs assuming gangs criminal organizations and for organizations such as hezbollah they use a financial process including one known as trade based money laundering to disguise their activities and illegally move this country in and out of the country it is a use of financial exchanges that look like legitimate trade to serve as cover for illicit flows of money if we can stop the financing of the drug trade we can stop the trade of drugs finally we need to look at loopholes in our custom system for example cartels will ship chinese-made fentanyl into our country by mail claiming the contents of the package is worth less than eight hundred dollars which is the threshold for paying tariffs because it's declared as less than 800 customs and border protection does not inspect the package and it passes through it is a glaring loophole in our custom system i look forward to discussing these solutions and more in today's hearing congress failing to address this crisis threatens our national security and risk the safety of the individual who does not know that one pill laced with fentanyl can kill which means that there will be one more obituary of an 18 year old child whose life has gone forever with that i yield

we got pretty much blindsided by the fact that they were closing this facility congressman mark wayne mullen along with senators inhofe and langford sent a letter to the va asking them to reconsider closure of the clinic the reason why va was was cho or venita was chosen by the va was the concentrated amount of veterans that are located within that area and and now we're just we're literally leaving them behind and going to make them travel an hour to go to the va clinic i have no vehicle veteran ty marvin driving home the dilemma of just how much of a headache closure of the venita location would be it's easy for me to ask a friend hey can you run me 20 miles over here i don't want to go to one of my friends say hey can you take me an hour to tulsa next week a town hall will be held at the american legion in veneta to talk about the issue with an underlying hope that the closure can be averted i'm hoping they can find a way to fund vanita and keep it open at this point we would love to keep it there but at this point i think that i think the the train is too far down the tracks and congressman mullen says even if the va provides a shuttle service does going to the va suddenly become a full-day affair we reached out to the v.a but have yet to hear back

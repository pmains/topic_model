[Music] hi I'm senator Tammy Duckworth and I'm in Wheaton Illinois today campaigning for Sean Caston Sean will bring a fact-based approach to policymaking and serve as an independent check on Donald Trump Sean will also work to increase access to affordable quality health care I know from personal experience that everyone is just one injury or accident away from having a pre-existing condition which is why we need to replace congressmen like Peter Roskam who voted to take away those four very protections and kick tens of thousands of Illinoisans out of health care we also need more representatives like Sean who support tax reform that helps small businesses in the middle class unlike Peter Roskam who authored a tax giveaway to the big corporations and the wealthy and left everyone else with two trillion dollars in debt early voting is now open and I encourage all Illinoisans to get out and vote to elect Sean cast into Congress if you want to learn more about Sean's policies or to sign up and volunteer go to Kasten for congress.com [Music] [Music]

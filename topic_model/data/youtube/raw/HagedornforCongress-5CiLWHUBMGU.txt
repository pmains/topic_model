hosting us uh thank you to mr hagedorn for uh for willing to stand up and express ideas in this democracy and most importantly thank you to each of you uh there's certainly a lot of places you could be you could have chosen to go on elsewhere but you came here and you came here for one very simple and eloquent reason you love this country and you understand that with all of the rights and privileges and freedom come immense responsibility and chief among those is participating in this democracy this grand experiment that was started the idea that common men and women could govern themselves they could step forward and conform this more towards a more perfect union uh was simply something that was so unheard of and challenged the thoughts of so many and as winston churchill pointed out he said this about democracy democracy is the worst form of government except for every other one he understood that it took work he understood that it took that compromise compromise compromise when madison left the first constitutional convention that's what he said people here in minnesota know that they know this is about having the grand vision they know 150 years ago and the mayo brothers showed up on the prairie that there could be something better something different something more hopeful and we've continued to do that and continue to do it with our neighbors we've not always agreed on every issue but we've certainly moved this country forward and in southern minnesota that's about finding solutions it's not good enough to point out the problems what you need is a solution what do we do with our transportation how do we build coalitions to make sure that goods and services and people move as efficiently as possible how do we get a farm bill that makes sure that this part of the world that not only feeds us and feeds america it feeds the world and so when president kennedy was asked about going to the moon he said we don't go to the moon because it's easy we go because it's hard america has challenges but in those challenges lie opportunities so i want to thank each of you for being here and i want to earn the opportunity to give that voice to that hope and dreams thank you thank you well thank you it's a pleasure to be here congressman walsh thank you for your service not only in the u.s house of representatives but also in the united states national guard my friends i appreciate this opportunity just a couple of brief moments about myself my background i'm a product of southern minnesota born in the city of newark minnesota where i reside today i was raised on a green livestock park just outside the town of truman my father tom aguirre grandfather and great grandfather all minnesota farmers and it's that perspective that i would take to the congress to sustain family farming in our rural way of life i also have experience that will help me make an immediate impact in the house of representatives having worked for united states congressman arlen stangwood and also been a congressional relations officer for two treasury bureaus during which i know bills through the congress have a little bit of an understanding of how the place functions and dysfunctions and i can do a good job on your behalf now the reason i'm running for congress is because i believe that our country's in trouble these are critical times and i believe our own government is causing us the problems the big government problems of washington dc just the other day president obama said that his policies are on the ballot this november i agree with him the man standing to my right voted for every last one of those big government policies including obamacare cap and trade trillions in deficit spending the border chaos i'm running for a different reason i think the liberal politics out there in washington is getting us in trouble and what we have to do is go out there and attack that place attack it this way take the power from washington and bring it back to the states and the people solutions that i subscribe to repeal and replace obamacare any energy and independence based upon drilling for fossil fuels securing our borders if we take the power from washington you will be empowered thank you we will now begin with questions the first question will come from the league of women voters and mr hegler will answer the question first how much do party physicians influence your opinion on your on issues well i have a track record in my name always standing up to to my party even even when i thought you know probably wasn't going to do me much good and recently i ran in the primary and some people were upset with me but i thought it was the right thing to do but uh you know some of the problems that we have in this country today for instance obamacare that bill is hurting southern minnesotans it's hurting our country it's hurting our economy and i don't just blame the democrats i don't just blame congressman walls for having voted for that bill republicans held the house of senate the white house in the early part of the century we didn't make the types of reforms that were needed what happened then is we had a big vacuum on that issue and the democrats filled it with a bill that i think is misguided we need to do better and i would stand up to my party in power when they're wrong thank you mr wallace could i ask you to repeat the question yes how much do party positions influence your opinion on an issue i think all of us as we move through life and we work in either work situations or family situations my wife quinn is here tonight i think of how often uh you're sitting next to loved ones here tonight how often do you agree 100 with the person next to you what you do is you find compromise for common goals to try and carve out a better life or a better home for your family the same thing is true of this country you certainly have issues where you have commonalities with others and then there's other issues where you disagree i think what most of you are feeling and the frustration and the angst you feel is is that the the blind adherence to rigid party politics it's that type of thinking that shut down the government because if i can't have my way i'll have nothing it's stalled the farm bill for 18 months when we know that that's a good piece of legislation it involves compromise and willing to do it and i think for me uh what predicates first and foremost is what's right for the constituency and what's right for the conscience of the constituency and myself but in the house of representatives you are not uh you are not the chief executive you are part of an elected body that you need to get 217 of your colleagues to join with you just to move a piece of legislation so i think i've proven that i think endorsements that span from farm to world to nature conservancy to the firefighters to teachers to others shows that i can build a coalition i can hold a coalition together to make sure highway 14 gets done make sure we bring a veterans cemetery to preston and do it in a manner that's respectful to my colleagues when i disagree with them i don't disagree because they're republican or democrat i disagree when i think they're wrong and it's my responsibility to articulate that vision and i think i've done that in a manner that it's been a positive reflection upon you and this history thank you well i think when you look at what's going on in washington we've got a lot of problems in this country and they're not always because we have too much partisanship well we did have some partisanship four years ago and they voted for obamacare and capital energy and things like that all the spending that was on the democrat side now but i think there's another issue in washington and that is people in washington going along and getting along just to make washington work what's happening we get these big government things on both sides we have veterans issues that the republicans are are complicit in and so i think we need to take a look and send people to washington that are going to go there and fight both teams when they're wrong thank you mr wilson i come down on the side of madison and jefferson compromise compromise compromise for a better future and a better future for all of us and that's the nature you see it you know what the dysfunction is and you'll hear more of it the blaming i'm not interested in the blaming i'm interested in helping take responsibility to move things forward and i have proven that when it comes time to put conference committees together uh republican and democrats ask that we'd be on there and i think that gives you a strong voice and you saw those reflections both in the farm bill in some ethics reform in the stock act and then moving forward to fix for our veterans what needs to be done thank you our next question comes from abc news well there are a lot of critical issues facing our country right now there are some of the folks who i talked to researching both of you and the thing that came into perspective for me was when we get right down to the fundamentals and that is is the constitution what you believe is it a flexible or inflexible document well first of all i think for many of us here it's the place that you carry with you often and it's a document that was crafted at the time when you think about coming out of the enlightenment think about the totalitarian regimes of europe of the spirit of man the idea of what individual freedoms would be and it was written as a protection it's certainly a document that was in its genius crafted in a manner that would anticipate and let us move forward on things like uh personal uh personal freedoms from encroachment and looking at now what happens when you have people who can listen in on your cell phones and do things like that and the constitution over the ages has changed it's been amended it was amended almost immediately after his first traffic so it's a document that's a reflection of our values it's a protection of our personal freedoms but its genius was that it could adapt to modern age it could adapt to technology it could adapt to things but it always kept our core principles at heart it always kept those fundamental things there and i think that requires us as i said you came here tonight because you understand we have a responsibility you can't just fall back on and say it they were very clear towards a more perfect union and we will not rest until we continue to move towards that more perfect union so as the document was crafted in the first place it excluded large numbers of americans it excluded minorities it excluded women we fixed that and moved forward always keeping it hard basic personal freedoms and the idea that adjust and govern society is the one that will move the human spirit forward thank you thank you mr hegar well i've been running for office for just about a year out here meeting the folks and what i tell them about my solutions to the problems that we have in washington dc is that we need to get back to the things that work limited government free enterprise and the rule of law when you ask about the constitution and you have to look at are we following the rule of law in this country we have a president who has been very lawless in the way he has executed his duties i'd say he's been extra constitutional in many areas when a president just decides by executive fiat that we're no longer going to deport people in this country because he doesn't think it's the right thing to do and the congress just wouldn't go along with him that's lawlessness that's not following the constitution of the united states and it needs to stop and you need somebody in washington that will fight him on that every step of the way the congressman go on get along guy with him on that not me when it comes to the other things like excessive regulation the president and his epa and other agencies going out of their way to reinterpret statutes that the congress passed sometimes 20 30 years ago to decide for instance that now well the epa should have the right to regulate waters of the united states so every farmer in this district would have to worry when's the epa going to show up and shut me down and harass me or find me those are the types of things going outside the constitution trying to use these powers that i think are wrong and we need a congress person that's gonna step up there and fight for you thank you mr wallstrom response i've taken two oath to the constitution in my life when i did when i signed up for the united states military at one when i uh stood up to be the representative of this first district uh i'll continue to uh to do that because it's very clear that we the people and uh and with that i uh i yield back my time for the response our next question is going to come from the post bulletin and we'll go first mr hagar what measures are needed to protect protect social security for today's seniors while also strengthening it for future generations well social security is not unfortunately a trajectory to bankruptcy this country is going right along with it the biggest problem that we have in the country is that we have no economic growth we have an economy that's very stagnant and we have pockets that are doing okay but if we don't have revenues created in order to sustain these programs we're just going to run out of cash at some point now i think we have to have some outside the box thinking on social security and some of the other programs like medicaid and medicare but the first thing that has to happen is the scare tactics need to stop every time you bring something out you have an idea about how to fix the program what happens well the other one team or another starts carting out advertisements saying that you're gonna you're gonna bankrupt granny or whatever so uh as far as social security is concerned the trajectory is wrong but the economy needs to grow now in order to make the economy grow to have more revenue you have to get back to what works folks giving businesses and farmers and others the opportunity to go out and do their things with some certainty we'll talk about that a little bit later but right now the tax policy makes things uncertain the economy in general makes things uncertain you have regulatory policies being inflicted on farmers and small businesses and others that they conserve and then you go down the line uh with the other policies like obamacare that's driving up costs people don't know what their bottom line is going to be on energy so these are the types of things that need to be done in order to firm up our social programs thank you mr wells well social security is the single greatest anti-poverty program probably any country has revised uh it has kept literally millions of seniors out of poverty has raised the quality of life and it's allowed people to retire with dignity uh it's a program that was devised in again at a time of great uncertainty during the time of the great depression and we've just seen what happens as we came out of bad policies that put us down the road and put this uh the financial and fiscal health of this country and families at risk by risking practices that that said the folks on wall street they know best they'll make the decisions uh the markets will work but markets are are are a moral they don't care if someone goes hungry they will operate as they operate one of the things with social security they did was we gave it a guarantee so that wouldn't happen and social security is not driving the deficit social security is not bankrupt social security some of the fixes are fairly easy to do on this one of the things is i've never understood this i don't understand why the withholding doesn't go up to what members of congress make and set it at that if you took the withholding to go up to what the salary of a member of congress is social security is solving for over 70 years so the fix is there uh we can we can handle but the thing is is that you're not going to get to that if the partisan bickering stops us if it stops us from sitting down and reaching some of these compromises because it makes good sense it helps the economy see you spend that money back into the economy the real issue is addressing and strengthening medicare and those issues that we started moving in the right direction stressing the medicare uh trust fund the longevity of that those are the things we have to do but they're going to have to be done if you think you're going to do it by blowing up the place and using this position as a talk radio show it won't work and social security is fixable and we'll do it thank you mr higgins well you know the thing that's put social security at risk more than anything is that the congress has been spending the social security trust fund monies for decades and now they've been running on a tap of over 17 and a half trillion dollars in debt and folks when that unravels unfortunately when we get to a point where the interest rates go up and we can't afford it what's going to happen is the people on fixed incomes are going to be the ones hurt the most the folks on social security they're disabled and others and that's what i'm i'm concerned about we need strong fiscal policies to get back to what works in this country thank you our next question comes from the chamber of commerce does the federal government need to play a prominent financial role in maintaining expanded transportation infrastructure in the united states we'll begin with mr walls yes and transportation again it's in the constitutions and the first paragraphs maintaining of the post roads and infrastructure uh is certainly an article one congressional responsibility and the united states when we expanded in one of the most uh again looking back to it the genius of it if you go back and look at the naysayers when president eisenhower understood how critical it was both for national security and for economic growth to expand the interstate highway system what he understood is that investment would come back 10 fold over we've neglected that our roads and bridges it's a challenge and i'm glad today and i congratulate i see i saw tina liebling here today that the state of minnesota has done the corridors of commerce to up the the infrastructure on highway 14. it's building those things these are investments if you have someone who says we should go and cut all spending if you cut every penny for transportation in this country you didn't spend any this year you would add 107 billion dollars to the taxpayers that they would cost in idling and ups fees and shipping fees when i was with ups the other day these are companies that understand investments in infrastructure both federal state and local are the growth engines that allow this economy to be able to prosper it allows for safety and it allows for our communities to continue to grow in a smart fashion and so there is a role in this uh we've always been there when we've done it right and we've been partners with the with the states and with the local entities we've created infrastructure that is and can once again be the envy of the world so yes there's certainly a role thank you mr higginer well of course there's a role it's very important i think every farmer when they take their crops to market and every business when they're trying to send out products and so forth realizes just how important it is i i'd say that you know i travel quite a bit campaigning between new home and mankato highway 14 is very dangerous highway 14 should be there should be more traffic on that road but frankly a lot of businesses coming out involved avoid it because it's a problem i'd say that after eight years in office the congressman should be a little bit ashamed that that project hasn't been completed yet you're gonna send people to washington folks we need to get those things done in a grander scale though i believe this i think that the monies in washington dc dc for transportation should be sent back to the states in order to have the governors and the legislatures decide how those monies are spent best whether you want rail projects or road projects or bridge projects or whatever rather than having presidents of the united states fly in a saint paul and tell you how they're going to hand out cookies and these things and have politicians and bureaucrats in washington d.c decide who gets to spend the money and how it works i mean you see that in in states like west virginia where you had very powerful chairman or pennsylvania their roads and bridges are wonderful the rest of the states are murdered so i'd rather have the money sent back to the state of minnesota and let our elected officials decide here thank you mr ross for the response i'd just like to uh make sure i point out and thank that uh the coalition building on highway 14 with the mayors with the city councils the county commissioners the state and federal uh folks i'm proud of what we've done together i i for one am grateful for that and we've certainly moved that project forward and i think that's what people expect it's been done in a bipartisan manner and it's been done in a fiscally responsible manner and i said i think that's what you're asking for and commerce is showing there's a reason that forbes magazine highlighted southern minnesota and the cities of mankato and rochester as being some of the highest growth areas in the country that's because of smart decisions that was made by those mayors so thank you thank you mr hagan we'll begin with questions from the audience now the first question is regarding um jobs what is the role of the and this will go first uh to mr hegedorn what is the role of the federal government in increasing the number of private sector jobs and what could be done about the stagnation of the middle class incomes over the past generation well the responsibility of the federal government in this area is to foster an environment that's conducive to economic growth and opportunity what's been going on in washington d.c particularly these last six years under president obama and congressman walls just the opposite they're loading up the private sector with all sorts of responsibilities and new fees and new bills and regulations that are bogging them down and making it impossible for a lot of businesses to get capital and get started and expand i spoke with a young lady in albert lee campaigning on main street and she gave an example of just what's going on in this area she said her name is dawn and she worked as a shopkeeper there and she said that because of obamacare she lost her primary job went from full-time to part-time and then she had to pick up another part-time job in order to make up the money but that didn't work now she's working more hours with less money and then her health insurance rates went up on top of that and so she said here i am working more hours for less money and it's all because of a bill that the congressman voted for and president obama had to have that said that if you had more than 50 employees well then you're going to be covered under obamacare and you have business after business blocking people off and send them in in a part-time work because of that our economy is in trouble we have record welfare i mean it's just a mess and so uh we need new policies that are going to turn this around in washington d.c thank you mr wilson can i ask you to repeat yes what is the role of the federal government in increasing the number of private sector jobs and what could be done about the stagnation of middle class incomes over the past generation yeah i think like markets are wonderful things and they they do incredible things they spur on competition they spur on innovation one of the things is that what we've seen is is that markets can be distorted they can be distorted again by by excessive uh interventions when those happen uh and it shouldn't happen and they also can be uh distorted by monopolies where there's not a fair and and uh an arbitrator a referee on the field so markets can only be free markets if they're fair the role of federal government is to make sure unlike what we did prior to 2008 where the sector on wall street took and risked this nation's future making hedging bets and loans which they should have never done as it undermined the system it undermined the wealth of the middle class and so you're right as the recovery comes back you see here in rochester at 3.9 unemployment job growth coming back in some of those i i do feel this and i see it amongst folks that there is a frustration amongst the middle class because what they've seen is that wagers and american workers are the most productive in the world hour by hour minute by minute american workers outproduce anybody else in the world but what we've seen over the last 30 years an erosion of a value of that work we've seen ceo pay go from 40 times what an average worker makes to 600 times what an average worker makes so the wealth is there it simply has moved in a direction that doesn't value the the working person so what i think is is let's just have the conversation about where and who is creating the jobs who is getting things done and i think what most of us understand is the economy comes back best and a true job creator is a middle-class person with disposable income in their pocket and that's something that i think here in southern minnesota we're starting to find is he's going in the right direction thank you that all sounds good congressman but every one of your policies in washington dc is exactly backwards from that you pass these big bills like obamacare you increase energy costs on people you pass dodd-frank that restricts the capital you put these ridiculous regulations on people from the federal government and then you have a tax policy that's so complicated nobody can figure out and you have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in this country just to comply those are the types of things that need to be changed in washington in order to help small business and others be in a position to create jobs be innovative and to expand our economy thank you mr wells for response and i made a raid yesterday i'll go back uh our next question from the audience will begin with mr walls from jobs and making money to the taxes we all pay with recent attention to tax inversions what are your priorities when it comes to tax reform uh we need and this is one where it's going to take the courage to stand up there it's absolutely it's it's not an epiphany to say that the tax code is complex i'm sure there's tax repairs in here would certainly tell you that every year i try and introduce a bill to get no support board that all members of congress should do their own taxes because it's a good way to find out if it's too complex for you to do it one of the issues here is is that we have people and the tax credits continue to get more and more complex we need to get away from this issue and i don't know when i mentioned this thing about the ceos or whatever i think a company should have the right to pay their ceo what they want if they choose and they think they're worth 60 million dollars pam but pay them on friday at a paycheck and withhold withholding exactly like we do don't use the tax system to figure out deferred compensation where you pay less than the person is actually doing the work so when it comes to these type of things i'd be the first to tell you this i think the way you get rid of the taxing version is you have massive and full comprehensive tax reform get rid of the corporate tax it doesn't raise that much money and i think it's certainly a disincentive to that but if you do that keep in mind that you're going to have to understand to make the tax system fair for those workers who are who are earning and making those companies go in the direction they've gone so i think that's not that difficult to fix i think most americans and most people in southern minnesota they're willing to pay their taxes as long as they're fair and other people are paying theirs and it goes to something that they see a value in whether it's investing in infrastructure education research for nih and those types of things so i'm important and again if you think you're going to get tax reform by blaming the other side on everything it's not going to happen we need it we need to come together and i'm going to say it again i know madison is happy with the compromise compromise compromise thank you mr hegar i'm not going to blame just the other side on the tax complicated tax system i may look at since president bush actually since president reagan reformed it back in the in the 80s with the democratic progress has just gotten muddled up got worse and worse it's both presidents it's both parties it doesn't seem to matter who's out there i'm just saying they have to come to grips and and fight for these things and so it can be both partners now what's my plan i want a flat tax with very few deductions or consumption tax or something that's going to attack the irs make them less powerful in your life and put you in a position to hold save invest your money the way you want not the way the washington politicians and the washington bureaucrats tell you to because the tax code is used every day by the lobbyists and others who go up to the members of congress and they want their special deal and i understand that it's a complicated process but what why don't we ever change it well because some of the people who are in his positions of responsibility on the ways and means committee and others both parties they like the attention they like the pac-man they like the power and i'm i'm one of those people that wants to go to washington and stop all that fight washington d.c and both parties and that's what i stand for thank you do you have a response mr ross uh no i yield back and you're finished yes sir our next question um from the audience what can be done to prevent issues like the problems of the va mr hannah well again i think the va is another situation where we have it's it's it's very unfortunate what's been going on i think both parties again washington dc has let us down this hasn't this been going on for quite some time we need some outside the box thinking as it applies to veterans and their care now here's the situation my opponent mr waltz congressman walsh has been on the committee for eight years he's been working hand in hand with president president obama on these issues what's the record six years into the obama administration veterans are dying at the hands of our government veterans are routinely denied quality timely medical care veterans are waiting a year or more for their benefits that's unacceptable now the congress both parties passed a bill and they said here's the fix well if you're a veteran and you live 40 miles from a va clinic and you have an appointment 30 days out or more well then you go to your own doctor and be reimbursed that's ridiculous that's unacceptable i have to say folks if the congressman or anyone on that committee were sick they'd go to the doctor the very next day or as soon as possible every veteran in this country deserves the same quality timely access to medical care as the united states congress and congressman walls and that's what i stand for thank you mr walls well there's no more sacred trust in this nation than the defense of it and uh and the care of those warriors we we all know and we've heard it since the beginning of this nation when president lincoln made his second inaugural address and understood when he said the care of he who wore the battle in his widow and an orphan is our utmost responsibility the work that republican chairman jeff miller has done on the committee has been exemplary and there are many in this room that have gone to the va and received quality care one veteran not receiving care is a failure just like leaving one of our fellow soldiers on the battlefield it's not going to happen and so the way you fix this is you come together and you put in the reforms that are necessary you make the accountability hold people accountable for this and you engage the american public to make this a priority not just now and always but i have to say i will not allow this to become a partisan issue and a close friend of mine lost limbs in vietnam to a to a grenade only to be uh denigrated by mr hagendorn and this this issue amongst all issues cannot go down the road of partisanship it cannot go down the road of trying to divide us there are solutions that are out there we brought in uh secretary mcdonald who brings in vast knowledge from procter gamble he's putting a team together and we're working hand in hand and i for one uh have wore that uniform for 24 years and i stood next to those veterans and to imply in any way that i don't care or that they would not get care uh especially after the comments that were made i'd simply reject that so thank you mr hager of your response i didn't say that you didn't care i said that the record after eight years in office and six years of president obama is unacceptable we have to have outside the box thinking we need to make sure that the veterans in this in this country are allowed to go to the see the doctors of their choice to get care when they need it we need to provide them with vouchers and private insurance i would swap the insurance that congressman walls gets with his subsidy from the u.s government and give that to every veteran and let the congress people go to the veterans institution give the veterans a choice mr wallace for the response well my pledge to you as it's always been is to stand and people are in here and the legion and the bfw and the folks who we've worked together to do this you know but uh but there there's there needs to be an accountability for uh wounded warriors and uh there needs to be an accountability on someone who would so denigrate one of ours but uh what you can know is that uh that i will continue to be there we'll continue to uh to fight for them we'll continue to make it right and and veterans know those of you in the room you know thank you our next question from the audience will go first to mr walls would you work to get rid of common core when it comes to education well i think like so many things in education i'm a teacher i spent my lifetime in this i said coming back into school i look out there i coached on that football field and down the hall and we're here with speech teams with my wife at different times i think looking for educational uh solutions looking for new and innovative ways we had a discussion today about what finland is doing and what some other countries are doing common core and some of the things that are there i'm not the only member of congress that ever taught under uh no child left behind i simply did not think it was the right way to go i thought there were certainly things that should have been changed and needed to be changed common core falls into that same thing but what i understand is that common core like certain things become catch words for people who who haven't thought who haven't been in the classroom and they hear things that might not be the case they're certainly faults there are certainly things that i think could be done differently it's certainly the rhetoric that goes into it asking our students to meet a common goal and asking our students to participate at the highest level to make sure that our nation is the most educated and has the best laid workforce uh available is certainly a noble goal but these are things that we we can continue to move forward we can continue to change we can continue to pull back i have not taught under the common core um but i talked to teachers who who have and while there is value in many of them there's things that aren't working so i think once again nothing's carved in stone everything moves forward progress is progress for a reason and we can continue to reform and go but one thing i know is the way you get achievements is keep and retain the best quality teachers in the world that's the key it's not the curriculum it's the teacher thank you mr henker i've been very consistent on this i'm not a real big fan of common core i think it's wrong and federal policy uh in washington dc has been wrong for a while i didn't think that president bush was right with no child left behind so i tell my conservative friends if you're opposed to common core you should have been opposed to no child left behind as well but i think what works best again block grant those monies back to the states get rid of this federal education program all together let the states decide how the kids are educated and if the states some states like louisiana with governor jindal and others want to take those monies and have school choice programs so parents can then decide where to send their kids that's the best way the money should follow the children not the children following the money and if we did these types of things there would be an explosion of opportunity in education and again parents would be in a very good position to determine whether or not their children were receiving proper education thank you do you have a response mr waltz just said i'll take minnesota over louisiana our next question from the audience we will begin with mr hagen would you vote to increase the federal minimum wage why or why not well i think when you're looking at the fed i'm opposed to the federal minimum wage increase and i think what's been going on in washington again is you have the politicians driving up the basic costs of people limiting our economy and then turning around well let's raise the minimum wage because nobody has any money of course they don't have any money and people are having to pay more for their health care people are paying more for their energy look at what's going on with these energy policies in washington where you have these capital trade style energy policies and before you know it the price of everything goes up because folks the price of everything in our society every product or service tied to energy you know regulations are costing people money and it's hidden and so after a while everyone says well there's no money in my back pocket i don't have any disposable income and then unfortunately you have people pushed into two part-time jobs which is happening way too much and people don't have enough money so but i think in the end what happens with the minimum wage is it's counterproductive if you raise it you people at the lower end that are getting started in work and things of that nature those jobs disappear we go to more mechanization because it's cheaper for businesses to do that i think in the end it's counterproductive thank you mr waltz yes any response our next question from the audience um would you support legislation to ban discrimination of gays in the workforce why or why not to begin with mr waltz yes i have because the constitution is very clear and those uh our fellow citizens who wear this uniform defending our freedoms have every right to be protected in the workplace as anyone else does it's that step towards a more perfect union and we're making progress in that regards and i i certainly support that i certainly think uh most americans understand that the basic equality and the basic sense of uh of respect and dignity for every american is something that we value thank you mr hegler i'm opposed to the legislation i believe the state should decide those matters mr wilson in response no i go back thank you our next question what needs to be done to have the parties work together to solve the nation's problems what tools for collaboration do you possess mr higgins well when i was when i worked at the treasury department one of the few people that ever went out to washington dc and downsized his own agency and i saw that we were we were doing some things inefficiently and i pushed a bill that forced the federal government to pay people electronically to send direct deposit went up to the congress and worked with both sides and sometimes when you have a decent idea a reform idea or whatever and you can work with both sides it works but other times folks we're in a situation in this country where we have two different paths that we're going to take we're either going to take a path that we've been going on big government with president obama his policies that are stifling the economy and driving up costs and getting the government in control of your lives and control your businesses or we're going to go another direction and that is to take the power from washington and so in the house of representatives which is a body that's controlled by one vote more than half when you're in the majority you set the agenda you pass the bills you send them to the senate there's something like 200 bills that have been sent to the senate by the house of representatives that have been stymied so i kind of halfways reject this idea that we're in a predicament because we're not getting along i think we're in a predicament because when one side had power they passed a lot of bad bills and now we're in a position of trying to undo that thank you mr waltz i think you do it by demonstrating it you demonstrated in your life uh demonstrated as i've worked uh both through the military and uh and also uh as a teacher as a coach you know me i know your kids and work for common goals and then i think in this job uh the way you conduct yourself and the things you say and the relationships that you build in the sense of trust because that's all you have is your reputation and i think building coalitions whether it's highway 14 bringing my friend uh congressman runyan republican from new jersey out here to get us the veterans cemetery and president for all the hard work the veterans have done for those years it's about getting results by showing that you're in this together there's there's never just two black and white past there's certainly different ideas and they come from both sides there uh you take the best and you melt it together and you understand that you're going to have to compromise what you've done but i think what i would tell you is this is talk radio slogans and things like that don't match up to getting it done when it came the issue and asked when they asked the republican chairman who has been in charge and the republicans have been in charge of the house of representatives for four years when they asked republican jeff miller who he goes to to get advice from to try and move things forward on veterans he sent me and they trust me and i trust him and i have many colleagues that way i don't agree with them but i don't disagree with them because they're republicans i disagree with them when i think they're wrong and that's the difference of opinion and i've built those coalitions we've built things done and in the minority i've been able to move more legislation whether it was stock act government reform ethics legislation farm bill uh implementing other things in the farm bill than any other member in the minority that comes from building trust and respect thank you do you have response mr hickman well the big question again i i don't i don't get into all this partisanship and all that stuff i got to tell you we have we have a choice which direction do you want this country to go more government or less government you want the federal government to have more control over your life and less and if you want somebody who wants less government then i'm going to go out there and fight for you and whether that's having to take on the republicans and democrats or just the democrats or whoever i'm ready to go fight for it thank you are you mad thank you the next question from the audience will begin with mr waltz how do you plan to keep only legal immigrations coming into the u.s and should we have quotas again what we do now one of the issues that i think this issue again the divisions as they divide us uh this nation be very clear every sovereign nation has the right to control its borders and must control the borders we must know who's here every nation that falls for the rule of law must know that the interesting thing about this country is we've been able to do that at the same time we uh we uh understand our heritage as a nation sitting here of immigrants a nation of neighborhoods sitting in this room of trying to build that and so what i would say we need to do is the policies that encourage immigration the situation coming out of especially out of central america recently is there needs to be an accountability from the governments there there needs to be as we'll partner with you but there needs to be an accountability to make sure that those uh that you're not incentivizing people to come and then when we control our border we need to do so in the humane manner we need to make sure that our resources are being focused on keeping drugs keeping people who wish to harm this nation but understanding when we ask people to go get in a line there is no line that's what comprehensive immigration reform got 68 votes in the united states senate but wouldn't be heard in the house of representatives we had republican senators and democratic senators compromised to make our borders secure to make sure we adhered to our history of of immigrants making sure people had a line to get into and making sure that we understood and listened to our employers who in the first district are playing by the rules trying to do everything right but we need to have an honest discussion of what we need in the workforce and that can be done we've done it through our history but it's not going to be done by demagoguery and it's not going to be done by trying to separate us it's going to be done by smart policies working together to solve it thank you mr hickman here's the difference between the two of us if you're worried about border security and the chaos down there then i'm your candidate if you if you want if you want immigration amnesty and continued policies that president obama is pushing that's your candidate what's going on in this country is disgrace we haven't secured our border we haven't fixed the passport and immigration system we don't know who's in this country now we're not even deporting the people that we abraham it doesn't take too much imagination to realize what will happen if just a few people islamic terrorists or others that want to do us harm how much damage they can inflict to our country well we don't have to use much imagination as we just think back to 911 when 19 of them did it folks they've left our country unprotected we're allowing people to come into this country right now from ebola nations that could that could cause a calamity in this country the president of the united states hasn't stepped up and defended us and neither has congress calls on this particular issue we need to fix the passport visa systems in the united states we need a work program that makes sense for labor and agriculture and where there's a real need in those jobs but we have to get back to the rule of law and say to people if you want to come to the united states go through the process like everyone else let's have a sovereign country again thank you do you have a response all right um our next question from the audience minnesota's largest high school wyzetta dropped out of the national school lunch program this year the one size fits all program didn't fit and didn't jive with the diverse student body the current law expires next year will you vote to continue this law or make changes we will begin with mr hagan is this relating to the mrs obama's luck program is that the question i'm sorry can you repeat the question yes minnesota's largest high school dropped out of the national school lunch program this year the current law expires next year will you vote to continue this law or make changes well let me answer that question just a second but what i would say is that this gets there's a little bit what's going on here folks where the government is controlling our lives controlling with kids eating school they don't like it anymore people want to drop out of the program and and it's on and on and goes the government is way too involved in our business and it comes through these regulations coming from usda in this case and other agencies and what we need is we need regulatory reform first we need a president that's not going to do these things to us but second of all we need regulatory reform the congress should have a way to block these types of regulations coming up that they don't like the congress should have a veto authority for instance over regulations of over 100 million dollars and we should sunset statutes and regulations so every five to ten years that congress would have to come back and reauthorize the bills so we would know that people would want to do it in this case if this has to do with the school lunch program uh for mrs obama and so far i would vote against that thank you mr walls well this is an area having supervised the high school luxury for 20 years i have some experience in um one of the things is i think we all understand is that the role of the federal government and again uh this is a nation that being hungry is not a sin and no child should go hungry and we figure out ways especially in school districts are not equal in terms of uh the assistance they get in free and reduced lunch and different schools need to make decisions and they have that right to invite said i have the right to do so but the issue here is making sure that we keep our children safe we want to make sure they're safe on their school buses we want to make sure they're safe crossing the streets we want to make sure they're safe from predators we want to make sure that as the science and the research comes that we want to make sure children aren't obese we want to make sure we're giving them good choices we're making sure that those things are made available so that they can live and again from a health care cost perspective it makes good sense and so what some of the things is and the things that come forward on this is that we're asking folks when they go forward that they would provide locally grown vegetables that are here be very clear that some of the fight that came on this came from the large processed food companies they want to sell the pizzas they could put in the microwave and certainly i've had a seven-year-old given the choice between eating a healthy meal or eating sugar and a pizza you know what they will choose we're adults there's a difference on this and again this this is us it is if you have two people standing up here this is there's not some uh faceless cabal or something it's your neighbors and folks who are working together what we want to do is give your children healthy choices make sure that no child goes hungry and again you can always modify these things you can make changes and in the case of whyzeta they make the choice based on the economics that they can go and that's fine they should have that right thank you mr heger give a response give the federal government power they will use it give the federal government power they will meddle this is kind of ridiculous when you listen to that last answer how involved the federal government is in these things send the money back to the states let the states decide these things get the federal government out of their business mr walls are you back next question from the audience should the federal government play a role in dealing with climate change and if so what would that role be we'll begin with mr wallace uh yes it should play a role as i said his issues uh and as the science starts to uh identify itself and certainly on and those of you in this this is the mayo clinic we're in rochester uh science is uh nothing is with uh absolute certainty the issue is is that the folks who frame it in a uh a false choice of either or what we should do is we should be addressing it but we can address it in a manner that will not only reduce carbon emissions and strengthen the longevity of uh of the planet and the sustainability but it also gives us opportunities to move in directions where we can create new economies where we can be a leader and we've seen it here in southern minnesota the jobs that are being created in renewable energies the jobs that are being created in the market now getting on an even field and i'm very clear about this i think we should use our existing fossil fuels that are here we should use them as a bridge we should use this opportunity now you don't fix the roof when it's raining you fix it when it's not raining so we should move forward on that and we should lay everything on the table for our energy needs because the country that controls its energy needs will control the future it makes no sense to me by not addressing this and not coming up with energy efficiencies and homegrown energy we send a billion dollars a day to countries specifically in the middle east you hate us they'll hate us for free let's get the jobs here let's create the incentives here let's move in the right direction at the same time it doesn't have to be it's not a purity test if the science is starting to move in that direction move in a direction that makes us sustainable that gives us options that moves us forward we owe that to future generations and we can do it the science and the technology is there mr hagan the united states was became a great militant the united states became great economic health because of abundant reliable low-cost energy in many respects this issue we have a complete divide between the two of us he's a cap and trade extremist he believes in restricting fossil fuels on public lands he's voted to bankrupt the coal companies through these epa regulations he's on he's on that side here's where i come down i think we need to have energy independence in this country first and foremost by drilling on public lands in alaska and other places where there's abundant energy we need to sustain coal we need nuclear we need renewables and conservation and folks we also need the infrastructure to use the resources that god gave us in order that it could be efficient we can drive down costs we need things like the keystone pipeline that congressman walls voted against we need new refineries and distribution points that are being blocked by obama's epa these are the types of things that we can do in order to not just drive down costs but bring back manufacturing and grow our economy uh thank you give response mr walls well oftentimes just because something said does not make it true i often remember my my seven year old calls himself an astronaut he's not one um so keep that in mind um the issue here is that there's there's opportunities to grow we're doing things right minnesota is led on this our rural electric cooperatives and our electric companies in minnesota have risen to the challenge and are doing better than anyone else in the country and there's a reason that those people support me because they understand the policies i've advocated for are growing that opportunity are allowing them to do that and move this forward and and that's again about talk versus results and then probably what we're doing thank you mr hagner for the response everything i said was true you voted to block drilling on federal lands you voted against the keystone pipeline you voted for the epa regulations that are going to bankrupt the coal-fired power plants in that in that industry driving up people's electricity rates folks when the government does this to you drives up energy costs it takes money out of your back pocket money they need to be using for lots of other certain services and sources and it's the type of thing there's just a huge difference between the big government policies on that side and the free market policies on this side thank you our next question will go to mr hegen on first where do you stand on a voter id i support it it just makes perfect sense that when people go into the voting booth and gasps is very important thing for our country that they have to prove that that they are devoted i don't support any barriers to voting i think it's making sure that someone is uh is verified and is registered on one of the rarest crimes in america is in-person voter fraud one of our issues in this country is not enough people do vote and we need to do what we can do to encourage them i think we need to make sure that they once again come back to uh to see the value of what they do we've seen this in our nation that different things are always throwing up as barriers we saw in the south making it more difficult we started out with pool taxes and things i think anything that's a common sense piece of this but don't don't be flippant about how difficult it is for some people and how many people don't have that and then to deny them the most basic of rights in this nation uh it's a pretty slippery slope on this the one thing that should have the ability is as an american citizen to be able to go and cast a vote and once again you see this often uh we simply don't and it should not and voter fraud is punishable uh it's his crime he's felony and it should be punished as it sees a bit but to make it more difficult or impossible for so many people to exercise the fundamental right to castle vote because of that it simply doesn't make sense of course the existing laws making sure that that doesn't happen and making sure that we encourage people to vote i think we should be having a conversation about expanding should we vote on saturdays should we make it so that we have it there that people can't leave why would you want to limit it why would the greatest nation on earth have one of the lowest voter turnout records is because it's the difficulty in this you've got busy people working and they've got long lines and so anything we do to make people participate in the democracy to be part of this experiment that's good thank you do you have a response mr hingman no just that it is a state issue tonight but i don't believe that people should should have to prove that they're the uh their identification thank you does the idea have to come from the state you're voting it i yield back all through the 90s we have heard of military bases being closed one after another we were cutting back on our nation's defense spending right now is that something that we continue to do or where do you stand when it comes to military spending and our nation's defense that's what you mean well i'm obviously the people in here know i'm a strong advocate of it uh i simply think that the the sequestration that took an axe across the budget uh certainly right and i voted for over a trillion dollars in cuts but they should that's our responsibility it should be done through regular order which we don't do anymore bring them to the floor debate them instead of cutting into customers one of the issues on this is is defense uh and i've spoken with uh everyone from uh general dempsey to join future staff to others that the readiness starts to be impacted by this i think this nation has many ways to influence things military power is one economic power our moral rights all of the things that we do to be able to exercise that but i simply and i know from 24 years of experience i know from watching this and seeing the budgets i know from traveling and being into the war zones and listening to them uh that we have to make sure that uh that we are funding accordingly here's where the catch is and it's a bill that i've moved forward and i cannot get my republican colleagues to get it off there uh some of them i'll keep working them we need to audit the pentagon to make sure where our money's going because it's one thing to spend on defense it's another to make sure it's going to the right place the pentagon will not allow that to happen and we haven't done so at this point and i think and i would make the argument that i don't think we're putting it into the right places i think we're spending it in the wrong places but i think if we do that and we have a reassessment of that um we're going to find out that because and once again uh there are folks out there there are dangerous people there are extremists that want to harm this nation we need to be smart about all of our resources and how we deploy them and i do think and i am concerned on this issue thank you mr higginbot well i'm concerned with the way that this administration is cutting back the military and but i have to say this that overall we could reform the defense department and probably save five ten percent of the money and still have money for weapon system and the pay and benefits of the troops but we don't have people out there that are really putting their mind to those types of things what we need to get back to in this country is peace through strength that was a reagan doctrine that worked for many years and what's going on in washington right now with the obama administration just the opposite we're showing weakness we're leading from behind and it's telling look what's been going on in the middle east the president inherited the middle east that was relatively stable had a lot of pro-american or pro-west countries or neutral countries then we undermined countries like egypt we undermine yemen we undermine libya and we've ended up with the place being upside down and completely destabilized where we have no more influence in that area the terrorists are rising up the islamic radicals rising up slaughtering the christians and this is all under this obama policy that congressman roles has supported wholeheartedly we we do need to project our strength we need to support our allies but most importantly folks we gotta get people around this world to fight for their own freedom rather than get in and try to fight every war miss world's team response i feel bad mr hagin come to the time for our closing statements um we will hear from mr walls first each candidate will have two minutes with no remodels to make the closing statement once again thanks to uh mr hagan thanks to our moderators and to century high school again thanks to each of you um my bride gwen is here we uh we bought our first house together and uh we're still in that house our children were born here um i taught your kids in school i coached them sometimes right out here lost some hard ones won some state championships when the tornadoes came i helped to pick up after that we did it together we sandbagged together in floods i put on the uniform of the minnesota national guard and i joined service organizations in our community i believe that there is no place on earth that provides the opportunity the security and the optimism that southern minnesota does i am so incredibly proud when i watch what mayo clinic and our great institutions of medicine are doing and moving things forward when the story of cancer being cured it'll go through hormel in the mayo clinic we're feeding the world with the most productive farmers in the world and we have a 25-year high in manufacturing coming back many of it's here we have some of the best schools in the nation and we have some of the lowest crime rates and that's done because of communities coming together understanding that you can have and value personal freedoms and achievement but you can also be in the public sector and the things we do together that are called helping your neighbor is not socialism it's neighborliness and we can do things smartly and do that and i've worked for you on that we've worked together on coalition past farm bills we've worked together to bring improvements to highway 14 in our infrastructure we got a bridge down in winona that we did working with the chamber of commerce and the community in a bipartisan manner and we have a rescue place where many of us in this room will spend eternity down in preston in the most beautiful veterans cemetery in minnesota that was done by working with my colleagues working in a manner that is respectful to you doing it by not throwing fire bombs but respecting the process of this democracy and trying to move towards that more perfect union if you give me the opportunity i will do it again for the next two years i thank you for that thank you mr hegren well thank you for this opportunity i appreciate being here congressman walls thank you for tonight i started the uh the discussion out tonight talking about how we have two paths that we can go on what a larger federal government intrusion in your life and another where we actually go to washington and try to take the power from that and send it back to you the american people i have to say that we're in rochester minnesota tonight one of america's greatest cities with the finest institution of medicine in all the world and yet we didn't have one question asked about obamacare and what we wanted to do about that and to say one of the reasons i want to go to washington is to repeal and replace obamacare because i believe obamacare stands as a direct threat to all the good things that are happening in rochester and southern minnesota with mayo and all the fine institutions of medicine in this country that bill is a menstrual monstrosity that is hurting the people of southern minnesota and driving up our costs limiting our freedom and hurting us when it comes to the economy in our jobs we don't need a top-down approach to medicine we don't need washington d.c based control of our lives we need private sector reforms that allow us to hold and keep our money shop for care competition across state lines we can do this without the federal government and if you give me the chance to go to washington first and foremost i will fight to repeal and replace obamacare but i also will continue that job and take us on another path to less coverage i ask for your vote thank you very much i know you're itching to claude give you just 15 seconds here and then i'll let you let loose i'd like to thank each of our candidates tonight for participating in our forum thank you for your service

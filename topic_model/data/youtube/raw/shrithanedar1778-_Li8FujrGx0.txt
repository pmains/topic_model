With a climate change denier President... ...and an accountant Governor who brought us the Flint drinking water crisis... ...our next Governor should get... science. That's scientist-chemist Shri Thanedar. Shri worked on cures and medicines that big drug companies ignored... ...signed a pledge to not take a single penny of corporate special interest money ... ...and took a stand for single-payer healthcare. The only scientist and the most progressive Democrat running for Governor: Shri Thanedar.

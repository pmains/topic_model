afternoon this Saturday Saturday is June 22nd and it's not just any June 22nd it marks 75 years to the day that Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed into law one of the most significant pieces of legislation in our nation's history it was called and is called the servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 and we know it today as the GI Bill since 1944 the GI Bill has helped literally millions not just servicemen but a lot of service women and when you look at our armed forces today there are a lot of service women who serve in the Army Navy Air Force Marine Corps and in the Coast Guard I remember being a midshipman at Ohio State Navy ROTC midshipman back in the 1960s and we had no women in our unit we had there no women in any ROTC unit and any college across the country as far as I know there are no women who were nominated to attend our service academies Naval Academy Air Force Academy marceline Academy I'm none of them none of them had women I got to my squadron out on the west coast during the Vietnam War and we had about 300 men in my squadron about 10% were officers the others who were enlisted men we had no women in my squadron all that has changed all that has changed when you go to any college that has a ROTC unit it today you're lying women and the academies you find women and my old squadron you find women and they're not just he ones and he twos and threes they're all four zero five zero sixes and they're doing a great job and the GI Bill is for them too since 1944 the GI Bill has helped millions of World War two veterans purchase a home pay for a higher education or obtain job training and in turn transformed our nation's economy a residing officer who has served our country in uniform those of what I speak and I was just off of active duty in the Vietnam War and in adela and when I finished up my my my MBA which was financed in part by the GI Bill I hadn't scraped enough money together to to buy a house I think it cost about thirty five thousand dollars I didn't have thirty five thousand dollars but with the help the GI Bill I was able to get a mortgage and to buy my my first stuff for my first home all those years ago but in the years since World War two the GI Bill has continued to shape the lives of millions of veterans by spurring of economic opportunity and helping to create the middle class as we know it today that's why earlier this week I was proud to reintroduce a bipartisan resolution here in the Senate alongside my colleagues senators Johnny Isakson of Georgia John tester of Montana they are both the chair and the ranking members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee and that designates this week this week as National GI Bill commemoration week celebrating the historical significance of the GI Bill and renewing our commitment to improving the lives of our nation's veterans for years to come so mr. president I I want to just share with you a couple of reasons why the GI Bill is oftentimes referred to as the greatest legislation and share with the you how it changed my life and really the life of my family after World War two of millions of returning veterans slaughtered our nation's colleges are an Evert universities and our vocational schools there was a GI bill that made financial support education and home loan problems available to those 16 million veterans returning home and helped to usher in an era of on preston ated economic expansion according to a 1988 report from the Joint Economic Committee was 1988 it was estimated that for every one dollar for every one dollar the United States invested in our GIS through the GI Bill about $7 return and that can only go for our country I'm going to say that again for $1 according to Joint Economic Committee 1988 it was estimated that for every $1 the u.s. invested in the GI bill about $7 will return to our economy pretty good return those are big returns and I wish I could say for every dollar we invested in the federal government all the spending that we did that we got seven bucks back in terms of economic growth we don't so this is this is something to to note but thanks to the original GI Bill four hundred fifty thousand engineers 240 thousand accountants 238 thousand teachers 91 thousand scientists 67 thousand doctors 112 thousand dentists and thousands of other professionals entered our country's workforce and many folks who are entered their workforce with skills and the building trades and assembly operations you name it it's truly the GI Bill truly democratized our higher education system it established greater citizenship and civic participation and empowered the greatest generation my parents generation to lead our country following World War two mr. mr. president I don't think of I think I have shared the story with you so I'll ask you to bear with me but others about listening or watching may not have heard this but at the end of World War two my dad had been chief petty officer in the Navy and served til the end of World War two and a little bit after that and served many years after that as a chief petty officer in the Naval Reserve for I think about 30 years in all but he came back and went to or two before he went to work he took advantage of the GI Bill and the he had a real knack for fixing things building things he's just very skilled in that regard had a high school education he my mom graduated from Shady Springs High School in Beaver West Virginia and they're married did another in the world war two and my sister was born in 45 and I was born in 47 but my my dad used the GI Bill he once told me to learn how to fix wrecked cars how to be an auto body repair man and he ended up working in a automobile automobile dealership in Beckley West Virginia Burleson Oldsmobile Burleson Oldsmobile and using the skills that he gained from the GI Bill and he'd worked there for a year or two and one day a claims adjuster came on from Nationwide Insurance Company nationwide he had ensured a car that was there being repaired by my dad and the claims adjuster talked to my dad about the car and how I was coming and somewhere in that conversation the fellow from the end the formation on interested in my dad you know you could be you could do what I do and my dad said you mean be a claims adjuster for Nationwide Insurance and I said yeah you could do that so you got a lot on the ball two years later my father was the claims adjuster for Nationwide Insurance and he continued as a hobby to repair wrecked cars we had any number of cars in her family that looked as good as nobody taking me just long weekends went to a garage and fixed them paint them and they're as good as new but that out of that humble beginning as a claims adjuster for Nationwide Insurance is very proud of the work that he did but he ended up 2025 years later as the one of top instructors for nationwide in your home office in Columbus Ohio teaching all the claims adjusters from across the country for nationwide how to do their job as adjusting claims working on claims and here's a picture of my dad while it's Richard Carper he went by Richard his middle name my middle name and instructing a bunch of folks in the home office in the train school in Columbus Ohio and here is what some of his compadres who some of the fellow teachers that that he worked with and it started with GI Bill now I know people who have to use the GI ability get an undergraduate degree or two-year degree associate degree a master's degree a PhD not everybody uses GI Bill for that and my father used it in a way that actually ended up enable him to not only get a good blue-collar job but also actually to end up doing this kind of workers as well I'm proud of him and and the thankful to the GI Bill for helping him get started and really the serve as a role model for my sister in and me my own my own career I served five years in active goods midshipman before that at Ohio State and serve five years in Vietnam or three tours in Southeast Asia and the I wanted to stay in the Navy I didn't want to I want to go to graduate school after my seat or and maybe wasn't ready to send me to Monterey I wouldn't go to Monterey to graduate school maybe wasn't ready to send me to a post graduate school here said that come back and talk to us in a couple of years and so I said I want to go to graduate school so I took surrender my regular commission took a reserve Commission and moved from California to Delaware University Delaware and enrolled on the GI Bill to go to graduate school and the next weekend after showed up with Delroy I drove up the road to Willow Grove Naval Air Station in Pennsylvania North Atilla Delphia and they were just getting navy p3 aircrafts that I'd been a p3 aircraft machine commander during the Vietnam War and I said are you looking for people who might help train these sailors that will go to how to use these b3 airplanes and they said we need some peeps and we as well and we're happy to sign me up and I flew with them for another 18 years and retired as a Navy captain but before I did those 18 years I went to graduate school at the University of Delaware and earned an MBA and had to help me to be go to work for state of Delaware in economic development right out of graduate school and later to had a chance to run for state treasurer nobody wanted to run whether was graduating a country and the fact that I had a an MBA from the University dollars some people thought maybe I could be a pretty good state treasurer and we ended up starting with the worst credit rating country in 1977 and six years later we had double a credit rating Peter Pont was our governor he's great governor and I hope I helped a little bit along the way but that GI bill my MBA helped I think in that work and later to have a chance to serve in the House and then as governor and now here in the Senate so I'm deeply grateful to the people of this country for investing in me and I tried to work hard to repay that that investment that they made in me all those years ago but today's veterans can take advantage of the post 9/11 GI Bill an incredible benefit that pays the full cost of tuition public colleges and universities are generous housing allowance and book stipend and could even be pants for the veterans spouse or children and in 2017 I was proud when Congress enacted the forever GI bill legislation to expand the GI Bill strengthen protection for veterans for Purple Heart recipients for National Guard and reservists and surviving spouses and children last about two or three weeks ago we had a send-off ceremony in that Delaware National Guard facility in Smyrna Delaware just north of Dover there had 20 or so National Guardsmen and women they were about to ship off for Iraq and that other surrounding countries in that part of the world and in my my remarks to stand them off and wish them well I mentioned when they came home they would be eligible for a a GI bill that would enable them if they had a total of like 36 months of service would enable them to go to college University of Delaware Delaware State University Dell or Technical Community College wilmington university free free no tuition books paid for the they need tutoring paid for a $2,000 a month housing allowance when we came back from southeast asia at the end of the vietnam war for the GI but we got a $250 a month allowance for everything that was it all in and the GI bill that our veterans inherited a receive today is just incredibly generous and it's actually very helpful in terms of include we're recruiting people to serve in an all-volunteer military one of the one of the aspects of the bill and I mentioned it a minute ago but if the guy doesn't use his or her GI Bill their spouse can use it and if their spouse doesn't use it their dependent children can use it and sometimes that happens but I want to just share with you one sad but Indian hopeful story about the the GI Bill benefits of one service member his name was Christopher Minh Christopher's Lebanon he grew up in not too far from Delaware but he ended up serving in New York City as a fireman he's a firefighter and he'd been a firefighter for 15 years he was in the words of Winston Churchill twice as citizen twice as citizens because in addition to doing that he served in reserves not in the Navy but in the Marines for a number of years his unit was activated he was activated that ended up in Afghanistan on active duty so he took leave from his day job as a firefighter in New York City to put on a different uniform and ship out with his with his colleagues to go to to Afghanistan and he was serving there on active duty marine reservist activated and one day on patrol in the Humvee that he was in they ran across a bomb which exploded and killed him Christmas Lebanon two other Marines who were in the other vehicle several days later I stood on the flight line at Dover Air Force Base along with Chris Coons my colleague here in the Senate Liesl Blunt Rochester our house represents our only u.s. representative that large congresswoman and our Governor John Carney secretary of the the defense out of the the Marine Corps and a lot of other people we stood there with three families of those three Marines who died one of the people in the in the families among the three families was Christopher's lemons now Widow and Shannon Metcalf Minh who has earned three degrees herself from University dollar undergraduate master's degree dr. droop degree was there and her three daughters were not I think they was late at night they were probably home and probably in bed but when Christmas Lippmann died he left behind a widow and he left behind three little girls ages 4 8 and 10 his wife doesn't need to go to school any further she's educated we'll all be on my my dreams and but you know what they have three daughters they have three daughters and we're gonna make sure that they when they're old enough to go to college will be able to inherit and use the GI Bill benefits that their father and their mother will never use and there are a lot of times I think about the GI Bill does to help service members like me like my dad but it also helps a lot of families in ways that we maybe never imagined and I think there's we celebrate 75 years we celebrate the gift that this legislation provides to those survivors this case the three men girls as they prepare to face the world without without their father well so today I'm proud and closing hymn proud to join families across our country and celebrating the importance of the GI Bill over the last three quarters of a century which enabled hundreds of thousands of veterans including as I said early me and my dad to pursue our dreams and hopefully to contribute in some way to our nation to our economy this week we reaffirm our commitment to make sure that every veteran today has a similar experience maybe even a better experience than we have and gets the most out of their hard-earned GI bill benefits so I want to ask all my colleagues to to join us today here in this chamber and across the country in wishing the GI Bill the GI Bill see if we can put can use pushes over thank you not every day we wish the bill in law a happy birthday but this is a big one and we wish the GI Bill a happy 75th birthday and here's to another 75 years of improving the lives of our nation's veterans and with that I yield the floor thanks for

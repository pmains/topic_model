our next guest illinois congressman rodney davis is taking up the cause of making the trump tax cuts permanent what a wonderful thing mr davis welcome sir tell us you're going to introduce some you know i am tomorrow i'm going to be joined by the ranking member of ways and means kevin brady you know you worked hard with him when you were in the trump administration to pass this bill that's been great for middle class families in this country we're going to make the individual rates still permanent this bill passed when we were in the majority and we're going to try to force the democrats to get this to the floor so we can help americans long after those tax cuts were supposed to expire you think uh i mean that's an interesting point is it possible to get a floor vote or pelosi won't let you get a floor vote well we need to put the pressure on the democrats do i think nancy pelosi will do the right thing and extend tax cuts to many middle class families no because democrats here in washington haven't met a tax dollar that families have yet to earn that they don't want to tax and spend so we're up against that but if we're lucky enough to take the majority then we're going to make sure we make these these tax cuts permanent you know that you're right the pr the pro growth i mean poverty came down middle class blue collar income soared uh we had record low unemployment from minority groups um the depreciation the immediate expensing starts to expire i think next year that's very important for business equipment investment and productivity but rodney you know i'm looking at this 350 billion dollar bill supposed to be america competes or whatever it's called if we have predictably low tax rates and we have predictably low regulatory burdens we would have the most hospitable investment environment we don't have to subsidize our way companies will come here because america is the best place to operate well that's why president trump and the trump administration tax cut bill was so influential to creating a globally competitive environment for american companies and when you look at what the democrats solutions are it's always spend billions more don't address any inflationary issues and really make it a green new deal policy ridden bill that can't get bipartisan support we need to continue to take the example from what you and your colleagues in the trump administration did and make our tax cut our tax uh our tax code even more readily uh readily available for companies and small businesses and frankly families to take advantage of to be able to go create their own american dream well i think more reforms uh are out there you know if the cavalry comes and we take the everything over in 2022 in congress at least you know you can lower rates broaden the base get rid of all loopholes uh even on the corporate side small businesses could probably need some help i mean is this going to be i hope it will be in kevin mccarthy's um new contract with america or whatever it's called well we're talking with leader mccarthy we're developing uh his next contract the agenda for our our road to the house majority in conjunction with everybody on our republican team here in the house and i certainly believe that making the individual rates and the small business rates for every single every single american company permanent should be high on our agenda that's great congressman rodney davis i just want to thank you sir one of my favorite subjects trump tax cuts permanent we'll talk soon i'll be right back

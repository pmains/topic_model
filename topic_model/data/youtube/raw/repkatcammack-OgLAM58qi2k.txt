foreign what was once disregarded as conspiracy theory is now reality Elon musk's recent release of the Twitter files exposed how big Tech actively censored information on behalf of the FBI and Trump's political opponents leading up to the 2020 election with big Tech Democrats and the swamp all working together to flip elections in their favor what can Republicans do to even the playing field it's our great honor to have with us Kat kamek a great relatively young congresswoman from the state of Florida I guess my first question I always find it interesting are you congresswoman are you congressman well first Matt you're killing me relatively young come on I mean you know relatively new at this job you know what I'm trying to say yuck you're which I consider to be a huge compliment I mean you know you're not one of these people I have to kind of like help sit down in their chair and give them all the questions to ask you know what you're doing before still the youngest Republican woman in Congress today uh but man I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to tease you about that for a while you're never supposed to ask a woman about her age well I always thought that was women who were older I don't know but uh no it's um it's it's really an interesting time where we're facing so many interesting issues and really important issues that I think a millennial and I kind of see myself as one of the token Millennials in Congress uh we're we're in a really good place to have leadership of our generation at the table and as far as being a congresswoman versus a congressman I'm the best damn person for the job so I don't really care what you call I love it I love it uh let's not get stuck up on pronouns and all that stuff right let's just get the job done so let's jump right into the the first area that's really bothering people been bothering people for a long time and that is this autocratic power of big Tech we have lots of companies it's not just Twitter it's the 417 million dollars spent by Facebook to try to you know change the outcome of an election it's Microsoft it's Apple it's all the big guys what are you doing to make conservatives feel like there'll be some justice on these sets of questions well well I think that's why the commitment to America is so powerful because one of the main pillars that we're focused on is Big Tech and it's a variety of things it's not just section 230 reform to try to remove the bias and establish some sense of fairness in that space But it's also protecting our data our privacy our kids who are exposed to so much especially on on platforms like Tick Tock which even Biden's Administration is now saying oh my gosh red flags Galore we need to remove tick tock from people's devices this is a problem you know so it's it's much more than just section 230 reform and you know removing that bias but it's it's things like going after the cartels that are actively advertising on social media platforms like Facebook and they are facilitating they being The Meadows of the world Facebook Instagram Twitter Snapchat they're facilitating the trafficking of Narcotics and humans and their take making money from the cartels to do it then you factor in the Geo fencing that takes place where they do these targeted ads to people around the world saying we can get you across the border into the United States and here's our price and then they're using the infrastructure of social media to facilitate the payments so there's a Litany of different things going on and as far as the censorship issues I think we have to go after the heart of it which is one the people behind the scenes like the trust and safety team so-called that are at Twitter that are deep platforming people with no good cause and of course the algorithms the algorithms that are designed to inherently censor and suppress conservative voices so there's a lot that we have to dig into here but it's going to be multiple steps for us to get back to a place where there's some sense of balance on social media platforms yeah I totally agree so there's all these separate issues here the first question is obviously censoring conservatives as we've seen seen Facebook and now Twitter with this you know set of Revelations that have come out from its new CEO Elon Musk that's just there's no way that should be able to exist now the first amendment applies to the government not private companies so private companies are allowed to make these decisions about who they want to highlight and who they don't want to highlight or Shadow band but you're all you're not allowed to commit a fraud on the American people by saying hey my company uh is welcomed All Points of View and we welcome all conversations remember Twitter went to CPAC to get all of us to sign on because it said this is a safe space for conservatives it turned out to be a lie exactly well and think about this when you look at say like the national broadcasters and you know you have to place advertisements or you want to place advertisements on local television or national television there's still a set of standards that you have to abide by and when it gets into Political season and Matt you know this better than anybody they have you know equal time coverage that they have are supposed to abide right but I've gone out the window a little bit here in recent years but there's some framework that there that is guiding this Tech has been really left in the dust because there really hasn't been anyone in government who understands it as someone who was born in 1988 I think I have the benefit of being a little bit analog but also digital growing up in the space and understanding the evolution of it and where it's going because we also of course have the metaverse to contend with and there's a whole Litany of issues in the first that I think people aren't really expecting so as far as really dealing with the framework to your point a private company absolutely needs its rights respected but when you step into the Public Square and conduct yourself as such you have to then at that point recognize that the first amendment is non-negotiable that's right so those communities need to reflect also corporations have to follow the law where it comes to their use of corporate money and these corporate entities when they've turned into Political entities and trying to be electioneering arms of the democratic party I really think you you and your colleagues have some real legitimate questions to ask you the second question is too big right too big too small cut them up uh do what we did with a t make them smaller do you believe that'll solve any problems or we just have more smaller companies uh committing the same uh you know policy violations you know you know I I I definitely think that there is a valid Anti-Trust argument to be made that being said what we've seen and this is a great example with Snapchat Snapchat came up it got real big and then it kind of fell off into a certain Niche but the issues within Snapchat still exist much in the same way when they were at the bigger levels so I think that we have to address some of the root causes a great example with Google is the algorithm that they use when it comes to uh the pro-life Community when pro-life Community puts out advertisements and does Google AdWords what happens is that the algorithm is designed to suppress that and so we need to actually get into that and say if you're going to be accepting dollars for advertising then you have to adhere by a certain set of standards and that is I think incredibly important no matter how big or how small so whether you're a tiny startup that is in the new social media connectivity app space or or if you're a giant like Google there needs to be some sort of framework and I'm all for pulling back on the regulatory environment but we're in an age where this is now the main primary means of communication the way people disseminate information so there's some considerations that have to be made and another thing that we haven't even really touched on is that there's only two main Platforms in which these apps can really be hosted on you have the Apple store or you have Android right and you see a real discrepancy Facebook for example they pay one dollar one dollar to have Facebook on their store you compare that to another app for example that pays 30 of their their gross profits and that's what goes to Apple it's a completely backwards model and there has to be some some framework put in place so that everyone can have a shot at the accessing that market so on the Apple phone are you saying that what it really should be is a fair place for all people to play instead of Apple being able to cherry pick which apps can take off and can't it seems like apple has a lot of power there yeah I know it's a novel concept of a free and open market is encouraged and and help facilitate it but uh it's kind of crazy that in today's world really you only have the option of a Google device of an Android device or of an Apple device and if you can only really get your apps through those two stores and they're choosing which companies they're going to put on the store and which ones they're not with no real clear uh set of rules or guidelines of what happens when you get on there and how you can beat the platform that's pretty crazy I mean I think parlor is a great example of that yeah that's right so I think that we're spending a lot of time talking about Twitter God bless Elon Musk I call him the ultimate whistleblower but what you just said is we have some big companies you've mentioned two of them Apple and Google that are really setting the pace on so many things that also need a lot of focus they try to hide sometimes and part of this is this woke corporate culture where once an apple and a Google says some new kind of perversion in society should be accepted by all companies and funded by all companies it seems to like go through the whole process of the the brt in the chamber what can we do to make all that stop you know I think that the culture war is just as important you've heard me say this before they're not going to legislate our way out of this mess we as consumers have to assert our right not just at The Ballot Box but with our dollars and really when we buy into these corporations that are promoting these ESG guidelines right where the social justice Warriors of the world are saying all of the companies that feed into this one Corporation or product have to abide by a certain uh set of guidelines and standards even some of them that are made up completely that is very dangerous because it's not just for tangible products but that's also for the digital space so I think we are really really entering an era where we the people have a tremendous amount of power we just have to help people seize that power and understand how they can leverage their vote and their dollar and their voice in a way to actually win the culture War because even though there's going to be 222 of us conservatives up here fighting the good fight there's not a single Silver Bullet in a legislative form that's going to fix this we have to stand up and push back from the ground up yeah for sure I hear sirens going off in the back those are the famous Congressional beeps letting you know they kind of dictate your life doesn't it by the way we'll get to control those beeps pretty soon right congresswoman absolutely it's a whole new world let me ask you one final question to let you go off to vote um The Border we're seeing now a second year of multi-millions of people you know coming across the border illegally I'm from a relatively small state of Kansas we've essentially let in another estate just from the illegals who have been able to come in across the southern border is there any hope that as we negotiate a budget deal going into next year with Republicans and can charge at the house that we can close that border and get Biden to back down yeah there's no option we have to there is no no deal on the table that I could support that didn't have a stand-alone border security secure secure the Border shut it down give the resources to our border patrol agents option right now we've heard about a deal potentially being crafted in the Senate that would tie border security to amnesty that is a non-starter that is dead on Horizon in a republic house and so people should take note that this should not be an item for negotiation you cannot force people to say oh yeah we we know that the border is unsecure but we're going to use it as a bargaining chip in uh some big old deal that has nothing to do with border security so I think you're not only going to see the Congress as a whole withholding funds and playing Hardball with Hardball with the administration I think you're also going to see an investigation and subsequent impeachment of Alejandro mayorkas for his negligence and his dereliction of Duty as Homeland Security secretary you know as sad as it makes me that we gonna have to take that step it's the right step and thank you for doing that and thanks for your wonderful votes in Congress thanks for being with us we don't have to tell you how to vote in this one because we know that you'll do the right thing and we appreciate you always being there for CPAC all right thank you congresswoman

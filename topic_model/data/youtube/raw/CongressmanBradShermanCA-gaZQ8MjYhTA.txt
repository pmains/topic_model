just show of hands because I got a limited time how many of you think we should designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism all four we all pray for the overthrow of this regime but no regime has been overthrown to my knowledge in maybe the last 50 years where they had a core of fighting men who are willing to machine-gun thousands of their own citizens if necessary that's why Iran remains in power that's why Tunisia changed dr. Terry is there any doubt that if necessary Kim jong-un can count on people to machine gun a few thousand of his citizens does he have a hard core of people with machine guns yes he does but ok now the policy is easiest for us psychologically and politically is to town the table and say will accept nothing less than either a democratic government or a human rights supporting government or at least one without any nuclear weapons we've been seeking this since the 50s um we have failed um there's an analogy to South Africa and I'm in support of all the sanctions that we can put on but we also have to be realistic South Africa had Nelson Mandela and the elites knew that they faced neither expulsion nor liquidation I don't think that Pyongyang falls quietly and softly the other point about South Africa is every country in the world of virtually every country sanctioned them in contrasts out that North Korea doesn't just face an absence of real sanctions from China it gets a subsidy from China so one can only imagine what would have happened in South Korea if the second most powerful economy in the world was dedicated to their survival and was willing to give them subsidies it does meet our psychological needs however to say we demand the matter of fact we we wouldn't signed a non-aggression pact with them back when Cheney dreamed of aggressing and so we can it meets our political needs oh speaking of that it's one we ought to have civil defense in this country some of us are old enough to remember when we had civil defense and we were under our desks that met only the political and psychological needs of our country's leaders because obviously if we faced several thousand Soviet High a thermonuclear weapons the civil defense would have done would have done us very very real good but at least the leadership of the country could say well we know that you face the Soviet Union you're afraid of that will give you something you can go under your desk now we have a foreign policy establishment that will not admit to the American people that it may fail to prevent us from being hit by not a thermonuclear weapon but something roughly 50 150th besides we could prepare to minimize casualties we won't because that will mean that we have to admit that there's the possibility we'd face casualties now missile defense is okay politically but remember you can smuggle a nuclear weapon inside a bale of marijuana I want to turn to North Korea's involvement in the Middle East they they provided the plans and the tools for the reactor on the Euphrates does that do any of our witnesses have any information as to how much money was given to North Korea in return for that very limited help I yeah I've seen speculation in the it roughly 100 million dollar figure but it's it's just the best available speculation now I ran once an indigenous program they want to produce dozens of nuclear weapons on their own but we all get what we need and we can't get what we want you've testified all of you that North Korea needs hard currency I know where there's over a billion dollars of hard currency wrapped in cellophane so you've got a country now North Korea needs about 12 nuclear weapons at least to defend themselves from us they have that than producing more this year why wouldn't North Korea sell some nuclear weapons in return for the stuff inside the cellophane does anybody ever reason why they wouldn't do that okay dr. Chung no I mean the historical record shows that they've sold every weapon system they've ever developed so I wouldn't expect it would be any different with weapons of mass destruction the Chinese to prohibit non-stop flights between Tehran and Pyongyang and I think that it wouldn't that the United States has to make clear that we would hold China responsible for allowing that flight there's always a reason to stop and Beijing and get some fuel and I'm confident that nothing goes through the Beijing Airport that the Chinese don't want one last question we face number of problems with China the South China Sea north korea a trade deficit I know the easiest thing for us to do is pound the table and say we're going to get a beneficial resolution of all three of these if we had to prioritize those three issues what would we do and I realize you folks are not economic you're more national security so how do how do you rate the need for Chinese cooperation with regard to North Korea with the need for China to be restrained in the South China Sea anybody willing to assess those two priorities or just take the easy road of saying dammit we should get everything yes ambassador I would resist the questions of course we should resist all questions in which we don't get everything we want it because it's politically unacceptable for us to accept less I think because they're interrelated and I and I might sense about the way diplomacy will work with Beijing will not be that we can trade things off quite that way I the art I I will point out that the present policy has utterly failed to get Beijing to either limit what it does in the South China Sea or to really pull the strings on Pyongyang and if you're going to advocate that somehow we're going to get them to do everything by demanding everything you'll need to do it on another members time because I'm I'm at a time and thank you mr. Sherman and thank each of you for being here today

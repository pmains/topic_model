elected officials safety is taking Center Stage after house Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul was so brutally attacked inside their San Francisco home last week ABC 7 news reporter Leslie Brinkley spoke with three members of Congress about their concerns about safety the incidences of hate has increased 900 percent and threats to lives of members of Congress just in the last four years and staff think about that Congressman Costa was part of a panel meeting in Oakland on supply chain issues but also on everyone's mind their safety I drove myself here I suspect the other members drove themselves maybe their staff took them but no we do not have full-time protection or even part-time protection at all unless there's a very specific threat I don't think it's appropriate to talk about exactly all of the security issues and details for obvious reasons but uh you know this is an environment where there's so much hatred the legislators all say those who report being most threatened do get extra protection from the Capitol Police this summer ten thousand dollars was allocated to each member of Congress for additional home security like camera sensors and door locks that ten thousand dollar stipend for home security is helpful uh but it's not like I'm gonna go to sleep better at night because of it what keeps these Representatives up at night is fears of repercussions for others in the public eye even those at polling places but can the city clerk get protection can the poll worker get protection obviously if somebody wants to do something there's not much I can do except put my faith and trust in the people I represent and explain to Americans that the better angels in all of us really require us to tone down the rhetoric I think what the public can do is is push back on this environment this hateful environment and and not stand for it in Oakland I'm Leslie Brinkley ABC 7 News

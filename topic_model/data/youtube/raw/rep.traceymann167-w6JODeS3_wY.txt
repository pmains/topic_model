hi congressman tracy mann joining you from my washington dc office uh for this week's man minute update a lot of things happened on the floor of the house this week a lot of appropriation bills came through you know we are calling this uh instead of the omnibus package the bloated bus package realize that the biden budget as proposed would add six trillion dollars to our debt we are approaching 30 trillion dollars in debt already very very concerning to me would add another 6 trillion the democrats in the house took what biden asked for on a handful of bills and increased it by as much as 20 percent on average 21 way too much money bad for the big first bad for our taxpayers bad for future generations uh voted against it one thing that was included in that or that was not included unfortunately is the hyde amendment language so the height amendment is the language that prevents taxpayer-funded abortions we actually offered up i offered up an amendment um to the budget by unanimous consent uh it was objected to and there's been multiple attempts by me and others to insert the hyde amendment language so far uh the uh that is not the house democrats have not been willing to add that language which is really disappointing to me but we are going to continue to fight that fight and work for that also this week you know a lot of talk about covet again i strongly oppose mandates the government should not mandate mass the government should not mandate people get vaccinated the government should not mandate vaccine passports you know we are all free americans the government should private vaccine which they've done to provide information uh and then it's up to individual americans and kansans and i trust people in the big first to do what's right for them and for their family they don't need the government telling them um what vaccines or what shots they should or not should not put in the body of them and their kids so we will continue to fight any of those efforts to make things mandatory uh tooth and nail had a subcommittee hearing this week talking about the cattle markets i'm on the livestock and foreign ag subcommittee on the house ad committee i voiced my concerns uh that i appreciate there was the subcommittee hearing but we need to that needs to be a full ag committee hearing in my view this is the biggest issue facing agriculture right now certainly the one of the biggest if not the biggest issue in the big first i adamantly advocate for the free market and for our farmers ranchers cattle producers feedlot owners to get um you know to be rewarded for their work and a lot of concerns with what we've seen in the cattle markets over the last really 18 to 20 months voice those concerns at the hearing and will continue to advocate there this week um the lesser prairie chicken back on the radar you know we are fighting back this regulations that's coming down from the bite administration the the time to give comments was to expire at the end of this month which will be tomorrow we ask for and we're able to get a 30-day extension so if you also have concerns about the lesser prairie chicken being added to the threatened species list please go to www.regulations.gov and you can voice your concerns we want as many kansas as possible to uh to join us in pushing back against this harmful regulation for agriculture for the oil and gas industry we also hosted a telephone town hall meeting this week have thousands of participants there and and i'm getting ready to fly back home to kansas we have a family reunion out on our farm and corner this weekend and uh we'll look forward to seeing audrey and the kids in salina uh we'll be back in kansas for the august work period we're gonna have a lot of stops a lot of events all over the district and look forward to seeing you there if you need anything at all from me or contact me anytime at our washington dc office here or at our office in dodge city or manhattan and until next time have a good day thanks

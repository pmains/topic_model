my dad was a navy chief petty officer in world war ii and for a long time after that my uncles served in world war ii one in korea and i was privileged to serve some gosh five years of active duty as a naval flight officer and another 18 years as a naval flight officer in the cold war and uh gosh four years before all of that is navy rotc midshipmen in another believe it or not eight years as the commander chief the delaware national guard when i was privileged to be delaware as governor i spent a lot of time in my life being in and around the uh the armed services happiest of the happiest memories of my life are the time that i spent in the navy best friends in my life for the years that i spent in the navy excitement travel uh the opportunity to go to college uh on the gi bill uh and as an avr otc midshipman so i got a lot a lot of wonderful memories of of the uh my time in the military when i think of the military i don't just think of the hardship and time away from home i just think about all that that i was able to realize and take away from that experience with me in my life and the best friends i've ever had even still are the people that i serve with overseas and later on in the naval reserve it's pretty easy to recognize or identify somebody in in uniform to know that they're serving that active duty as an active duty or reservist or as a member of the the guard it's a lot harder to know somebody has served before whether it was in world war ii or korea or vietnam or the persian gulf war when you find out that someone has served make a special point of thanking them whenever i run into vietnam veterans we served over in that part of the world when i do i always say welcome home because for a lot of us we didn't get much of a welcome home at least nothing like our veterans do coming home today so take advantage of those opportunities and just say 12 welcome home we're proud of you and grateful for your service

so tonight and a story exclusive congressman Matt gates in his first national television interview since the tweet that set off a firestorm ahead of the michael cohen hearing here is the tweet it is now deleted which led to an investigation by the Florida Bar Association and may lead to a house ethics inquiry as well hey Michael Cohen do your wife and father-in-law know about your girlfriends maybe tonight would be a good time for a chat I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison she's about to learn a lot here on the story the former chair of the House Oversight Committee said this about gates tweet about Cohen when asked if that was a mistake it was more than an error it's indefensible it's not persuasive you know the president has a lot of really provocative allies like Matt he could stay to have a few more persuasive allies people like John Radcliffe Elise Stefanik people who in actually make the case but threatening a witness then I'm going to leave the criminality to others but threatening a witness like that in a tweet you're not helping the person you're trying to help you actually look guilty as hell when you do things like that so I'm glad he put took it down but he never should put it up strong words from trey Gowdy and congressman gates will respond to that in moments but first chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel with the back story tonight Mike Martha good evening first it was that controversial tweet and then congressman Matt gates continued his attack on the House floor I guess tomorrow we will find out if there is anyone that Michael Cohen hasn't lied to does he lie to his own family does he lie to his Finance ears do he lie to his finance ears who are members of his family the congressman did not stop there the attack continued in an interview with Fox we have got to find out who Michael Cohen lies to and if there's anyone Michael Cohen tells the truth to he lied to the IRS he lied to three different banks he lied to Congress and now he's going to jail for lying my objective is to figure out whether or not he lied to the people closest to him and I think that says a lot about his veracity and his character hours later House Speaker Nancy Pelosi fired a warning shot on Twitter writing I encourage all members to be mindful that comments on social media or in the press can adversely affect the ability of House committees to obtain the truthful and complete information necessary to fulfill their duties then late night gates apologize Speaker I want to get to the truth too while it is important to create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Kohn it was not my intent to threaten as some believe I did I'm deleting the tweet and I should have chosen words that better show my intent I'm sorry gates face bipartisan criticism from fellow lawmakers it's wrong I think it's disgusting I'm glad II I'm glad he apologized but you know in addition to just being appalled at what looks like a blatant effort to intimidate this witness despite the apology the very public attack could lead to more headaches for congressman gates Martha Mike thank you very much so joining me now exclusively to answer some of these questions is congressman Matt Gaetz congressman thank you for being here tonight to face some of this criticism we think for coming in so let's start with the tweet itself what was your motivation what did you hope to accomplish by tweeting that about Michael Cohen and girlfriends and his wife and his father-in-law well I think the clips you've showed from my statements on the floor and other interviews reflected the context but that doesn't excuse what I did that was wrong and that's invoking someone's family and so I want to say publicly what I've said privately to Michael Cohen and to his family that I'm sorry if it is entirely appropriate to test the truthfulness of a witness but that could have been done in a way that didn't invoke someone's family and I shouldn't have done it what did you have what information did you have that caused you to write that tweet did you do you know something about him that that other people don't know I mean obviously you know he said he's had his credibility issues there's no doubt about it but but why why the girlfriends I mean did you was that your idea or you know some people have even suggested that President Trump wanted you to write all that stuff yeah I mean to get into all of that would would be to continue to reference someone's family and I'm just not going to go there Martha but you are but you are right that Isaac Dover of the Atlantic reported that I was on the phone outside the Longworth office building talking to President Trump and someone did at time overhear me say the words I was happy to do it for you and you just keep killing it the problem Martha is I wasn't talking to Donald Trump 8:37 p.m. I was I got a phone call from Florida Governor Ron de santis Ron de Santos and I spoke for 13 minutes and he was calling to thank me not about Michael Cohen or payoffs to porn stars but because I had made a recommendation to him for someone to serve on the Orlando Airport board a friend of mine named Randall Hunt and governor de santis said well you know I appreciate you doing that for me I said hey governor I was happy to do it for you you just keep killing it and what's crazy is that even though Governor De Santis told the Atlantic that he and I were on the phone that we had that discussion they still haven't issued a retraction or taken down their allegation and it continues to be repeated across the mainstream media in the Washington Examiner in the Miami Herald and so look what I made a mistake I should not have invoked someone's family and I am here to take responsibility and to say that I'm sorry but when the media goes after President Trump when they tell lies about me about when they repeat the lies that Jesse smollett Thoth showed like it really enrages a lot of Forgotten men and women in this country who are tired of the media's all-out attack in the absence of facts and we saw that again today so I hope that Isaac Javert in the Atlantic will retract something that Governor De Santis has already told them was false so you have proof that that phone call at that time was between you and and gorgeous and us in Florida so we would respect there should be a retraction and we'll see if you get it did you ever did any time did the president ever you know encourage you to you know he was out of the country and obviously the White House has said that they were very unhappy that that hearing happened simultaneous simultaneously with the North Korea meeting did he ever encourage you to to mix it up a little bit on the Michael Cohen issue or to show up at the oversight hearing which you also tried to do absolutely not I spoke to the president before he left for Hanoi we talked about completely unrelated matters and I never spoke to the president when he was in Vietnam or the way back now I'm not going to get in the business of talking to the media about every time I chat with my friend the president or every time we discuss advice or an issue before the country but I certainly could tell you that there is false reporting about me there is there is no proof like we live in a world now Martha where the media can report something that I was on the phone with the president they can have no source no witness no identifiable person and then in the echo chamber of the media they just continue to report it despite the fact that it is a lie it did not happen and we ought to have better journalistic integrity than that all right let's talk about the investigations because I know that you you know you took down the tweet you apologized for you spoke to Michael Cohen about it correct I did and what was that conversation like all right look I felt that in addition to apologizing publicly from invoking Michael Cohen's family that I needed to apologize to him personally and so I reached out to him I told him I was sorry he sent back a very gracious message to me and I am grateful that he accepted my apology and the spirit that it was intended in a raucous political discourse and an investigations we can disagree about substance we can look for ways to expose inconsistent statements but we can do that with it without invoking family and look Martha the reason your network has me on a lot is because I'm one of the leading voices defending the president this was an error on my part but my errors are not errors of omission their errors of Co mission where I do a little too much fight a little too hard and this time I cross the line and I hope that it's a better sign of Valor that I'm willing to admit that well you know I think everybody can can appreciate that and I think it's right that you reached out to Michael Cohen doesn't really matter what I think about it but you know I think that you know what most people would say that that's the right thing to do what about the Florida Bar Association they say that if the rules were violated because obviously you are well aware of the rules of witness intimidation and how it works in the law they say they will vigorously pursue discipline against you if their investigation shows that you were trying to intimidate a witness I have not heard from the Florida Bar if I do I will respond but I think it's a real problem for State Bar Association's to be second-guessing the legislative conduct of members of Congress I mean like when Kamala Harris was saying terrible things about Brett Kavanaugh both inside and outside the halls of Congress like should the California Bar investigate her for conduct it brings disfavor or puts the profession of the practice of law in a bad light they didn't do that they shouldn't do that and so look I'll deal with the Florida Bar if they if they send me a notification but like just the fact that they are responding to allegations against me doesn't mean that there's any violation of the rules in any person makes any makes any allegation they're obligated to look into it the House Ethics Committee is also considering looking into it as well but we appreciate you coming here and answering the questions tonight congressman gage the House Ethics Committee they've got a bad record of sort of going after a lot of the president's defenders they open up an investigation into Devon Nunez that turned out to be bogus charges they've opened an investigation into mark meadows that turned out to be something that wasn't his fault and so it seems as though the people who defend the president most vigorously do spend their time in the barrel at the ethics committee so I guess it's my turn all right thank you very much congressman gates good to see you tonight Thank You Martha thank you sir

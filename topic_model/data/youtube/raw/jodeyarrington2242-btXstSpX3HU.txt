hi i'm scott knights former cultural texas family i'm here today to talk to you about something way more important than i'm talking to you about representing district 19 in washington dc we need somebody who will fight for what we are and what we stand for out here we need somebody that will represent us to the fullest extent in washington d.c that's why i want to talk to you about jodie harrington jody is a long time west texas guy a long time west texas family guy i don't think you can work for george bush for 10 years as he did and not come out knowing what it takes to be successful in the political ring i really believe that so i think that this is a real chance for us to have somebody in washington to really really really represent us and to really carry the ball for all of west texas and to carry the ball for all the people that make it all work out here and so you got to have so much persistence you gotta have a bulldog and i'll tell you one thing that guy is a bulldog in fact he played at playview high school and they were the bulldogs he is a great christian gentleman he's a good family man he's well educated he comes from a west texas family certainly he has a great heritage of texas tech but this is not all about texas tech this is about west texas we need him we really do need him and i'd like you all to think about that because he can do wonders for us you know experience is hard to come by when you have the kind of resume he has that we talked about earlier golly i want him representing me in washington d.c because he will fight like a dog for what's right for our country and our area so thank you a lot and vote for jose he had a chance to work with george bush for 10 years now if that's not a great mark on your resume then i'll buy you a rolex you

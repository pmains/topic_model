jennifer Mississippi is recognized for two minutes Thank You mr. speaker and I thank the gentleman from from Texas the entire dyslexia caucus and also the comments for many of my colleagues tonight I rise in support of the redact dyslexia is one of the most common learning disabilities in the United States affecting an estimated 8.5 million school children and one in six Americans in some form despite these statistics millions of children go undiagnosed and million more do not receive proper educational assistance the redact addresses this problem by requiring the National Science Foundation to fund research that promotes greater awareness of how to identify students with dyslexia and how to tailor a curriculum to better fit their needs the redact also aims to put more resources in the hands of parents teachers and students as an original co-sponsor of this bill a member of the bipartisan congressional dyslexia caucus and as a parent who has seen firsthand the challenges facing today's dyslexic students I firmly believe that research focused on practical applications is needed to not only help understand dyslexia but also to afford students and education that enables them to succeed in the classroom and reach their full potential the redact provides an opportunity for a brighter and more productive future for millions of Americans for these reasons fully support the redact and encourage my colleagues to do the same I yield back

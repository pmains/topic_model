Thomasson revelries a democrat from california congressman welcome to you sir and I just want to write off the gate here ask you what you think of Senator McCain's decision and can the Graham Cassidy bill passed the Senate well first of all I'm very concerned that the Graham Cassidy bill may pass the Senate and that's why we need the alarms and really bring the level of urgency to the American people so that they once again call their senators and and make sure that they do the right thing like Senator McCain who is no coward to bullies who was a powa and it's something that all of us whether Republican and Democrats really respect and admire even though I may disagree with him I truly admire him as a human being for being an American Hero and also now even more for standing up to bullies and making the right decision in order to protect health care for the American people well look and considering you're from California I can totally understand why you're very concerned about Graham Cassady because state officials are saying that would cost California 139 billion dollars in federal funding over seven years the kinds of foundation is estimating huge cuts to the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act also big gains for those that did not expand so does this bill essentially target blue states you know this bill does disproportionately target those states that did the right thing in order to expand health care that brought down the uninsured rates in their states I'm an emergency medicine my Maine physician I'm an emergency medicine physician my main priority are my patients obviously my district my state but this is going to wreak havoc in those red states in rural America when you block grant healthcare you're basically putting healthcare in a chopping block so in other words you're gonna give States a certain amount of money you're gonna cut the funding at that level and then States in rural areas are gonna have to change their eligibility make more people uninsured cut some benefits like expensive cancer medications if people need them and also decrease reimbursements to those very same clinics and rural hospitals that they depend on for their care so even those states that did not expand Medicaid now under this plan maybe make it a little disproportionate but when you look at the big picture they're gonna suffer just as much as California and other big states so there are some Democrats who are signing on to Bernie Sanders proposal for Medicare for all health coverage essentially universal health coverage here but let's listen to what one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act told me earlier about that system Medicare for all has some pros and it has some cons the pro is its universal coverage and the program's popular the con is that Medicare is actually not a very well-managed program in the sense that there's a lot of excessive healthcare spending but in some sense the key point is we haven't really grappled with the political difficulties of getting there I think it's a fine aspiration but I still think we haven't grappled with the fact that it's gonna require a massive tax increase Congress oh do you think your constituents will pay higher taxes to get universal coverage well we don't know how much exactly they're going to have to pay because we need a CBO score on that particular bill but I can tell you that I disagree that Medicare is an inefficient costly way to administer health care Medicare in fact is the most efficient most liked form of health insurance of the American people and so I do think that we need to have that conversation about the difference between viewing health care as a commodity where only those who can afford it have the privilege of getting care to that which the American people which I believe in it's my value that health should be a basic fundamental human right viewed as a common good so that all of us have a social responsibility to take care of an individual when they're sick and we have the resources so life is morally wrong so it sounds to me like you're onboard with Bernie Sanders proposal well I think that we need to have that conversation and I'm looking forward to a CBO score to determine how much it's going to cost because that is a big concern and once we have the CBO score and if it says that it's going to be very costly to every text to every taxpayer then we have to reconsider whether or not something that average middle-class working families will be able to afford but we do have to do something about health care cost if we don't address overall health care costs like the cost of medicines like the cost of colonoscopy verse in one Hospital versus another which you see wide ranges then then then it the American people are really going to continue with this conversation about why the hell this health care cost so much so here's the bottom line what do you think's gonna happen by the cut-off date of September thirtieth man you know I can tell you that that that this bill is like the zombie apocalypse it's just ugly and it keeps coming back and it's going to wreak havoc on the American healthcare system I think that it's going to come down to the wire it's going to be very close and it could very well pass if the American people don't start calling in their senators right now and start activating and visiting their offices right now all right congressman Raul Ruiz of California thank you so much for your time sir

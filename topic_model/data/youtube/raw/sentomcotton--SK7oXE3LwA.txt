and Liars guns and money we may have to do that for Nevada America I'm you Hewitt joined by United States Senator Tom Cotton first Senator cotton your general reaction to the results of last night well Hugh Warren zevonne is a great lead and I think we'll be doing it uh in Georgia for another uh month as well uh be a lot of lawyers and money in Georgia and if you care about your guns in Georgia you're certainly going to need to get out in those rehearsal Walker in the right office um so here I would say Obviously the election results were not the big smashing blowout Victory we'd hoped for but a lot of successes first off and most important from my standpoint at the Senate is the sin is still up for grabs I think Adam laxalt will pull it out in Nevada Ron Johnson I think he's waiting for a call that puts us at 50 seat and that means that as it was in 2020 uh it'll come down to a runoff in Georgia and I think Herschel Walker with all of our support can win that runoff in early December in the House of Representatives it looks like we're going to take the majority there's a lot of uh seats especially on the west coast still waiting to be accounted but we had real good nights in Florida and in New York in particular picking up House Seats there so we're gonna be able to put the brakes on the Biden agenda uh and then obviously we had some Republicans uh who had accomplished a lot in office who delivered results I think that's where a lot of the American people are looking for especially our Governors if you look at Rhonda Sanchez's huge victory in Florida Brian Kemp running at the score against Stacey Abrams election Mike dewine smashing Victor in Ohio in your home state we had a lot of Voters coming out and rewarding Republicans who had effectively steered their states through difficult times over these last four years even in places where we came up short like my good friend Lee zeldon who still ran a great race in New York he helped us carry across many house members as I said so although it wasn't a huge Victory a lot of us had hoped for a lot of bright spots and I think we'll get back to work in the Georgia election next month and then hopefully we'll have a senate and a house in Jordan begin to deliver on an agenda that can help reverse the damage that Joe Biden and the Democrats have caused this country on the last four years kind of like what I lay out and Only the Strong to rebuild our military and secure our border uh to achieve energy Independence to crack down on crime in our streets now Senator cotton you announced earlier this week you will not be seeking the presidency in 2024. I wanted to confirm that for audience and you did it before the selection got nothing to do with this election would you just explain it to people so they hear it from you and not from me sure Hugh Anna and I had reflected and prayed on the decision over the last couple months but as our boys who are seven and five we're back in school and I was on the campaign Trail we began to realize it's a particularly challenging time to be gone six or seven days a week for two years you know that they were four years younger they probably wouldn't even be aware that I was gone and if they were four years older they would understand why it matters and why the sacrifice is worth it in addition to being able to travel and participate on the campaign so I'm I'm pretty confident Republican primary voters can find another nominee and probably a pretty good one but I know for sure that my boys can't find another dad for the next two years and as my my seven-year-old Gabriel uh learns to hit the fastball and little league over these next two years and my five-year-old Daniel learns to read I want to be there uh to help teaching those things and I I wanted to make that known to all the many generous kind supporters who encouraged me to run over the years before this midterm election or before the presidential election gets underway because our decision was about our family not closing the book entirely on potential uh future campaigns but closing the 24th chapter and going to keep working hard in the United States Senate for the great people of Arkansas who if I could just flag one other big victory last night to you I extremely extremely uh thankful that the good people of Arkansas level-headed very sensible rejected a recreational marijuana initiative I also want to thank the good people of Arkansas for putting Sarah Huckabee Sanders in the state house you have a great partner and a governor your colleague your seat mate from Arkansas also winning reelection and Sarah's going to be a superstar for everyone who needs a superstar to come in for them as is Governor DeSantis uh I think that um the biggest winner of the night for the Republicans Governor DeSantis and Sarah Huckabee Sanders Ted Bud one I know you helped him out and and uh Ron Johnson one I know you helped him out but we did get over the line in New Hampshire or Pennsylvania or Tiffany Smiley or Joe O'Day what do you think held him back Tom Cotton yeah those are some disappointing losses especially this morning about Tiffany Smiley I've known Tiffany and Scotty mail for a few years they've been great champions for our veterans and I was with her and her kids on the campaign Trail late last week um no I think in the end in some ways we we saw a replay of the 2020 election and the Georgia runoffs in 2020 I think it's probably betting that we're gonna have another Georgia runoff we just have a closely divided country um and our candidates who have record in particular um you know have able to deliver results for the people performed really well last night like we talked about earlier some of the governors like Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott Mike dewine some of our Senators well you know Marco Rubio won the Smashing victory in Florida as Tim Scott did in South Carolina and Ron Johnson won in very tough circumstances in Wisconsin um so like I said I think in some ways it's a bit of a replay of the 2020 election in a closely divided nation and small differences can make a big difference uh you know we had some great candidates in districts that were hard to win like hung cow in Northern Virginia a district that you abide won by double digits he almost pulled it off but that's just a tough District you know you had Benjamin Netanyahu on for a great interview earlier this week and he finally just pulled out a victory after uh five uh elections in recent years in Israel in some ways it's the same Dynamic so some small differences here and there in districts uh can make a very big difference in what is otherwise a closely provided country it has been now for a few election Cycles now plates are grinding each other and eventually one gives and one one doesn't and we are in a 50 50 country and the Senate of the United States will matter so I don't see any retirements from the Supreme Court in the next two years so I don't think we're gonna have a knockdown but we really need Herschel to stop the worst judges we and I think that is the message that we've got to save the courts in Herschel Walker the guy to say if it comes down to that and Adam laxalt wins let me talk to you about the nrsc looking forward who is going to run the nrfc for the next cycle when so many seats are held by democrats and they're fighting What republic basically had to fight a multi-fight multi-front war this year so right now the only uh candidate of which I'm aware is Steve daines a outstanding Senator uh from Montana uh when we're back in Washington next week in session uh we'll start to have our leadership choices um so uh like I said I don't not aware of anyone other than Steve daines running for that I was on the campaign trail with him Steve that's a very accomplished Senator knows how to win tough races you know he was in one of those races in 2020 that the Democrats spent tens of millions of dollars on uh yet he pulled it out by a substantial margin and as you say we've got a lot of great pickup opportunities around the country as luck would have it many of those States like West Virginia and Pennsylvania Ohio New Mexico Montana our big energy producing states and as I as I outlined in Only the Strong energy Independence is not just vital for our uh Prosperity here at home but it's also vital for our national security and support for our allies of abroad so with a new Republican house and hopefully New Republic looking Senate after the Georgia runoff I think that should be one of our priority issues Senator let's talk about China the happiest man on the planet last night was President XI because you've made the case and Only the Strong and we talked about it all last week we have to plus up defense spending we have to get serious about it and I'm not sure even a one vote margin in the Senate will allow us to do that because we have some Senators who are very leery of defense spending on our team and the house has got some isolationist I mean just outright isolations I don't think we have any isolationists in the Republican caucus in the Senate but what do you think will even if we get Georgia and and Nevada is it possible that we can plus up defense to where it needs to be as you outlined in Only the Strong it's you I hope so I mean the biggest obstacle of course is the Democrats um and it's not just they're opposed to more spending on defense but they're willing to hold defense spending hostage as I explain in Only the Strong uh defense spending is different from other kinds of spending you can't base your strategy on your budget you have to base your budget on your strategy which is based on the threats you face and the threat we Face from China is great um so we got some good new Republican Senators coming on you know you had JD Vance on the show the other day and he made some outstanding points similar what I've been making for years about the need to spend more on Commercial off-the-shelf technology and take advantage of our Cutting Edge uh Tech sector here in America some of that you see happening in Ukraine right now uh with things like the starlink internet uh systems or um you know custom made 3D printed drones we need more of that uh in our Department of Defense as opposed to multi-decade multi-trillion Dollar programs uh that seem off budget and and over time unfortunately Democrats don't see it that way they're willing to hold up and delay defense spending unless they get the same amount of you know domestic and typically welfare spending they want so we'll see what some of those Democrats and vulnerable States uh states that were close to one way or the other in uh in the election last night have to say when we get back in the cycle but of course if we control both the house and the Senate we'll be able to set the terms of debate and bring the bills to the floor and force those Democrats uh to take a position on it so Republicans are disappointed because um my original numbers of R plus one and the house by 25 are not coming true we might get the r plus one in the Senate but we're not going to make 25. uh what do you tell to a disappointed Republican this morning well as we said I mean obviously we all wanted a big smashing Victory I would have liked it a lot more than R plus one and R plus 20 or 25 in in the house but uh we shouldn't undermine or uh uh underestimate uh just how significant it is to control the House of Representatives even if it's a smaller majority than one might lie or for that matter if we can win the Georgia runoff to be able to control the Senate I mean that sets the terms of debate that allows us to stop the worst of the Biden legislative agenda I saw this in 2013 2014 my one uh term in the House of Representatives when we had a republican house didn't accomplish everything we wanted of course but we were able to control the agenda in the House of Representatives and that's a huge Victory coming off two years of overreach by the Democrats in Washington so I know that everybody there's a lot of races that people would like to won but again small small shifts and the electric here and there can make a big difference um and I think we're going to see that again as we head into this runoff our job just encourage all of your listeners to be prepared for that do what they can to pitch in a few bucks if they're in Georgia maybe help get out the vote if they're not in Georgia you know it's nice down there this time of year so you know yeah vacation a little bit and not only that everybody who can is going to go to Georgia and help I may have to go down to am 920 and set up that last question for you Senator cotton uh polling was off again this time it was off in the Republicans favor are we ever going to get is it worth using for anybody well as I told a lot of folks leading up to the election um I wouldn't want to count on polling error one way or the other um it better be uh far ahead as you once wrote and you know if it's not close they can't cheat so it's always better to win you know the way Sarah Huckabee or the way John Bozeman won in Arkansas last night um but yeah polling is uh is a material thing and it can be uh very difficult especially as fewer and fewer people have landlines and more and more don't pick up unknown numbers um so the best thing you can do I think from the results last night obviously is just be a strong effective leader that delivers results for your people a growing prosperous economy and Safe Streets and sound schools for kids that's what you saw in Brian Kim's big victory in Georgia Ron Sanchez's victory in Florida Greg Adams Victor in Texas um the wine victory in Ohio plus a lot of our Senators uh who have been great effective leaders in the Senate like Tim Scott and Marco Rubio blocking and tackling it still matters Senator Tom Cotton keep coming back and I hope Only the Strong continues to sell maybe we'll actually persuade some Democrats to support to try and detergent from taking Taiwan we will find out Senator Tom Cotton Only the Strong still available at amazon.com thanks for joining me on Election mourn where everyone was up late

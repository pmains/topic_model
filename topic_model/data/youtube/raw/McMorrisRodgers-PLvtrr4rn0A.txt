Thank You mr. chairman I move to strike the last word I strongly support the teaching health center graduate medical education program and its positive impact on the on increasing the number of physicians practicing in America living in rural Eastern Washington I know firsthand the challenges of getting doctors into the rural areas in my district in eastern Washington as well as all over the country I want to thank chairman pallone and the ranking member Walden for their work in extending this important program for another four years I appreciate the chance to work with mr. Ruiz and together get this legislation passed I look forward to continuing to work with you as this package moves to the floor and ensuring continued robust robust funding for this important program we need to be mindful of the effect that short-term level funding can have on the stabilization and the expansion of these important programs that's why I'm happy that we in this legislation are authorizing the longest extension that we've seen in the THC GME program

[Music] so investigations into the Biden's have been quietly percolating in recent months but they could soon come back to the forefront as Joe Biden emerges as the candidate to beat in the Democratic race for president many Republicans want to probe possible ties to corruption involving his son hunter Biden who profited from a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president my next guest is leading that charge and planning the first subpoena in a Biden verissimo probe joining me now exclusively is Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee senator thank you good to have you with us this evening so obviously you know this is greeted with sort it's embraced I think on the part of supporters of the president who have long said that there is something that doesn't smell quite right here and then others look at it as something that could be a very political attack so here's Peter Baker White House correspondent the New York Times he says look you know Briscoe wasn't oh this is soundbite let's buy it look you know barista wasn't necessary in the Republican playbook when Biden was down and out he was a fourth place fifth place finisher in the early primary states and they had bigger fish to fry now Biden of course is resurgent you're gonna hear a lot more about Purisima and hunter Biden so what do you say to that senator well first of all I appreciate you using the words we've been quietly percolating this investigation my investigation possible corruption the Obama ministration dates back to Hillary Clinton's email scandal it was our oversight that ended up releasing most of the Peter struck Lisa page tax I joined chuck grassley investigation into possible DNC involvement with Ukraine to affect the 2016 election back in 2017 and so it's not our fault that Joe Biden hunter Biden got wrapped up in the whole Ukrainian story but we're not closing our eyes to this and I have no idea why anybody would object to us obtaining records from a US consulting firm run by former Clinton administration officials that is basically using hunter Biden's name to strong on the State Department to curry benefits for a corrupt Ukrainian oil company so that's what we're trying to do here but but our investigation and our oversight is much broader than just this Ukrainian story with hunter Biden and even the DNC and you know I mean the fact is that if as former Vice President Joe Biden says there was no issue with any of this then they shouldn't fear anyone looking into it and as you point out these emails that were sent to the State Department are sort of you know wouldn't you please talk to the folks from this firm by the way hunter Biden is on their board right I mean that that's definitely a suggestion that that name really should open this door right yeah precisely and of course yeah the news media's saying there there's just no evidence of well that's because they have they've never looked and so Joe Biden has never adequately answer these questions I've said repeatedly if there's wrongdoing the American people need to understand that if there is no wrongdoing or if it's not significant the American people need to understand that but Martha again the other things we're looking at for example we sent a letter working with Senator Grassley to attorney general Barr asking him to declassify for footnotes that because they are redacted in the IG report really make parts of that IG report misleading we've also asked the National Archives to look for records of five meetings that occurred between January and June of 2016 between Ukrainian prosecutors who can you crane Ian's embassy officials White House staff DNC officials we've gotten a response back from the the National Archives that there could be a response in excess of 10,000 pages we're just waiting for President Obama's counsel to release those to sign a waiver so we can get that information so again our investigation is far broader the American people deserve to understand what happened they need to know the truth what do you say to those who say that this has been debunked that the timeline doesn't match up that you know by the time he joined that board those issues were we're over what's your answer to that one of the things we're going to we are preparing right now is a timeline and it is incredibly interesting and it raises all kinds of questions it connects all kinds of dots and that really you know what I'm hoping to be able to do within the next couple months is gather enough information verify it through things like this subpoena and then issue at least in the interim report so the American people can see what this possible corruption is and again it's it's bullying from a well-connected swampy consulting firm and you just have to ask ask the question what was yeah why was why was prosecutor general shokan fired I can't get that from the US government I know it's a big explanation that everybody wanted him fired but there's a document you know we have to verify but there's documents supposedly in contemporary has said that the contact by Blue Star to the prosecutor general officers all about apologize for the myth apologizing for the misinformation campaign conducted against chokan kind of raises some eyebrows some questions that need to be answered I I would I think we're all interested to see how that timeline matches up in you're right there really hasn't ever been a really true investigation of all of it and if there's nothing to worry about on the Biden's team then they then they don't have anything to worry about senator Johnson thank you good to see you tonight have a great night YouTube

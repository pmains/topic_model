joining us now is Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin who opposes the tariffs good to see you senator Morgan Chris how you doing alright first let's deal with the I'm doing well thank you first let's deal with the politics you wrote a letter he doesn't care how does that make you feel as a GOP senator oh listen I don't expect anybody to agree with me hundred percent of the time so you know on trade there's obviously a wide divide within this country and between individuals so it doesn't surprise me President Trump has had this position literally for decades but I come from a manufacturing background I've exported a product to 20 25 different countries around the world I understand global supply chains and I just view this as potentially if it's widespread if it's targeted toward China depending on how its tailored I mean I have a problem with it because that is really where the root cause the problem is the the gross oversupply within China right and and their trade abuses but a generalized tariff that would actually harm allies harm American consumers by the way harm American workers that use steel in production hurting their competitive nature in renewable markets as well I'm opposed to that all right so there so there are two obstacles here and we should discuss them both the first one is whom is he helping ok the promise is attractive to his Basin to workers in general you're gonna make it better for us we're gonna have more jobs but is that true when you have so many more workers literally exponentially more affected because of their use of these materials then the workers involved in the manufacture of the materials sure well one study after President Bush tried to do this in 2002 said that they're about 200,000 jobs lost in steel using industries you were talking about somewhere between six and a half to seven 1/2 million workers in industries manufacturers that utilize steel versus probably under 150,000 in steel mills and so you'll have to wonder what would the increased prices do even for those workers than steel mills now maybe a couple Mills might open up maybe a few more jobs might be created but you're literally risking hundreds of thousand jobs in all the other industries that utilize steel their costs going to increase their products could be less competitive on global markets and oh by the way American consumers will pay higher prices as those steel workers for higher priced goods because the the raw materials increased so if it's that obvious on an economic level you got to ask why is he doing it anyway impulsivity aside do you really think that he might be just loading the deck for a trip to Pennsylvania for a special election in one congressional district I really can't answer that I do know it's actually very disappointing that free and fair trade is not politically popular I don't understand it myself again having been in manufacturing participated in global markets but there's been a fair amount of demagoguery on all sides the aisle on this issue and so American public in in general does not support free and fair trade and I think that's unfortunate I think it's just too incorrect economic position to take the second obstacle is this is not power derived from his seat this is power given to him by Congress back in the 60s there is a threshold that the president has to make the case that it is a matter of national security interest do you believe that threshold is met I don't believe so the figures I've seen the Defense Department uses about three percent of American produced steel our largest supplier foreign supplier Steel's Canada I'm pretty confident the Canada's a very solid ally of ours any friend of America so I don't believe it really meets that the national security threshold at all and now their latest move may work against them in the White House now they're saying first Pete Navarro said I don't know how well you know him but he was somewhat of a nondescript character in this White House until this issue came up and Gary Cohen got squeezed out over it now Navarro seems to be driving the bus on this that's politics he said no exemptions can't make exemptions sends the wrong signal when you have any exemptions now they're saying there will be exemptions and it's probably Canada and Mexico and that's because of forcing the hand on NAFTA but if it's about NAFTA then how is it about national security well being the senator from Wisconsin what I do know about NAFTA is that Wisconsin actually has a trade surplus with both Canada and Mexico and one thing that's kind of lost in this whole conversation when we talk about trade deficits now I would much rather export 2.3 trillion dollars and have a trade deficit they'd have a trade surplus and only export a trillion dollars as well as the fact in the private sector suppliers treat customers really well America we are the world's largest market the world's biggest customer and so our suppliers other countries that import into our country really ought to treat us well and they do and so our trade posture can really be an effective foreign policy tool doing awful lot of good we can wield an awful lot of influence because of that and again if we start engaging in trade wars I just don't believe anybody wins a trade war quite honestly there there may be people that that are harmed less maybe America is in a better position but I just think there's so much collateral damage I think it's a very risky and dangerous strategy

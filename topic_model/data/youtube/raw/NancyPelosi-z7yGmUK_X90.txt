thank you Miss fluked for coming here today to share the testimony you were banned from giving last week when chairman Issa rejected your testimony before the Oversight Committee he argued that his hearing was not about contraceptives and was not about women's reproductive rights he said you are and i quote a college student who appears to have become energized over this issue and the quote and that you are not quote appropriate or qualified and the quote to testify and that you did not have both the appropriate credentials and the quote to appear before the committee obviously everyone on this panel disagrees with him as I SAT there and listened to the Chairman tried to explain his position I looked out on a panel of men I could not help but wonder what credentials did they have to talk about the importance of the pill to the lives of women in my opinion the Chairman committed a massive injustice by trying to pretend that the views of millions of women across the country are irrelevant to this debate and that is what really offends people even if they did not agree with you miss flu there is no reason to silence you that is no reason to deny you a voice in the debate or let it literally a seat at the table so I thank you for coming here today to finally give the other side the side of millions of women across the country who aren't safe and affordable coverage for basic preventive health care including contraceptives I look forward to hearing from you today let me add that I fully understand the religious component of this debate my mother is a strong and independent woman who commands respect she is also a woman of faith and has been an independent pastor in a small Pentecostal church in Baltimore for all my life I understand the importance of this issue to all women including women of faith that is why I commend the administration for the accommodation it made to allow women working at religiously affiliated organizations to obtain coverage for conferences contraceptives directly through their health insurance companies unfortunately in last week's completely one-sided hearing was not an isolated incident right now a nationwide campaign is being conducted at both the state and federal levels to outlaw are many forms of commonly used contraceptives these efforts includes legislation and ballot initiatives in multiple states as well as legislation proposed right here in the House of Representatives and the Senate intended to outlaw the pill as well as other forms of contraceptives such as IUDs the so-called morality legislation is intended to permit any employer including including for-profit sector companies to deny insurance coverage for contraceptives that are contrary to their religious beliefs or even broadly to any of their moral convictions finally under this legislation a CEO could decide to ban coverage of the pill for unmarried women employees he could deny coverage for routine prenatal care and testing he could deny coverage for medically prescribed IUDs all in the name of undefined moral convictions madam leader I am obviously not a woman so I can I can never fully understand how central this issue is to the lives of millions of women across this country but I am here today to support their right to exercise control over their lives and their bodies and to make sure that they are never ever never ever denied a voice in this debate with that I yield back

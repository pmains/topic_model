um and mr hud i just want to thank you for uh your excellent report uh and work uh identifying the problems um and trying to identify solutions to those problems if i am i remember i i used to think that the secretary of homeland security should be somebody with like our background a prosecutor law enforcement type and then then i thought no i think it may be a general would be like some military guy that could really run a tight ship you know would be like perfect for that job but more and more i'm starting to think that what we really need is a business leader at the top somebody that when i look at the problems of dhs and how to fix dhs so many of these issues are management related more than anything acquisition related or management um i'll leave that for the next president whoever that is to make that decision but you know i think like steve jobs who was just brilliant uh in terms of business if he was looking at his latest version of the iphone and suddenly it cost 200 percent more than they thought or yet cost overruns or it was it was delayed you know they were getting announced it was going to come out in september they didn't come out to like two years later um you know in the private sector this just wouldn't and i understand this is a different animal than the private sector but um that would not fly in the private sector and so and there were these 2008 guidelines i think dhs you know put forward which were good and i think you identified that mr hutton in a report and yet the department doesn't follow it for some reason so let me just mr hutton just go to you first if you could just tell me what you um if you could just simply identify what you could perceive to be the problem what you see would also put forward as the fix to this problem thank you chairman um there's a number of points i think i could make on this one you referenced the private sector and what would the private sector do the thing i would point out is that a lot of the processes and the steps and the decision points that you'll see in the current directive is really based on commercial practices and it's all about also managing risk and the the private sector will at the early stages decide what kind of portfolio of projects they might want to take on and they may have varying risks but they have constant revisiting at early decision points what do we know about these risks what is it going to cost and you kind of whittle down over time what they think is executable and what's going to help the bottom line of the company but it's based on knowledge it's based on stakeholder involvement that could be the chief financial officer business people so the process is uh set and you're asking about the execution the way i see it that 08 directive was a real important first step and i say that because some of these requirements were in fact in place before o8 they required a lot of this knowledge based approach in fact we issued a report in 2005 that said even what they had in place then resembled a knowledge base approach largely and it was all about execution i think what why i say 2008 was important because what they did was try to come up with a common language to explain what they want the components to do and how to do it and they work very closely with the different components to adjudicate a lot of comments get a lot of understanding a lot of conversations and so it ended with that particular directive but i think that was a real important step because now everybody is talking a common language and i think should have a good understanding of what the requirements are why is it not being implemented i'd say largely there's there were some capacity issues i believe around the 08 time frame you had the acquisition program management division and the cost they set up a cost analysis division i think you might have looked around eight people nine people i believe uh four years later they're up in the stages of shooting towards a roughly 55 and these are folks that are going to help manage the the process through the department help provide cost estimating support so i think capacity was one part of it but i also think it's leadership and having uh someone at the usm's level that um will drive the uh the process and insist on uh adhering to the governance process and i think our work is showing that since january we're hearing more and more of the desire to do that well it's good you know four years later now just suddenly the light bulbs on that gee we had a solution to this that we set forth in a directive four years ago now we were thinking about implementing it but it's been four years and and so i guess to the other witnesses and i know miss waters you just came on board in march it may be unfair to pick on you but why can dr nayak can you speak to why this has not been implemented and why it's taken four years to finally get this idea that gee we uh we came up with a solution four years ago that may work and now we're just finally starting to implement it so happy to uh add to what mr hutton shared uh you know look it i've been here for a little bit less than two years and i think mark a little bit more than that and obviously karen's new to her role uh and so it could could possibly be if we use four years tomorrow four years as the marker that transition uh you need steady leadership over time and we've had it and and now we do actually have the results uh as mr hutton shared a couple of things i just want to generally share with you sort of on a positive note and all under the heading of acquisition generally speaking gao recently issued in this month i believe a report on management integration one on procurement oversight at the department as well as this report that we're discussing today um lots of positive news in the management integration report about the things we're actually doing the things we're executing against that 08 directive that we've revised procurement oversight i think was one of the better gao reports i've ever seen and that's really in my wheelhouse we've been we've enhanced procurement oversight um and in in investment management in this report we recognize as mr borkowski pointed out there's cleanup to be done and we're doing that um we uh so we're we've been living it for the last two years it kind of starts out with the integrated investment life cycle which essentially is going to have at the front end like a joint requirements body fed by sort of functional information that cuts across the components so that in the front end of acquisition we're going to be discussing commonalities and what major requirements should be actually become programs eventually after looking across the enterprise of what we already have as well as even what other agencies have and dod has so you don't you won't ever get programs birthed without being fully informed that's the first thing but on the back end where we've got lots of cleanup to do in the acquisition review uh sort of world and our more than 500 programs 127 major programs and what we classify as level 1 and level 2 about 40 of each of those we've got lots of things in flight and are actually getting results so for just for instance because it's been mentioned here do we have enough credible cost estimates well we didn't in the past uh is it increasing the answer is yes do programs go through arbs uh and are they ever delayed are they ever stopped the answer is yes so we are forcing a first of all a common language so everybody across the department now is informed about program information the same information through the dst through the quarterly program acquisition report and this and and also congress is through our comprehensive acquisition status report we're more transparent than ever about everything that's going on with our programs meanwhile we double back behind to do the cleanup work while also making sure no program gets birthed uh unless it goes through this integrated investment life cycle so i'm pretty confident that moving forward uh that we need time to just ex just execution and and we're doing it today so it's not like we're saying we need two years to begin execution we're executing right now i think that's the good news the bad news is you're still on jao's high risk list uh despite all this good news mr barkowski yes i'd just like to also highlight there's a difference between knowledge management and documentation see that's that's part of the challenge here right so you mentioned stamp um stamp we believe has the knowledge management but it's not documented in the appropriate format so the question that we have and this is part of that balancing past and future do we go back and capture that knowledge management in the now current formats or do we accept that the knowledge management is complete another i think that you might find intriguing is that in the case of sbi net that scored very highly in terms of the documentation complete and yet we know what the status of that was so as we do that balancing between past and and future it is very important we get in a common language because one of the problems that the department has with stamp is okay we have to spend all of this time confirming knowledge management if we had had it in the right format that would have been nearly the lift it is but i think that's important as we look at digging out as opposed to going forward it is very important have a common language but let's not confuse knowledge management with documentation ms waters do you have any remarks no thank you okay you're very smart uh is it mr hutton is it it's my understanding that in terms of procurement or acquisition that it's still very siloed within the department in terms of the 22 different components coming together they're still not they're not really brought together is that correct well if you uh take it from the point of view of program management in the large acquisitions i would say that they're breaking down some of those silos because what they've done is the program accountability and risk management group they moved it up under the under secretary of management and they now and then they establish a component acquisition executive so now you have a link between the department level governance process and the component level to work together to ensure that the department's requirements are being met and then folks like mr burkowski will work within the component so that when they are going to an investment review meeting that through his great work he's going to ensure that they do have the knowledge they do have it properly documented and i'll just say documentation is important though because it has to go forward to the department department is buying off on these large investments many of them that are going to cost you know go out 20 years costs billions of dollars and you have to know when you're approving those programs at the start that you're making that commitment because if you don't know that you may end up at a point in time where you start managing so many programs and the budgets forcing uh decisions where you start adding this funding instability and other things that we talk about which then starts creating uh problems for the program managers to be able to execute their program so i think the documentation provides that added uh buy-in from the department uh but it also facilitates some accountability as well yeah i think you're making make a good point i mean i can see how you know somebody in the department's like yeah i got all this paperwork i got to do and i i just they think it's kind of cumbersome burdensome and not necessary but when you are talking about particularly these level one programs i mean they are they're billions of dollars and i can't think of it in the private sector i think you know that would they would certainly have a you know i think paperwork that would have to be you know completed so from what i'm hearing from you though these silos are not there there is a merger now in terms of acquisition policies is what you're saying that's happening well from my view now there's more communication i think there's better understanding in our survey and i would recommend everyone take a look at our survey in the back of the report it was an outstanding survey the 77 major program offices that we uh surveyed had a 92 percent response rate but there are a whole bunch of questions in there that give a reflection of the program manager's view program office's view of their their initiatives that they're undertaking now what they think about parm's role harm actually got and i'm saying that as i'm surprised but they really got some pretty high scores in terms of familiarity with what parm's doing and also what value they think parm is bringing to the programs and this is fairly recent and that's why i think our survey is really like a health assessment dr nayak has a nice health health assessment for its procurements but if if people go into that survey there's a lot of questions that aren't really teased out in the report but it's going to give you a good insight of what the ones that are on the ground trying to make these programs work what they think about the department's requirements the department's initiatives and things like that that said i do want to make one point though sir um in january of 2011 is when we kind of started really working you know back and forth with the department in their efforts to get off the high risk we submitted five outcomes to the department in the acquisition management area back in september 2010 january 2011 department came out with a strategy to get off the high risk which includes acquisition management that strategy was about 55 pages and we had uh some feedback to the department where we thought that strategy could be improved they've had subsequent six-month period strategies they're now at a strategy not saying more pages is better but they're at about almost 300 pages in their current strategy but they're starting to better link the outcomes that we expect them to take as to the root causes why they haven't done it in the past and so i think that back and forth has helped a lot in in promoting this but one of the major features is this integrated investment cycle model and what our survey that was introduced in january 11. what's a little concerning to me is that when we surveyed the program offices uh 32 of the 47 uh of the program officers and this was response in the january of march of this year said that they really weren't too familiar with it yet so i think if you're going to drive this down through the organization i think it's imperative that they keep talking and communicating yes it's not fully developed yet they're working through a lot of different things we're open-minded about the approach they're taking we want to see it play out it's there it's their solution but we think communication with the components and constant interaction will help create a better likelihood of a good outcome in that effort yeah and your it's actual point though they still remain on the high risk list are you optimistic that dhs will be off that list in the future near future sir um for context dod has been on the high risk list for acquisition since 92 the department since 2005. we're talking as dr brokowski said these are very complex systems it's a lot of money there's a lot of inherent risks you take it back to the need to go through a knowledge-based approach you're not going to get perfection even with the best knowledge-based approach it comes down to individual decisions you make at each point in time along the way and so i would say that given the fact that they got so many programs without a lot of the foundational documents that can allow them to have the insight to make those good decisions given that they have to get those uh developed and and also approved by the department so they know what they're buying and what capability they're buying i appreciate you and i appreciate your kind of relationship and view of this i mean it's like a diagnostic test like a almost like a doctor would make an analysis on your health and you're not doing quite as well so you're on a high risk list but here's how you can get off of it and i think i think that kind of relationship working together is the productive way to move forward and and get off the list and i i hope hopefully i can share in your optimism at some point that they'll be out the list last point because i'm taking a lot of time but i can i guess it's just the two of us um i can't mr broadcast i can't let you go without asking about one of my favorite issues that's border technology and you and i went down there and looked at some dod assets technology and i still think you know given these budgetary constraints we live in that um and you know mr clare and i talked to the generals in afghanistan and iraq about transferring some of this technology and leveraging as existing technology within the federal government that we've already invested r d money into it's nothing you have to recreate this stuff and i know you have some good news on that front but i want to give you an opportunity to maybe talk a little bit about that issue in terms of what you're leveraging and where do we stand at this point in time with respect to the border and the technology initiative well very quickly we have built a much stronger real-time relationship with various elements of the department of defense that are helping us through this so we are aware of the availability of all kinds of technologies everything from non-intrusive inspection systems to aerostats to hand-held you know long-range uh night imaging information we've received a whole inventory of those things i've sent teams out to army depots to survey what's in that inventory and prepare to perhaps lay some claim to some of those things and for some of the systems in particular aerostats and the towers that support them we've actually worked with the department of defense to evaluate those systems on the texas border in august we actually had two aerostats and two towers and what we find by the way is that these things are very effective systems what we are evaluating is what do they actually cost for us what do we have to do to train our people we want to make sure that we don't go into this without complete knowledge again that's knowledge based uh we don't want to do the sbi net thing with the dod technology we want to make very clear that as we go into doing using this technology we are aware of what is the complete what the complete bill will be i will tell you that those uh particularly those aerostats are very effective so we're in the process of evaluating those results making some trades with cost looking in the inventory of things that the department of defense has that are oftentimes more modest things in fact um the relationship is such that the department of defense the pentagon's a couple blocks from my office has actually left some of these things in my storage room so that we can actually try them out that way so i think the relationship is getting better i do want to be a little cautious we do need to do some cost evaluation to make sure we can actually afford them but it looks very promising good to hear i got a phone call from commissioner aguilar actually updating me on the aerostat program and specifically in texas and i just actually just want to say how much i appreciate getting that phone call and i thought that was a real positive step to say hey here's some good news what we're doing on the border um are we still looking at that when do you yeah i think the defense is up you get more personnel we can always use more resources but you know when i hear it's going to take 10 more years to secure the border that this didn't go over well with my constituents where are we right now well with the arizona first of all the dod systems the dod systems the way that we're currently looking at them they give us an opportunity to put some deployments and a shot in the arm in areas that the arizona deployment doesn't cover right so we're still planning to do that arizona deployment but as you recall the rest of the border was intended to follow that we reserve the option working with you to change that we are seeing things for example going on in southern texas that concern us but right now the plan is to buy the things for arizona and then extend beyond that so one advantage of this dod interaction is it may give us systems outside of arizona more quickly than we thought having said that the arizona plan itself many of the smaller systems have been bought those agent portable surveillance systems which we went and looked at down in laredo we have 15 of those in arizona we've been using them continue to evaluate them mobile surveillance systems are coming online we've been doing some testing with the vendors but that's about done those will come online the two big items that people spend time on are the remote video surveillance system cameras those are day and night cameras that go on towers and the integrated fixed towers which are cameras and radars tied together in areas both of those are in what we know as source selection we've sent out requests to industry for proposals the bids have come back in the remote video surveillance system is coming close to the end of that process we have to evaluate those the integrated fixed towers will take a while now there's a good news bad news to that we got so many more proposals for that than i have ever seen in my life and it takes a long time to do due diligence with those proposals so i'm very very pleased by the number of proposals we've got because that suggests that all the communication we did with industry on its non-developmental it doesn't have to do everything if it does a lot and it's a good deal that's good enough it seems like that worked the downside of that is i've just got to slog through all all of those proposals but we do have the proposals in we are in the source selection process for those i do think those integrated fixed towers are really going to transform the the security down there on the border and and i i agree i mean i i i sort of empathize with your situation where i'm we're pressuring you to get this done as quickly as possible and yet then we we're pointing the finger in procurement acquisition failures and that sort of thing so you got a lot of proposals coming in you got to weigh them and make sure you're making the right decision um i would appreciate if you just continue to update me personally and i think the committee as a whole because um you know we get asked about this issue a lot when we go back home and and i think if i can give my constituents and others on the committee a more positive outlook that that would be uh good because i think the current uh impression with a lot of the american people is that it's there's no security at all down there and that's in fact not not the case you and i know that uh but the more updates you can give me the more i can be a messenger that another we're actually moving forward so uh i appreciate that and with that i recognize the ranking member

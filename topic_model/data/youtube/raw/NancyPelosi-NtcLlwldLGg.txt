and for yielding and for giving me this opportunity as a mother of five children when I brought my baby youngest baby number five home from the hospital that week my oldest baby was turning 6 years old a birth of a baby is such a jubilant occasion and women's health is essential to the health of families of raising our children in a way that has respect for all of them it's very interesting that we're taking this bill up now when the American people are calling out for jobs their number one priority is the creation of jobs and once again we come to the floor of the house with a major distraction that ain't gone nowhere in order to cater to an extreme agenda author of the Republican majority the American people want us to take up jobs they want us to take up the American Jobs Act which three-quarters of the American people say they want us to consider it would create nearly two million jobs or we could vote on the China currency legislation which would save 1 million jobs and has the support of the majority of the members in this body including 61 co-sponsors from the Republican side of the aisle but again instead pursuing the Republicans ideological agenda forcing us to relitigate a very divisive issue every woman in America should be very concerned about this assault on women's health let us begin the debate with a very clear understanding of the facts the federal funding of abortion is already and has been for a long time prohibited under the Hyde Amendment except in cases of rape incest or to save the life of the mother furthermore the Affordable Care Act prohibits the use of US taxpayer dollars to fund abortions that is why the Catholic Health Association said we are confident that the health care reform does not allow federal funding of abortion and that it keeps in place important conscious conscience protections for caregivers and institutions alike I repeat the Catholic Health Association said we are confident that the health care reform does not allow federal funding of abortion and that it keeps in place important conscience protections for caregivers and institutions alike this bill is a radical departure from existing law it represents an unprecedented and radical assault when a woman's access to the full range of healthcare services for the first time this bill places restrictions on how a woman with private insurance can spend her own private dollars in purchasing health insurance as a result of this bill million using health insurance exchanges are likely to no longer have access to insurance policies that cover all reproductive services furthermore supporters of this bill falsely claim that this bill is simply a restatement of the Stupak amendment considered by the house in 2009 it is not this bill is very different from the Stupak amendment it appears that health care providers could withhold care for women with life-threatening conditions in other words a woman could be dying on the floor of the hospital and when you vote for this bill you will be saying that caregivers would not have to would not allow medical professions to medical professionals to treat that woman and keep her from dying the Obama administration has come out strongly against this legislation rightly saying it intrudes a woman's reproductive freedom and access to healthcare and unnecessarily restricts the private insurance choices that women and their families have today so just a few points again public funding of abortion is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment accepted Raikes cases of rape incest life of the mother the merit Catholic Health Association says we are confident that the bill does not the Affordable Care Act does not allow federal funding of abortion and that it keeps in place important conscience protections and for caregivers and institutions alike and third it is not the Stupak amendment this legislation is bad public policy it is the wrong priority for Congress is an assault on women's health and women should know that it prevents them from using their own dollars to buy their own private insurance should they be part of an exchange urge my colleagues to vote no and implore the Republican majority to turn their attention to what this country needs and that are that is jobs jobs jobs and more jobs with that I yield back to them gentlemen woman's time as it's

if President Trump has had a great first year you look at the numbers on the economic front where the market is the amount of new jobs have been created into the millions unemployment as at a 17-year low consumer confidence at a 17-year high on the judiciary front getting Neel Gorsuch confirmed on the national security front I just got back from the Middle East a couple days ago it's my third year visiting the troops in Afghanistan Afghanistan Kuwait Jordan on this trip I have not seen their confidence as high Isis is getting wiped off the map all across Iraq and Syria our military is feeling good about it it's being very clear for Isis that any type of caliphate that they want to establish under a trump presidency is going to be a caliphate in hell they're they're getting wiped out out of Iraq but also seen extraordinary gains in Syria and on the veteran front we passed an expansion of the GI Bill that the President signed into law the whistleblower protection act for our Department of Veterans Affairs getting passed and signed into law so I'm just giving a few examples of where I think the president's had a great 2017 and I stand with him I support him it doesn't mean we're gonna agree a hundred percent of the time but that's what you know this is about working together and hopefully more wins in 2018 well and you know Congress I know you were tweeting throughout the day about the protests we're seeing in Iran and you had tweeted that the big difference between what we saw in 2009 when President Obama was criticized for his inaction or for you know for standing on the sidelines a lot of people were critical in saying that and so you said the big difference between that and now is because President Trump we're seeing leadership so can you kind of tell us a little bit about you know what's going on and what you anticipate or hope to see from the Trump administration and addressing this well the president's leadership right now is critical we need to learn our lesson from 2009 President Obama missed an opportunity millions of Iranians back in 2009 in the green revolution protesting an undemocratic election took to the streets they wanted to overthrow the Iranian regime President Obama basically said it was none of our business and we weren't involved at all president Trump understands that these are this an important lesson learned that this is an opportunity making sure that we're not going to be propping up the wrong regime anymore it's the Iranian regime now that is calling America the Great Satan they're pledging to wipe us off the map they testified in a continental ballistic missiles and violation of UN Security Council resolution it's the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism financing terror they have blood on their hands with dead US service members overthrowing foreign governments these are just some of the examples and Iranians are taking to the streets they're emboldened and President Trump is sounding off on it he's standing he's realizing that we can't just say this is none of our business if there was a free stable democratic Iran like millions of Iranians want the Middle East would be better American national security would be stronger our allies would be stronger a military would be safer and the president recognizes that the president realizes that American exceptionalism is nothing to apologize for American greatness is something for us to be proud of he's unapologetic about his a love for America and understanding that our enemies they are adversaries don't respect weakness they only respect strength we can't be silent not because we want more but because we want to prevent it well thank you Congress so we appreciate your time tonight thank you thank you and Happy New Year Lisa thank you you too

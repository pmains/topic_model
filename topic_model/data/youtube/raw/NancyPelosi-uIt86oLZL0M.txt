good morning representatives good morning my name is Lisa Floyd and for nearly fourteen years I've worked as director of volunteer services as mentioned for an area nonprofit hospice which serves both West Virginia and Ohio I have worked my entire adult life having had three jobs my whole career and I had never been unemployed until now I'm 67 years young and I'm capable fully able and eager to work I need to work I love the work it's Who I am I was laid off in May 19 2013 due to lack of funding that was complicated by the sequester earlier in the year I have spent the majority of my waking hours looking for work during this time I was able to support myself because I received those vital unemployment insurance benefits unemployment benefits have helped me scrape by week to week even even with him I'm not able to pay my portion of expenses pretty apartment I share I'm trying to find a job is it very trying to find a job is a very difficult thing construction work is a hard find in a winter and outside and outside of my industry from what I've seen potential employers see my age and look right past me we have very little pre shovel income coming in in fact it's just my state unemployment that will end at the end of this week so I am going to be one of those 1.3 million Americans on the EUC in 2013 and to face the fact that those benefits end at the end of this year is truly creating destruction within me I have very sleepless nights I wake up with fears and tears and I just don't know what I'm gonna do without unemployment insurance and the Federal Emergency benefits I would have not been able to sustain myself in my job search I could still buy groceries and pay my bills my anxiety who was kept to a manageable level and I was able to keep sending out applications and going on interviews I still get up at 4 or 4:30 every morning that's Saturdays and Sundays I'm actively pursuing work through my Union and elsewhere things should pick up for me in the spring I'm looking every day for hopes of getting something sooner because I hate not working and it's this fear is keeping me from moving forward and pursuing these activities and and from pursuing my job search today I think I'm getting a new spark now in the 8th month of my job search I'm happy to say that I have secured a job just three days ago and although my new job pays much much less than what I was making it is a good job with a livable wage and for that I am very grateful if Congress lets see you we see programs shut down I won't be able to put gas in my car you can look for a job tell me how that's they're going to help me and help others let me get back to work don't allow them to shut this down please invest in America that's where you get you'll get results for the economy to grow I am an emergency unemployment compensation success story won't you please allow this to be America's story thank you you

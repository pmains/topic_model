again the president criticizing his Attorney General joining me now is the house whip Democratic congressman Steny Hoyer from Maryland congressman thanks so much for being with us appreciate you being here I hope you had a chance to hear what I was just reading this new statement from the president criticizing a new the Attorney General for calling for an investigation and divisive abuse well the president tends to call out his friends and his foes for anything that he believes they're contrary to his interests and I think that he's undermined clearly Attorney General sessions in a lot of different ways from the very beginning most of all of course for recusing himself and therefore not being able to fully protect Trump from what the facts may show so I think it's a continuing unfortunate modus operandi of the price of the United States to undermine law enforcement undermine the Justice Department undermine the FBI undermine the credibility of anybody who's trying to get at the truth and put yourself in the attorney general's shoes I mean he was once a lawmaker like you could you work like this I don't think so I don't think I would tolerate being undermine in in so many different ways by the person who asked me to be the Attorney General of the United States and a person that I had supported very very strongly and and frankly uniquely in many ways being one of very few who were strong supporters of Trump's and believed he could win from the very beginning but the president is loyal only to those who are absolutely an unquestioning will be loyal to him well on that point hope Hicks you know whose communications director testified to the House Intelligence Committee yesterday apparently told them that she sometimes tells white lies for her boss does that concern you well of course but say what the white lies were so we don't know how important those lies are it doesn't sound to me like it's cleaning the swamp up it is adding to it when hope Hicks who obviously is one of the president's closest advisors apparently in the White House will not tell the truth about what's happening in the White House the American people have the right to know what's happening and the fact that she admits to White Lies heavens knows what else might be the case because other than that she was unwilling to be very forthcoming look if the Democrats do take back the house you think there's a 90% chance I've read you say that before is this the type of thing you would investigate would you be calling on the House Oversight Committee to be launching an investigation into this book I think one of the reasons that Americans are going to vote for Democrats to take back the house is because they want to check and balance on this administration whatever they think of the administration they obviously don't have a lot of confidence in their continuity or their transparency or truthfulness and I think they're worried about this administration would want to see the checks and balances that our founding fathers had in mind operate in a way that the founding fathers thought it ought to do as a check on executive power so that I think that that clearly would be something we would be looking into yes America is watching Washington today congresswoman to see what you do on gun safety on school safety yesterday I watched bill Pascrell stand next to you and say you know Paul Ryan has lost his guts here you know what do you want to see come to the House floor look we have 67% of the American people who think we ought to deal with assault weapons which are the weapons of choice for those who want to kill a lot of people very quickly in public places whether they be schools or restaurants or concert venues restaurants nightclubs the American public one action they certainly want action 97% of Americans which means the majority of Republicans independents Democrats all believed that we ought to have background checks that do not have any loopholes that we know who are purchasing weapons we find out whether they have mental health problems whether they have criminal problems whether they're domestic abuse a person's whether they're terrorists whether they can't fly on airplanes because of the danger to the air air public the fact of the matter is America wants action and well to have action and the press and the speaker has said we will take on the tough issues one at a time we'll have the courage to do that well he's not doing that he hasn't done it in so many different ways but certainly on this issue we've filed to discharge petitions one to make sure that we have everybody has a background check and two that you can't get a gun until that background check is finished not just 72 hours later if the background check is not approved you get the gun anyway that's the roof case in Charleston where the individuals who were killed were in a church so I think the Americans want action they expect action and we ought to take action we'll see what happens today after the president meets with lawmakers of both parties congressman Steny Hoyer thanks so much for being with us appreciate your time thank you okay all right want to go now to Abbey Philip at the White House again we just heard

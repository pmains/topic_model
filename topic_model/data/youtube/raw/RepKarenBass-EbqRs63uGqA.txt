feda congresswoman Karen bass from California who serves on the House Judiciary Committee so she knows what she's talking about here I'm gonna ask you congresswoman good to see you what are your next steps well bright and early on Monday morning we're gonna have a hearing and that hearing is going to involve a presentation from the intelligence can be intelligence committee about their findings so we will be examining the evidence yesterday we were looking at the Constitution the framers what they had in mind but on Monday we'll be actually looking at the evidence and I think we'll probably do that for a couple of days and then we'll take it from there whether we get to writing articles or not we'll take it one step at a time all right let's talk about the question the discussion that is ongoing about whether or not or why or not to include elements from the Mulla report into the into the report I just want to read you from The Wall Street Journal reporting about representative ELISA Slaton from Michigan a Democrat who said your colleague who said she hadn't decided how to vote on impeachment but would oppose a kitchen sink approach that included mr. Muller's findings what do you think of that and what what's your take well I know that that's the debate that we're gonna have I would agree with her in terms of opposing a kitchen sink approach the question is whether or not including the obstruction of justice amounts to that there are so many examples of wrongdoing from this president I do think it's really important that we're focused that it's clear that it's easiest to understand and so we will have to make the decision do we just look at abuse of power do we look at the examples of obstruction of justice and and determine it from there that will be the discussions that will take place next week you heard my conversation I think with Jeff Rossen talk to you about Professor Turley and the case that he was making for the Republicans what do you think of it well actually I was kind of surprised by the professor I thought that they would have had a much stronger witness because part of what he was saying as well is that he wasn't saying that the president shouldn't be impeached he just said we don't have enough information and we need to wait now what is ironic about that and I know you know this very well it's the president that's stopping us from having any of the information so what about obstruction of Congress I mean that's something that we're gonna have to look at you remember when ambassador sunland from the EU testified a couple of weeks ago he was testifying from his memory now he is still an ambassador but the State Department won't allow him to look at any of his notes so you have the president that doesn't even want for employees to testify before Congress that's why we had to take the whole McGann situation to to the courts and then you know you have john bolton well if he wants to come forward he could come forward for whatever reason he's teasing all of us with tweets maybe it's because he's trying to drive up the amount of money he's going to make for his book but I feel a tremendous sense of urgency because the difference the fundamental difference for me is that the Mulla report was about the 2016 election what happened with Ukraine is about the 2020 election and we need to do everything we can to stop the president from intervening in the next presidential election what's your thinking on timing you said you will take this as it unfolds you'll start to write the articles of impeachment as you get the necessary information is there some timeline about doing this before Christmas that you're we do not have a rigid timeline but if I had to make the best guess I would say before the end of the year the question is whether it's before Christmas or after congressman Karen bass thank you for joining me today congresswoman Karen bass is from California and she's a member of the Judiciary Committee

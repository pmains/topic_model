hi i'm virginia senator mark warner thank goodness as people get vaccinated we're starting to put covet in the rearview mirror that means people's thoughts turn to travel whether travel around the country or travel internationally and if you're thinking about traveling internationally you've got to make sure your passport is current my office currently gets about 10 emergency requests for passports either new passports or renewal passports every day to make sure that this you don't fall into this problem please do the following if you've not traveled internationally before well in advance of your travel submit a passport application to make sure that it can be processed in time for your trip if you have a passport make sure that it is current if you need renewal again you can go to the passport office or contact our office for assistance sometimes now the state department is saying it can take up to 10 to 12 weeks to get either a new passport process or a passport renewed so get ahead of the game you want to make sure that that long awaited trip takes place make sure you've either got a passport or you get your passport renewed in a timely fashion thanks so much

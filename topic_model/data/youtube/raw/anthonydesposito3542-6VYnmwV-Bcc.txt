well good afternoon everybody I'm Don flavin the 10 tips that supervisor and I'm joined of course by my colleague and government councilman Anthony D Esposito Anthony how are you good and of course ahead of our EMS right here in the town of hempstead dr. Dave Aziz referred to doctor is always that it's great to have you here good to see you super him good good Sarah may I help all of you that are watching at home are safe and are comfortable for our Facebook live interaction where we try to feel the number of questions before I begin I do want to go over a couple of important announcements as many of you may know back in March I joined with the receiver of taxes Gina Driscoll and all the former members asking the governor to extend the second half tax payment that has now been extended that has been extended until June 1st to pay you secondhand school taxes without penalty go to the tad website if you'd like to more details on that as well as the three additional drive-thru locations the receiver and I have put in place at various locations throughout the town that will be available so as you can simply drive up to one of these windows make your tax payment there and get your receipt that will be in addition to the drive-through locations at 200 North Franklin those are implemented with conversations with our our head doctor here in the town to address social distancing and there's a safe protocol in addition to that I'm happy to announce that everybody that we will be going back to our full recycling and sanitary schedule pick up starting on Monday May 4th again thank you for all of you understand a necessity due to staffing and making sure for the safety of all the the men and women that are our essential workforce down in sanitary district and working with us I know some of it some of us are very passionate about our recycling and I know that many of you aren't and we heard it but now through the again the the advice of our are treating physician as well as the Commissioner of Sanitation we think we are back to not having any scheduling problems due to the pandemic so the schedule will be back in full force starting Monday May 4th right back to your regular regular cycle of sanitation and recycling with that Mabley can also start off with a little bit of a little insight a little update of what dr. Dave has been seeing taking place out there at our hospitals and you could share with all of us yeah sure super president hi everybody so good news we've been talking a lot about the curve and the number of patients and how people have been doing you know we can't let up on what we've been doing with social distancing and you know wearing masks now we don't have ours on so we can talk to you but we all we all have them with us so we can put them on when we're done it does appear right now that the folk coming into hospitals that we're seeing a less lessening of that volume which is really good news that does indicate that the curve is indeed flattening and starting to now come back down on the other side you know we still need to continue doing what we're doing because we do not want it to go back up again we've heard me references before 1918 our last pandemic that we dealt with the second peak after the first one was actually the worst one and we don't want to repeat that and that happened because after everyone did the right thing and everything was looking better they loosened up on the restrictions and then the virus spread again so you know the virus is is not going to give up so we don't need to give up and we can't give up until we until we have the chance to get this you know defeated once and for all but the good news is is that possible is Asians are you know new hospitalizations are going down it appears that new cases are going down you know it appears that you know for right now we're getting a hold of the situation so I do like to bring that good news to you guys that what we're doing is working continue to be the greatest a billion responders that you are and and doing what you need to do to prevent the spread and will continue from there you know just wanted to really thank everyone in town government our great work force for around I guess kind of getting used to the new normal I think when we started this whole process over a month ago it was we were really unsure of how long this was going to be and I think that we are we've all reached agreement and kind become comfortable with the fact that this is the new normal for a while and I think the what dr. Dave mentioned is critically important we can't let our guard down we can't forget that we need to follow protocol continue that social distancing because it does matter and just as although we are seeing improvements we can quickly get back to a really disastrous area yeah and it's you know it's not just the work of our town a folk but all those in in the hospitals and nurses and doctors are first responders everyone has just just done such a great job and to see all that work bring us a step backwards would be terrible so I think we really need to make sure that we can continue the steps in the right direction I just you know wanted to say thank you to the supervisor I know that over the last six or seven of our facebook lives there's been thousands of people that have joined us have watched with us have communicated with us ask questions and I know that one of those big questions is always about recycling and it is important people really do feel strongly about and I think it's great that although you know we're not back to a hundred percent being our normal selves we are you know making the steps necessary in order to continue providing the services that we've brought here the Tanna have said and i think that that's what's really been our mission from day one day one we were unsure how long this was going to go we weren't sure you know how much of our workforce we were going to have to you know be without how long we were to have our buildings closed for what we've kind of come to the new norm and I think that the fact that we're making steps to bring us back to where we were over a month ago is important so great job by quality oh and just good guys along with what the councilman was saying um I know a lot of people were scared to go to the hospitals and to go to doctors offices when the coronavirus was at its peak and you were seeing all these people getting sick but it's important that we take care of all of the issues that people have not just coronavirus issues so understand that the hospitals and the urgent care is that we're very good at this in a very short period of time all of us have figured out how to do this a way that we can keep the people without coronavirus safe and take care of the people with Crona virus so if you have other medical issues that are bothering you that you've been ignoring we don't want that now to become a problem for people so it's very important that if any kind of medical issue that you have you know if you feel that you need to go to a hospital do not be afraid you're gonna get corona virus from a hospital our hospitals know what they're doing they know how to keep everyone separate so we're not making it spread any further they've had a lot of they've made a lot of the hospital areas at my Hospital at NYU went through negative pressure which basically means the virus gets sucked out of the air so the air is clean I am positive that other hospitals have done the same and even the the urgent cares now are getting very good at you know letting people come in and get taken care of so just I just want to put that out there it's kind of a public service announcement before we move on just if you have an other medical problem do not be afraid to seek medical attention call your doctor's office go to an urgent care or don't be afraid to go to the hospital for something other than coronavirus because we can take care of it you're not gonna get sick there from it and we got to make sure we're addressing all those kind of medical problems so that way everyone stays healthy for all the reasons they might be so great I saw one question out there a resident had a problem with the piece of property in Uniondale I do want to remind you that if you call the main number at forty nine five thousand and report that piece of property we will have crews available to go out and take a look at I pre she ate that and I'd again you know one of the big issues and we're working with the doctor very good diligently is how reopening will be done based on the guidelines that are being set forth by the governor and the state but it's really a lot of this is based on the advice of our health professional and the steps that it could be necessary and I'd love to tell everybody out there that you know the snap of fingers everything was gonna open up be wide open and it's gonna be back to normal obviously I think we all realize it's not but when we get the information we'll provide it just like I said you know we've made the the the recommendation based on our health professional and our Commissioner that we are at the staffing levels and the safety levels for our sanitation for any leg comers so recycling full service goes back again May 4th and I know and people are very passionate about it so spread the word we're gonna be sending that out there but when it comes to you you know the golf courses America's open we're in the process of opening let me first Lito is open we're in the process of setting forth to reopen America again with protocols about how payments will receive the social distancing that needs to be taken into a place there and what could be utilized and we're doing that in all of our parks and again it is by not only sitting down with myself the board members our commissioners but with the advice of our health professional who has just been been great about it doc and that and I'll go to it every single time masks I just one of the things I think again if you explain the necessity and again show people again maybe they haven't seen how you properly put on a mess because that's one thing I've seen when I've gone out to another source people grabbing them from the insides throwing them on again I just think it's it's it's worthwhile for you to give that demonstration so people understand it and maybe you could pass it on to your fatty or your family members as well as your children who obviously you know don't maybe understand this things as well and your I need assistance putting on the mask sure I'm so just in case you guys haven't seen any of our previous Facebook live sessions the purpose of the the masks is that you're trying to decrease the the droplets the small little amounts of saliva that come out of your mouth because that's the primary spread the primary way to spread corona virus so the reason we do the social distancing and we're staying six feet apart is because if those coughs droplets if you call or you sneeze or you talk loudly those droplets can leave your mouth and typically won't go further than a few feet that six feet radius gives you a pretty good protection but there's also this thing that we've talked about previously called a super spreading incident where people if you have a lot of people in one place all of these tiny little particles and droplets that come out of our mouths can kind of congregate together and then cause it to spread faster that's why we're trying to decrease large crowds where we're trying to keep people spaced apart and now why the masks are such an important adjunct you know a lot of people in the first few days that they're sick may not realize that they're sick they may think it's allergies or they may have such mild symptoms that its asymptomatic and they don't notice that they're sick and this specific virus the twenty years ago the original SARS virus the virus very similar to this one we had a lot of health care workers sick because it was about a week and a half into the disease when it was the most infectious this one the one that we're dealing with now kovat 19 or SARS Kobe - this version of the corona virus is the most infectious in the first few days that somebody is sick and especially in that first day or two when they are spreading the virus they may not notice because again they're not feeling sick so that's why the masks are so important I'm going to show you how to put a mask on here because wearing that mask allows your cost droplets to get caught in the mask itself I'm going to show you the mask person I'm gonna put a clean one on CC so this is just a general piece of cloth councilman's got a nice looks like a superhero mask and and the supervisor has just what at the surgical mask so these are all that you know all of these are reasonable masks again we've talked about this the fancy n95 KN 95 masks those are meant for the health care workers because we are very close to the people that are sick these just general cloth masks or the surgical masks that look like that they do they can block between 50 to 90% of the particles so depending on how well you fit that mask it actually does a really good job it's not going to be good in a hospital but in a normal you know everyday sense it's going to be good for you so let's show you how to put the mask on up just real quick I'm not gonna put this one on because clearly my hands have been all over it but I just want you to see there's basically two sides to the mask of any mask mine's black so it's a little hard to see but there's gonna be an inside and the outside to the councilman's you'll see the inside is obviously decided without the print on it and then the outsides that show you want him to keep the inside and the same with the the supervisor you want to keep the inside of that mask clean because that's the part that touches your face I have basically just a bunch of these cloth ones that I that I acquired and I just use them and then I'm then just disposing it sorry putting them down so I could wash them because it's hard for me to tell the inside and the outside and I don't want to take a dirty mask and put it on my face so washing my hands going to show you guys how to do this so hand hygiene always the most important because again the virus is either going to be in those droplets or on your hands and then if you touch your face you can introduce it into your nose or to your mouth or into your eyes so hands are clean I'm now gonna go grab one of my press cloth masks again you can see on this one the way the mask rolls that this is clearly the inside and that's the outside I'm trying not to touch my face so I'm just gonna put this one goes on with my ears and then with my clean hands I'm just rolling the mask down without touching the inside because I don't touch the outside so now I have the mask on so now this is trapping my cloth droplets on the inside again you're doing this to keep other people safe in addition to keeping yourself safe you'll get some minimal filtration this way but if everyone has masks it prevents all the cough drop hoods from spreading hands are clean mask stays on I'm not going to during the time of wearing that mask be touching my face a lot again you don't want to have though you're ill you're unclean hands touching your face and then when it's time that you can ask off hand hygiene again and then I'm gonna go from my ears and remove the mask this way you notice now I'm not touching the inside which is clean the outside that's dirty and actually I can put that down and actually now we wear that mask cuz I know where my inside is so as long as you're not touching the inside of that mask the inside stays clean against your face the outside you know is the part that kind of provides you with the protection and um you know cause masks like this really simple to wash I'm asking the supervisors you can use that for a couple days - maybe a week or two if you keep it clean as long as that inside stays clean and it doesn't get wet or damaged and obviously the counselors mask is reusable and washable as well so you did a couple different ways to do this but that's the general way that the masks work and the right way to put it on and off making sure that inside stays clean making sure your hands are clean and having that to protect others so then you're not you're not spreading those droplets when you might not realize that you could be safe and you know it's like one one person Amanda was asking a question about their child has sensitive issues that he can't wear a mask and and that's some of the the things we're looking at before we're able to reopen some of these programs and against through the doctor you know there there are special places like like camp anchor that we need to have discussions about protocol that needs to be put in place as well as all the parks and all the facilities and and people are asking you know where no pools gonna be reopening well again a lot of this stems from what the governor and the state are going to limit us you know we want to be ready that we would hope that every pool will be open at a timely fashion if we can't we're working on protocols to give people as much as we can let it be the pools let it be the ocean but again that's all being done with the the insight of not only the department heads the the co-workers but with the doctor the doctor we is you know tasked with being an on every decision making because he's the health professional he should be on it and I appreciate that and like I said we're we want to get it back to normal we want to do everything we can but to avoid as he said the the second round of a pandemic we have to take protocol and you know people talk about complaining about masks so I've been forwarded photos from when the Spanish flu took place of baseball games where the baseball players were batting wearing masks and the pictures were marrying a mess and all the fans were mess so you know this is something that it seems so troublesome to some and a hundred years ago was almost the normal and again we appreciate but if some if somebody does have an issue with a child that can't you know utilize a mask or has a discomfort you know what could be some alternatives if there are any at all doctor yeah I think a couple things with the mask to the supervisors question the first would be you can see with the mask I'm carrying with me are just kind of gentle cloth masks they're basically from a company that sells t-shirts that is making masks and they're using the similar fabrics so looking out there it depending if you have sensitive skin you clearly would want to have something that you feel comfortable wearing if you don't feel comfortable wearing it you're not gonna wear it so you know kind of doing a little bit of homework to see what mask options are out there basically any kind of covering their covers the nose and mouth is going to be sufficient as long as you're wearing it regularly and that we have kind of talked about this last with anchor you know face shields that's also something now that people that's not directly on their face right so like my dad was talking about a company that was selling like a ball cap that had like a kind of a face shield built into it so I mean you have to do a little bit of homework but you I mean again if you get something that's going to stop the the droplets that could be just a mask in front it doesn't have to be directly on your face reading some articles and within the last couple days saying that you know children or adults with sensory issues you really have to get a little bit creative in protecting them and I think you know the discussion you were having with your dad yes similar to that they're making now baseball caps with the shield's you know maybe it's a favorite color or a favorite team and it just makes it a little bit more of the norm yeah and also that remember guys the the mask while it can be protective to you is definitely protective to other people so I decrease in that kind of spread of those droplets so if you have somebody that for some reason can't tolerate a mask then you have to be very fastidious that everyone around you is wearing a mask so don't be afraid to speak up make sure they're maintaining the distance and making sure that the people around it if you have a special needs person that them themselves can't wear a mask but everyone around them is wearing a mask that's going to decrease the risk to that person so that's I mean that's the most important thing that it doesn't just it's not just you wearing the mask it's everyone around you wearing the mask so that you can keep kind of a safety zone you know and I think there was there was a question it wasn't coronavirus related but somebody was asking about a budget our budget is available on the Town of Hempstead website you could navigate through there it's definitely on there last year's budget passed by the Town Board was actually a 4% Tanna hemstead tax decrease so that's available on the Town of Hempstead website if you have any questions you could give a call at four eight nine five thousand looking guide you through it yeah oh it's just real quick to the question about you know reopening things like the beaches and the pools I am in communication daily with the Nassau County Health Department the director and the Commissioner have been amazing and that's been a really good partnership that we've had and I was just talking to to them yesterday and we are going to be sure that we're in line with whatever recommendations come down from from the CDC from the state and and from the and and the best updates that we can get health-wise I'm researching this every day my colleagues are the same we talk among ourselves and then we have great connections in government the other levels of health so just understand that this it's not in a vacuum but like the supervisor said we have to make the right decisions we want to keep you safe and it's a balance we want people to be able to be socially enjoying themselves but socially distancing and protecting others and so we just have to you know figure that out together I said I guess two questions have come in related to sanitation so the first is is special pickup still available yes it is call sanitation special pickup is still available there was another question why is Uniondale seeing garbage pickup at 5:30 a.m. this is not just specific to you need to l we actually the supervisor in Iowa was a beacon to senior councilman Goosby earlier today and she mentioned it it is not specific to Uniondale it's been town wide and that's just because the schedules are sort of staggered you know some days we have a less of a workforce or different people covering different routes so for the time being you know we kind of have to work together we have to get through this all as one unified force so if you remember and if possible and if you can let's do our best to get our garbage out that night and for this way as early as a hard-working CSCA employees can get there they will and like I said it's not specific to any community we've seen it really all over the town and by the way it's it's not only all over the town actually I've I've noticed a couple of villages that the crews are going on early and that was part of the reason we had to immediately suspend recycle for the time being was for the staffing concerns you know at least generally there was certain procedure of three individuals being in a truck we had to change that procedure where we had to distance them and it was also concerned about employees getting sick and that that's that's why that was suspended and and for any of the late comers we're happy that starting May 4th the Sanitation schedule and recycling is back to full force in addition to the the one or two people who were looking for looking for a little help with issues in the community I also remind you you know for the building department the town clerk the parks department the tax office we created a separate hotline number that it's five one six eight one two 3,600 you could dial there and be directed to submit questions or reach somebody in those departments directly also if you go to Hempstead NY gov we've created a page where you can submit questions directly to those offices they have a mechanism in place that those questions will go to Department personnel either in the facility or working from home and they'll respond to those so you know we are still function as a government and yes and we understand all of you working with us that we are a limited capacity because of the restrictions that have been put on on us by the governor but your essential services are still being provided such as sanitation such as water you know we do have highway crews out there many of you remember the storm we had last week we have crews out there but again it's a two-way street and we're thankful that all of you have been great at understanding and just working with us it's like I said we want to get back to normal and we're gonna gradually get that but most importantly it's really about the safety of our co-workers as well as the residents and that has to be taken into account because if essential service departments really had not been adjusted according to the doctor's recommendations we could have had much more serious you know consequences with our drinking water or our regular garbage pickup and that's why I said a lot a lot of the decisions are entirely based on what the doctor is recommending in a lot of these procedures this is two things first I see a couple comments from marchello Luke he was actually I was a detective with him in the 73 squad I told him everything he knows about police work but he's asking about baseball fields I know both of his sons are big baseball players and obviously we are following all the protocol from the governor and our parks here in the town of hempstead are open our playgrounds our tennis courts our pickleball courts are you know closed or locked but the parks are open to utilize and we just ask that if residents or neighbors utilize the parks they obviously take into consideration the social distance they are careful about being near one another they wear a mask if it's necessary and they're unable to practice that social distance but we are doing our best to keep our parks and our beaches open because we know that people are kind of stuffed in their house and need a place to go and enjoy so the parks are open just you need to practice all that protocol and we've talked about this you know outside in the fresh air is actually safe Earth than being inside a building because again if there's anything those little kind of droplets that are still floating around they dissipate they go away when you're in a large open air area so as long as you're doing exactly what the councilman said perfectly fine to get out and get stretched you don't want to be locked up in your house but just make sure you follow the rules and social distance and wear your mask and another question at the ends right oh yeah there was a Frank from I believe from Franklin Square he said that yesterday's federal briefing a doctor was saying that this fall it will be more difficult if the cove in nineteen virus comes back with the fall flu season aren't we in the flu season now and why aren't there any regular flu statistics I think right before this right so we were seeing yeah we might have to get out yeah we were in a terrible flu season this year in fact most me and most of my colleagues believe that the corona virus probably was here for a few weeks at a low level before we got the information from the w-h-o and from other countries about the spread and it was a terrible flu season this year we had there two strains of the flu this year influenza A and B there are two versions of it and those specific strains were very very at this year we had a lot of sick people from the flu some people even got flu a and then recovered and got flu B because there are two separate types of flu viruses so so the status of I mean they we would have been talking about this this actually was one of the worst flu seasons we've seen since h1n1 and it was affecting a lot of children this year a lot of children sadly died from the flu this year more than we typically see coronavirus doesn't seem to affect children as much to be the hypertension and diabetes and overweight seem to be the three biggest risk factors for having complications from coronavirus right now obviously advanced age and immune suppressed or other risk factors and cardiovascular disease but just um we the story got overshadowed because of what happened and the pandemic and how terrible and how how many people got sick so fast but to the question of the flu season I mean absolutely this was a terrible flu season and I hope as a physician that moving forward all of the social distancing and mask-wearing and hand washing that we don't forget these lessons because people die from the flu different that you know different infection from this guys that we've talked about how terrible this is and how many people got sick and it overwhelmed our system but the flu every year is also terrible so I think that we take these lessons from coronavirus and we apply them to all respiratory diseases because we don't want anyone getting sick from the flu from corona virus from the regular cold we don't really want any of that and then the question is - what's gonna happen in the fall that's the ten million dollar question you know the the way you're going to finally see corona virus kind of disappear is you get enough people that get it and you get hurt immunity but for people to understand you know that right now they're looking at the case fatality maybe four to five percent somewhere around there the numbers are still kind of preliminary but that's a very high case fatality rate than flu which people get sick from has about a point five percent sometimes lower so I mean this is ten times deadlier than acts of if you're doing that math so you know it's it's important that you know it's important that you we do that that we understand that you have to take the steps they'll be taking and you know we don't know what's gonna happen with the flu season comes back in the fall you know if we have enough therapies for this which the doctors are working on we get a vaccine for this talking about corona virus I mean that's how we come back the flu right we have therapies for the flu like like you know medications for it and we have a vaccine for it and that's why we're able to keep the flu under control and you know for all intents and purposes so we're gonna have to follow that same playbook when it comes to corona virus we're researching treatments hopefully there's a few I'm not gonna mention names because none of them are definitive yet but we're gonna hopefully have a treatment for this and then a vaccine for it and then when we have that then probably this will be intubated flu where we'll see if you know come and go but it won't be anything like hopefully what we just saw none of us want to go through what we just went through so so the hope is that that we you know we continue to get those things you know we're gonna have to you know we're not gonna have to be avoiding each other to the extent we're doing it right now but we're gonna have to keep precautions in place and we should probably keep those precautions in place from now on for all respiratory diseases and then that way we know everyone's gonna be saying no as Marcelo kindly refer to as councilman rookie the reality is you know we're trying to open up as much as we can case in point last week the governor closed you know the ability of people to use the the docks and five days later reopen them but we put in to account safeties and protocol with the doctor about signage distancing who could go on votes who could go on the facilities the family members the fact that you're not able to tie up boats again we're trying to allow people the outlet they can but in the proper mechanism and it's and as I said it's if we can provide the the outlet for a resident let it be a part let it be a beach we ask you to to work with us and not all get together and and not have 20 people looking to to have a party or having that that football game on the grass not right now and and we understand it's frustrating we don't want to close places we want them to be open but the fact is so many people are great so many people are great about you know social distancing wearing the mask doing the right thing it's just a few that are not thinking not just about themselves but about all of us and all of you and what their actions are are potentially going to do it being a little selfish and we don't want that and and again you know and I can't reiterate you know as things begin to open the doctor is going to be looking at these state guidelines and helping to make those determinations about if and when the pools but also know that you know here in the town we are communicating with our sister towns in the North Hempstead as well as Oyster Bay but I've also been on the phone with the supervisors of Suffolk County trying to you know work together to give a cohesive unilateral you know service to residents because the township provides such great services you know we provide you know a lot of the pools throughout Long Island and all of us want to be on the same page so you know if you know we don't need somebody jumping ahead and making a reactionary closing that you know and and someone else not doing if you want everybody to sort of have the same protocol so when residents travel from town to town the locational location they'll know wherever I go this is how they're implementing it here they're not being that one that's different they're not being the one that's you know taking a different different task and again but for the most part that's a decision that's based entirely on health now something else that that Colette was typing from home and and it was such a valid point and it sticks to me I am notoriously you know I can't help myself I have itching and everything and I've really tried to train myself personally to to spray my hands and not touch you know my face it's hard and but I'm saying what I she kind of Brooklyn what's the significance of trying to maintain you know not touch your face what what's the end goal of that how is that cause this spread of coronavirus getting so close to you know your your mouth your nose or what what it may be okay so the primary method of spread of this is the cough droplet and that's what we've been talking about minimizing for the past couple of minutes here but those coughs droplets they when they exit the body will then sink to the ground so if there's a table here and say I sneeze and I don't have my mask on then there's going to be a certain amount of the virus sitting on the table we've talked about this previously is it safe to get packages yes you know can you get this from your groceries probably not just keep you know clean them as you normally should but if you are not keeping your hands clean and you're in a public place where you have lots of people interacting there's a chance that there could be corona virus that is on a surface that you then touch with your so again remember that this we had talked about this the other day this is not blood-borne this is not spread by mosquitoes this is not spread by it you know other animals typically right now the main spread is humid the humans spread so if you're wearing your mask and maintaining your six-foot distance you're likely not getting those droplets on people but then if you are doing your precautions and you touch a surface and get the virus on your hands you have to get that into your body the only way that can happen is through your nose or through your eyes or through your mouth it does not absorb across your skin I could I could rub coronavirus on my hands right now and I can stand like this and it's not gonna get inside my body unless I start touching my face because then you're introducing it into your nasal passage or your eye or your mouth and then that's how it's going to spread and it doesn't seem also to be from eating it's a little unclear on that but we don't have a really big so the thought is you're eating you're chewing it it's probably not living on the food and you're swallowing it but if you're rubbing your mouth or you're rubbing your eyes or nose and it's just kind of sitting there then the virus makes its way into your respiratory tract and then that's where the virus replicates and that's how you get sick so by doing constant hand-washing again you do like this you know say I have any any kind of you know and this isn't just viruses this could be bacteria I mean I I was a Purell you know fan long before before this and I always had this around to keep your hands clean once you disinfect your hand most more Corona fans yeah yeah yeah but so you disinfect your hands your hands are clean now you don't touch your face the virus has no way of getting into your body so think of that it's kind of your first line of defense your first and second line of defense if the virus can't get inside of you the virus can't make you second oh and so that's why it's important and it's very hard I mean not touching your face I mean you show the last time you would do this I left another guy candles are nice and it's what you say my son you know he's he's eight and one of the things he's constantly always looking at you know get it nibble on a nail or buying it something I do go through a lot my kids that it's you know this is the necessity and I tried to convince him to do something else hold a bottle or what put something else in the hand to stop that urge of bringing their hands near their face cuz they're little and they don't they don't understand it as well as as maybe an adult one of course and the other thing guys is a barrier so I'm tissues if you have I carry those little packets of like pocket tissues or a tissue box if you have an inch on your face you have to blow your nose as long as there's a barrier you wash your hands and then there's a barrier with that tissue then you're also keeping yourself safe that way as well so that's also important if you keep putting I'll keep that around if even if you feel like you're constantly itchy even like good allergies and stuff as long as you have your hands clean you're using a tissue you're not going to spread it that way either so that's another good way to do it so every every Friday at 3 o'clock our friends at Nassau Community College have a show called this week's Long Island news it's on at 3 o'clock so today three o'clock you could tune in after this 90.3 FM they have a question is there a daily accounting of Nassau Town of Hempstead nursing homes extended care assisted living group homes etc and their PPE needs like hospitals yeah I can only say at least I'm sure the doctor will go into it a little further I know that we have done our part at our Emergency Operations Center to assist any of those facilities here in the town of hempstead supervisor Clavin made it clear from Jump Street that if we could assist them or any of the fire departments or EMS agencies with any sort of PPE as long as we had it we were willing to help yeah so the answer to your question is yes the Nassau County Department of Health is keeping track of that and they are checking in with those facilities and I can tell you that the auntie Samoa director called me the other day and indicated that there was a nursing home that had a critical need for personal protective gear and we were actually able to help out the Health Department and that that skilled nursing facility by giving them some time hex suits you know we our town' workforce has been amazing when we put the initial word out at the beginning of this that our our our EMS providers who have been on the front lines and I cannot be prouder of them when we said our EMS providers need to be safe are our workers went into our warehouses and found as Tyvek suits and eye protection and the animal shelter had n95 masks that they use for some of the stuff with the animals and they gave us some of them so we have them so you know we have supplies for our people because of the the the tenacity and the creativeness of our workforce that knows how important it is to take care of us and you know I know we've talked about this we've worked extremely hard to keep the workforce safe and that's been a wonderful partnership so when the Health Department reached out to us the other day and asked if we could help we immediately answered the call and we were able to help out that skilled nursing facility so that that's that just shows how good our partnership with the health department is that we're working with each other and helping each other you know we don't have a huge supply of this where we could just be giving it out but but if there's a critical need we want to make sure everyone in the town of hempstead say we recognize that importance and I guess at our constant communication with with our County Partners has made that just a really good relationship and that allow us to serve our community better so yeah Susan I saw your point about that you thought all construction was supposed to stop some construction is allowed to continue based on the necessity and the emergency it's so there's some cases where it is a lot too but if you do have a question about it I know I think you said you lived in the village you call the village call the Nassau County Fire Marshal and for all non village residents if you see something say construction taking place and you have a question I want to make sure you know if something's being done that that is an appropriate please dial five one six eight one two thirty-six hundred and you can be redirected to the building department or submit your question via the the web page we've created at Hempstead New York gov where questions will go right to the town building department in your cases and I think it indicated you lived in the village of Hempstead so I would reach out to village officials and again and everybody's doing their due diligence if you can call the Nassau County Fire Marshal as well and they can come and take a look at it and close it down if it needs big there's a question here from Amanda who's asking what is being done to educate our youngest residents on the spread of prevention we love your fliers but kid-friendly version would be very nice thank you that's a great idea I think maybe going forward we could sit down with dr. Dave and craft a kid-friendly informational mailer to get out to our youngest town of hempstead residents and obviously this isn't going to be a short term you know we're not going to fix all this short term this is going to be we're in this for the long haul so as we all hope you know in September we're back to normal and kids are in school I know that I speak for everyone on the town board whether it's senior councilmen Goosby or councilmen Blakeman councilman done councilmen muscarella councilman Carini and obviously with the in conjunction with the supervisor we are happy to work with our local schools and providing the information just as we do with vaping and opioids and our narcan training we're happy to work with our schools and any of our kid-friendly organizations in order to provide the information that they need to keep healthy and safe Fanta corona actually and and our EMS agency again I'm very proud of them as always has taken the lead with the guidance of the councilman and the supervisor we've been doing a lot of public health initiatives and along that our EMTs are trained by me and we have educational of you know educational seminars that we do so if you know if he is a need at your location and you would like either the doctor or one of our EMS provider to come out and with the education and the knowledge we could certainly put something together that we have a you know a flier but but that's something we were doing you know with like the game of the council I was saying with narcan with vaping you know with the you know CPR and first date we've been doing all sorts of you stop the bleed you know we've been doing all sorts of Public Health Initiative to keep our community safe so this would just be another one we can add on there that if you identify a need we'd be happy to send someone out to address that need we we do that on a regular basis so I mean that's that's how we're here that which is rare for a township yeah yeah I mean that's why it's your EMS agency is really unique there's a there's a very active physician and very active medical providers that that want to help with the public health and you know and moving forward I think that we're gonna show you know continue to be the lead and making sure the government handles public health initiatives and problems and I mean from the beginning that's what we've been doing and I mean it's it's shown in spades that we're helping people and making people healthier and saving lives so I mean it's important to use with what we're doing and and also it's from great ideas like Magda you know that was just a great question to ask that you say geez what programs completely put in effect you know for the youth use the town facilities as well as maybe we could do certain educational program in communities in conjunction with school districts or other youth groups and that's what you know when you have a great idea if you could ordered to us and it's the email you know the great idea sitting in your head all alone is that the great idea to you if you could pass that on him we could utilize that we will you know one of the things that I know the councilman's always been a been a lead on has always been the the adoption program right here at the town shelter and we've had a number of people foster animals and we say to people you know if you know during this time if you want to you know utilize those services of our of our shelter and and take home as he likes to put it a furry friend being it's furry Friday you know take advantage of that you know and and a few other ideas of things to implement please email your Town Board member Emami submitted to any of the departments they will be looked at and if we can incorporate it it definitely will be yeah I mean just to follow up on supervisor claimant suggestion I mean you know many many think that a lot of our services you know are closed but the animal shelter is open and like he said you can call ahead make a an appointment and they will actually bring the animals out to you you know while we're all trying to get out in the open hair and walk and enjoy the fresh air it's nice to do it with a four-legged friend so definitely keep that in mind okay so with that why don't we em will do doc I'll have you on giving a couple of closing thoughts here yeah no I this is good we've all been working together we've certainly shown that the steps we're taking are working we don't want to let up now we want to continue as a team to work together to stop the spread again just to kind of piggyback off the supervisor if you have needs where we can help with with you know your health and ways to make it better or you have ideas that we could go out and educate our community and educate our our friends and colleagues that we are very eager about that and we get the best ideas from other people sometimes so you know just understand that we are actively daily you may not see what happens in the background but daily we are even before the pandemic we were looking out for you know the health of our citizens and our friends and families so just you know continue to communicate with us continue doing what you're doing you know don't let up on you know the fight that we're fighting because it's it's showing a really good fact right now and I can you know have some good news that it's getting better it's still long haul it's not over I mean realistically we're probably gonna be dealing with this for you know maybe another year or two hopefully not anywhere near what we just saw but that's why we have to work together we all continue to communicate with you understand that you know we all continue you know from the medical perspective to talk to our partners and and and we'll all make sure that we're on the same page and that we have the right answers or the best answers we do at the time and just be patient and understanding that we want you to be healthy and we want to do what's right for you guys so doesn't gonna keep doing oh just you know you know this weekend I'm just looking at the weather seems like sort of a 50/50 weekend tomorrow supposed to be beautiful Sunday a little bit of rain for those of you that are out there enjoying our town of hempstead parks or county parks the state parks just be careful you know keep that social distance remember that we have to have some personal responsibility but enjoy the day and realize that all the steps that we are taking are really preparing for our future because this isn't going to go away quickly but we can do our best to make sure that it ends as soon as possible definitely so just have a great weekend stay healthy and god bless and thank all of you for taking the time to watch participate for any of you Lake come Riis I just want to give another shout out to some of the initiatives that have taken place back in March they receive our taxes Jean Driscoll the Town Board members and I joined asking the governor to extend the deadline to pay for second-half taxes that has been granted second half taxes are now due without penalty till June 1st they can be paid when the I believe is starting the 22nd at the main office and they drive through there as well it's a reciever tax and I've created three different satellite locations for your paid taxes from being in the five towns down in Seaford and the last in West Hampton where you could pull right up and in your your check and get your receipt go to the town web website to take a look at further details for that in addition for all of our friends recycling and full collection is going to be backed up in 4th starting May the 4th Monday regular schedule again we thank all of you for the understanding of why this needed to be done at the advice of our doctor for staffing we love recycling and it is going to be back up and we're delighted and as as time rolls on you know we hope to bring back the other programs that have had to be suspected temporarily you know our stop program our recycling you know of you know drop-off or dropping off old electronics we we hope to bring those back up but again it will be done with advice through the professional in these cases with proper protocols being put in place and again that comes to all the parks all the playgrounds you know when we are allowed to reopen and depending on the circumstances and the guidelines that are going to be set forth by the governor and the health professionals about what it can be we will implement that we we want to be a hundred percent open we want everybody to enjoy the facilities and we are going to the best of our ability to put into place to have things open but with the requirements that are being set forth by the state and by our health professionals so with that I will sue Plaza just one more initiative that we may have forgotten just a reminder to everyone our great town clerk Kate Murray has put up a marriage license information on our website you could download the application and if you're interested in making quarantine a little bit more interesting and you need to get married our great town clerk is still accepting those applications producing the matters licenses and we are conducting marriages I know she did one today via zoom I am you know available to to handle any marriages as long

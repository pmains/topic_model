thank you mr chairman and thank you for being here today and being the senator from mississippi i too want to talk about the gulf of mexico i'm in very very close contact with the producers down there and the companies that are concerned about these leases and uh you know offshore oil and gas production in the gulf of mexico has proven so many times that it's the cleanest on the planet due to the stringent environmental safety standards that we have to meet down there it provides 15 percent of the u.s production and it is a critical source of reliable and affordable energy so despite these benefits the leases required by law are being canceled at a time when our nation is suffering from a record high gasoline and diesel prices and at the same time president biden claims his administration's policies are not holding back domestic energy production and you know we have charts of the decline of the gulf of mexico five percent since january of 2021. so my question to you as madam secretary is what does your department have against uh utilizing this gulf of mexico production for domestic energy this makes no sense whatsoever so can you just explain to me what your department has against utilizing this senator i don't i mean i don't i we are perfectly um moving forward on on all of the the work that we we have to we don't we don't prioritize you know one lease over the other or one area over the other um i i'm not exactly sure we don't have anything against why were the two leases cancelled just week before last why were those two leases canceled um are you so i'm not sure are you same time the alaskan lease was cancelled you cancelled three two from the gulf of mexico and one from alaska why were the two in the gulf of mexico canceled thank you senator um it was likely because of the conflicting litigation that is happening is that what i i believe that's what you could be talking about in the in the case of the two gulf lease sales uh conflicting litigation uh made it extremely difficult to move forward uh given the legal parameters that we were trying to deal with the timelines and so forth so are you willing to work to improve this or this decline of 5 since 2021 do you expect to increase those leases in the gulf of mexico um i know that um we are working hard to as i mentioned many times even when i was before this committee during my confirmation hearing we are working very hard to balance the the use of public lands knowing that they they are public and they belong to every single american also we know that we're working hard to with the fossil fuel programs to take climate change into account um i appreciate all of the um the information from you and senator cassidy about the about the durability and the the cl the cleanness of the gulf of mexico oil i am more than happy to make sure that we continue to work with your office moving forward i'm going to get on to my next question then um the piece that was passed along that we got hold of that early this morning christopher got a hold of that and your department informed my staff this morning that it would release the draft proposal on june the 30th and you know i suppose that that should be good news but i'm just interested is whether or not is this an admission that your department will fail to meet the june 30th deadline for the final five-year program well considering the fact that we essentially had to start from scratch on this program as we mentioned the previous administration stopped in 2018 and didn't do any more work on it so we picked that up when we got into office but i mean is this an admission that you're not going to meet that final draft deadline of june the 30th that's a yes or no yes the f the fi if yes the final draft will not be out by june 30th okay and i have one minute left the white house recently stated that the president's policy is to ban additional leasing and that is from an april 19 statement from the white house press secretary at that time it is not in line with the president's policy which is to ban additional leasing and we've seen the obvious detrimental effects that is this misguided policy is having on all american families does the interior department agree with such a policy senator what i could say is that i am guided by the law okay and it is clear violation of your department's requirement to prepare and maintain a five-year program for the offshore leasing and development so if you agree with the law are you saying that you're in compliance with this now we are working on it given the fact that of of the conflicting litigation that we had of the fact that it was the process was stopped in 2018 for three years and that we had to pick it back up again my time is out thank you mr chairman thank you

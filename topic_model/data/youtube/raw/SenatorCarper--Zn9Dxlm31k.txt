hello I have a question here from GM and Barbara from Milford I asked this question senator why did you vote against senator Coburn's amendment to win corn ethanol subsidy this decision has directly harmed the Delaware economy and costs many jobs because it has sent Allen food into bankruptcy that's not true the just a little bit of history here Senator Dianne Feinstein to California Democrat Senator Tom Coburn Republican have offered to legislation to do two things this this year one is in the 45-cent tax credit for a creation of a per gallon for corn ethanol the other is to take away the tariff that is imposed on ethanol from other countries corn ethanol from other countries that would come to the u.s. that was your proposal actually proposal i co-sponsored the Democratic Leader the Senate Majority Leader Sen Harry Reid promised that we would have a chance to vote on that amendment that bill which actually was turned into an amendment Feinstein Coburn amendment that I co-sponsored that we'd have a chance to vote on on Thursday of a given week a couple of weeks ago and Senator Coburn tried to use a parliamentary maneuver to bring the vote I to the same bill underlying bill two days earlier I voted not to allow him to do that he's one of my best friends as it turns out but the Democratic Leader majority leader had already said given us assurances we could vote on the amendment on Thursday and the idea that anybody else from our party or the other party was sorta like take away the control of the floor from Majority Leader that's that's just not something that we do and particularly since we get to vote on the same amendment two days later we voted on a two days later I voted for it it has something like 73 227 so in fact what we did is attached to a different piece of legislation actually something that is a legislation on the economic development administration which is created to help create stronger economies states across the country we attach that amendment to to the economic development administration bill that bill has yet to be finalized we've not been able to to end a filibuster against that bill not for any good reason nothing involving the Feinstein Coburn amendment but it's still hanging out there but what we have then very clearly gone on record by 3 1 margin made it clear that we wanted in the 45-cent subsidy for corn ethanol in this country one in the the tariff the band the characters I get keeps foreign corn ethanol out end up hopefully we'll have the opportunity offer that amendment again to another bill make it part of the law what I may have a chance to do that here in the weeks to come on a major deficit reduction plan and the the corn ethanol tax credit costs us billions of dollars a year it's money we shouldn't be spending and we should encourage I think the creation of I would call it cellulosic ethanol derived from corn stalks corn cobs corner leaves we should do that the idea of using kernels of corn for for ethanol I don't think makes a whole lot of sense anymore since we have the technology to do it the other ways we need to biofuels we need biofuels to make us energy independent they can have a smaller carbon footprint they can reduce our dependence on foreign oil it works for a lot of different reasons that's the path we should go that's the path we're going to take but Jim envira I Milford thanks for asking your question I hope that's helpful thanks

all right let's bring in house minority whip and the ranking member of the house subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis congressman steve scalise great to see you congressman i know you've been on this very strongly this new information tonight i think everyone watching will want to know what can we do about this well steve what we need to do is have hearings on this very issue i mean you look over a week ago with the emails that came out clearly those of us for a year now that have been calling for an investigation into the origin of this virus specifically whether or not it did start in that wuhan lab as you pointed out again over a year ago many people were calling for this kind of investigation and we were called conspiracy theorists now it looks very much like that may have been where this virus started from whether it was intentional or not and whether gain of function was part of what the united states taxpayers were helping fund those are serious questions rand paul's raised those questions he's a medical doctor himself he understands gain of function but as well as the question of whether or not it actually started in that lab in wuhan and whether there was funding that went with it whether directly or indoor or directly of american taxpayer dollars these questions should be answered pelosi for whatever reason will not call a hearing we've been calling for her to do this for over a year i think the pressure's mounting steve and i think in a hearing is inevitable but president biden himself should want to know the answers to these questions look this virus has been devastating uh both to americans as well as internationally millions of people dead uh let alone the damage it's done to all of our economies and psyche of our children we ought to get these answers well we i mean look frankly we've got the answer that we know for a fact there's no question about it that fauci's niaid did fund gain of function research in muhammad there's no question about that he can deny it as often as he likes we've just demonstrated that he did it and so the question is i i think we've lost your video congressman i don't know if you can still hear me the question is yeah we don't care what can we do about this the professional misconduct is what i want to focus on because because of the fact that he now clearly did fund it we know that he went around the ban that was put in place by the obama administration and the new regulations the rules regulating all this put in place by the trump administration he went around that and he did so by claiming it wasn't gain a function but it was on his own definition and that's just unbelievable that the head of the government agency would do that and not face consequences where the co where's the accountability that come from for this well that's again why we are demanding a hearing we've been we over 200 of my colleagues sent a letter to speaker pelosi last week after the emails came out saying we need to have a hearing on this specific issue we have a number of committees of jurisdiction that are already in place the select subcommittee of course is one you've got the oversight committee energy and commerce there's a china task force that initially was going to be bipartisan speaker pelosi walked away from that but we still have that committee standing up there are other committees as well but this this needs to be investigated by congress and let's get more detailed answers maybe china won't give us honest answers but we've had scientists in america that have been in communication with some of those scientists in the wuhan lab let's get as much out there on the record as we can if they haven't already destroyed the evidence in china let's get whatever we can now so that we can find out uh before it's too late because again we're over a year away from this the longer we go the harder it's going to be to get these answers we ought to be getting these answers right now speaker pelosi ought to want to get to the bottom of this too and get the facts out for whatever reason she's been stonewalling but we're going to keep fighting to get these answers well good for you and another reason frankly um that in those elections coming up in the midterms we're trying to get another speaker in place and then i think we can really get motoring with this congressman steve scalise thank you so much really appreciate you being with us great being with you steve thanks

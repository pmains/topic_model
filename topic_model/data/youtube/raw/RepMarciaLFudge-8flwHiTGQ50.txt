gentleman's time has expired miss fudge thank you very much mr. chairman and thank you mr. secretary for being here let me just say that I think that what we spend on feeding kids in this country is a great value especially since we spend about three million dollars per hour on war that we've never authorized mr. secretary nonprofit organizations in schools have to operate after school meal programs and the summer meal program separately these programs serve the same kids the same meals at the same location just at different times of the year now they have different sets of paperwork and often operate under different state agencies it is a huge burden of paperwork is there any opportunity to streamline these programs and make them easier to operate well the answer obviously we should look for ways in which we can streamline the programs and yesterday in Baltimore we sort of committed ourselves to a demonstration project in the city of Baltimore to see if that if we could work on on creating a process apparently we have a rule that says you can't serve three meals at the same location and so we're going to have a demonstration project take a look at at whether or not we can do that and whether what the concerns might be so there are obviously ways in which we would look for streamlining and if you have suggestions we'd be more an open to him Thank You congressman Fortenberry and I introduced a bipartisan farm to school act of 2015 and a cornerstone of that of that act is to provide flexibility to local schools and communities to include preschools in the USDA Farm to School program can you speak to the benefit benefits of Farm to School for children and why you would support this additional flexibility in the program for early childcare settings well the farm to school program has been extraordinarily successful we've done 221 grants and we have recently surveyed school districts and we found that there is about of this the school districts that have been surveyed about 350 million dollars of economic benefit associated with Farm to School so one of the benefits is basically keeping resources that are generated in a community in the community instead of send your resources for meals a thousand miles away in benefiting some other community if you will so there's an economic benefit there's obviously a freshness benefit people like the idea that they're helping their local producers and they like the idea that kids can learn about what's being grown and raised in their vicinity we know that there is a billion multiple billion dollar opportunity here it's particularly helpful to small and medium-sized producers and kids get access to fruits and vegetables that they might not otherwise consume so it's a you know to use at right phrase it's a win-win situation and frankly school districts are learning that they can do this in a way that doesn't break the bank and that it's quite popular you know we've done quite a bit of I think we've done quite a bit of good with a relatively small amount of money the program has five to six million dollars in grants and what we do with those resources is we acquaint people with what is grown in their vicinity in their district within 150 200 mile radius we help them with procurement so they know how to contract and then we basically steer them potentially to food hubs and other facilities that can provide sufficient quantity to satisfy Thank You mr. mr. secretary I'm just ask one last question and it's about summer meals we've had a number of hearings where both sides testified that summer meals are significantly important to young people but in the state of Ohio only about ten percent of low-income children are getting summer meals where the national average is about sixteen percent both still low but what solutions should this committee consider to ensure that programs like summer meals are flexible enough to serve kids in need I look at just my largest city which is the city of Cleveland fifty five fifty four percent of all the kids there live in poverty so the need is there how do we how do we address it well I think it is a partnership that requires local engagement involvement from local political leaders mayor's governors have to be engaged and if they are we've seen dramatic increases I would say one thing that we need to do is to figure out ways in which we can go to where the kids are as to having the kids go to where the meals are we know and I suspect you know and you're in your city you know where kids will congregate during the summer and we need to figure out ways in which we can be able to ensure that meals go to them if it's a playground if it's a swimming pool if it's wherever they congregate that's in my in my town where our kids grew up it was a little league diamond is where kids basically congregate during the summer months so ways in which we can go to where the kids are right now our process is the kids have to go to a central location and sometimes they know where that central location is and we're trying to make it easy for parents to understand where that is but it is oftentimes difficult to get there we're trying to make it non threatening that's why libraries are important that's why schools the seamless program is important any way in which we can continue to promote flexibility and access we would be certainly looking forward to working with young thank you very much

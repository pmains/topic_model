started sounds good good afternoon everybody my name is mia keys and i serve as the chief of staff to congresswoman robin kelly and i just want to thank you all for joining us for this significant event we're wrapping up the fifth annual black maternal health week and for those of you who have been following maternal health for so long on the congressional level you know the significance of this week and how how far we've come to to come to this space we're looking forward today to talking about black maternal health policy specifically and then we're also going to be um be talking with the with what with the champion the godmother of maternal health in congress congresswoman robin kelly my boss who i'm very honored to to help uplift her work here she's um she is hosting this event and she's invited the black women's congressional alliance to be a part of this discussion and you'll hear from those members later on in this discussion and congresswoman i know that you've been the champion in the space since you came into congress almost 10 years ago and i'm really looking forward to having everyone know more about that work and what it's taking behind the scenes and we look forward to you being able to tell us about that we're also joined today by the centers for medicare medicaid services administrator uh miss brooks leshore and so administrator lashore has brooks the shore has joined us and thank you so very much for joining us administrator brooks leshore you've had quite the busy week talking about what you're doing what the biden harris administration is doing and what everyone collectively is doing to build a more equitable future with respect to the health of black women so we're very much looking forward to hearing from you and in fact without any further ado i'm going to turn it over to you congresswoman kelly um and and also then over to you administrator personal short for your opening remarks and then we'll get started thank you mia and thank you administrator brooks leshore for making time to join me today as mia said we know you've been busy yeah as you've mentioned i've been working on maternal health policy for a long time now but actually before i came to congress i didn't even know that it was an issue in the united states of america we probably all know someone who has experienced issues with maternal health but what i did not know is that the united states has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world and that black women are three to four times more likely to die than other women after working on this issue for so long i've come to learn the stats backwards and forwards and i know many in our audience know these stats too so i want to focus on what comes next what administrator brooks lashore and i are working on now to make sure that we turn this crisis around and that every black woman in america can have a safe and healthy pregnancy and delivery if she so chooses last month president biden signed my bill the maternal health quality improvement act into law and part of the fy 22 appropriations packet i was so proud to see this bill go through as it makes up a large chunk of my mama's act which i first introduced way back it seems like in the 115th congress now i'm working to get the rest of the mama's act passed which includes a really critical policy mandatory postpartum medicaid coverage for one full year in every single state i got a five-year option for states included in the american rescue plan but we need to make sure that this becomes permanent and mandatory so that every woman in every state has access to life-saving care they need after having a baby one-third of all maternal deaths happen up to a year after giving birth so this absolutely must get done i'm also working to close the medicaid coverage gap to address social determinants of health increase culturally informed care and eliminate biases for now i will leave it at that so that we can get into our discussion and questions i'll turn it back to you mia thank you congresswoman and you've been so very modest in terms of um all this work and i i i think you should also let people know you are a mother you are a grandmother and you are a mother to so many other adopted uh persons and we are grateful for the work that you're doing for to impact the generations administrator brooks leshore tell us a bit about the work that you've been doing through cms and what we can look forward to in terms of working with the byden harris administration thank you mia i'm first going to um uh ditto your kind and comments about congresswoman robin kelly and just what a champion she is for maternal health and from the first moment i got to meet her cms administrator i was really blown with her warmth and her passion around this topic and in one of my happiest moments of cms administrator we were with the vice president um really it was a call to action at the vice president at the at the white house and we were on a panel together with other members of congress who are who are champions as well as people with lived experience and after that panel the next day i was on with stakeholders who were so moved at such a profound level at the fact that at the white house there was a discussion about maternal health that the vice president's leadership was bringing voice to some really unspoken unspoken pain and i really want to thank congresswoman kelly for her her her ongoing passion in this space because the one month postpartum coverage that is right now optional that she continues to push to be mandatory i truly believe is one of the single most important things we can do as a nation um and i and some of that perspective comes from me being a mother and what it was like two months after three months after i remember we lived abroad at the time and i came back and i was just sharing this with my doctor of you know i didn't have a babysitter when we came back from australia but i went to see my own ob gyn and there i was trying to get my check up and i had a child my little girl my arms who's crying i was just like what if i help like trying to get checkups when you're going through all of this stuff and to actually have to try to change your health insurance in the midst of all of that when you're just trying to keep it together we have so much work to do and i'm really excited about this uh this incredible provision um and 12 states are working with us right now um to uh put this into law we have um five states who are um are moving ahead but we we plan to keep going one by one until we get all of the states in whether um voluntary or mandatory where we're headed for for that uh for that number so that's one of the biggest things that we are focused on um the second thing that we have talked about and and just released in the last couple of days is this notion of of letting a family members and mothers to be know which hospitals have the designation birthing friendly and we're starting with a measure that really focuses on whether the hospital has engaged in the collaborative to really try to improve maternal health outcomes and we will continue to push um to increase the the measures that we are looking at as we evaluate the facilities that are under our um are under our space and jurisdiction i also um as uh as we've talked about there's so much action in starting from the president but really spearheaded by the vice president within the administration and last week i was privileged to join the maternal health cabinet and if i can tell you that the energy in the room and just the idea i mean you have epa talking about the effect of the environment on mothers you have the labor department looking at their authorities you have the military dod who is sitting there and we are all working together to try to figure out how can we work together and support each other and then of course hhs so at hertha hersa has maternal health grants we have medicaid and we are really engaging at the department level trying to think how we can work together and then the last thing i'll mention and then let you get to leading us in questions is that we have learned a lot in looking at the data the office of minority health and our medicaid office partnered together over the last couple of months to really look at our medicaid data and try to find out what what we can learn from what's going on with maternal health we've been sharing that with through technical assistance with dates and we're going to open that up even broader in the during the summer where we'll have a stakeholder discussion and really bring together private industry to put commitments on the table to advancing on maternal health that's so that's another thing that we are we are actively engaged in so as you can see there's a lot happening um that we're excited about but happy to answer and take the conversation in whatever direction you want to go thank you so very much for that opening administrative virtual show the other thing i'll say about you and your work is that um for those of you who are not familiar with cms and what they cover first and foremost they cover of course medicare medicaid but also chip the children's health insurance program and also it's up to cms to regulate the healthcare.gov insurance health insurance marketplace right but but with you and your past work administrator brooks le short you worked on the patient protection and affordable care act the ema um and had it not been for the ama to begin with we'd still be having a conversation about women and the gender specific conversation around what it takes to birth a child and all of that i'm wondering before we go into the questions if you could just briefly talk about that as well because that's important to this maternal health conversation absolutely absolutely i mean health insurance is just so key to being able to live your best life and before the affordable care act which is not that long ago but you know one of the biggest issues that we had as a country is that even if you could afford it sometimes you could not get coverage because of your pre-existing conditions and women paid more than men because women have health and care needs but just by virtue of being a woman 15 years ago you would be charged different rate than a man your same age to buy health insurance and so it really was starting with creating a floor of saying that coverage should not vary in cost based on your pre-existing condition i.e what gender you are and what your health status is etc just so important as a fundamental because it's not just when you're pregnant when that your health matters it matters all the years leading up to it how your you know whether you're getting regular checkups whether your diabetes is treated and um whether you have things going on in your health that you have no idea about um and and that's one of among other things one of the reasons why we do see differences in maternal health outcomes because of the when women are pregnant they're in a different health um [Music] health status than um than others thank you so very much for that i know i put you on the spot but you talked about building the floor congresswoman kelly you're taking us to blow out the ceiling so tell us more about the fact that you know president biden just signed your maternal health quality improvement act into law you mentioned that already can you tell us more about that legislation and how that's going to improve maternal health your own your own mute there congresswoman you should know by now first it authorizes a grant program to improve maternal health outcomes by developing evidence-based best practices improving maternal mortality review committee data and evaluating new models of care secondly it authorizes the grant program to address implicit and explicit bias training for health care providers it also creates a study to develop recommendations for teaching within uh health professional training programs to reduce and prevent biases that could impact maternal care lastly uh authorizes a grant program for developing integrated health care services for pregnant and postpartum women and infants with grants and reporting of study outcomes there's a lot around um biases that people have but we know that's one of the uh the really big problems and i know that's not all you're doing congresswoman we're gonna we're gonna have you talking about more about what you're doing in congress in just a few minutes um administrative bristol ashore if you can tell us a bit more about your your conversation your conversations with vice president harris you talked about it a little bit um what went on at the first maternal health day of action in december and how did you leave that conversation what did you pick up were the most urgent aspects of that crisis of this crisis from that conversation so the vice president is serious about this as an issue and really it was a real engagement of what does every agency and department doing what are her priorities and and part of what i think was so meaningful is really to hear that across the government there are real robust efforts underway and that we can learn from each other so really hearing um what uh what everyone is up to i think it fosters conversation most of our conversation is really around what can you a lot of my focus is what can we do at cms and a big part of that is are some of the things i talked about but i would say that a lot of the language that i use as we as we think about health equity in general at cms and then maternal health in particular is really trying to use every lever we have so like this birthing friendly designation is really a medicare issue it's um but where you medicare doesn't pay for that many births but we're going to use every lever that we can in terms of making sure that we are pulling out all the stops to try try to address this issue and really working across the department and i would say that one of the things is at the state level one thing i'm most concerned about and focused on is at the state level a lot of times there isn't the level of coordination that we want to see and one key area is something that the vice president cares very deeply about and that is doulas and so one of the things that we are working on is how do we incorporate doulas into the medicaid program and part of that i think is really going to come from coordinating with the maternal health grants that also are you know at the other side of the house with hersa i'm really trying to make sure that care is integrated as well as of course looking at the medicaid program but a lot of it is about making sure that we are seeing women as whole people um and not just not in just this isolated issue uh there are many things we need to tackle um but a key core of it is making sure we're not we're not just thinking about the birth itself because a lot of a third of the deaths are a week to a year afterwards and so we're really really trying to focus yes there's some things at the um at the delivery itself that we need to be addressing but there's so much leading up to it and leading after it that is um that uh that that's really affecting our our outcome and of course we care about it from the mother's perspective but the flip side is just as important and you mentioned tip the children um and so just the impact of these difficult births uh or or morbidities affects the child's health as well um and so really just trying to make sure we are really really thinking about all aspects uh from that perspective and i am clapping it up in the inside for doulas in particular i'm i'm i just gave birth four months ago and so i'm a new mom my actually i just noticed my pumping bottles are here in the back i love it but to your point about doulas i i had two i had a labor and delivery doula who was also my prenatal doula in a postpartum doula and had it not been for my doulas there could have been some things that that were missed but more than anything i just felt very supported and surrounded as as i was becoming a mother and now that i'm a new mother i'm still in touch with my actually my doula just stopped at my house yesterday to the same level so let's keep up the work and keep supporting moms congresswoman speaking of which you know with with the maternal excuse me the maternal health quality improvement um act you know like i mentioned that's just a start what's next for maternal health policy in congress and and what policies do we need to pass now and and why why is that sure well first of all we need to keep the pressure on we just you know we can't rest on our laurels we have to keep on moving because unfortunately moms are still dying so we need to need to need to close the medicaid coverage gap we have planned to do that as you know and go back better but now we must find another route and the same thing for permanently extending postpartum medicaid coverage for one year again that was included in a buildback better but we're looking for other opportunities to move it forward independently uh you know maybe um you know those in the senate will um you know uh cast a a smile or something over these particular pieces and we can get them not only passed in the house we know we can do that but pass in the senate also and then also we simply need to continue working to address health equity and social determinants of health more broadly that's you know a big part of this and next week as you know we'll be introducing the health equity and accountability act which focuses on so many you know of these issues because you know we still suffer you know as the administrator said from access and you know um different things like that resources so we need to do everything that we can do to um you know get us out of the place that the united states is in uh with the rest of the world compared to the rest of the world i should say we should be ashamed we we need to do much better we sure do we really do and that's why you're here uh administrator broke to the shore tell us a bit more about what you were talking about earlier the new birthing friendly hospitals and the designation guidelines for that yeah so um i we've announced it and i think maybe going live in like 10 minutes our uh our rule coming out so as part of our process at cms we issue regulations and what we're doing here in the birthing friendly initiative is saying we're starting with a measure of of looking to see are you as a hospital again engaged in in collaborative so really trying to make sure that the hospitals are really focused on best practices and and we know a lot we know a lot about what is working and what is not and we want to make sure all of the facilities that are delivering babies know what those best practices are so this is a step and we plan though over time to increase the measures that that we are looking on to and so as part of the process we encourage people to take a look at uh the regulation um and certainly add uh additional thoughts and comments um and and sort of our process is updating the measures that we have on a yearly basis and so we're starting with this one that we have data for but really plan to continue to build on making sure that facilities are meeting the standards that we want them to meet i want to keep give this next question and this might close out this portion um i want to give this to both of you you know and this is a heavy topic and we rightfully so focus on the loss associated with maternal health particularly when you're talking about black women and brown women in the us what about this conversation and this time excites you you know with respect to maternal health and maternal health policy or or what makes you hopeful about what's to come and um uh administrative bristol short i will start with you with that question and ask the congresswoman to round us out well you know you asked me about the affordable care act and i've been thinking just how similar i think this time is so um i as people will recall sometimes you don't remember but when we started doing the affordable care act there were a lot of people who were wondering why we were trying to tackle health care we were in the middle of what we now call the great recession and we didn't know what was going to happen with the economy and there was sort of a push pull of why are we spending our limited political capital on health and the reason was because health was actually in part was affecting the crisis at the time families were going bankrupt and because of medical costs and a significant number of those bankruptcies at the time i remember hearing that it was a third were caused by medical costs and i actually think we're in a similar moment right now where covid19 has just exposed in a different way our inequities we know that they existed that they were not new but i think there is a different level of awareness and a willingness to talk about these issues right now it's a limited window but we need to seize this moment but i mean nobody comes in to talk to me without saying health equity because they know we care about it and the industry knows that there is something here and so i think i am hopeful because i think we have this window to seize and say look as a country look at the price we're paying congresswoman kelly said it just right it's an embarrassment we should be ashamed at these results they're ridiculous and we can say that very boldly right now and nobody can disagree and i wha and so that is why i'm hopeful because there is energy there is voice and and you have some senior leaders who are absolutely devoted to making sure that we move the middle on this and that's why i'm hopeful congresswoman words to add sure first of all the idea that we're talking about it as i said when we opened i didn't even know it was an issue until someone tapped my shoulder when i was in congress that this was an issue but uh a certain family that had a loss couldn't really get the attention so that's one thing you know that we're talking about it and others are talking about it and my other hope is that um women women or it could be young women or you know whatever age you are that you are more aware as you go into your doctors you go into the hospitals what your rights are uh what you should be asking for how things really should happen and we just don't go along with the program that we make sure that we're treated you know with respect and good care quality care like everybody else also i'm excited about you know administrator brooks lashore announcement about birthing friendly hospital designations and guidelines i think that is really cool and a great great idea and we deserve to know what kind of healthcare facility you know we're walking into i it reminds me of new york with the restaurants a's and b's and hopefully not seas you know and you have a choice about what which restaurant uh that you're eating in and finally what is absolutely fantastic is that we having a supportive administration through president biden the vice president harris to get things done they realize the urgency of the situation because again you know mamas can't wait you know i i i still have uh three child bearing daughters and you know it it makes me nervous two of them have had one has not you know and uh it makes me nervous to think about what could or could not happen so uh but i'm i'm hopeful i am definitely hope i'm certainly holding on to that hope and and with the hope we work so with that said i am so very appreciative um for your presence here today administrative brooklyn shore thank you so very much for coming through and telling us about what the centers for medicare and medicaid services are doing there was a question in the chat with respect to the extended role of medicare what i do encourage you to do is um be in touch with with the cms to uplift your questions if if it's helpful um and mr brookshaw we will send those questions to your office um on the back end and then of course congresswoman robin kelly my my my boss my forever boss and um and then i'm also just going to put a plug just ask someone who is a new mother and someone who's worked with miss kelly for so long um in in multiple capacities i i couldn't be more uh honored to be a part of your work and thank you so very much for your support not just in this role but in this role as i'm evolving as a as a as a mother to a young boy and um and even with my office so that i can pump and such like that uh thank you both i hope that you all will stay on board we have a continuing conversation um with with some ladies who are either co-founders or advisory board members to the black women's congressional alliance they've worked on the hill for married years as well as one maternal health policy and other policies that support the health of of women um black brown or other one um throughout the nation and and although all of them have either had a child or currently going through that process so i'm going to invite them onto the screen and uh say thank you once again to congresswoman kelly and thank you once again to to administrator so we are going to pivot and um in this part of the conversation we're going to we're going to get a down to the nitty gritty and and say words that you know maybe titty will pop out of her mouth or something like that or some other words like uh you know but we're going to get real with it so today we have joined joining us um some really phenomenal people we have christina henderson who's a large member of the council of the council of district of columbia she's previously served as the legislative assistant for the united states senate democratic leader chuck schumacher schumer i'm giving him all kinds of names today she's also served as the committee director for dc's committee on education and in the offices of previous senator hillary clinton as well as for kay hagan and as i mentioned before she's one of the co-founders of the black women's congressional alliance thank you very much for joining us today christina and we also have with us yasmine rigney she is the senior principal at bracewell yes and where are you on my screen here you are got it you've uh she's she's recently served as a senior policy advisor to uh to now vice president kamala harris and she was in that in that role responsible for managing the then senators economic agenda as well as advising on other policies uplifted by the congressional tri caucus as well as on the political side she's also previously served on the finance committee and in senator cory booker's office and is a co-founder as well of the bwca we also now have with us keenan austin i'm going to give keenan austin reid her an opportunity to introduce herself because i do want her to let us know why she thought it was so very important to bring the bwca to this conversation but before i turn it over to keenan to tell us a bit about herself i want to talk about lakeisha steele she is the deputy assistant secretary at the department of education's office of legislation in congressional affairs and she previously served as a professional staff member on the house education and labor committee for chairman bobby scott as well as an education policy advisor um to um susan bonamici who's who's a congresswoman from oregon and she is a co-founder of bwca the four of them are also fantastic mamas and we're going to talk about that too but let me go ahead and uh and bring keenan into the conversation hi there keenan mia thank you um for just being a fantastic and awesome chief of staff human being and new mom uh the black women's congressional alliance is over 300 black women on capitol hill both house and senate we're bipartisan um and all these ladies have are uh representative of that network when we talk about black maternal health and the work media that you you've done and your boss has done and administrator brooks lesure has done it is personal we are most of us are of childbearing age and we are grappling with are we going to be listening to who who are the best health care providers um making a birth plan uh we've got family members who are concerned about the coverage gaps and so we are experiencing the policy but also writing the policy at the same time so um and we try to stand in the gaps many of our memberships our members are the only one in their office they are the voice of black women um in their space and so while they're you know dealing with their own issues and fears and concerns they are um trying to make policy to make it better for everyone when black women are at the table we bring equity to the table and so i'm just grateful to you me i'm grateful to congresswoman kelly for her advocacy for allowing the black women's congressional alliance to be a part of this conversation and just look forward to discussing more thank you but you said it keenan i mean the work that you all are doing and the spirit in which bwca was founded is to wrap arms around around women uh young women in congress right who are who are black and brown and um i think that that's that's a part of that's a huge part of this conversation because we're also talking about we have to acknowledge them that the space of congress is a space of privilege we don't all necessarily come from privilege but it is an affluential influential space and that matters when we're talking about maternal health because it's not maternal health of black and brown women is not something that is dependent on on other health out of health related issues that have to do with socioeconomic status or achievement you can't achieve your way out of being at risk of higher higher mortality and morbidity rates so i want to bring in um all of you and talk a little bit about you know your experience how you came into the conversation of maternal health and specifically mortality and morbidity in your capacity in congress and what was your experience like working on the issue or what is your experience like working on the issue and christina i'll ask you to chime in first um thanks mia and and thanks again to congresswoman kelly for having us um on this is really exciting uh to be on a panel with these ladies um so i have two daughters uh jordan who is three and cameron who was seven months and i'm very spunky and um i would say that you know i think working on capitol hill the issue and the drumbeat around the crisis that was happening around black maternal health had already been pounding if you will um we knew the statistics um but again you know that moment when you become pregnant yourself the statistics become even more personal because you yourself don't want to become a statistic and so you are really trying to figure out um not only how to protect yourself but how to support or enable policies going forward to protect your sisters around you because i think we've all know someone who's had a scare or some type of complication that could have gone wrong and even for some of us we have had um you know colleagues or associates or friends that we know who you know passed away after child birth or complications thereof and so i think um you know i think yeah you said it just right it it becomes very personal and even when i transitioned off the hill and you know being elected um in in dc government the very first bill i introduced in dc government when i was elected was on maternal health maternal health access and resources act um that bill passed it was around getting medicaid coverage for doulas and also requiring transportation um services to help women get to and from their appointments because in the district we have the highest maternal mortality rate in the country a rate that's double the national average um and there's just poor statistics all around in terms of half of black women in the district did not seek prenatal care until their second and third trimester which definitely impacted the outcomes that were happening later on and so i always keep at the forefront of my my mind my own experiences but also um how can i make sure that we're essentially protecting our sisters going forward as well christina thank you very much for for your work on in local government and i i do want to acknowledge that there had been a question earlier about how how people can be involved in the maternal health conversation on a local level so um feel free please to answer that question either in the chat or bring it up in in your next remarks because we want to acknowledge that and by the way speaking of not acknowledging a lot of you on in the virtual world are telling us your stories in the chat thank you so much for that please keep it coming this is a safe space virtually or or what have you um and we want to acknowledge that we see what you're saying we feel your pain we hope that you and your families are healing and we want to uplift life for you at all times yasmine i want to bring you into the conversation same question how'd you come to the maternal health conversation and what was that experience like for you well thank you so much i'm i am so honored to be on this channel right now um i wanted to just make sure i said this clearly um you know i started my career with senator cooper who i think is a phenomenal um passionate leader for uh you know women maternal health uh black women in particular right um and from there i got this this passion to do things um and policy on the senate side that i don't i don't necessarily know what's ingrained in us to be able to do um and so working under you know um black women in his office was such an empowerment and a powerful world that um it allowed me to then start to think about where we were missing pieces uh uh in the senate right uh so i went to work on senate senate finance and started to ask questions about um different tax codes and different um uh healthcare pieces that just to me did not seem equitable at all um and i was i was faced with a lot of pushback people would tell me that um the administration the tax code was very black and white and it was so interesting that they used that kind of um vernacular to explain something like this because it is black and white it's so black and white that it's so unethical right um and so it it when i was offered the opportunity to go and work for one of um the only black women uh to work in the senate as a senator uh then senator kamala harris i knew it was my job to make to make sure to answer those questions right so why does it feel like we are we are treated or neck would it be um why does it feel like i'm not being heard at work right um then senator kamala harrison empowered me she gave me the ability to ask those questions and then answer them right and so there was only two black staffers uh at the time uh who led her policy issues and we worked very closely together on health on education and on economics to make sure that the the packages of uh proposals that we put together for her um and offered to her to introduce were very black and white right um we wanted to make sure that um we answered those questions and we introduced the maternal care act we introduced um the lyft act we introduced a number of different fields uh to make sure that we could you know further those those conversations and um you know it was it was through members of congress right like rick kelly like um he concluded that that fight on the house side did not let you know um outside world kind of let you think that we weren't being heard uh we partnered with uh many celebrities uh serena serena williams was one of the one of the partners and and you know we think that through all of these kind of coalitions the collaborative efforts of um you know our black members on congress that we were able to kind of put this um topic at the forefront uh whereas now we have you know vp kamala harris leading the charge uh in in in the white house it was such a very honorable position for me to be in to just contribute in a very small way that i was and then you know uh at the end of my life i found out i was pregnant and it became even more suffering through you know loss i had lost on my own i suffered um miscarriages in the past very important for me to not only um ensure that the health of myself and the health of my you know you know in 2019 to 2020 i was i was developing policy and legislation uh while on maternity leave and it was just um one of the you know forefront experiences that i've ever had and i'm extremely grateful i think yasmine what you're getting at is the fact that sometimes it takes having the experience to bring the conversation to the table of power and it shouldn't be the case um but we're doing the work lakeisha same question how did you come into the space of maternal health policy and what's been your experience so far thank you so much for having me uh um and thank you so much to um congresswoman kelly who is my home state uh congresswoman so um so shout out to to kangaki and it's um it's honestly just so it why i'm here just so deeply personal my experience um coming into understanding black maternal mortality is being around it being being in the house when these conversations were happening with congresswoman kelly and congressman underwood you know was leading you know this great work um being a part of the black women's congressional alliance and hearing my my fellow bwca sisters like christina and yasmin you know share you know their their experiences with um with not being a statistic with having to navigate um you know a health care system you know that is that has been failing black women and then now being three months postpartum and having a near-death experience um myself um you know it is it should not be in the year of 2022 where the most dangerous thing a black woman can do is to become pregnant um and so my entire pregnancy um was marred by and was marred with anxiety of not wanting to die of having to ask specific questions at my prenatal visit so the first question i asked when i found out i was pregnant um was how familiar they were with black maternal mortality and what happened what were they doing in their practice specifically to protect the lives of black women and i purposely stayed with my ob who trained in baltimore and so i actually live in upper marble maryland now but i was traveling for my prenatal visits you know two hours two and a half hours um to nova to fairfax because the practice had shown me that they were so dedicated to this issue and had stayed on top of the latest research and and specific data when it when it comes to um protecting you know the lives of black women you know there were specific questions i asked when it came to preeclampsia and i come and i came to find out that it you can ask all the questions you can navigate the system you can be prepared mia you said it best that you can't um you you you can't um you know achieve out of you know and also knowing the the the latest research you know on these issues you know it is it's really about being your own advocate even if you don't have a doula making sure that you have uh you know the right questions to ask that you you know when you're going towards you know when you're there for your uh prenatal visits but when it comes to your postpartum care i think that there is there has to be great care that we take not just on the prenatal side but on the postpartum side even once i got to six weeks postpartum after having an emergency c-section you know i was worried about dying when i got to eight weeks even now being now 13 weeks postpartum those are all things that i think about and here i am equipped with you know um a degree you know a master's degree with access to information with access to be on panels like this and i still you know fear and have that trepidation every single day so i think about all of the low-income black women who are having to face this without having access to the information and the knowledge you know and the resources and i think it's just really time that we really get serious about saving you know and protecting you know the lives of black women you know um so i'm going to to loop some of the things you said location some of the things you started to say keenan and then i'll also acknowledge that when we're talking about fear and i don't want us to end on the conversation of fear but i want to make sure that we're giving giving the space because it's so true um for me when i was when i was having my son and similarly lakeisha in terms of what what every encounter felt like it was more like i'm asking this question question because i do not want to fill in the blank right um maybe the fear is something you felt in your head in terms of headaches or um for me it was something i felt i wasn't breathing like i felt myself holding my breath a lot when i was listening to my providers as they were explaining things to me either pre-birth or during the labor um you know the fear can manifest in so many ways keenan when you're when you're with friends and colleagues who are black women and they're talking about or or even if you're talking about having children either soon or in the in the near future what are some things that are consistently coming up in your conversations in terms of what they may be fearful of and then i'm hoping you can answer the same questions of what they hope for yeah mia that's a great question um i was i've neglected to mention that i'm on a daily group chat with these ladies um and that's really how i my black maternal health uh education and it has been so insightful um but when we think about like the the fear and and how we kind of you know come to this conversation it's it's about like it's something like keisha touched on it's like she's got these degrees she works in congress she can be on a panel with robin kelly but you can't really like achieve your way out of it one of the things that has been so um interesting to me about this crisis is it doesn't matter how much access you have or how much capital you have you serene like uh i think it was jasmine who's talking about her work with serena williams serena williams is like the goat right and she wasn't believed um and so the systemic bias is is what i worry about as a professional i'm i'm cheering for you and i hope to work alongside you i'm so excited about the maternal health and quality improvement act that you had that you and your boss had a chance to work on i'm hoping we close the coverage gap um i think that's some of the joy right it's that we are finally and it goes back also to the work of bwca we're trying to get more black women in the room more black women on capitol hill more black women actually working on the policy the reason why that's so incredibly important is would we be talking about these issues where we have a black maternal health week but we have a bill that the president just signed into law will we be calling for this in the health equity act to build that better act had you know we not have black women leaders who found this to be important and raising it every conversation possible so that's a that's a little bit about what i'm thinking me and thanks for bearing with the noise that is so strong right there keenan and and with that i would be remiss if i didn't give a shout out to the the staffers who are working on on this work right now in fact on our own health team our senior health policy advisor dr anita virgo shout out to anita somewhere and then also shout out to our accomplices who are staff who are not black and brown women right who understand like oh i hear you i may not feel precisely what you're feeling but we're going to do this work together right so shout out also to rachel kingery our comms director who was adamant that we have this program and and people like right who who bring this he's been great you know right yeah yeah um well let me just say one point on that is um we also have to shout out um these organizations these grassroot organizations that have been screaming this at the top of their lungs for years right i mean without them we literally would not even have the confidence i think i mean as far as myself i don't know if i would have had the confidence to be like wait we actually have to talk about this like we can do something about this you know we have these organizations that are out of cities that just know uh you know they have this connection to the city and state and um it's just important for us to also shout them out so i want to say mother and justice who is a grassroot organization out of detroit want to say thank you guys for the work that you guys have been doing for years um and and now just kind of seeing the light of some of the work that you've been doing um there are a number of other organizations we can kind of go down a list but but definitely just need to make sure that the black moms who don't have the pen but also but have the like the the speaker uh box and kind of um shouting from the rooftops they need to be heard too here for sure i know that's right yes you all are getting your flowers today so make sure you stay around black women because we're going to uplift you because we need you to continuously uplift us for sure what would you all say to um in addition to what you've mentioned keenan what would you say to black women who are who are presently on this call who are sliding into the chat dms um who might have fears about being impacted by this crisis what what words would you give them go ahead christina um i mean i think the first thing i would say is your fear is valid so don't let anybody say you are over exaggerating or all those different types of things because it happens each and every day right and so if you feel like your provider to loci's point like if you feel like your provider is not listening to you it's okay you can change providers that is the agency that you have and i feel like in some in these conversations i think we have to explain to black women number one you can ask questions number two you can like say okay i'm to switch doctors i'm going to go to someplace someplace else and then number three it's okay to speak up in the room and and own your agency and space in this the other thing that i would say is that um women in in our roles are not just working on it from the maternal health standpoint so the the prenatal piece of it but we're also very much working on the policy pieces to help support you on the back end um one of the things i was really excited to work on when i um worked for senator schumer was uh paid parental leave for all federal employees 12 weeks of paper rental leave and we fought with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and people like well why you know is this so important and all these things i'm like if you've ever been through a major surgery like a c-section is a major surgery period childbirth is major period the idea that some women can just get up in three or four weeks later and go back to doing their everyday work this is how we have some of the postpartum crises that we have around black maternal health and so if we are going to take care of the health it can't just be on the prenatal side we have to put policies in place to protect it on the postnatal uh and excuse me in the postpartum periods as well so paid family leave we're working on the child care front because you know nobody talks about that nobody talks about it no nobody talks about how expensive that part is but so i think today your fear is valid but also know that there are lots of people who are working to support all the various pieces that encompasses because i you know having two children now i know more than ever right like you are meant to have a village period that you're meant to have a village to help you raise a child and so i i am passionate about this work because it's it's about women and children i don't know i haven't met but who who desire for their children and for themselves to be able to continue on this path to build their family and have opportunity for success without fear of of of dying or sickness or hurt um and so i'm grateful for all of the staffers who come to this work sort of thinking about it from those very angles is it's not just around who the doctor is giving birth but what else are we going to do once the child gets here to not only protect them but also to protect the mothers and ensure that they're able to heal and able to be the very best that they can be and show up each and every day and yazmin was talking about that christina when she said earlier you know looking at tax codes and looking at economic related essentially you're talking about an intersectional approach to protecting the the you know and and socially supporting and psychologically supporting the existence of black and brown women right that's that's what it comes down to to your killing and we want to talk about the maternal health or the mental health piece of it too oh my gosh absolutely we can have a whole other rachel let's have a whole nother panel just on that please let us please do that you know um to your point about policies and i'm so glad someone actually said this in the chat we are on the same virtual wavelength whoever said this in the chat we're talking about policies to support black and brown women who have either given birth or who are preparing to give birth we have to talk about reimbursement rates and equitable reimbursement rates for for providers especially if you're seeing women who are on medicaid um or who are are outside of the the the healthcare marketplace and in need of care we have to be able to talk about that because otherwise it becomes a quality of care issue it becomes a well i'm not going to see this type of patient because the reimbursement rates are too low and i have you know that kind of thing but the other thing too that we do have to talk about is that you know we we've got to operate in the policy space but policies can't legislate hard hearts and minds you can't legislate uh someone looking at a black woman and not seeing um a stereotypical story in that black woman woman right i can't if i were saying if i were a you know a member of congress i can't write a law that says white men um you must look at black women with love in your eyes right it's not going to happen um but to your point kina's earlier point about getting people to the table who um understand and or who at least are willing to understand or at least are willing to build relationships with people who better understand what the issues are and become neighborly in that way become people who are um supportive and wanting to learn about why this issue matters that's what we also need to certainly where we need to be i think about relationships as a site of um of of healing black women and relationships between you know people who are not just black women um so some other policies that might support that to christina your other point is you know looking at um housing loans and uh mortgage loans and availability of those and um because if we can start there the conversation could potentially then burgeon into desegregating neighborhoods and by by class and by race and if we have a bit more of that um then we will potentially have people who are neighbors who are very different in terms of their race and ethnicity and you can build relationships there but i mean that might sound simple but when we look at across generations of wellness and wealth building and just overall health we've got to talk about all of those other things that christine lee pointed out don't necessarily on the face of it look like maternal health policy but they support the wellness of black and brown people and families um and certainly women um just to your point there right pg county and i'm just speaking because i live in upper marlborough um around the corner from lakisha um and uh we we've noticed that pg county is one of the you know blackest counties right that has the most uh black wealth uh in america actually and here you can actually find more black of doctors more black women doctors more black nurses than you can in most areas of the country right but it was still very difficult for myself and i'm not going to speak for every anyone else but but at least for myself to find a doctor that i felt answered my question that didn't think make me feel like you know it was all in my head you know that i had one doctor who was like listen that's all that's that's all you know talk that's all talk and i said oh okay won't come back here like it's time that it's time to go somewhere else you know it in in in like christina made that point earlier it is your your responsibility is your agency to go ahead and and say listen i want to be heard i'm going to go to someone who's going to to listen to me now i know for myself i was working on capitol hill and um you know i i did not necessarily um find the doula in time for my ceterian section i was looking for it and then you know blood pressure shot up and then next thing you know i was having my son and so um one other piece of advice i would give to folks is look for your doula early so that you have her throughout the you know the end of at least your second trimester towards the third because things can happen really quickly and there are a lot of doulas in dc that will work with you to find you know the right um amount i've i've had friends who have come out of the woodworks at this point um since i said i had a c-section uh and so just you know i know that they're in the chat there there are um conversations happening um reach out to folks have conversations i've i've had so much uh guidance from my friends here in these group chats i would encourage you and you know get a group chat going um bwca has been such a home for me and um these ladies have have felt like you know um sister because of it right um and so i encourage you to do the same and with that going i'm going to bounce it back to you girl i know i'm i'm going off grip no i'm so glad and good i was about to say i'm trying to crash this group chat but go ahead like she would say something oh no i just wanted to say mia i think that your boss in terms of her next steps when she mentioned the mandatory um postpartum care and medicaid i think is a game changer i think for those of you know black women um you know with private insurance one of the things that i did was be very intentional with talking to my ob when she explained you know uh my appointments would be six weeks and eight weeks and i was like no i will be checking in with you at two weeks and then i'm gonna be checking in with you you know at four weeks um and i i think you know if you it's okay to tell yourself to listen to your gut i think black women have some of the most keen instincts on the planet and when we know that something is not right you know that something is not right and you and you have to be your best advocate so when you are in a health practice and if you are uncomfortable at any point it is time to go even if that means inconveniencing yourself when it comes to your travel and maybe your doctor is it next to you know your your doctor maybe your doctor's not next to your your office um maybe you have to travel an hour but your but our lives are worth it that is what we have to tell ourselves that our lives are worth it and i think that when you are not listened to i think we have to make people listen to us because again it should not be that the most dangerous thing that we do in 2022 as black women is is actually become pregnant um and actually have to you know deal with you know um navigating a health care system and racial disparities you know on the parts part of the postpartum side as well as prenatal but i'm so grateful for all these women all the great work that you all are doing um and and how you're being intentional ending this on a positive note um because we can you know take back you know um this issue and we absolutely um have members like your boss you know who are working you know every day to ensure that our voices are heard um and that our lives are valued and protected i love it any any last words before we close out and thank you all for rocking with us in the second part of this uh this chat hoping we can get a part two but i want to give everybody 30 seconds to to close this out keenan let's start with you thank you media thank you congresswoman for hosting this and thank you team i work with the entire robin kelly team so i would not i'd be remissified and thank miss rachel and mrs and dr burgos um for being great folks um everybody hit it but i i would just drill down on get the playbook before you go to the doctor's appointment you're not the first woman to go through this some sister can give you the readout and who and what to avoid so roll with that but thank you again for this conversation thanks keenan yes go ahead yasmin after you sorry i was reading the group chat it is really popping in that group chat i love it i reflect to like follow up and answer all the questions um you know i'm i'm just really fortunate i i feel very extremely blessed to be uh able to to have this conversation with you guys so thank you so much for um for for for allowing me to participate allowing me to give my experience um it's it's been a good almost decade well it was a good almost decade on the hill and i think you know bwca is bursting bwca uh excuse me i did not birth it but but tinan and and others birthing it christina uh bursting it and and allowing us to kind of care for this baby has been such a privilege um and and i'm so honored to be a part of it uh if you guys have any questions or concern about maryland or dc kind of birthing experiences i've gone through a bit i'm happy to help and with that i will just i'll pass it back to you thanks jasmine lakeisha just wanna again just express my gratitude to you me and your boss um and also to the black women's congressional alliance um obviously i know that i'm biased but you know to to be a part of such an organization that really does walk the talk that really does believe in taking our roles very seriously whether the in the administration or in congress um or on k street or in on dc city council um taking very seriously our agency when it comes to the business of black women and this is an issue that bwca cares deeply about you all can see that person this has all affected us you know personally um and as staffers um it has been an issue that that we that we all have um that my colleagues here have and my sisters have worked on and so i think that if you if you have questions if you're if you um are even a black woman right now that's interested in becoming pregnant you're pregnant um and you uh want to talk to us um and you know we're happy you know we're happy to do so um if you um like yeah said if you if you need um if you have questions about being connected to doulas you know whether in the district or in maryland or in virginia we certainly are happy to share you know our personal experiences um with you thanks lakeisha christina um yeah i the thing i want to underscore is that you know you center black women and you take care of it on this front everyone benefits right it's not just black women who will benefit from these changes in policy it's everyone who would benefit from these changes and policies and so i want to extend my gratitude to representative kelly uh congresswoman underwood and all everyone who's been working um on the black maternal health issue and in the congress i would also say to folks who are interested in this issue right sometimes you know uh congress can be uh deliberative in pace um and so your your state and local governments also have the opportunity to layer on some policies here um to to move ahead and to advance so if you're in the district of columbia that's definitely something that we're doing here i'm really excited um we're about to do a maternal mental health task force here in dc um that we're hopefully gonna get funded at the end of this week um so there's just a lot of stuff that's going on the other thing i would say too you know bwc has been great it it in sort of the black women's space and the black mama space there are other organizations that are there for support too i have to shout out my girls at district motherhood um which is also around you know supporting both pregnant women but also those who have given birth as well like i said i feel like um you know that that that proverb or that saying that it takes a village to raise a child is like so deeply important and so i feel like for women you you're not alone in this and you shouldn't have to travel this journey alone in silence so connect with us and we're good really appreciate you all coming through christina henderson lakeisha steele yasmin nelson and then we have i think keenan just went off camera but she's but we uh still uplift her um in her absence keenan austin reed thank you all to our audience thank you so much to congresswoman's staff for putting this together rachel i know you're in the virtual world this calls for a part two so uh hopefully that will come through um

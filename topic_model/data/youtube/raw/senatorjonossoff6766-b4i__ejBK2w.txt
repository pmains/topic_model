THE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS WILL COME TO ORDER. TODAY, THE SUBCOMMITTEE CONTINUES OUR BIPARTISAN WORK INVESTIGATING CONDITIONS IN PRISONS, JAILS, AND DETENTION CENTERS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. I THANK THE RANKING MEMBER FOR HIS COOPERATION. IN JULY, WE RELEASED THE FINDINGS OF CORRUPTION, ABUSE, AND MISCONDUCT IN THE FEDERAL PRISON SYSTEM, AND QUESTIONED THE NOW FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS. TODAY, AFTER A TEN MONTH MY PARTISAN INVESTIGATION, WE CAN REVEAL THAT DESPITE A CLEAR CHARGE FROM CONGRESS TO DETERMINE WHO IS DYING IN PRISONS AND JAILS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WHERE THEY ARE DYING, AND WHY THEY ARE DYING, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS FAILING TO DO SO. THIS FAILURE UNDERMINES EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE URGENT HUMANITARIAN CRISIS ONGOING BEHIND BARS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OUR INVESTIGATION HAS REVEALED THAT LAST YEAR ALONE, ACCORDING TO G.A.O. ANNOUNCES I REQUESTED, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FAILED TO IDENTIFY AT LEAST 998 DEATHS IN CUSTODY, NEARLY 1000 UNCOUNTED DEATHS. THE TRUE NUMBER IS LIKELY MUCH HIGHER. WE WILL HEAR TODAY FROM BELINDA MAINLY, AND VANESSA -- WHOSE LOVED ONES DIED PREVENTIVELY WHILE IN CUSTODY. IN BOTH CASES, SONS AND BROTHERS WHO DIED WHILE THEY WERE PRETRIAL DETAINEES HAVING BEEN CONVICTED OF NO CRIME. WE WILL HEAR THEIR GRIEF AND ANGER, A GRIEF AND ANGER SHARED BY MANY THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHOSE LOVED ONES NEEDLESSLY SUFFERED AND DIED WHILE INCARCERATED. WE WILL HEAR FROM PROFESSOR ANDREA ARMSTRONG AT LOYOLA UNIVERSITY TO UNDERSTAND WHY AND HOW DOJ'S FAILURE TO OVERSEE PRISONS AND JAILS UNDERMINES AMERICANS CIVIL RIGHTS. WE WILL HEAR FROM DR. GOODWIN OF THE -- INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES TO CONGRESS WHICH ANALYZED IN MY REQUEST AND THE -- DOJ COLLECTED IN 2021. AND WHO WILL PUBLICLY REPORT THOSE FINDINGS TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE WILL QUESTION MISS -- DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, ABOUT THE DEPARTMENTS FAILURE SINCE 2019 TO IMPLEMENT THE DEATH AND CUSTODY REPORTING ACT, A FAILURE THAT HAS UNDERMINED FEDERAL OVERSIGHT OF CONDITIONS AND PRISONS IN JAILS NATIONWIDE. THEREFORE UNDERMINING AMERICANS HUMAN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. . MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OR TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS. IN MY STATE AND EVERY STATE. INCLUDING THE RIGHTS OF THOSE INCARCERATED. WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WHAT THE UNITED STATES IS ALLOWING TO HAPPEN ON OUR WATCH IN PRISONS, JAILS, AND DETENTION CENTERS NATIONWIDE IS A MORAL DISGRACE. AS FEDERAL LEGISLATORS SERVING ON THE NATIONS PREEMINENT INVESTIGATIVE PANEL, IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S COMPLICITY IN THIS DISGRACE. THEREFORE, IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO ASK WHAT TOOLS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS USING TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THE INCARCERATED. TO HOLD DOJ ACCOUNTABLE WHEN IT FAILS TO USE THOSE TOOLS, AND TO FURNISH BETTER, MORE POWERFUL TOOLS, WITH WHICH THE DEPARTMENT CAN'T DEFEND THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SPOTS. FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS ENCOURAGED WHEN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL KRISTEN CLARK ANNOUNCED A DOJ INVESTIGATION OF CONDITIONS IN GEORGIA'S HORRIFIC STATE PRISONS, ALMOST ONE YEAR AGO TODAY. IT HAS BECOME CLEAR IN THE COURSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS FAILING IN ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT THAT DEATH IN CUSTODY REPORTING ACT. THAT IS THE DEPARTMENT IS FAILING TO DETERMINE WHO IS DYING BEHIND BARS, WHERE THEY ARE DYING, AND WHY THEY ARE DYING. AND THEREFORE FAILING TO DETERMINE WHERE AND WHICH INTERVENTIONS ARE MOST URGENTLY NEEDED TO SAVE LIVES. IN 2000, THEN AGAIN IN 2014, CONGRESS PASSED THE DEATH IN CUSTODY REPORTING ACT, ALSO KNOWN AS -- TASKING DOJ WITH THE -- CUSTODIAL DEATH DATA NATIONWIDE. YOUR DAY ITSELF DESCRIBES THIS LAW AS, QUOTE, AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHY DEATHS OCCUR IN CUSTODY AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT AVOIDABLE DEATHS. BUT FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS, DOJ COLLECTED AND PUBLISHED THIS DATA, AN INVALUABLE RESOURCE FOR THE DEPARTMENT, FOR THE CONGRESS, AND THE PUBLIC. THEN, ABRUPTLY, THE PUBLICATION STOPPED. OUR INVESTIGATION FOLLOWED. WE FOUND THAT IN RECENT YEARS, AND OVER MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS, THE DEPARTMENTS IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS LAW HAS FAILED. DESPITE CLEAR INTERNAL WARNINGS FROM DOJ'S OWN INSPECTOR GENERAL, AND DOJ'S BUREAU OF STATISTICS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 20, THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT CAPTURE ANY STATE PRISON DEATHS IN 11 STATES, OR ANY JAIL DEATHS IN 12 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. IN FY 21 ALONE, ACCORDING TO G.A.O. -- WITH THE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO IDENTIFY NEARLY 1000 DEATHS. IN MY ASSESSMENT, THE TRUE NUMBER IS MUCH HIGHER. OF THOSE RECORDED, 70% OF THE RECORDS WERE INCOMPLETE. 40% OF RECORDS FAILED TO CAPTURE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS FAILED TO COLLECT A COMPLETE OR ACCURATE STATE AND LOCAL DEATH DATA FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS AND FAIL TO REPORT TO CONGRESS HAVE DATA ABOUT DEATHS IN CUSTODY CAN BE USED TO SAVE LIVES. A REPORT REQUIRED BY LAW THAT IS NOW SIX YEAR PASSED DUKE. WE RECENTLY LEARNED IT'S NOT EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS. PIECES INVESTIGATION ALSO FOUND THE DEPARTMENT HAS NO PLANS TO MAKE STATE AND LOCAL DEATH DATA PUBLIC AGAIN, DESPITE THE OBVIOUS PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS TRANSPARENCY. TODAY'S HEARING MAY DIVE AT TIMES INTO ARCANE DISCUSSIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS OR THE CLOSE PARSING OF LEGISLATIVE TEXT. THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE RELEVANT. THEY ARE RELEVANT. IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS CONCLUDED IN 2020 28 YEARS AFTER THIS LAW WAS REAUTHORIZED, THAT IT IS INCAPABLE OF SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING IT, I'M SURELY WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM TO HELP FIX THAT. BUT THIS HEARING IS ABOUT SOMETHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL. AMERICANS ARE NEEDLESSLY DYING, AND ARE BEING KILLED, WHILE IN THE CUSTODY OF THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT. IN OUR JULY HEARING FOCUSED ON THE FEDERAL PRISON SYSTEM, WE REVEALED THAT FEDERAL PRETRIAL DETAINEES HAVE BEEN DENIED PROPER NUTRITION, HYGIENE, AND MEDICAL CARE, ENDURED MONTHS OF LOCKDOWN WITH LIMITED OR NO ACCESS TO OUTDOORS OR -- RATS AND ROACHES INVESTING THEIR CELLS. WE REVEAL THAT FEDERAL INMATES KILLED THEMSELVES WILD BASIC PRACTICES OF SUICIDE WELLNESS CHECKS WERE NEGLECTED. A ABUSIVE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT LIKELY LED TO LOSS OF LIFE IN -- WHEAT REVEALED THAT THE BUREAU OF PRISONS, WAS WARNED FOR YEARS, BY ITS OWN INVESTIGATORS OF CORRUPTION AND MISCONDUCT IN ITS OWN FACILITY, AND OF A, QUOTE, LACK OF REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE BY ITS OWN PERSONNEL. TODAY, WE WILL HEAR ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES OF AMERICANS IN STATE AND LOCAL PRISONS AND -- AMERICANS ENTITLED TO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE INCARCERATED, WHETHER THEY ARE INCARCERATED, AND WE WILL HEAR ABOUT AMERICANS WHO DIED IN CUSTODY, MANY OF WHOSE DEATHS AND CAUSES OF DEATH ARE NOT BEING COUNTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS BOUND TO COUNT THEM. THE SAME FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OBLIGATED TO DEFEND THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. BEFORE I YIELD TO THE RANKING MEMBER, AND WITH MAILING PERMISSION, WE WILL LISTEN TO AN AUDIO CLIP OF THE LAST PHONE CALL THAT SHE SHARED WITH HER SON WHILE HE WAS JAILED. A PRETRIAL DETAINEE WHO WAS NEVER CONVICTED OF ANY CRIME. I WANT TO WARN THOSE WHO ARE TUNED IN ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT THIS IS A FROM -- AS THAT WE IMAGINE HOW WE MIGHT FEEL TO BE ON EITHER END OF THIS CALL. PLEASE PLAY THE AUDIO. >> OKAY, LISTEN, I FOUND OUT EVERYTHING I CAN. I'M HAVING LAWYERS -- TRYING TO MAKE IT I'M TRYING TO GET YOU OUT OF THERE. >> I WANT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. I'M ONE -- I'M GOING TO DIE IN HERE. >> I KNOW YOU ARE. I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO GET YOU OUT. SO I CAN SEE YOU. HELLO? >> YES. >> -- MY FEET ARE SWOLLEN. THEY HURT. >> I KNOW, MATTHEW. I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU. I TOLD YOU -- THEY'RE GONNA CUT US OFF MATTHEW, I LOVE. YOU >> I LOVE YOU TOO. I'M GOING TO DIE IN HERE! >> THE CRISIS IN AMERICAS PRISONS, JAILS, AND DETENTION CENTERS IS ONGOING

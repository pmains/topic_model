mr. Faber from the great state of Minnesota next Thank You mr. chair and I appreciate the witnesses here testifying as mr. Renaldi I was in grade school too and President Carter was our president a couple of things I just wanted to reiterate to mr. buntz Cirrus aircraft in Duluth Minnesota is the largest manufacturer of a piston-driven aircraft I spoke with them and they had the cert the certificates were delayed in sending the aircraft out they have now been backed up about for months because of this can you talk to us about other general aviation manufacturers some of their concerns like Cirrus hadn't by the way Cirrus aircraft employs 1,100 people in Duluth Minnesota in and around Duluth Minnesota well thank you sir and Cirrus also delivered the most jets last year of any manufacturer out there with the new visions yet so it's pretty exciting so take another company in Florida that provides other types of aircraft out there they were within a week of furloughing because they could not get flight test people to be able to keep their programs going other another very large jet manufacturer if you look at a major development program and I've testified in front of this committee before the burn rate for a major program is about ten million dollars a month and so if you can't get the program to progress like get flight tests what happens is those flight tests people are now booked the next month with another company so you you don't just push everybody to the right you you go and you get to go folks that were scheduled and then you have to go several months later so it really is a burn rate where it's like lighting a match to the to the money and that money could have been used to go ahead and hire more people as you ramped up production once you get your certification so it all has ripple effects for each one of the manufacturers when we have delays like that thank you then the second second comment I'd like to make a ranking member graves made it and this is about the inability to elect elected officials in Washington to come to a compromise and it's extremely disappointing I hope it doesn't happen again and you talk about safety I have to ask this one more time was there any flight in this country that took off flu that we know only felt was unsafe anybody I'll take it again I would say no okay that's to miss Nelson you talked about Safety's first the flight attendants and the assistants you guys and gals do a magnificent job you make the flights peaceful and and through some stressful situations and I've only been a member for a month and a half but I flown enough to to really see this spectacular job that you and your folks do so I appreciate that my last comment will be this I will support 100% the aviation industry beyond 10 years Thank You mr. chair you

Kym's recommendations regarding the continuity of the economy I think are particularly relevant given the challenges that we're addressing here with the corona virus so pandemic so in the event of a widespread or a prolonged cyber attack on critical infrastructure we all agree that the impact could be catastrophic so my question for you senator King is can you discuss the recommendation and what lessons do you think we're learning from covet 19 that you think we should be considering for a long-term cyber attack well I think one of the first things we we've learned is the necessity of planning the necessity of thinking the unthinkable of putting smart people into a room and talking about what could happen and what would happen and how to bring the economy back I think that the continuity of the economy planning and setting that up as a real function is one of our most important recommendations and you've got to be we've got to be think about what happens if the Northeast grid goes down or or the southern grid we've got to be thinking about the lessons that we're learning now some anticipated frankly I think once we get through this this awful situation that we're in now one of the most important things is an after-action assessment what I call an after-action assessment what did we learn and what was missing what are the critical functions what are the pieces that we need to be paying attention to that are likely to be vulnerable before I finish also let me mention the Chairman asked a question about breach notification senator wicker senator Cantwell and Senator Moran all three have bills on that I think they're good bills and so I think there is there are some models that we can go forward but to get back to continuity the economy I think it's absolutely a critical function it's got to be strategic it's got to be specific and I want to be ready when this happens it's going to happen mr. senator it's going to happen I told somebody the other day we are seeing the longest wind-up for a punch in the history of the world but that punch is going to come

all right now with great pleasure joining me on set Senator Tom Cotton from the great state of Arkansas said oh wait a second you got a book we love books author of Only the Strong one click on Amazon is it actually at it is out there you can buy it on any bookstore today please go out and do so and a lot of issues you touch on your roof I touched on in the book and I explained that it's not just Insanity although it seems like that it's part of the progressive left deliberate plot to sabotage the sources of American power a strong and growing economy a strong military Sovereign borders Sovereign freedom of action in the world um American energy production the progressive left going back 100 years and to very much include today's you know BLM riders or the squad or the 1619 project types are at best ambivalent about America and therefore they're hostile to the sources of American power yes there's no America First with that crowd ever no America first let me just come back we weren't part of the group at lunch today with you you spoke very eloquently and I think you illuminated a lot of important issues um you know I have a certain wise ass sense of humor I get that and I compare Kamala Harris with Jay Powell he may be the Kamala Harris of monetary policy his performances it was very bad and you hate to see almost a thousand Point swing in stocks but but but but the trouble here from day one has been fed over spending that is federal government Biden overspending which was monetized by the Federal Reserve and so inflation is the number one issue plus their war against fossil fuels I want to just ask you is there an end to this in sight if the Cavalry comes will this be ended yeah there isn't into it when we win the election next week Larry you know inflation is too much money chasing too few goods and the Democrats have created this inflation coming and going first off they spent trillions of dollars that we don't have and that our economy didn't need it was as it was recovering early last year from democratic shutdowns Larry summers at the time said so uh second they've also constricted Supply especially when it comes to American Energy oil and gas and coal because energy inflation is the worst kind of inflation it affects everything we do not just the gas you put in your to get to work but the food you buy the clothes you buy products for your homes this is devices ordinary folks you know sitting around kitchen tables they don't understand that you do away with fossil fuels you're going to do away with hundreds of things the glasses on your face the pen in your hand the shoes we wear uh petroleum products go into hundreds and hundreds of everyday products and we are the world's energy superpower yet the Democrats have waged war on fossil fuels Joe Biden said in 2020 he was going to eliminate fossil fuel production they'd rather Outsource our energy to China which through its combination of unfair Trade Practices and mercantilist policies are the dominant producers of so-called green energy as I explained in Only the Strong this is directly undermining not only our prosperity at home but our power broad as well so let me yeah let's go through this again let us assume the Cavalry is coming we both heard Dick Morris give a very ambitious forecast today of a big GOP win but I don't know the numbers exactly but I think dick is a smart guy and he's on the right track you seem to basically uh be in sympathy with it as I was um so you take over the house you take over the Senate I'm going to say whenever you all get sworn in for the new session early January what happens Senator tomcon because you're going to have still high inflation uh if not as not an outright recession a sinking economy Republicans will be blamed almost immediately if they don't get out of the shoot fast what do you think is going to happen first off from the from the election next week markets can be sure you're not going to have more trillions of dollars spent but second once we take office in January I think we should focus on American energy production because it is so vital to our economy but also you have a lot of Democrats who will face the voters in 2024 from States who depend on fossil fuel production in West Virginia Pennsylvania Ohio and Montana so I hope we could find at least a few Democrats who would recognize that even if they don't prefer it as a policy solution as a political Shield they need to side John Owens always said take the handcuffs off on Guess take the handcuffs off for fine petroleum products what happens prices will fall and economic growth might rise and you could actually you think you could get votes for that we could and you know we can also use our spending power more you know in 2015 when I was new to the Senate we just won back the Senate after six years of Obama having a Democratic Senate we were able to use spending bills to lift the ban on oil exports for instance that created many more markets around the world for America's oil and gas producers so maybe we'll be able to use our spending power to get some favorable changes to oil and gas practices in the country as well that I think I think you put your best foot forward then I think you'd be making a clear statement also you would be dealing with the ills of the economy so you figure your colleagues saying the same thing you're hearing this in the cloak room I know you're not in the cloak room you hear on our set yeah this is one of those issues that unites all Republicans because just such a common sense issue for most Americans when they're paying four dollars a gallon for gas or five dollars six dollars a gallon for gas out on the west coast they want Common Sense practical solution they're not audio logs they're not beholden to some idea that we need to leave all fossil fuels in the ground so this is something that unites all Republicans and hopefully we get a handful of Democrats to cooperate with us last Point uh Joe Biden is out there now this is this newest Mansion they've tried everything else but what the key points are on the economy and crime and the Border uh Republicans you all are going to destroy Medicare and you're going to destroy Social Security Now this one I've been around even longer than you I mean this this argument has been around almost since the 1930s but here they go again Republicans are going to destroy your retirement and destroy your health care what you make of that how effective is this going to be well let's recall 2022 is the 50th anniversary of Joe Biden's first campaign for Senate so he's been making this exact argument that his entire adult life and it's simply because they don't have any other arguments to make they have no solutions to things like inflation and crime and the drug epidemic and our open border because their policies are the cause of those problems and the American people are going to deliver a resounding verdict against the Democratic agenda on Tuesday and just to conclude let's end where we began Geo LPS got to make it clear America First not America lasts not Joe remember Joe Biden's he's having his ice cream cone I don't progress him his ice cream cone our economy is great but I'm not worried about us I'm worried about what a battle overseas no no how about America First going yeah and I write about this in Only the Strong that our founding fathers would have said of course you have to put America first because no one else would this has been a common sense solution for our entire history until modern times if we don't put America First no one else will and my pal Sarah Sanders big winner for governor of Arkansas she's going to be a big winner and even better governor and Francia will be re-elected in the house easily re-elected Senator Tom Cotton I have to catch up with all my friends author of Only the Strong reversing the left's plot to sabotage American power pretty good you know you could make it as a Fed watcher

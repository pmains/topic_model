senator from Virginia mr. president thank you for allowing me to retake the floor I'm speaking about the nomination of Congressman price to be HHS secretary and reading stories from Virginians who are afraid about what a repeal of the Affordable Care Act would mean in their lives I will continue mark priest Alexandria Virginia I'm a self-employed entrepreneur and consultant since I worked for myself I don't have access to a special pool from an employer that would make health insurance more affordable starting in 2014 I was insured through the ACA and I was able to find an affordable policy to cover myself I think there's a mistaken notion that if you are employed you automatically have access to affordable health insurance the ACA isn't just for the unemployed I work hard and I'm a small business owner the ACA makes it possible for me to afford health care Constance birch Fort Valley Virginia I'm a 53 year old single female who's self-employed as a voice and piano teacher I've always prided myself on being able to care for myself and provide the basic necessities of where the ACA I had a CA I had to pay over $450 a month for health care on a net income of $19,000 this meant some months having to used credit cards for other necessities such as food and gasoline to get to my lessons thanks to President Obama that all changed and based on my income my fee was reduced to $33 a month I literally cried for joy that someone finally did something to help those of us who work hard and deserve the same quality health care that the more fortunate are able to have it's fair and quite honestly it was the first time in my life that I truly felt that the government actually did something to help me personally and those in the same position Deb fuller Alexandria Virginia I rely on the ACA for my health insurance because otherwise I'd not be able to get it my job writing k12 textbooks and other educational material has largely been outsourced and full-time permanent positions with benefits are nearly non-existent these days the majority of the work is as a flexible work force which is a fancy term for a freelancer or contract employee having the ACA means I can continue working these contracts instead of trying to figure out how to completely change professions because I need a job that provides health insurance before the ACA my saint of a doctor went back and forth with health insurance companies trying to convince them that I wouldn't cost them too much money in the long run they literally looked for anything to deny me coverage one rejection letter mentioned cold sores in the litany of reasons why I was completely uninsurable 90% of the population has cold sores now insurance companies make back their money on me because I pay them vastly more than they cover because I don't get sick that often or visit the doctor that often outside of routine checkups I also have peace of mind that if I'm out on horseback riding or on the trail I won't be put in the poorhouse because I landed in a heat and had to go to the ER Lauren Carter Lovingston Virginia my 39 year old son has cerebral palsy and a blood clotting disorder his pre-existing conditions started at conception three years ago he lost his full-time job with health insurance benefits the ACA allows him to continue receiving medical care and purchase his life-saving medications he supports himself through multiple part-time jobs but employer-based insurance is just not an option for him at this time shannon Linford Leesburg Virginia my name is Shannon Linford I'm 24 from the age of 10 my life has been a series of doctor's office visits I suffer from more than half a dozen chronic illnesses physical and mental and require frequent checkups and take up to 15 prescriptions a day I've spent the last 14 years balancing illness with my attempts to build a life that would not have been possible were not for the provisions of the ACA that prevent insurance companies from denying me service for my illnesses or allowing me to stay on my parent's insurance until I'm 26 I've had to take a detour from pursuing higher education due to my illnesses as well as getting a job and instead spend the days I'm well enough volunteering with nonprofits that advocate for others with illnesses like mine my team of doctors and I work together personally to create a plan that's best for me we're exemplifying healthcare at its best they know me by name they know each other by name across disciplines they work and collaborate together I would not have this luxury were not for the ACA insurance companies would deny me coverage due to my pre-existing conditions and my family and I would go into bankruptcy trying to get basic care my health is finally under good management I'm going into remission with my depression thanks to new experimental treatments from my psychiatrists things are looking up thanks to the provisions in this remarkable act of legislation revoking this law would be criminal and would destroy lives destroy futures thank you so much for your hard work and I am from Vienna I asked that I not use her last name without the ACA I'd likely be dead I live with bipolar disorder an incurable mental illness that causes my moods to swing uncontrollably from intense anxiety to crushing depression I began seeking help five years ago and once spent two weeks in an intensive outpatient hospital program because I was suicidal I got help but later lost my job and my insurance making my disorder a pre-existing condition thankfully the ACA prevents my new insurance from refusing coverage and I was able to continue treatment I'll need to control my bipolar disorder with medications and therapy for the rest of my life without treatment I'm at a higher risk for long-term unemployment becoming homeless incarceration dying by suicide with treatment I work full-time pay my taxes volunteer for local charities and I'm a loving daughter sister and friend Katie rug Henrico Virginia I was paying half the cost of my rent and health insurance every month and still having to pay for services every time I went to be seen I never knew how much things would cost when I went to be seen either so I was paying an outrageous amount for health insurance and also afraid to go see a doctor if I had any issues because it was going to cost me more money than I had on top of everything else I was living to paycheck to paycheck with a full-time professional job in my field and a master's degree and seriously considering going without any insurance at all when the ACA was passed my employer offered a discounted option through the affordable care exchanges I decided it was worth trying it cut my monthly cost by more than half and it pays for services at 100% of the Medicare fee schedule the cost is deducted directly from my paycheck and every provider that I've seen has been happy with the prompt and predictable payment even if it requires some explanation at first the way it works is that I would pay the difference if there was any between the cost of service and the Medicare fees payment so far any additional cost to me besides occasional lab work have been very minimal and my regular chiropractic care is completely covered it's been phenomenal and like the difference between day and night for me but not only did this option allow me to feel comfortable going in to see a doctor when I had an issue instead of when I absolutely had to and was already sick it also helped me put some money away into modest savings and most importantly with housing costs continuing to rise and my paychecks staying absolutely static for three and a half years I was finally able to buy my own house through a first-time homeowners assistance loan it took a year looking and saving aggressively but I've done it I've done it losing my ACA insurance would be devastating I've come too close to homelessness with the financial pressures I face in this economy I don't want to lose now what I have worked so hard to gain Thank You senator Kane for what you've been able to do to help people like me sincerely Katie Rudd Jo Ann Lewis lit Clifton Virginia my story is I'm sure like many other women I was a stay-at-home mom and in 2009 my husband who owned his own business and I separated and ended up divorced three years later he's not required to keep my children insured and he canceled their health insurance without me knowing it the company I started working for it on offer health insurance and we went without until the ACA went into effect our pediatrician didn't charge me for office visits only for vaccines when needed we borrowed money to help pay the bills if the ACA gets repealed what would we do what would happen if my son breaks his arm or my daughter breaks her leg how could I pay for that I make $50,000 a year and live in Fairfax County and I could end up in bankruptcy we have a right to have insurance and lived with peace of mind lauric Ramos Mechanicsville Virginia my daughter was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in April of 2013 that September my husband was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease we're farmers we raise food for America as such were independently insured prior to finding a plan through the ACA in January 2015 our monthly insurance premiums were to increase to nearly $3,000 a month yes a month on top of that our health care insurance had an annual cap on prescription coverage of $5,000 the you Mira that my daughter takes to combat Crohn's retails for $3,800 a month and this is not the only medication she needs so basically after one month we reached the prescription coverage cap meaning we would have to pay thirty eight hundred a month for her medication on top of three thousand a month in premiums who has an extra sixty eight hundred dollars a month to pay for this this is way more than we earn every month with the health insurance plan we got through the ACA our premiums for 2015 were fifteen hundred dollars a month less than half of what we would have been paying but the real saving grace was no prescription cap so my daughter's medications are covered with a copay after we reached the deductible this is still a lot of money but at least we can treat our daughter's disease and hopefully keep her healthy and even though our premiums have gone up to nearly two thousand a month for this year under the ACA at least we still have insurance under the cent Republican senators repeal of the pre-existing condition provision will might be able to get much less afford any insurance in the future and this will have devastating consequences to my daughter's health she's only 15 years old she deserves a chance in life and I've not even touched on how our insurance will affect my husband's Parkinson's disease we are upper-middle class income Americans I'm not asking for a handout we're paying more than 25% of our income for health care related expenses and I can't imagine this effect has on people with less resources than we have do you know what happens if you get sick or a disease and you don't have or can have health insurance or medical treatment you die seriously health care costs are out of control in America health care is a basic right and people are dying Cynthia Elliot Hillsborough Virginia governor Kaine without the ACA I and many other younger seniors whose jobs do not provide health care would simply be without until Medicare kicks in I was paying $1,000 a month for HMO care until I couldn't but with the ACA I was able to get I was able to get coverage for a reasonable $300 a month and this one includes dental care it is a lifesaver for me Mary Lloyd parks Richland we have excellent insurance coverage though expensive through my husband's partnership at a large law firm and we've been grateful we have two daughters now 21 and 23 our oldest has cystic fibrosis the Affordable Care Act has allowed her to stay in her health insurance policy through college and now in her first years as an urban teachers fellow in Washington DC where she's teaching first grade and studying at night to get her master's degree in elementary and special ed while her health is currently good the medicine she requires to maintain or else are extremely expensive and without our insurance she would not be able to afford them the prescriptions cost thousands of dollars every month we're quite fearful that when she turns 26 or pre-existing condition a very expensive and lifelong disease that requires routine hospitalizations and even lung transplants would make her virtually uninsurable we are counting on the ACA to be in place when she can no longer be insured as a member of our family she's chosen a profession that may not allow her to afford the care she needs but she was born with a chronic serious illness that would be a pre-existing condition that a future in sure could use to deny her coverage or charge her prohibitively high premiums just for more mr. president carry Haws Midlothian Virginia sometimes people for get how much is encompassed in the ACA if not for the ACA my husband would be dead diagnosed with a fatal liver disease at 27 he needed a liver transplant and he ended up getting 2 on July 19th 2012 he received a new liver at UNC hospital he regained his wife and we were able to move home to Richmond to take new jobs and begin a family knowing that his pre-existing condition would be covered under the ACA we were able to live without fear that an employer would deny us coverage because he was high-risk Sammy Newman Richmond before the ACA became law I was paying more than 1200 a month for health insurance quitting altogether was one alternative but it would have been paying possibly double for health care procedures and lab tests because I'd no longer be eligible for the negotiated prices contracted by the health insurance company still I was almost out of money then the ACA was passed my rates fell to between 50 and 60 dollars a month for better policies that I had before making the switch at 62 years of age I'm faced with healthcare needs that continue to increase as a cancer survivor 21 years and Counting it's imperative that I be proactive regarding health care in fact having a good doctor under an affordable employer-sponsored health care plan is what saved my life 21 years ago please don't let this lifeline be abolished hi des Richmond she asked me not to use her last name thanks to the passage of the ACA I was able to stay on my parents health insurance plan until I turned 26 this policy change allowed me to go back to school at 24 years old to pursue a master's degree during which time I was diagnosed with a malignant melanoma the mole was not of concern to me at all and it was found during a routine check-up if I didn't have access to my parents health insurance at that time I surely would not have had access to pathologists and surgeons who diagnosed and remove the cancer before it had the chance to spread while no one truly knows what would have happened had this tumor not been removed I truly feel that I owe my life to the ACA ACA and finally mr. president Christopher Woodruff from Bedford Virginia dear senator Kaine in September 2011 I began receiving Social Security disability benefits not from an injury but from an illness I was diagnosed with 12 years ago a rare blood disorder caused by a mutated gene in my bone marrow I worked as many years as I could but I've eventually became unable to the company I worked for insurance plan had a ten thousand dollar deductible so for me having to go to the hospital twice a month for treatment for most of the 12 years it's taken all of my savings and the retirement I had accumulated to cover my medical bills seven years ago we had to cancel my wife's health insurance due to the high cost due to the high cost of medical care my wife would not see her doctor time she really needed to the amount of disability I received barely covers our basic needs so she felt she could not afford a doctor bill but under the Affordable Care Act she qualifies for a decent policy that cost us $30 a month this has enabled her to start seeing her doctors again and made her prescriptions for asthma affordable and obtainable gain again this coverage is a lifesaver for us and I'm not sure how I could handle losing it please please convince your colleagues in the Senate to show some compassion for those who worked hard all their life only to lose everything because they became ill thanks for your service god bless you with kindest personal regard Kris Woodruff this is not a game this is not politics this is not a debate this is the lives of dozens of Virginia sampled out of 1600 stories that have been sent to me in the last three weeks all saying to this body one thing do not repeal the Affordable Care Act do not jeopardize the health care of 30 million people do not jeopardize the peace of minds of parents going to bed at night and making them wonder what will happen if their child gets sick tomorrow or if they lose their job we can improve and many of these letters point out things we need to do improve the Affordable Care Act but we shouldn't even be contemplating a repeal of a law that provides so much good to so many and this is one of the main reasons why when we vote late today I'm going to be opposing someone who wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act Congressman Tom price as he's been nominated for HHS secretary and with that mr. president I yield the floor thank you

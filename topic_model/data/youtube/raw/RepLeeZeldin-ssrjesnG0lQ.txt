Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to honor Brookhaven National Lab on its 70th anniversary the United States is the greatest nation in the world and one of the reasons why is Brookhaven National Lab their science research is aggressively pursuing cures to illnesses protecting our national security and increasing our energy independence imagine being able to witness a recreation of the very beginning of our universe a replica of the primordial soup which once comprised all that had existed right before your very eyes also imagine that this very same equipment could be used to find cures to illnesses such as cancer and heart disease I'm proud that brookhaven national laboratory is located in the greatest congressional district in America the first congressional district of new york for nearly three quarters of a century Brookhaven has stood as a world-class research center that conducts groundbreaking studies within the scientific community Brookhaven ask the big questions that scientists have been researching for generations and has allowed us to look into the building blocks of our world between the preservation of our ecosystem studies on the environment and researching new forms of sustainable energy Brookhaven is a world leader in scientific research there's also incredible cultural and historical relevance of the site of Brookhaven National Lab there was once a world war one army training center called Camp Upton located where Brookhaven stands today it was at this camp that Irving Berlin wrote god bless america while serving in the US Army Brookhaven is not only a local and regional treasure but also a national asset the machines in Brookhaven have been utilized by the most brilliant minds in America from the scientists of MIT and yale to the engineers at GE and IBM while there are 17 national labs across our great country Brookhaven is a unique user facility which focuses in a number of disciplines not limited to particle physics chemical engineering and systems engineering integration in previous Congress's critical funding has been provided in support of the RPE program for several of Brookhaven's phenomenal projects on energy production and storage and so much more there's been discussion in the past to cut funding for Brookhaven's nuclear physics program to levels that haven't been seen since 2008 this would be a mistake brookhaven features some of the most important scientific efforts in the world with assets like the national synchrotron light source 2 or NSLs to nsl s2 is allowed for incredible advancement in the research and development of superconductors which have the potential to revolutionize energy consumption the US and save into the billions for the American people and American businesses another program in need of our continued support is the relativistic heavy ion collider or Rick this multifaceted machine is essential for studies on matter and has key practical applications like figuring out how to best protect our homeland using detector technology there's also the Brookhaven linic isotope producer or blip which has been recently upgraded to advance the field of medical science this upgrade allows blip to better diagnose and treat illness including heart disease in many forms of cancer such as leukemia and melanoma with Congress's continued support there is limitless potential for needed discovery and advancement mr. speaker thank you for allowing me to discuss this amazing national treasure I would also like to thank Jim Gibbs who is the lab director for his outstanding leadership at this facility is a privilege to stand here on the floor of the US House of Representatives to speak on behalf of America's great scientists and their vital work congratulations again to Brookhaven National Lab on 70 years of groundbreaking innovative research and to everyone at home happy Valentine's Day Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back

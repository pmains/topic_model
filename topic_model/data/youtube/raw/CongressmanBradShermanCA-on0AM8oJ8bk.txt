bring in democratic congressman brad Sherman of California the second ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee good morning it's good to see you could be with you could let me ask you first about what the president-elect tweeted and about his reaction to both of these attacks on the Russian ambassador in Ankara where he blamed radical Islamic terrorists same on the attack in Berlin is this a situation of concern that he's getting out ahead of what the investigation shows or is this tough talk a warning Trump is going to be your shoot from the hip president we knew that or those who voted for him knew that when they voted for him my guess is that quite often he'll turn out to be right he's saying what everybody in the world would tend to believe and at the same time maybe once or twice a year he'll have to retract the tweet in involving international affairs from the standpoint of the State Department the way we've always done business that's unacceptable but the the world I can't understand make as you well know congressman is that the reason people elected him is because they find the way Washington works to be unacceptable and so maybe they want him to give this tough talk do you think that there's danger in it uh I think that he'll be wrong some of the times because you lacked too quickly on the other hand there is an advantage to speaking frankly and immediately and I think the world will understand that when you see a trump tweet you're not seeing weeks of state department meetings coming up with a locked in change of policy you're hearing what the president elect or then president thinks that very moment and the fact is that the killer in in in Turkey who seemed obviously is a terrorist and seems to have been motivated by his own beliefs about Islam and what's happening in Syria which of course is terrible so I my guess is that these two tweets will turn out to be correct but from a State Department standpoint there they would act much more slowly obviously he's made it very clear that he thinks that President Obama his administer have not done enough to fight Isis a lot of his supporters cheer him at his rallies before and after the election when he starts talking about how he's going to defeat Isis even though he has not put forward a specific plan having said that do you think it's an argument that resonates especially when you see the series of attacks across Europe over the last year well I think Obama had major successes in dealing with terrorism first we didn't have thousands of casualties in an unnecessary war second we got rid of Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons that he'll that exists in Syria today imagine how much worse it would have been if Assad had somehow retained that huge stock of chemical weapons and when you look at Trump's proposed policies they seem relatively close to those of Obama except more cooperation with Russia and a lot more tough talk the fact is that Obama's talk is considerably mellower than george w bush's but there have been a lot more drone strikes and we got bin Laden so on the ground not talking not posturing but actually acting Obama has been pretty tough one of the key questions that we don't know and I guess in some ways you could argue we don't know it going into most new administration's is who on the foreign policy team will indeed be the person who has the presidency or who he listens to most closely and sometimes those are relationships that's developed but since you brought up the State Department and how it's the way that Trump has been responding to this is different than what they like or what decades of tradition would suggest I want to ask you what you think about Rex Tillerson a lot of people are expecting a big fight should there be well we the fight is not so much about the main but about what our policy is going to be about Russia you're talking about a Republican Senate and the Republican Party has been the anti Russia party in this country since the 1930s and continuously even after the Soviet Union fell and when you have a man who has been against sanctions against Russia and against sanctions policy in general when its sanctions that punished I ran to the point where we got at least some concessions and possibly could have got more the the Republican majority in the Senate is an anti Russia willing to impose sanctions majority and tell erson seems to be on the other side of that congressman brad Sherman good to talk to you today thank you for taking the time

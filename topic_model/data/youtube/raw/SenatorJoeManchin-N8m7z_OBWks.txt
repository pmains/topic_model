contact him with the upcoming 2022 medicare open enrollment fast approaching we have already begun receiving calls from constituents concerning things like eligibility requirements and changes to medicare advantage plans today i will be joined by three individuals that will assist you on your journey to find affordable health care options i am excited to introduce miss sharon graham she serves as the regional administrator for the centers for medicare and medicaid services philadelphia office sharon could you start us off hi angie thank you very much for that kind introduction again i'm sharon graham and i'm the regional administrator for the centers for medicare and medicaid services in our philadelphia regional office and our office has responsibility for the mid-atlantic states including west virginia and so i'm happy to be here with you today i'm going to spend a few minutes speaking with you about getting started with your medicare coverage so what is medicare medicare is health insurance for people primarily age 65 and older however people under the age of 65 with certain disabilities can also qualify for medicare and i want to be clear that these are for people who social security determines to be disabled not for people necessarily on workers compensation so if you're under age 65 and disabled please check with social security for people under age 65 for example who have end-stage renal disease they'll qualify for medicare after a 24 month waiting period and also people with als otherwise known as lou gehrig's disease will also qualify for medicare without a waiting period but to qualify for medicare it's important to know that you need to be a u.s citizen or lawfully present in the united states for at least five continuous years to qualify and all people with medicare every september will receive the medicare and you handbook that you see there on the screen every household will get one copy and it's a great resource to explain all things about medicare and also show you some of your health care options available to you in the next year in the appendices at the back so what is medicare it comes in three parts first part a is your hospital insurance so that covers your inpatient hospitalization home health care hospice care and skilled nursing needs if you have them part b is all other services basically your outpatient services like physician visits and lab visits and durable medical equipment like wheelchairs and canes and knee braces and things like that are covered by medicare part b and then part d remember d stands for prescription drugs is optional coverage you can add in order to have your prescription drug needs met so there are basically two key components to medicare you either have original medicare or you choose to get your medicare benefits through a medicare advantage plan when people are first eligible for medicare they will always have original medicare that's the default coverage and original medicare includes medicare part a and b that we just spoke about your inpatient and your outpatient care and you can always add part d coverage or prescription drug coverage the federal government contracts with private companies to offer that prescription drug coverage so you will be contacted or can look into medicare and you handbook about prescription drug options that are available to you in your area of west virginia now it's important to know that people with original medicare also have out of pocket costs there's typically a deductible an annual deductible and co-insurance that you'll have to pay and many people choose to purchase supplemental coverage sometimes you'll hear called medigap coverage to cover those out-of-pocket gaps that medicare will leave you with primarily the co-insurances and the deductibles and those medigap plans are also offered by private companies that are overseen by your state department of insurance in west virginia it's important to know too with original medicare that you can see just about any doctor or any hospital you just show your red white and blue medicare card and in most cases that physician in that hospital are participating with the medicare program and you'll get coverage across the united states now with medicare advantage you need to sign up yourself for that if you choose to receive your medicare benefits through a medicare advantage plan and basically you're getting all of your medicare advantage benefits all of your medicare benefits through that medicare advantage plan both part a and part b and in most cases the prescription drug coverage is folded into that as well so you'll have medicare a b and d all through the medicare advantage plan many of those plans offer additional benefits as well so you might have access to hearing aids for example or routine eye coverage or routine dental coverage those are benefits that original medicare does not cover one of the benefits of a medicare advantage plan is that they will have typically a lower premium and a lower out-of-pocket cost than say the supplemental plan it's important to note that a supplemental plan a medigap plan will not cover the out-of-pocket costs at a medicare advantage plan you will have to pay those yourself one other thing to know about medicare advantage plans is that they do have networks of doctors so whereas with original medicare as i said you can see just about any doctor or hospital across the country with a medicare advantage plan you need to stay with the doctors that contract with the medicare advantage plan so it's important to know if you're looking at enrolling in a medicare advantage plan that you make sure that your doctors and your hospitals and your pharmacy have a contract that they participate with that medicare advantage plan so what you see here on the screen is your red white and blue medicare card and every person with medicare will receive this card if you want to accept your medicare part b simply keep the card however if you don't need medicare part b at that time perhaps you're getting health insurance through your employer or the in your spouse's employer then you can refuse part b and if you want to do that just sign the form and return it that you'll see how to do that in the instructions in the package that's mailed to you now even if you choose to get coverage to a medicare advantage plan it's important that you keep your medicare card and keep it in a safe place the medicare advantage plans will send you a separate card and you will need to show that card to get health care coverage in a medicare advantage plan but always keep your medicare red white and blue card in a safe place carry it with you if you need to but be sure that it's safe and remember to not share your medicare number with anybody except your health care providers that's really important keep your card safe and only share your medicare information with your health care providers if you ever lose your card or need a replacement you can always call our 1 800 medicare number that's available 24 hours a day seven days a week or if you go online to medicare.gov and open up an account there you can request a replacement card right online now as you heard at the top from angie we're rapidly approaching open enrollment for medicare and open enrollment starts on october 15th and continues all the way through to december 7th and this is the one time every year that you can review your health care coverage and make changes that are important to you to make sure that you continue to have the coverage that meets your needs at a cost that you can afford and still with the doctors and hospitals that you want to see we call that the cost coverage and convenience so we encourage everybody to take this time now starting on october 15th to review your health care coverage to make sure that it meets your needs and if it doesn't this is the time to make a change no later than december 7th so that your new coverage can be effective january 1st and lastly i'd like to leave you with a couple of really important resources i mentioned our 1 800 medicare phone number where we have customer service representatives available to you 24 hours a day 7 days a week and you can also go online to our website medicare.gov where you'll find lots of helpful information and starting on october 1st you'll actually be able to see those medicare advantage plans that'll be available to you starting on october 15th during open enrollment we also have our medicaid.gov website for people of limited needs who are under age 65 primarily and need additional health insurance help social security.gov is critical that's where you go first to sign up for social security and also for medicare if you don't receive your red white and blue card in the mail and you'll hear more from jeremy later about the health insurance marketplace and that website is healthcare.gov and lastly rebecca gowdy who you'll hear from next is with our local help there for people who need assistance with medicare the state health insurance and assistance program so thank you again for the time senator manchin and i'll turn it back over to angie thank you sharon through our conversations with constituents we've asked west virginians to share their stories and questions with us our first question today comes from priscilla of kanawha county hi my name is priscilla i'm from kenoi county earlier last year i reached out to social security administration to inquire about benefits however an error was made and my information was changed resulting in the cancellation of my medicare benefits for months social security administration told me the issue was resolved however my claims were still being denied it wasn't until i reached out to senator manchin's office that i learned that the social security administration had enrolled me under my late husband's account instead of my own this issue was corrected but it took about a year what could i have done differently thank you for that question priscilla and i'm really sorry that you had that problem getting your healthcare coverage sorted out typically when you sign up for medicare through social security their computer systems talk directly to our systems and it seems like perhaps that didn't happen you did everything you needed to do we just needed to make sure that your records transferred appropriately but remember that if you ever have a problem with your medicare coverage you can always call our 1 800 medicare line where they can help you with claims billing and enrollment issues 24 hours a day seven days a week thank you sharon also joining us today is rebecca gowdy rebecca serves as the director of the

including where to find local counselors and the electronic contact us form that can be submitted again counselors are located statewide at different county aging providers or senior centers and at our aging and disability resource centers remember to never provide your medicare number over the phone to unsolicited callers this information should be provided to trusted sources that you contact review your medicare summary notice or explanation of benefits looking for services products or equipment you did not receive double charges or items your doctor did not order contact your local senior medicare patrol if you believe you have experienced health care fraud errors or abuse some examples of medicare scams that are commonly used include back knee leg or arm braces this is where you may receive a call from someone saying they are from medicare or your doctor's office and need to update your information they may ask if you have pain in a specific location of your body and offer you a brace at no cost remember medicare will never call you this is a scam another related scam is related to your medicare card where you may get a call offering you a plastic medicare card or a medicare card with a chip embedded in it remember again medicare will never call you they'll never call to offer you a replacement medicare card your medicare card is a heavy card stock card that comes in the mail if you do need a replacement medicare card you can contact us and we'll help you get a replacement card another common scam is related to genetic testing medicare covers very limited genetic testing and must be medically necessary or ordered by your doctor random testing and cancer screenings are not covered by medicare do not give your medicare number social security number out to unsolicited callers be cautious of unsolicited requests for your medicare social security numbers if your personal information is compromised it may be used in other fraud schemes do not consent to any lab tests at senior centers health fairs or in your home be suspicious of anyone claiming that genetic tests and cancer screenings are at no cost to you monitor your medicare summary notice to see if there's any services that you didn't receive or didn't want but were billed for medicare summary notices are sent every three months if you get any services or medical supplies during that three-month period thank you rebecca for that overview rebecca wears multiple hats representing ship and the senior medicare patrol and for that reason there are two constituent questions for her the first question comes from joyce of grant county good evening my name is joyce i'm from grant county and i have a question i get phone calls 20 30 times a day about medicare services and insurance and changes in um everything how do i know if it is a scam or if it's legit thank you joyce the key point you want to remember is that medicare is not going to call you regarding coverage options benefit changes or replacement medicare cards calls like these are typically scams trying to get your medicare information but the call could also be from an insurance sales company always be skeptical of anyone calling you who identifies as being from medicare never provide your medicare information to untrusted or unknown sources if you are not sure if the call is legitimate please know it's okay to hang up and call 1-800 medicare or west virginia ship smp for assistance related to medicare coverage options and services senator manchin receives daily calls like this one if you're watching for a friend or a family member please make sure to pass this on our next question comes from linda of berkeley county my name is linda i live in berkeley county a loved one contacted her advantage plan to confirm that her doctors and prescription would be covered the reps said she would be covered on her existing plan at her first appointment she was told that the medical center that she used is no longer accepting her plan what could have been done differently to prevent this from happening thank you linda network changes with medicare advantage plans can occur throughout the plan year the plan can add or remove providers and providers can also choose to leave a plan's network when scheduling or confirming an appointment always check to see if your plan is accepted by your provider if your provider is no longer in the network you may need to choose a new provider in the network to get covered services if your plan is a preferred provider organization or ppo you will have some out of network coverage when reviewing plans during open enrollment always talk with your doctors to see if there are any anticipated network changes thank you rebecca our last speaker today is jeremy smith program director and outreach coordinator for first choice services thanks angie my name is jeremy smith i'm the program director for the west virginia navigator program uh here in west virginia and we've talked a lot about medicare so far today but for folks that may not quite be ready to go on to medicare or maybe they have a family member or a friend that isn't medicare eligible yet and you may have questions about other health insurance options we wanted to address that here today as well so i work at a non-profit organization here in west virginia called first choice services and so we operate a number of social service helplines for the public so you may have heard about some of our programs we operate help for wv which is west virginia's addiction and mental health helpline we help answer two one one calls with the united ways we answer the 1 800 gambler program for folks dealing with a gambling problem we do the west virginia tobacco quit line and then also the suicide prevention lifeline in west virginia which was also recently added a three-digit code to call you can just call 988 for that program so we receive a lot of calls uh from west virginia residents so a long time ago back in 2015 we realized that if people don't have health coverage often they can't get some of the help that they need so we was able to apply and receive federal funding to create the west virginia navigator program just to help people find and sign up for health insurance plans here in west virginia so these are the plans if you can't get health insurance through a job there are options out there for you and uh you know a lot of people are eligible and they don't even realize it so our mission is to help figure out what people can qualify for and then help them get signed up for a health insurance plan so some of those insurance options available if you can't go on to medicare yet we have the west virginia expanded medicaid program we have the chip program for kids and then we have the plans on what's called the health insurance marketplace and these are the plans on healthcare.gov and so we have a variety of plans to pick from on the marketplace and the way it works is that the majority of people a little over nine in ten people that get their health insurance on the marketplace in west virginia can qualify for what's called the advanced premium tax credit and what that means is uh the majority of everybody can qualify for a monthly subsidy that helps you pay for whichever health insurance plan that you pick out and so the amount of subsidy that you can qualify for is based on your family size and your income and then there's an application on healthcare.gov that you fill out in order to get that subsidy and apply it to the health insurance plan that you want to sign up for so what we do at west virginia navigator is we help you fill out that application to get the advanced premium tax credit and then we also look at all the different plans with you and help you figure out what might be best for you and your family so there's a lot of different options and you know it sometimes is hard to figure out what might be best so we look at all the deductibles with you the co-pays we make sure your doctors are in network and we make sure your medicines are going to be covered so that you and your family can make an informed decision uh to sign up for the plan that that you uh might think is best for you and your family so um we've talked a little bit so far about medicare open enrollment there's also an open enrollment period for the health insurance on the marketplace and it's a little bit different than the medicare open enrollment dates so open enrollment for the healthcare.gov marketplace is november 1st to january 15th and just as we've discussed with medicare this is when you can sign up for the first time or if you want to change plans that's your opportunity to change plans for the upcoming 2023 plan year so it's really important to pay attention to those dates and if you need health coverage for the first time make sure that you sign up during that open enrollment period the other option that people may have is for this time of year you can look to see if you can qualify for a special enrollment period and that's if you have a life qualifying event that will allow you to sign up outside of open enrollment and there's a number of reasons that you can get a special enrollment period if you've lost coverage if your income is a certain amount if you've recently moved or added a family member so there's a lot of different reasons to ch check in and see if you can get that special enrollment period so that you can get coverage for you and your family so it's really important uh we've talked a little bit about fraud so far with some of the medicare uh plans that are out there it's also important to check and make sure that you're signing up for a legitimate marketplace plan the official website is always going to be healthcare.gov it has to have that dot gov in there so when you're searching online just be really careful where you shop for your health insurance and also just remember if somebody's calling you you should always kind of question what kind of plan that they might be talking to you on the phone about so that's another option if you ever have questions about what you might be trying to sign up for you can always reach out to our free program and talk to a navigator whether you want to get help signing up or if you just have questions and so we are able to offer assistance over the phone or we have remote offices around the state and people can come in and meet with us or you know you can always reach us on the phone and we can do the enrollment that way so we have offices in charleston huntington fairmont and martinsburg and then we also travel the state a lot so if you're in a very remote area uh we'll even make a special trip to try to get to maybe a library in your community to meet with you or we will even offer a telehealth option so that we can enroll you right over a hipaa compliant telehealth enrollment so really the best thing i want people to come away with is if you ever have questions about how to get health insurance please remember you can reach out to the navigator program and the plans on healthcare.gov as i mentioned the majority of everybody can qualify for that advanced premium tax credit that makes the price affordable for folks and over the past year we've even seen the majority of people be able to get plans for under fifty dollars a month and a very large majority also can get a plan for even under ten dollars a month so it's a really good option for folks if you can't get insurance through a job uh definitely check into healthcare.gov and and reach out to us if you have any questions at all or if you just uh need that extra help to select a plan and get all signed up so if you need more information about how to contact us you can go to wvnavigator.com or call us locally senator 304-356-5834 receives an uptick in marketplace calls during tax season from constituents who did not receive their 1095-a or the information reported is incorrect could you provide some direction for folks that may find themselves in this situation yeah that's a really great great question and it's a really important topic so anybody that gets their health insurance on the health insurance marketplace through healthcare.gov and receives the advanced premium tax credit has to file a tax return even if you normally wouldn't wouldn't file taxes and so anybody that gets to the marketplace health insurance should receive what's called a 1095-a tax form that they have to use when they file their taxes for that year and so it's really important that you do receive that document and that is correct so if for some reason you haven't received the document or it maybe there's an error on it that is one thing that our navigator program can assist with you can definitely reach out to us and we will help you contact the federal marketplace to get a replacement sent to you or there's an option to log into your healthcare.gov online account and print the document directly from from your own account so if anybody ever needs that assistance they can call us and we will help you through getting a new form or contacting the marketplace to fix the errors on it before we leave our office would like to share some of the work senator manchin is doing involving medicare and health care policy for those of you who watch the ssa webinar you will remember another member of the senator staff jordan brossey in addition to social security jordan is also the legislative correspondent for issues involving the centers for medicare and medicaid services thank you angie medicare provides quality affordable health care services that west virginia seniors across the state depend on protecting vital programs like medicare is one of the senator's top priorities to ensure that medicare remains strong for the years to come senator manchin supports common-sense steps to bring down the cost of prescription drug prices and ensure the program stays solvent without affecting benefits for seniors several of those common sense steps were included in the inflation reduction act of 2022 which passed the senate with the senator support and was signed into law the inflation reduction act lowers the cost of prescription drugs and health care costs and ensures that seniors have access to the quality affordable health care services they need more specifically the inflation reduction act empowers medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs for seniors starting with 10 of the highest costing drugs in 2023 and expanding to 20 each year by 2029 the inflation reduction act will also cap medicare beneficiaries out of pocket costs to two thousand dollars per year starting in 2023 it will also ensure that seniors in the medicare program spend no more than 35 dollars per month on insulin and can access free vaccinations senator manchin will continue to work with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take common sense steps to protect the benefits seniors rely on and ensure that the medicare program remains strong for the years to come senator managing will continue to prioritize our seniors in west virginia and others across the country as a nation we have made solemn promises to our seniors and we must keep them thank you jordan and i'd like to thank all of our panelists and constituents again for taking the time to meet with us today now i'll turn it back over to senator manchin thank you to everyone for joining us today i hope you will join me next time for the next

family that attack near Bagram was the deadliest involving NATO troops in afghanistan since 2012 let's bring in congressman brad Sherman he's a Democrat from California he's a leading member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee congressman thanks very much for joining us it looks like the situation in Afghanistan despite the billions that the u.s. is poured in there despite the enormous military involvement is falling apart right now how concerned are you I don't think it's falling apart I mean obviously we've got to focus on Helmand province Pandu's was contested we were able to take that back but we're in maybe the 20th year in our struggle against jihadist violence and one would suspect that that's going to last decades more into the future Afghanistan is just one of the many battles you think those 10,000 u.s. troops part of a 13,000 member NATO contingent in Afghanistan should stay there I think so yeah but I think we've got to be looking at everything from Paris to San Bernardino from Nigeria you think US taxpayers spending billions of dollars in Afghanistan that's money well spent if we ignore the Middle East the Middle East will still not ignore us we have been dragged into this civil war of for waste of a war for the future of Islam and we even in those areas where we haven't been involved Isis al Qaeda have found that by attacking us they can build their credibility in the Middle East but the Afghan military you would think they have hundreds of thousands of troops armed trained financed by the United States largely after 14 years you'd think they'd be able to control their own country but they can't Karzai was not a good leader there's a lot of corruption in that force there are units that are relatively free from that corruption but we will see a seesaw battle in various provinces it I guess is on the merge on the on the on the move right now in Afghanistan in addition to elsewhere throughout South Asia Middle East North Africa as we all know the the Afghan military obviously not necessarily up to the job but the US Afghan President Ashraf Ghani right now he's traveling what to Azerbaijan in the mid the helmet province potentially falling to the Taliban what's up with that I don't know why he's going to tell you have confidence in us Ralph Connie slightly more than I had in his predecessor but not much moderate amount and we're going to have allies in this conflict that are going to be helpful and others that are not you look at the Nigerian government it's a little better than its predecessor you look at Somalia things are a little better but this is this has lasted two decades already I want to bring a major general spider james spider marks our CNN military analyst these retired US Army Kim Dozier our global affairs analyst as well you know this situation over there spider it looks like it's another situation where Iraq the US spends an enormous amount of money trains a lot hundreds of thousands of military personnel and when the going gets rough they disappear yeah the sad fact is is that unless there is some glue that holds these forces together over the course of time it will dissipate in terms of a fighting force and we've seen that quite a bit we realize that in order for us to be successful to achieve our national security interests this what's all about how do we get out of the very close fight here that potentially is in the United States and take it elsewhere that is intergenerational this is what we call the new normal this is the constant state of conflict that this nation has now accepted as a result of conditions that we see around the globe our engagement overseas is a must in order for us to preclude what is an inevitability where this will be closer on our shores it's going to happen unless we engage will receive Kimberly you've spent a lot of time in Afghanistan including in Helmand province at obviously in Kabul as well what's your analysis of what's going on well I would say to be fair about the Afghan security forces they have taken some of their heaviest casualties yet over the past year but they have a real problem with logistics your correspondent over there mentioned corruption the afghan special forces are actually seen as one of the most effective fighting forces but because of problems within their ministry of defense they can't get some of the supplies they need and they're at the front of the battle so you have these differing things that are hobbling those security forces they used to have American forces to prop them up in many of these situations now they're in a situation down in Helmand where they've always had problems getting supplies to those particular bases on the Afghan side and now they're facing fierce fighting and not much backup that's a problem that spells just a continuing back and forth which is why the UN is saying at this point in Afghanistan the Taliban hold more territory than the last time I held this much of territory was 2001 when they were in control is before the US came in after nine eleven into Afghanistan it looks like a horrendous situation in Iraq it looks pretty awful right now there's a military offensive by Iraqi forces congressman you're trying to retake Ramadi right now the US wants the health but this government there in Baghdad the government of haider al-abadi because of his alliance with Iran because of the Shiite militias they don't want US military involvement other than a few airstrikes coming in to back them up what does that say about the u.s. role over these years if the Iraqis don't even want the United States to get involved and help them on the ground well the Shiite alliance based in Iran is perhaps more evil and more dangerous than even Isis they've killed a lot more civilians they have killed far more Americans both in Afghanistan and Iraq and even our Marines and Lebanon several decades ago and as much as we need to focus on getting rid of Isis we also need to focus on getting rid of Assad he because as long as he's there there's going to be in Isis as long as Malachy and his the remnants of his regime and Isis are oppressing the Sunnis if it's not this Isis it'll be another Isis you have confidence in this new Rocky Prime Minister relatively new haider al-abadi who seems much more interested in having an alliance with Iran than he does with the United States he's slightly better than his predecessor but what we've done is is turn the government in Baghdad is now kind of a satellite of Terran the one advantage of the current approach is that we've minimized American casualties anybody who promises immediate and painless victory is not going to give us a median victory and they are going to dramatically increase our casual general you know you can minimize American casualties very dramatically by simply pulling out all those US forces from Iraq and from Afghanistan for that matter as well then there won't be any US military casualty well they're very true congressman I would have to college that as a strategy to minimize you as casualties is not a strategy what we need to be able to do is try to work as effectively as we can with the host nation so that we can achieve our goals and I'm in complete agreement in terms of Baghdad's relationship with Tehran it's sinful and it's incredibly painful to us moving forward if we don't have a balance in terms of what we can try to achieve relative to what Baghdad's trying to cheat that's what diplomacy is all about and an element of diplomacy certainly is the military it's a derivative of what we're trying to achieve zero casualties because even if we had zero casualties in the Middle East we see San Bernardino and so we have to be involved and as long as we're involved at the present level in Iraq and Afghanistan we may have the present level of casualties this year we've lost only 21 even with this terrible incident in Afghanistan we used to lose 21 in a single incident before and even out of those 21 half have been accidents and half of them caused by by the opponents and the enemy but let me Kimberly you have confidence in the Iraqi military right now that they're going to actually take Ramadi and then move on to other even more important targets like Mosul the second largest city in Iraq which is now for almost two years but under control of Isis they have proved an increasingly effective they're not moving as fast as anyone in the United States would like to see them move but this has been a been fighting to take back ramadi one thing that bad debt has been responsive on is they haven't used Shiite militia in the retaking of this mostly Sunni city so it won't be as fast as we want it but it is moving in the right action Isis will probably see they've only got about a hundred fighters they think inside Ramadi they'll probably do one of their strategic retreats and they actually intercepted a piece of paper that Isis have been handing out to its fighters telling them to commit atrocities as they exit places while dress Iraqi security forces I i can't independently verify that that's really what Isis is handing out but it may spell that they are changing their battle to an insurgency instead of trying to hold territory that means the Iraqis have gotten more effective are used as frustrated as a lot of people are here in Washington congressman that the Obama administration continues to refuse to provide weapons directly to the Kurdish Peshmerga arguably the US best friends in this fight against Isis right now insisting it's got to go through the central shiite-led government in Baghdad is that okay with you it's not many of us on the Foreign Affairs Committee have been pushing to get the Peshmerga the u.s. arms they need we're all so frustrated by the rules of engagement we have mamang rates but we trying to have zero civilian casualties if we did that in world war two we would have lost world war two I was sitting there with the French ambassador telling me that we had 70,000 Frenchman who they're due to Allied bombing but when the Allies arrived at Normandy they were welcomed with open arms right now the Iraqi government is providing free electricity to Isis if we had the rules of World War two we would be bombing the electrical facilities that provide a electricity to the ISIS governed areas it like in Mosul you mean exactly it's free electricity that I didn't know that yep and so what is the USA to the Iraqi government about that we say we who the government position is that we applaud your efforts to make sure that civilians are not inconvenienced you have to inconvenience civilians governed by the enemy brad Sherman the congressman from California thanks for coming in kimberly and spider thanks to you guys as well donald

speaker i rise today to remind congress that small business and consumers all over the country are feeling the repercussions of president biden's spending spree it's very simple president biden's so-called rescue plan has directly caused a crisis we're seeing on the farm and on main street injecting 1.9 trillion dollars of government spending into the economy without a clear plan for execution has increased cost and disrupted the supply chain all government spending must be faithful somehow and americans are paying for it with inflation since defense since february of 2020 the amount of money in the economy has grown by over 26 percent so it's come as no surprise that americans are experiencing the highest price increases since the great recession consumer prices for used cars and trucks have risen by more than 24 percent and costs have increased 11.2 percent for furniture 9.6 for household appliances 6 for utilities and 5.6 for clothing president biden promised to raise taxes only on wealthy americans but these price increases happening under his direction are attacks on every american inflation of justice wages are down nearly 2 percent since president biden took office and with the democrats plan to continue their reckless tax and spend habits american families can expect the cost of living to keep going up as if rising costs weren't enough this administration's so-called rescue plan has created a labor shortage that is weakening our supply chain and leaving manufacturers and business owners high and dry early this month i hosted a manufacturing tour across my district in kansas where i visited small businesses that produce and sell products like highway signs car accessories and industrial valves these businesses are the driving forces in their communities but the leaders who run them all painted the same bleak picture vendor costs are rising labor is hard to come by and a weakened supply chain is slowing everything down the grasshopper company in mound ridge kansas builds and sells mowers and landscaping tools the same ones used by the white house groundskeepers grasshoppers facing longer lead times on vendor items than they've ever seen and the prices on raw materials like steel seem to be rising daily to meet their customer demand on time grasshopper had to pay an extra 28 000 air freight fee back in july grasshoppers disrupted supply chain and increased costs of doing business forced them to raise the price of their goods mid-season something they've not had to do since the carter administration another manufacturing company in my district told me that the supply chain backlog has made it impossible to plan for their future their suppliers are telling them that essential inputs like electronics components will now take at least five to six months before they even ship before this year they never had to wait longer than four weeks sadly these are just two examples from kansas big first district small businesses all over the country are being forced to raise their cost through supply chain issues inflation impacting their own inputs labor shortages or all of the above to get inflation under control strengthen the supply chain and stop consumer costs from rising even further we need to get americans back to work stop the vaccine mandate quit recklessly sprinting money and end the spending addiction here in washington

more than 4 000 illegal immigrants crossing into the united states and the rio grande valley sector over the memorial day weekend those are the numbers of people that we actually saw remember there are always got a ways in that mix republican senator roger marshall of the great state of kansas is also a doctor recently visited the border where he encountered an illegal immigrant who was overcome by the extreme heat i'll call ems he's not making much sense either he's really the idea for the final puppet the lord the lord okay that woman actually was found in a very dangerous area of texas where smugglers often drop off illegals after traveling thousands of miles through other dangerous conditions senator marshall is in focus now thank you for being here to tell us about your trip first of all i was reading and you went with sheriffs uh and and people from texas who were in law enforcement tell me what the mission was and what you saw right here well good morning to you and your listeners i took five sheriffs from kansas with me because kansas is now a border state uh we have people dying most every day now from fentanyl poisoning in my state most every state in the union is having people die from fentanyl poisoning what we saw was a humanitarian crisis i i've done physician humanitarian work across the world i've been to poland recently this is one of the worst humanitarian crisis i've ever seen certainly the worst in this hemisphere people putting their lives in jeopardy in so many ways people crossing the river people drowning they already traveled a thousand miles and then they're being human trafficked and that's what i wanted my sheriffs to see is what what does it look like to have a car human trafficking people and real life want to emphasize here the real heroes are the sheriff's officers the board of patrol officers the public safety officers national guard officers they're the real heroes defending this nation you know it's interesting to get your perspective um not only as a leader on capitol hill and the senate but also as a physician because what you're talking about is the policies in place now as as we enter some of the hottest months of the year down at the border i know i'm i'm from arizona certain times of the year it's 120 plus degrees down there that it's on our responsibility in watch and on our souls when people suffer like this because of those policies what would you say to president biden please come down and see for yourself see the inhumane crisis that you created your policies are creating this you're harming the very people you think you're trying to help the young lady that we attended to and not had any water for two days she had probably walked about 60 miles through the brush of texas after having already traversed thousands of miles across mexico she was dehydrated she was close to dying from exhaustion uh heat exhaustion if you will so it was a very tragic situation he could turn off the magnet his policies could stop this when he said he was going to end title 42 what all these people heard from the cartel was amnesty come on on this week and you'll get amnesia from joe biden he has to turn off the magnet he's creating this crisis let's talk about covet 19 right now there is discussion today among top officials in the biden administration that will would they look at reinstating masking us on tran public transportation title 42 is something that democrats still want to do away with uh and and what will that look like permanently if that happens because there's a discussion maybe we bring it back at certain points i don't even know how it would work but from a doctor's perspective what are we faced with at covid at the border are people being tested so harris this is the state of confusion that our president is operating under evidently there's no coveted at the borders but there's coveton in airplanes and america knows this you know as a physician i think that most of us have immunity already i bet 90 95 americans have some level of immunity of course there's people coming across the border with coven the ones that are being apprehended are being tested and or vaccinated um but many but it's maybe a two for one that gets across the border that's not apprehended and what i'm more concerned about is probably tuberculosis and mumps and measles i'm more concerned about the human trafficking i'm much more concerned about the fentanyl poisoning maybe 200 americans dying every day from fentanyl poisoning as a physician that's what i'm worried about well and ironically title 42 helps deal with all of that because technically we're still in a pandemic so if you're keeping people south of the border i'll let you explain it how does that work right so president trump instituted title 42 that we could basically take all the people up applying uh to come into this country and say no you have to stay in mexico because of this infectious disease and and now what's going on is the president has said we need to end title 42 and what we're worried about and it's happening you described in your opening remarks the number of people that probably uh went up 50 60 percent since monday when when the president told them title 42 would end so the the cartel doesn't care about what the courts have decided the people that have come in lining up on the border for weeks now waiting for this title 42 to end of setting up this is going to be the california gold rush they're coming across they know they're going to get free health care free food they're going to get a phone they're going to get a plane ticket to anywhere in the country they ask for and you've proven i mean we're americans when we see suffering we do want to lean in and you did we got to fix this senator thank you and thank you for watching the focus out numbered next

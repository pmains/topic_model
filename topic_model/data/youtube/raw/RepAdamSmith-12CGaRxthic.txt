when Adam Smith of Washington so you heard that report and you're well aware that Doug Jones has been certified today is the senator elect from Alabama he's going to be sworn in on January 3rd to the Senate does this win indicate to you a chance or maybe just a hope that there's going to be a blue wave next year clearly I think that combined with the results we saw in the Virginia and New Jersey off-year election show that Democrats are motivated to get out and vote and also I think when winning an election like this adds to that motivation because it proves to people that they can be successful and whatever one may may think of president Trump certainly after the election there was a great deal of despair amongst Democrats and progressives and that despair has not been mitigated by the president's actions since he was elected but I think that despair very quickly turned into action and what winning an election like the one that Doug Jones won in Alabama does is it just adds fuel you know it's like my son play soccer I'm sorry but when you score a goal it motivates you you know you can win and it tends to be a real momentum factor and I think that's the case here in addition to the fact that President Trump is the most unpopular president during the first year in office that we've had since we've been doing polls he simply has not been able to get above 40 percent a lot of it is policies a lot of it is the way he talks about people and the things that he does but it gives us an opportunity and when Democrats have to do is we have to present an agenda particularly an economic agenda that shows the American well that we have a better way well let me ask you about that because if the economy continues to do better and this tax plan which obviously is very unpopular right now but could gain in popularity and the president's numbers when it comes to the economy could be in a better place as we get closer to the midterm election couldn't that temper some of this enthusiasm for Democratic candidates that you've seen in these off year elections well I don't think it would tempering the enthusiasm amongst Democrats it would make it a little bit more difficult certainly but look in the first year most economists will tell you that any economic impact is is come from prior policies and the tax cut was just passed a week ago other than that the president has implemented no major legislative policies in 2017 so whatever economic numbers that we see are reflective of policies that came before that came under the Obama administration and the one thing missing from all of this has been sort of the the middle class and the working poor seeing a significant benefit in their wages and a tax cut that goes primarily to corporations in the wealthy isn't going to change that that's why this tax cut is the most unpopular tax cut that I can remember in history ever passed the people look at and say this is going to people who don't need it this is going to people who already have money and aren't spending it aren't investing it so I think this gives us an opportunity in addition to the unpopularity and a success that we've had in the election of 2017 you know we have a tax cut which is their season not just their signature issue their only issue and it's very unpopular all right congressman Adam Smith thank you so much for joining

Thank You mr. corns Ian thank you very much for getting back to me in regards for lands scheduled for disposal on the BLM I look forward to the next month to seeing that up on the website mr. corn Z I'm strongly opposed to the practice used by this administration which utilizes the antiquities Act to unilaterally designate national monuments and to lack up millions of acres of land BLM or otherwise from resource development I find it especially egregious when the administration plays fast and loose with this Authority at the behest of the extremal streamis tin vironment allah stand special interests that knew not have Americans people's best interest in as their motives mr. corn Z Arizona already has 18 national monuments more than any other state is the administration currently working on designating a new National Monument in Arizona on BLM lands so I'm gonna have to refer refer you to the White House the antiquities Act is a presidential power and you know any decisions that relate to that are are under there well I understand but have they reached out and talked to you about any types of parcels particularly in western Arizona no conversation whatsoever with the White House at all I'm gonna direct you to CEQ in the White House for for information on what they're working on to what they're not working on so the White House hasn't reached out to you one iota in regards to any lands located in Arizona I would say we we receive requests and interest from a lot of people from all types of stakeholders on these issues no but this is a specific ask I mean you you you are you are under oath and I'm asking you did the White House or the administration talk with you or anybody underneath the the BLM in regards to any withdrawal potentials and utilizing the antiquities in Arizona I've heard discussion related to multiple possibilities multiple possibilities can you elaborate on those possible multiple possibilities I'm talking about you know looking at the country and figuring out where would this be appropriate where would it not so there is there is some conversation going on between the White House and BLM in agencies and regards to antiquities withdrawal yes that's kind of miss you miss miss love me I mean you know at the very very beginning of that conversation you said you'll have to talk to the White House so there is some coordination going on is there a member of Congress that actually is involved in those conversations well remember you're under oath I mean it depends on what we're talking about so is there a member of Congress from Arizona involved in those discussions with BLM in the White House is there a member of Congress involves I mean not that I'm aware of but I'm gonna refer you to the White House for more information on what they're working on my office currently has a FOIA request at the Department of Interior regarding and the proposals and the coordination between land agencies and environmental groups well that request collaborate the information that you shared here today I don't know what I don't know the request you're referring to so the request we sent was by multiple members of Congress was submitted on 12 3 2015 and we've read and received nothing of substance to date absolutely shameful so much for being most transparent administration in history any idea when your administration will respond to that request I'm not familiar with that request so I couldn't tell you well make sure that it's reissued and we look for it expedited conversation in July of last year the house representatives passed an amendment to block pending national monuments throughout the country where they're a significant local opposition do you support pursuing the designation of a monument that blatantly ignores the will of local governments and overrides every clear opposition from local communities who will make me negatively a targeted by such action so it's been a consistent position of this administration to make sure that any use of the antiquities Act has done through community conversation that it's responding to to local interests so we're you really would have a scheduled public hearing in regards to those withdrawals there have been public hearings before other designations so no I'm gonna be more specific about air ona when if those conversations occurred would you enlighten me which well I mean you you made the comment today that there has been some conversations between the White House in your office in regards to potential liquidity of some lands so when are we expecting to have these conversations with the public out in Arizona I presume if a decision is made to pursue with interest that sort of concept that there would be a public process and so you would tell me that that that's actually going to happen prior to not afterwards that has been the practice of this administration to make sure that there is a public process can you provide for the record those that have applied prior to for the record so that we can actually have all the record of that I sure can I would appreciate a madam chair I thank you very very much for the questions

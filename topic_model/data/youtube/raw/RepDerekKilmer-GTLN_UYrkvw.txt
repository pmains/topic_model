Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to speak on the devastating loss of unemployment benefits for 1.3 million Americans already and 1.9 million more at risk of losing benefits if congress fails to act soon I've heard from constituents across my region who will be impacted by this including a veteran who's been unemployed for eight months losing benefits will make it harder for him to complete the training program that he's enrolled in with the hopes of finding a new job while our economy has made progress since the depths of recession we still have too many people around this country struggling to find work Congress needs to get focused on job creation but withdrawing support to unemployed people as they seek work is no way to boost this economy in fact the Council of Economic Advisers estimates that failing to extend unemployment benefits will cost my state Washington State nearly 60 200 jobs that's worth repeating doing nothing will cost us jobs for the sake of middle-class families who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own for the sake of economic recovery we need to extend the emergency unemployment compensation program immediately Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

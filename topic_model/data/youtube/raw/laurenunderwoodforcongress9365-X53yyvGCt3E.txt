[Music] in 2018 we organized and we rose up to chart a new course for our future now that we're here we've fought to improve our health care and pass life-saving legislation to lower the cost of insulin there's nothing more inspiring than a community coming into its power some say let's go back to the way it was and it would be easier for them if we let that happen but the truth is the way things were didn't work there's still so much to do for the health and safety of our families and our loved ones during these challenging and uncertain times [Music] if easy was what we were looking for we wouldn't have come this far in the first place thank you so much let's fight for our values and bring change to our community to build the illinois we always dreamed of i'm lauren underwood and i approve this message

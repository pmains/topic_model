like to yield 90 seconds to my fellow floridian from uh the central florida area representative franklin thank you gentlelady i appreciate you recognizing me for a couple moments here uh fellow friend from just up i-75 in central florida i rise today on behalf of every american taxpayer who is infuriated by the wasteful spending of our government for many months now republicans like me have been taking to the floor to sound the alarm on the biden administration's ridiculous and wasteful spending as hard working americans are struggling with the highest inflation in over 30 years president biden wants to continue doling out taxpayer money by the billions to things like tree equity and studies to determine the effect of climate change on lactating individuals we've all been taught there's no such thing as a free lunch and when your government is spending money it doesn't have like it's going out of style you better hold on to your wallet the washington times recently reported more than 40 percent of the 700 billion in covet unemployment benefits with defraudsters including many connected to state sponsors in china and russia for context the relief money loss to fraud could have provided a hundred and sixty thousand dollars to every american family living under the poverty line or paid for an ivy league education for every 18 year old in the country instead this money now sits in the coffers of our enemies who will surely use it against us it's bad enough that irresponsible democrat policies have created inflation that is hurting american families but the lack of oversight of hundreds of billions of dollars means that we are funding our enemies this kind of fraud waste and abuse should be thoroughly investigated by congress unfortunately republicans in the minority for now we don't have the authority to determine which investigations will be held so i hope my democrat colleagues share my concern and outrage what they do with this information will tell us all we need to know about how they feel about squandering hard-earned taxpayer dollars the american people deserve answers and a solution that ensures fraud like this can never happen again thank you gentlelady i yield back thank you to my friend and colleague from the sunshine state incredibly important points about the economy we're seeing over and over example after example of of the failures of this administration and how it's impacting working class families

all over the country people are deciding to ride trains again they try and looking for ways to get other cars trucks and vans and riding the train reduces our dependence on foreign oil it reduces emissions of bad stuff into the air reduces the threat of global warming reduces congestion on our highways and a lot of people are taking that up we saw record growth in amtrak ridership the year of fiscal year just ended yesterday record growth and Amtrak revenues or more than most cities and states the amtrak depends on passenger rail Amtrak is the 11th busiest train station in America there over 500 train stations to one of the very top but train stations and we take full advantage of the 90 some trains that go through our city through our state every every single day we also have a lot of people who live in amtrak who work for Amtrak who repair the car's repair the engines provide on onboard service Amtrak is part of our economic lifeblood it will provide continue to provide jobs good-paying jobs for people who fix the trains repair the trains work on the trains and will provide excellent opportunities for transportation for people up and down the Northeast Corridor to there is terrible to a train accident out in California a month or so ago 25 people died commuter train ran into a freight train the commuter train ran a red light and there was a kind of safety systems that are required in this legislation starting in 2015 that's not going to happen again we'll have the safety procedures in place currently people who can work on the trains can can work as much as like 400 hours per month that's a huge number of hours we drop that by almost a full third to it to provide a more reasonable level so people have a chance to get some crew rest over half the people in our country now live within 50 miles of one of our coasts as a result there are a number of densely populated quarters up and down the East Coast the Gulf Coast and the west coast for a lot of people live and are looking for opportunities to get out of their cars trucks and vans and and find another way to get to work or to shop or to visit their loved ones we it's not enough for us just to try to improve train service in northeast quarter that's important though but there are other densely populated quarters where if States had a little bit of incentive a little bit of federal money to go with their state money and their money contributions from freight railroads we could dramatically improve passenger rail service and a number of densely populated quarters up and down the East code the Gulf Coast and the west coast again for our stay we have a whole lot of people who ride the train the 11th busiest train station in America is Wilmington we have probably more people on a per capita basis who work for Amtrak fixing what locomotives fixing rail cars serving an onboard purse personnel so as a large stake in what's going on here as if I'll remember the House of Representatives as a governor as a former Amtrak a board member and for seven or eight years now in the United States Senate I file almost every day to try to provide excellent train service not just in the northeast quarter not just for Delaware we're in all kinds of places around the country where there are these densely populated quarters where there are high weeds that are crowded with a lot of congestion where we have too many airplanes in the air where Amtrak can be part of the solution and it's important for our country it's important for us in della this is important for our country Amtrak was created in the early 1970s almost from its beginning Amtrak has been starved for capital investment to improve trackbed improve overhead wiring system improved signalling systems improve the actual trains themselves starved for capital this legislation represents a significant shift in funding less for daily operating costs and much more capital investments and capital and lessons from which were asking states to join us local governments to join us and also the freight railroads around this country

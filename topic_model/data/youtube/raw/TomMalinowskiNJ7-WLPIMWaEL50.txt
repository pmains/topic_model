welcome everyone to our social security round table this is one we've been looking forward to for a long time um before we get started i want to remind folks that if you've got a question for the congressman or for john bauzman aka bowser please put it into the chat box and we're going to try to get to as many questions as we can so um it is my honor to introduce john bowser bowman he's the president of social security works pack you probably know him as bowser from the hit tv series and rock group shanana and the movie grease he's also hosted hundreds of tv shows including the last three my music do-op specials on pbs but since 2004 john has participated in hundreds of political campaigns crisscrossing the country to endorse candidates who will fight for a better quality of life for older americans an expert on senior issues john did endorsement events in 57 campaigns in 2018 literally traveling from alaska to south florida and northern maine to southern california he actually joined us in clark during the lead up to the 2018 election john is a surrogate for the biden presidential campaign and recently put together the florida democratic party organizing council a vital tool in a crucial swing state through the dnc and the fdp john lives in california's beautiful santa ines valley with his wife of 49 years mary recently retired clinical director at the help group one of america's biggest edu agencies for educating young people on the autism spectrum they have two children nora 40 and eli 37 and three wonderful granddaughters and without further ado john bowman thank you lisa and on the night of november 3rd 2020 congressman tom malinowski has got to be doing this can you believe that i have been making a living now for over 50 years doing this god bless america and yes many of you out of this call probably know that i love the music of the 50s and the early 60s however that does not mean that i actually want to return to the 50s and the early 60s because that was a time before medicare and in the time before medicare over 35 percent of american seniors had incomes below the poverty line and i certainly do not want to return to a time before social security was passed in 1935 when just think about this more than one out of every two over 50 of american seniors had incomes below the poverty line the simple effect is that social security and medicare are the two most successful domestic programs in the entire history of the united states of america and you know what we need to keep them that way in fact we need to expand them so that is why for instance in 2018 i went on this journey from alaska to south florida and northern maine to southern california in search of candidates for specifically the house of representatives which we needed to flip it otherwise we probably wouldn't even have a country by now i went on to search for candidates who would be good on these issues and i certainly found one there in new jersey seven and in fact i have something rather personal to say that i can only say in a very few endorsement events that i do um i had a very very short list among these 57 campaigns in my brain and that short list was called okay you just need to be in congress there were not many people on this list of who i really among the candidates that i met um katie porter in california 45. uh alyssa slotkin in michigan eight uh antonio delgado in upstate new york and really at the top of that list to be really honest it was katie porter and your congressman your current congressman when i met tom malinowski i just immediately you know said to myself okay you just need to be in congress this is very simple because his incredible background his dignity his intelligence just everything about tom malinowski felt like we need to send you to washington please to represent the seventh district of new jersey and blissfully the district came through and he is there and you know everybody likes to be right about things um and i'm no different from anybody else so just to you know confirm being right in the first place i have here the alliance for retired americans uh scorecard on senior issues which grades every member of congress house and senate on how they vote on issues that are important to seniors and it should surprise nobody it certainly doesn't surprise me that the score of one tom malinowski in new jersey's seventh district is 100 perfectly right on every issue no surprise at all and do be aware that social security especially is under the biggest threat that it's ever been under right now we do have to do something by 2035 all things being unchanged we would have to do something by 2035 to keep social security intact um very easy to do there's a bill that the congressman i think has probably signed on to called uh social security 2100 it's a very moderate uh social security bill by john larson the sponsor is chair of the social security committee of ways and means that would keep the program intact until 2100 by adjusting the cap which is unfair um we'll take questions about that later um you know or by uh and you know making simple adjustments to the program but all of a sudden we're in a whole different world because somebody in washington dc about three weeks ago said he intends to terminate social security's dedicated funding if he wins a second term and i'm sure you know who i'm talking about this is a a threat um that there's never been a threat of this kind to social security and you know what it could possibly happen uh that it's not inconceivable because this payroll tax or fica deferral that's on the table right now um yeah the president of the united states actually could probably defer there would be legal challenges but they would take a long time and who knows when they would be heard and it's also possible that they could lose there might be a way to defer defer defer until social security actually ran out of money and that means the 2.9 trillion dollars that are in the social security trust funds right now would disappear and ps the year that that would happen if there were no incoming funds for social security's dedicated revenue would be 2023 two years from now disability insurance also severely threatened by this crazy idea would run out in 2021 so make no mistake about it there is danger in the air here to the most cherished most coveted programs the programs that have brought that have literally brought the poverty rate among seniors down from 50 to the current 8.7 percent well before the pandemic at least 8.7 which is among seniors which is roughly the same as the poverty rate among the general population so we must protect social security and medicare we must in fact expand them so that the cost of living increases are better and make more sense i'm sure those of you who are on the programs know there hasn't been a real colab for a while um you know we must make sure that medicaid stays in place we must fight to lower drug prices the single biggest scourge of all before this new threat to social security where you know for some reason congress can't negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices and we must always of course refer to social security and medicare as earned benefits and never use the pejorative term entitlements those are the five questions on our questionnaire the congressman well the candidate malinowski um answered beautifully in 2018 and i am pleased today of course to endorse congressman tom malinowski for a second term and an infinite number of terms as many as he would like beyond that uh but i also want to share with you a little bit about the personal reason why i'm here today and this one actually actually uh has more resonance for tom than it has for some people um okay you know i love the classical music of rock and roll but i actually didn't start out in rock and roll i actually started out in real classical music i started out playing music that sounded like this [Music] and yes i started playing piano i'll beat bowser now for a second i started playing piano when i was seven years old i attended the juilliard school of music in the city of new york not that far from views beginning at age 12. so if you're a little kid and you're learning how to play classical music especially in new york city where do you want to grow up one day to perform that's right congressman tom malinowski's campaign all right maybe it was carnegie hall so the year was 1973 carnegie hall in desperate financial trouble has turned to rock and roll and who should be invited to perform at the fabled the legendary carnegie hall but my old group shanana so there we are on stage at carnegie hall and in the third row of the audience was the only person standing in the entire audience of carnegie lowe mine butter bessie bauman the woman who forced me to practice and she stood proudly in cardi hall while her son sang rama lama ding-dong and she waved she shouted jonathan because that's my real name that only she ever called me jonathan you made it because it turned out that to your mother whether it was chopin's minute waltz or rama ding dong carnegie hall was carnegie hall and that is a 100 every single syllable of a true story and then when the show was over she went out to the merchandising table and she started signing autographs bowser's mother so in her honor because she did force me to practice and for that i thank her still today i'm gonna play for you my mother's favorite melody it's the chopin a tune in e major [Music] so [Music] so [Music] do ah because that's the personal reason why i'm here today my mom was a public school librarian at ps45 in brooklyn new york like a lot of women of her generation she went back to school late in life got a master's degree had a wonderful career but when she retired it was her social security and her medicare those two programs and remember medicare was new at this time but those two programs allowed her to live a life of dignity and independence that was unknown to my grandparents and that's the personal reason why i'm here today and why i'm supporting congressman malinowski who i also know has a personal connection to these particular pieces of music because he is was born in poland as by the way were my ancestors and the composer of those pieces frederick chopin had a french father a polish mother and was in fact polish came from came from that beautiful country uh something i found out since i saw you last time about this was that this melody the second one the a-tube my mother's favorite melody was actually chopin's favorite melody it's his favorite piece that he ever wrote so um my heart is really with you today in new jersey you have an extraordinary congressman and i hope that you will you will work your hearts out between now and november 3rd to get everybody in the seventh district too as bowser would say vote for tom malinowski of november 3rd he's got to be doing this i want to see you practice that congressman no you don't have to do it literally it's terrifying oh man oh my goodness thank you so much john it's my pleasure it's always wonderful to see you and thank you for what you're doing for me and for all of my colleagues um i'm i'm very humbled by your kind comments about me but you know that politics in congress is a team sport and what you're doing here is keeping our team on the field at a moment when the house is really the only check we have against bad policy and abuse of power and hopefully for a better time starting next january when the house will be able to partner with responsible people in the white house and in the senate to try to fix things like the long-term health of social security and our health care system and all of the other things that need doing in this in this country and you know if you want to know what we would do in that moment look at what we have done in the house in the last two years all the legislation some of which has been enacted most of which is sitting on the desk of mitch mcconnell we've been very very clear about what our agenda is and what we would do including on fixing social security so thank you so much because you can't do it if we don't get elected um so um on the issue of social security there's no there's nothing i can say that can make the case better than than you just did there's another piece of music from from your era um which uh happens to be i think my favorite joni mitchell song and the famous line is don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you got till it's gone and if you apply that to social security which is one of the great things we take for granted in this country the most successful policies the most uh wonderful thing that government does we take for granted because we're just used to having it that poverty rate among seniors for example i think it's now under 9 it would shoot up to over 40 if we didn't have social security it would be a catastrophe um this program works and it works because it's a promise that we keep generation after generation i don't know how many times i was told when i was much younger um oh you know you'll be paying into social security and it won't be around when you retire you know that lie has been told generation after generation and here we are it's still around it's still the main source of income for overwhelmingly the main source of income for about a third of our of our seniors um and a major source of income for almost all of them um so we have to preserve it there's a long-term threat which you mentioned and there's also a short-term threat and i want to i want to talk a little bit about this payroll tax um deferment that the president has has foisted on us because i i want to make sure everyone understands how this works and what could happen next year if we're not very very vigilant so obviously we know what's happening in the country we have covet 19 we have an economic crisis we have tens of millions of americans who lost their jobs and everybody democrats republicans agreed we need to provide some relief some stimulus for the economy to get people through this the one thing that there was virtually no support for in the house and the senate among democrats and republicans was this idea that we should defer or suspend the payment of the payroll tax that funds social security and medicare and why was there no support for it i mean we argue about everything right but on this we weren't arguing because we needed to help people who had lost their jobs and if you are if you are paying the payroll tax and thus potentially benefiting for maybe a few months from this deferment then by definition you have a job you're paying the payroll tax you're on a payroll so you don't actually need this this wasn't helping anybody who needed help and because legally the president can only defer you can only postpone the payment of this payroll tax what it means is you may see a few extra dollars in your paycheck in september october or november december but starting next january you're going to be paying it all back the payroll tax will be twice what it would have been normally and so what has happened the president issued this executive order because he was obsessed with this idea and very few companies private companies are taking him up on this offer because like why should we not with withhold this payroll tax for four months and then have to chase our employees to get all this money back next year it makes no sense so most private companies aren't doing this but the president does have absolute power over one group of employees in our country and it's a very large group and that is federal employees and amongst federal employees there is one very important group and that is the men and women of our nation's military who have been told that they have no choice that they must accept quote-unquote this deferment of their payroll taxes for a few months and then they'll be hit with a double whammy and so amongst our military there's all this messaging now trying to help them understand this weird thing and what to do and and the advice they're getting from their advisors from their senior officers is well just save this money because you're probably going to have to pay it all back next year it's just crazy but and here is the important part where this becomes a threat to social security here's what i will expect will actually happen in january john you said the president may try to defer defer defer defer let's say he can't do that let's say the courts say you can't do that here's what they're going to do they're going to say to us in congress look if you don't make this permanent if you don't turn this if you don't take this from a deferment of paying the payroll tax and actually forgive the payment of this tax for for for this period or for longer then you're forcing the men and women of our military to pay twice what they would normally owe for months and that will be used to try to pressure us politically into making this permanent in which case it actually does have the effect that john suggested it might of defunding social security and medicare which some people apparently have no trouble doing because they're on a mission to break the us government not to fix it and that's why this election is so important for social security on top of all the other reasons why it's so important because we have a group of folks who are just trying to destroy this stuff we're trying to first destroy our confidence in it by telling us we'll never get it which is a lie and then they're trying to actually dismantle and privatize the system and they're going to use this mechanism that i just described so there is a lot at stake and our choice will make all the difference in november not just our choice for president that's important but our choice for who should represent us in the house of representatives because we have two teams in front of us that will govern in very very different ways when it comes to issues like this we have two teams that will govern in very different ways in terms of checking abuse of power and bad policies from the white house and our district is blessed um i'm you know i have to work really hard for this reason but we collectively are blessed in the seventh district because we are one of those districts that has a real election a real choice that's going to be close it could go either way which means more than most people across this country we are going to help to decide who controls the house of representatives and our agenda for the next two years so thank you so so much again john for um sharing your insights for playing your music thanks to everybody for uh being part of the call and i i'd be uh eager to hear your thoughts your your comments and your questions to us great thank you both so much so we're going to start our first question is from catherine ranga she has a question about keeping social security solvent and keeping medicare going hey catherine do you press the unmute button on your on your zoom okay yes um oh yeah that was very good that that explanation because i really did not realize that the payroll tax would adversely affect social security but even though that doesn't go through say we still have a problem about keeping it solvent my understanding if that still is on the horizon and does the uh congress have any plans to help that that doesn't or stop that it becomes unsolvent yeah uh we we do and john mentioned it briefly john do you want to go into a little more detail about what you guys are proposing there are several good bills that are ready on the floor as as the congressman knows um one of them that's really just common sense very moderate kind of bill is the john larson bill it's called social security and we keep the program intact until the year 2100 and probably beyond okay and uh you know it's only one of the proposals but it does happen to have 210 co-sponsors as we speak so it's probably the one that's the furthest ahead of any of the other of any of the proposals it not only keeps the program solvent but expands it this is not hard to do it it does things like changing the cola to what's called cpie there are three levels of cola the one we have now which is inadequate the one that the republican party keeps trying to push towards which is called chain cpi which is actually just a cut for you and cpie which takes into account that social security that that cost of living for seniors goes up quicker than it does for anybody else um not slower so there are plenty of good proposals in the wind and congressman malinowski should go further on you know and congressman do you have the support of any is it going to be a bipartisan support for this most of those co-sponsors are democrats right now okay um and you know i mean you have to pay for it right there's there's no way around that and and the way we pay for it in that bill i think is sensible that's what most of the experts recommend it's it it's adjusting the cap um you know right now as you know uh the the cap is a little under 140 000 so we don't pay the payroll tax on income above that um and as a result we're actually americans are paying a lower share of their income on average um to support social security and medicare than we ever have what the bill does is actually it keeps the cap where it is but then it subjects income over 400 000. uh to the payroll tax so in a way there would be like a doughnut hole you stop paying um a certain point but then above 400 you start paying again um and it turns out that that would be um that that would get you uh a secure transfer trust fund through um 2100. okay thank you simply put with regard to that because it's worth going into the average person you know 137.7 times right as always 137 is where the cap is right now and um that means that you pay 6.2 percent and into fica by the way payroll tax is even a misnomer the second fica is insurance social security is an insurance program and that's the fundamental identity of the program you're paying basically premiums so that the money will be there when you're hearing yeah right so anyway bottom line is it's at 137.7 so so anyone making 137.7 or less is paying 6.2 percent of their income if you're i don't know for argument's sake one of the koch brothers or somebody who made you know 50 million dollars last year let's say you stop paying in at 137.7 so you're not six point two percent you're paying point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent how is that fair is the question americans that also helps explain why people whose campaign campaigns are bankrolled by the koch brothers might not necessarily think this is the greatest idea yes it does thank you catherine for that question um we're gonna move on to michael anthony he has a question about treasury obligations and interest rates oh oh hi tom i just uh wondered with all this playing around it's mike watson down here in ts9 um but my good friend um because what we're worried about what this will all do to interest rates right now interest rates are low so treasury is paying a low amount of interest but if you start messing with the obligations that are sitting in the trust fund and causing a shortfall in the trust fund what will that do if people thought about that and now since i'm on just my tag on to that because having worked on wall street for 30 years my thing is just raise the cap to 500 000 and call it a day because the donut hole thing just like it was in prescription drugs is more of a pain in the butt but it's crazy when you work on wall street your social security is you stop paying it in march and it's you know it's it's silly that you realize that goes out and you're earning you know good money the rest of the year and most people i mean even down here in texas in tx9 the average income in this district is a hundred and nine thousand dollars i don't think people here would even notice the scintilla of additional fico coming out but they would notice it but also they have to take care of their parents that's where it comes in if all of a sudden you like you didn't have medicare if you had just all of a sudden pay your parents doctor bills um that's that's a different story so that's my that's my question and thought from tx9 who appreciates you for uh for doing those anti-racism resolutions thank you mike nice to see you how green is you well we can we want to see you back sometime yes yeah yeah look i don't think we've thought through all of that uh i i think look in a way you just you know the very simple point about um how again the consequences of allowing this thing to collapse right uh are that you're taking care of mom and dad and your grandparents healthcare which certainly you know people can't do it and so um and again we take it for granted so it's just hard to imagine like it's always been this way we've always had a system that takes care of that and you know it's also true that in political campaigns people have been saying for many years oh those people want to destroy social security right and and so when i say it now maybe some folks hear that as just the usual election year hyperbole um and you know you know me i don't you know me you know i don't do hyperbole that i trust you you're very understated and there's some things the democrats dream about that that i think you know it's going to be okay um but you know we really do have uh a proposal that is not just on the table but was put in place by executive order that um that creates this this threat um that you know we're going to be i i promise you whether president trump wins or loses come january there will be people who say if you support the troops you have to in effect defund a portion of social security and um you know i'm gonna defend social security right um and and and encourage uh members of the armed forces and other government employees heck i'm probably you know i probably count in this too i need to check but you know save the money you're going to get a few extra pennies it's not going to be a lot just you know save it because next year you're going to see twice that amount taken out of your paycheck because of this stupid idea that nobody but one man wanted to happen but it's going to be uncomfortable and it reflects a very real desire or at least recklessness with regard to defunding social security yeah we are worried about about his ability to potentially defer and defer and defer because the courts you can't rely on the courts and it may take too long and money may run out i want to make one statement um since mike's on here and brought up wall street you know a lot of people ask the question you know privatization has been on the table for a long time especially from the other side of the aisle and we keep fending privatization off but a lot of people ask the question why would anyone want to privatize social security um you know in in uh 2007-8 if you put your money on wall street your social security money it would be gone so it's dangerous right um the answer to that question that i always give because it's just common sense is and mike could probably back this up if anyone could figure out how to deliver the 2.9 trillion dollars in the social security trust funds to wall street the amount of money that would come back to that political entity would be actually unfathomable that would be the greatest gift to wall street that ever could be made um you know and money is going to be made on wall street either way you know whether if you invested and you win money is made if you invested and you lose money is made so it's a very difficult position in a way to put wall street in but that would be an awfully big gift um and it should never it must never roll them back to 2007 2008 and even if someone tried last week what happened last week you know almost a thousand points gone because of things and if if that was people's money that they depended on for their groceries on september 1st that would be a disaster either all right thanks mike thank you thanks for visiting us from texas um our next question is from pamela paxton she has a question about the medicare advantage plans and the privatization piece of that go ahead pamela um what i'm concerned about is i call it death by a thousand cuts or strategies it seems like there's a big change taking place in the private insurance industry when i first went on medicare all that i got were solicitations for medic gap plans but this since trump's been in office there has been a dramatic shift to pushing medicare advantage plans and that is private insurance and with that happening and the consolidation of medical practices who are also on board to push these plans they're offering new enrollees very low premiums and it seems to me that there's a long-term strategy in place here to ultimately up these premiums dramatically as time goes on and undermine regular medicare which has older people in it and no one is everyone in the democratic party is talking about how important it is and it is important to have met medicare for all or better a better system for people under 65 meanwhile it seems to me that there is this very stealth strat long-term strategy to destroy medicare in very subtle ways that are not yet apparent but are going to at some point down the road be very serious well very threatening and i'm not i don't know that much about it but i'm very suspicious that this dramatic change seems to be taking place john what do you think do you see that as creeping privatization i think pamela is on to something i think that uh someone who said in 2016 i'm a different kind of republican i'm not going to cut your social security and your medicare has not always been truthful and um you know in a second term this would really be something to worry about i would direct you to look at joe biden's plan for older americans on his website because you will find it to be actually excellent and with regard to medicare it mainly talks about lowering the age which by the way we at social security works agree with that as a strategy of the next thing to do with medicare since politic politically we're not getting to medicare for all you know anytime soon um but lowering the age would actually make you know most people who struggle with their health you know are trying to get to medicare to medicare age of 65. the program has two and a half percent overhead it's a beloved program it works really well um but you know things start to go wrong between kind of 55 and 65 you know 60 and up 60 to 65. that would be a really big and welcome change in that in in that year but you have to elect the right people to do it and what about i mean you know what about allowing i mean not just lowering the age but allowing healthier younger people to buy into the system well that's the ultimate you know there'll be some combination of the public option which is basically that the overall thing but we do believe that the single biggest effect would be to lower the age right away and bring in the people who are the most vulnerable but pavel is definitely on to something you know the death by a thousand cuts this is the thing that we always worry about with regard to both social security and medicare is is there is and again this john i think you froze socially sorry you had frozen you're good okay 66 percent would rather vote for so for a congressman who would protect and expand social security 64 protect and expand medicare 84 fight to lower drug prices you can't get to those numbers with just democrats those are a vast majority of independents and a substantial number of republicans that are contributing to those numbers so these are the issues that cross over the parties you know these are human issues these are not partisan issues thank you yeah pamela i think you're on to something um our next question is from cynthia she has a question about what do you say to people who don't believe all these numbers yeah um obviously i'm on social media like other people are but um i grew up in michigan and most of my family and friends in michigan are trump supporters and when somebody brings up social security they go oh nothing to worry about so what do you say to people like those they just don't believe data you want to take that one top yeah i mean i've gotten versions of this question now well ever since i've been doing this and if i had a brilliant answer that no one had thought of before i would tell you and maybe we would have solved this problem by now it is my number one worry about america because i think i don't think there's any threat to this country if we are arguing from the same facts you know remember remember the days when we all got our information from walter cronkite and whatever nightly news program you watched and and then we were still democrats republicans conservatives liberals we were still you know fighting with each other about what we should do about those facts but mostly people agreed on the facts and right now we don't get our news that way we get our news filtered through social media and who decides what information comes through to your social media into your relative social media it's not walter cronkite it's not a person it's an algorithm it's a it's a mathematical formula that knows everything about you and determines what you most want to hear what kinds of things will keep you engaged frozen to your screen so that you see more ads and buy more things and so we're all fed stuff that confirms our pre-existing opinions and that makes us angry at the other side because that's what keeps us glued and you know sometimes i would maybe start there and just like talk to relatives like look i'm biased and you're biased we're all biased and we're all being fed information on facebook that just makes us angry and afraid of each other all the time and let's step back and look at what's actually going on and then gently share a fact or two that is well sourced and hope that it starts a conversation and then occasionally something happens that will break through with some folks like that like the president insulting the military or a factory closing in your own town or people dying of covid when he's saying that it's a hoax people close to you and bit by bit you peel off that support um you know if it's people close to you it can be you know you care deeply about it because they're close to you from a bigger political point of view we don't have to convince everybody and i think most americans actually are still rational and reasonable and fact-based insane i mean look look at how most americans reacted to covet 19. we're in trouble because a minority doesn't believe it but you know not 52 not 58 like 80 85 percent of americans like believe public health should come first and believe that we should be driven by science and that you should wear masks that's not enough you know for public health you need 100 right but it certainly shows most americans don't buy all that nonsense about this being a hoax um so you know we we we have a good foundation to build on there um and if i'm re-elected one of the things that will be a crusade for me is trying to have a real conversation in this country about social media regulation to fight this effect that is creating the problem you're experiencing i'm i'm i was just talking to one of my staff members today we have a bill we're writing and i'm hoping if it's we can get to some consensus with some of my colleagues we at least introduce it um this year so we can start that conversation this cynthia i would also say you know maya angelou when somebody shows you who they are believe that right now um you know these programs are under a very serious threat um you know out in the open and if we didn't have this firewall that we have in the house of representatives we would really be have something to worry about in in another four years of this so in a way the most important thing of all is to make sure that you send tom malinowski back to congress and that we maintain this firewall in the house so that we could stop horrible legislation from coming down the pipe because i would say to those people if if one side of this we're in control we're in complete control um i would be very pessimistic about what was going to happen to to our beloved country and all these wonderful programs that have been built up over centuries of effort by well-intentioned people yes so tom count me in for working on that crusade um yes so we have another question from jennifer spiel she has a question about the so-called temporary payroll tax cut go ahead jennifer hi tom it's it's great to be here in this uh this meeting um i'm actually in north carolina now i moved about three weeks ago breaks my heart i will not be in new jersey to vote for you but i'm sitting here looking up who is my house of representative in north carolina it's david price and i'm i'm trying to look up and be a republican or a democrat do you know him yes i do he's a democrat yes yes well i understand north carolina is a swing state so i'm hoping to swing a blue so um well my question was and i think it was answered about my question was and my fear is trump's thing about this payroll tax and deferring and deferring and it seems to me that um it could easily fall into that which i think um you've answered the question um and by the way if john is right and he can continue to defer defer defer it makes it even more likely right that at the end of that period we will face unbearable pressure to give it because remember the longer you defer it right the more you will then have to take out of people's paychecks later on if you want to actually not you know defund social security and so the more painful it would it'll become right um and so the longer they can do that the more i think likely it is that they'll succeed in in this this trick of turning a deferment into a permanent defunding of social security right right exactly um and going back to and i can't remember your name uh pamela you're i think it was your question about or no i'm sorry since it was i can't remember the name of the person that was just talking about yes and you know i your response about how do you react to people you know when you get to the end of giving the facts of facts you just say you know i just have one phrase for you i told you so because that's that's all we can say to people who are um who just don't want to believe the facts so i told you so i i hate to say i told you so but i told you so so there you go anyhow that was my question and i think it was answered in all the other information so but great to see you in my kitchen when you enjoy my children are still in new jersey and they're voting for you tom so yes well thank you we miss you but we're glad that you can join us in this way yep yes and i will be doing a phone bank for you tomorrow night so oh thank you so much speaking out for you thank you thank you it's the silver lining of this whole experience is that we get to still see folks who have moved away um john did you have something that i'm just going to uh play my closing song because as you know i have an event on the presidential that i have to do in florida but you guys can of course continue and peppered bob with questions because he can answer every single one of them but this is their traditional closing song more like what you're used to hearing from bowser you can sing along at home good night sweetheart well it's time to go no no no good night sweetheart good vote for tom malinowski thank you john so much for being here i know you have to run this was great we're going to stay on and uh tom will answer some more questions thank you so much be well please support him love you alrighty see you soon i hope i hope so that was a treat um all right we have another question from marianne cowan she's a question about uh the new jersey's payroll tax and go ahead i'll let you ask it marianne okay hi um i just wanted to make a really quick statement about social security before i asked my question and um i'm collecting social security right now and if it goes i have nothing to live on so i just kind of want to throw that out there that i'm one of those people that i would be severely um affected by it so anyway on to my question um i'm not sure that i'm right on this but payroll tax i think also includes like new jersey state tax on employment insurance and state disability so if he's deferring payroll tax is he also deferring that and can he step on the state with that no so it doesn't he he only has the authority to defer federally mandated payments okay um so uh anything that the state withholds for you know similar insurance type programs uh would not be uh would not be affected and again legally he can only defer he cannot you know he cannot change the tax laws by executive order uh he can give you the tax holiday in an emergency but you still owe the tax at some point that's why we've been you know we've been projecting out a few months ahead like what's likely to happen you still owe legally that tax and in all likelihood if you know you're forced to accept this deferment for three or four months at all likelihood you will then pay double for three or four months to make up for it and that just is stupid not hugely harmful but just stupid it will become much more harmful if if he can succeed in deferring it for much much longer or if even in january they just you know politically put pressure on congress to um to to actually um forgive the payment of uh of that uh contribution to social security uh particularly for members of our military um you know who will be in a in a pickle right if you know uh if they have to pay more or you know imagine this is one reason why private companies aren't really uh taking him up on the offer because you know imagine you have an employee who leaves in november or december that person is no longer working for your company the company is still on the hook for um for paying uh the tax that they owe and the employee owes that was deferred in the fall so that you what do you do you could track that person down you somehow have to get the money from them um i mean that would apply to federal employees too actually come to think of it members of the military if you're discharged from the army in december having um not uh made these contributions for three months what what do you do um all completely unnecessary because these are not the people who need help right now in our economy the people who need help are the people who lost their jobs and they're not paying the payroll tax they need unemployment insurance they need loans for their small business employers so they can stay on the payroll not be fired this does not help thanks marianne good luck with everything um just want to point everyone to the chat box there is a if you want to help call voters there's a way to sign up right in the chat box if you see it you can click on it and um we are it's eight weeks from today folks we are counting down so ballots are going to be mailed in the next couple weeks so we are we're in go tv believe it or not um and this issue is just so important which is why we're so glad you're all here um congressman you have anything you want to say um well for wrapping up i just want to say thank you to everybody um i we we promised a slightly different and entertaining session um but i i hope you also found it really informative um john knows what he's talking about he's he is a um not just a wonderful communicator but an expert on on this issue and and i hope that this has inspired you to go out and talk to friends and and relatives and neighbors and co-workers about this part of what's at stake in uh in the election um we are a little over 50 days away from what is traditionally known as election day uh what i think we can also refer to as veterans day november 3rd is veterans day after what we've seen the last week or so but as lisa also suggested it's not a one day deal uh this year it is um you know people will be voting starting probably at the end of september in new jersey because the ballots will be will be coming out there are a lot of ways to vote and we'll need to educate ourselves and our neighbors and friends that you can mail that ballot back you can put it in a secure dropbox you can take it to the county clerk office you can even wait until election day and take your completed ballot to your polling station or you can fill out a ballot in the polling station all of these options are going to be there to make it as easy and a safe for for us to vote and that's a very very good um thing and by the same token we may not know the result of the election on november 3rd because even though new jersey is going to allow those mail-in ballots to start being counted 10 days before election day um they may not all be we haven't done this before and turnout is going to be huge i'm certain of that so we all have to be vigilant and patient encourage folks to do this as early as possible um but also let's have nerves of steel and be ready for uh an election night that may stretch out into several days and nights but with the confidence of knowing that the system is going to work and that ultimately what the american people want is what the american people are going to get and knowing that gives me confidence that we are going to put this country on the right track this november so thank you all for being part of this discussion thank you for being part of this election um hope you know you you stay involved or get involved um with our campaign other campaigns around the country nothing is more important than that right now thank you all

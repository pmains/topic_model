Muller has obtained a warrant for information on these Facebook accounts and earlier I spoke with Senator Mark Warner of Virginia the vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence I asked him what kinds of information his committee was seeking from Facebook well Chris is far back as last winter we raised concerns that the Russians were using social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to both advertise to create fake accounts to try to drive stories we've increasingly seen to try to drive people out to rallies and other events Facebook at first and this was fairly disappointing you know kind of blew off those notions and said that really wasn't happening we now know for a fact that it has been happening and what we want to make sure is that Facebook is fully transparent that they've done a thorough review looking backwards of what all happened how many accounts that were fake that were affected by Russia how much of the ads I mean what they've reported so far as one hundred and hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of ads those were only ads that were paid for in rubles so the fact is I think the Russian spy services know how to hide a little better than just using a little deeper I didn't I didn't I don't think that's quite really that's that's the number that that's the 150,000 which always struck me as a sort of small amount of money if you're gonna do this as an enterprise you're saying that's cordoned off because it was actually paid for in rubles that was just paid for in rubles and what we found so far is it Facebook didn't even take those same accounts and run them and see if they placed other ads maybe paying in dollars or Euros and other currencies so I don't think they've given us the whole story and let me get let me just give you another example to give the audience some way to put in perspective now I'll grant before the 2016 elections this was kind of wild wild west Facebook was learning we were all I think seeing this two of these tools being used for the first time in many ways by the time the French elections came in the spring work Facebook being more cooperative working with French authorities took down their words close to 50,000 accounts that were affiliated with Russia 50,000 in France much smaller country so far Facebook in the United States has only identified 470 accounts that may have been fake accounts that were promoting certain stories or promoting certain interest groups to me that again just doesn't pass the smell test maybe that's correct but if they did 50,000 in France and only did 470 in America when in America we've known they've parties they Russia attacked 21 states electoral systems I just think there's a lot more questions to be answered and that's why we're gonna have that public here and come in do you have more access to do you have access to more data than we have publicly with respect to Facebook I wish I wish I could tell you yes we do not know they're gonna come back in shortly was what they did so far was they they in effect showed us certain things to the staff and then took took those materials away which again raises questions in my mind you know that we may need legislative changes both in terms of tightening up the restrictions about foreign money flowing in to our elections but also you know I think as an American if somebody's putting a political ad for me or against me Americans ought to be able to go and look at that content that happens on TV that happens on the radio that happens on newspaper ads at this moment in time that does not happen in social media and in the internet world Senator Mark were thank you

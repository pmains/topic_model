shirring reminds us that when Assad was close to losing power and the ability to kill hundreds of thousands of people the government of Iran rushed in and that the proper image of the government in Teheran is not the dapper Foreign Minister Zarif but it is rather a lawn Kirti that boy on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey two or three years old a picture that brought home to the world the catastrophe which continues in Italy we've got millions of people displaced Enid Lib where we need to make sure that our humanitarian aid goes directly to them that it is not purloined by the Syrian government has turkey been cooperating in recent months to ensure that humanitarian assistance actually reaches it lib bravas Mistral Hardin will be in a better position to answer the specifics of turkey of turkeys provision of humanitarian aid the two cross border areas that remain open right now are along the Turkish Syrian border the challenge of course is the completely non-permissive environment of is lip so it is incredibly difficult to deliver aid across the borders given the fact that you have al Qaeda al Qaeda affiliates and an active hot war with Assad backed by Russia and Iran every single day not to mention the infrastructure and the civilian infrastructure of Italy being constantly bombarded and bombed by Russia are we send a n LS anyone on the panel are we sending any donations in cooperation or through the Syrian regime I assume not but I'm going to ask sir to the that internet that our international assistance is channeled through the United Nations there are elements of that assistance then that are worked through Damascus that much is clear very little of that assistance in fact none is making its way in a significant fashion to have impact in the situation in Italy so the UN is giving valuable assets to the war criminal in Damascus and we're contributing toward that my sense is the United Nations is laboring under extremely difficult circumstances in Damascus and that as part of the process for trying to deliver humanitarian assistance to areas under Hitler killed a lot of people but delivering food to Hitler wasn't a way to correct - to ameliorate the harm he was doing and we continue to contribute toward UN programs that send the assets to Assad we contain it and none of and and virtually none of that actually reach that reaches the people who live profits is there any good thing that happens with that you na sure I would say this because it's an extremely good question it's a very difficult to have circumstances there are many populations in areas under government control that require humanitarian assistance and some of that assistance from the United Nations is making it way to those populations the question IDing those populations swear loyalty to Assad or at least are not in opening descent with Assad correct since the signing of the ceasefire agreement on March 4th the do we expect turkeys troop levels to remain the same and what his likelihood of the turkey will be able to successfully maintain the agreed security corridor surrounding the m4 highway yes I do expect the turkeys military posture will remain they've established the the kinds of positions that indicate that they are in this for the foreseeable future I do expect that the Turks can deliver on their side of the agreement with Russia I do not expect that Russia we'll deliver on its side in part because Russia has demonstrated an inability and in some cases an unwillingness to compel Assad to abide by such agreements they yield back thank you Thank You mr. Sherman mr. lang myself five minutes mr. Lang can we take a step back for me

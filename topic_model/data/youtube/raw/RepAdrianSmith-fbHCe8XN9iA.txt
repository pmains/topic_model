Thank You mr. Speaker I rise to bring attention to the harsh weather and flooding experience throughout the state of Nebraska over the past few weeks on Wednesday March 13th a large storm known as a bomb cyclone hit our state of Nebraska and much of the Midwest it brought with it blizzard conditions high wind and large amounts of rain followed by highly destructive flooding which continues in some areas today as I spent the past week touring damage and recovery efforts one theme was clear Nebraskans don't scare from a challenge nor do they stand by as their friends and neighbors suffer entire communities have come together to fill sandbags open shelters and rescue neighbors in need ranchers across the state have battled to clear pastures reunify herds and reach newborn calves I appreciate President Trump moving quickly to approve a federal disaster declaration requested by governor Ricketts and supported by the entire Nebraska congressional delegation Governor Rick governor Ricketts has estimated the cost of rebuilding infrastructure destroyed by the storm at more than 400 million dollars and the Nebraska Farm Bureau estimates the toll from lost crop and livestock production could top even 1 billion dollars the recovery will not be easy but the hard work and dedication of Nebraskans across the state will be on full display as we recover rebuild and renew what was lost in these tragic events thank you Mr Speaker I yield back

I remember Ronald Reagan's famous line what are the worst words in the English language I'm from the government and I'm here to help you those are not the worst words in the English language among the worst words in the English language are we're in a crisis and the government doesn't have a plan to help us get out of it doesn't have a plan to protect our families and the people we love doesn't have a plan to rebuild our economy the idea somehow that we're all going to be better off with a government that doesn't invest in science and in long-term planning I think has has surely been shown not only to be wrong but to be dangerous I think that what the election in 2020 is going to be about in part is about people who want a government that is competent and that is on their side in planning for an uncertain future

Clyburn he's the assistant Democratic leader in the house welcome sir did you happen to hear any of that I think I heard out of it and watch it as well no question of those people sorry your thoughts oh well you know I hope they're successful in getting this administration to focuses its attention on the african-american community I would like to say however I think that people make a tremendous mistake when they look at the inner city and say that is they have an American problem the fact of the matter is the majority of African Americans in this country still live in the south basically in rural communities many of which I represent here in the Congress I always maintained that the reason we have these crises in our cities is because we have never had a successful rural development program going in the country we have people in rural communities it will remain in those communities if we carried opportunities to them that's what infrastructure is all about I've been listening to the president talked about infrastructure big giant infrastructure program well the infrastructure program for me more than roads and bridges is about what is about sewage is about broadband connection is by saying to those kids at scotts Ranch High School where a ground person Board of Education all started even today they are less than forty percent adoption rate in those homes when it comes to broadband so if we are really serious about developing african-american community closing the education gap closing the income gap then we have got the care if program into these rural communities of in fighting for them since I've been here if you look in the Recovery Act you will see that I've inserted little formula in that act called 10 20 30 it was put into four parts of the egg feel that we have it yes sir let me ask you this because Donald Trump acentos all of these african-american people so that they could celebrate african-american history month mr. Trump build this as a lifting session did he reach out to you at all to attend this meeting oh no I don't see any African Americans there who are in government i'm strong williams i know very well who was there he is from my congressional district his family look at the people well I guess what I'm getting at is most of the people at in this listing session were supporters of Donald Trump's during the campaign surely you're like widen the circle what could it seems to me that to be successful that within the administration as in everything else in politics to learn how to add and multiply this whole thing of deflecting and dividing and so much even at apartment last night to the united Supreme Court that is an apartment that will divide America like I have never seen it divided before you may think this campaign was the visit but you just see what happens as this veteran takes place and I was hope well what's in the present were either very very i will say that republicans are looking at the democratic party at the moment in calling them obstructionists especially in light of what just happened just about a half hour ago i'm going to try to explain it to my viewers it's very difficult but essentially the democrats were boycotting these these committee hearings on these Trump nominees right so the Republicans suspended the rules and completely cut the Democrats out because they weren't cooperating at all and now all of these nominees go to the full Senate for these confirmation hearings without the Democrats taking part what do you think about that well we did that look I think you know what's going on here rushing these things through not Alliance were full getting to take place put these names up this before the paperwork has ever turned in I think that we have a right to vet these nominees we should know what in their records they all taken their signals from a president that we just elected who refuse to show his income taxes we learn a lot about people when we look at the income taxes we learn a lot of our people will need fill out the right paperwork and turning in so ask them to participate in an unfair bias system the Democrats is decided they would not be a party to that and follows this is not being evicted this is being an attention to the fact that they're rushing these things through not giving up the paperwork and then these new questions arise you don't want them to answer the questions well congressman senator orrin hatch is not happy about this he's called dumb Democrats idiots I heard the night I hate to see orrin do that I know since it had very well we worked very closely together he has helped me tremendously with my Gullah Geechee heritage corridor and other programs but I think he got a bit miffed but I think he's cool down a little bit today no he just moments ago called Democrats shameful he has not pulled down he seemed to be angry angrier than ever well he may be but I would hope he was just recognized that a lot of what the second place today camp on the Republican playbook Republicans it had the same thing going on with Obama in the first year of his administration we have seen them so wait a minute is that the Democrats goal to to you know notice our goal to remind the publicans is what's good for the goose is good for the gander that is all this is lotus process down bring the paperwork in when these questions arise sweet journal is writing about stuff that it was falsified it in the testimony so if someone hears what looked like false testimony break them back to the committee and let's answer questions about what this is all about where it is could I in a refuge is for a moment sir nasrallah jayam this is judge Corphish who mr. Trump nominated for a position on the US Supreme Court he's going to meet with the vice president of the United States Mike Pence and then I assume he will make his way and talk to lawmakers I know that you mentioned horror fiction and you're not a big fan but would you be interested in listening to what he has to say I always want to listen to what everyone has this is not about whether or not we listened this is my work now to get a chance to ask questions and get some answers we'll never get a chance to highlight what has taken place in this person's record and if extreme veteran is good for Refugees I think extreme veteran is good for nominees to the United States Supreme Court so I think he should be subjected to some extremes better than to see what he meant about some of these positions that he has written about you know I love people with good smooth personalities every great writing skills but I want to know the subject matter that they write about what are not that subject matter it's something that i can buy into and would love to see passed on to my children and my grandchildren but just because the right smoothly doesn't mean you're writing good all right congressman james Clyburn thank you

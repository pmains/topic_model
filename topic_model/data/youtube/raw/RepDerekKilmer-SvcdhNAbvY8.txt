five minutes Thank You mr. Chairman I rise to express my concern about the need for fully supporting native american housing programs I recognize that my colleagues faced a number of difficult choices when crafting this bill and I specifically want to thank the Chairman and ranking member for their work and fully funding the President's request for Native American housing block grants at 650 million dollars and I'm pleased to stand here today along such strong advocates for Indian housing programs I am grateful for the leadership that each of the speaker's today is shown I do share my colleagues concerns over adequate funding for our Native Hawaiian housing needs and I'm hopeful that this as this legislation moves forward Congress can work to address this need as well as resolve some serious issues with other parts of the bill now as the members of this committee well know the challenges facing adequate housing for Indian country are profound the district that I represent is home to nine tribes I have seen firsthand what a difference these housing programs make to individual families and to their communities and the statistics bear out just how substantial the need is here in 2012 the Department of Housing and Urban Development found that more than twenty-five percent of Indian housing units lack basic facilities are overcrowded or costs more than fifty percent of the residents income there is a need today for 200,000 more housing units in Indian country that's why I'm hoping that this body will soon all the hearing on the reauthorization of the native american housing and self-determination actor in the hosta i know i know that there's been bipartisan work both in the house and thus in the senate on identifying ways to increase the effectiveness of these programs and to reduce duplicative bureaucratic requirements but there's another element of nas de that i think is absolutely important not only to Indian country but also to those who've worn the uniform and service to our country and that's homelessness among our tribal veterans in December 2012 the u.s. interagency Council on homelessness found that while Native Americans make up point seven percent of the total population of veterans they represent two and a half percent of veterans experiencing homelessness in other words homelessness disproportionately affects our tribal veterans unfortunately as I stand here today we don't have the tools we need to help fight homelessness among our tribal veterans the HUD Veterans Affairs supportive housing program which has made real and significant progress in tackling veterans homelessness does not have the authorities and flexibilities to provide support to native veterans facing homelessness that's why I was pleased to join representative Cole a true champion for Indian country in introducing HR 3418 the housing made of heroes Act our legislation doesn't cost any new money but would instead authorize existing funds to support a demonstration project that would allow tribes to manage this voucher program directly in both the House and the Senate the proposed reauthorization bills advanced this proposal making critical progress in the fight to reduce homelessness among tribal veterans we have an obligation a trust obligation to our tribes but also a sacred obligation to all of our veterans to take care of them when they return home we simply cannot turn a blind eye to the needs of our native veterans if this chamber can make progress advancing the hostile reauthorization I am confident that we can end this anomaly that leaves our tribal veterans without the support they need I'd like to conclude by noting that the underlying bill before us today provides 70 million dollars for the HUD Vash program in line with the president's budget request I thank the Chairman and the ranking member for their continued support for this program and I asked that as this committee continues its work combating homelessness among our veterans that the challenges facing our tribal veterans are not forgotten Thank You mr. chairman and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman

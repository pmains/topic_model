South Carolina they are being labeled code 
red States and are expected to experience   serious effects from the historically low Reserve 
Supply joining us now is house natural resources   committee ranking member and member of the 
transportation and infrastructure committee   Congressman Bruce Westerman Congressman 
great to see you tonight thank you so   much for joining us on this very important 
issue um Business Insider reporting that   the Biden Administration considering hindering 
military aid to Saudi Arabia in response to that   oil production cut this would be retaliation 
Biden said there were going to be consequences   but we're in a pretty bad spot right now as a 
result of our domestic policy here at home as   a result of tapping the spr under the 50 level 
and continuing to you know dig oil out of it   um do you think that this is a wise move right 
now to start with Saudi Arabia on this way   oh good afternoon Jackie so good to be with you no 
I don't think it's a good idea uh we're you know   we're sleeping in the bed that Joe Biden and the 
Democrats made for us and it shouldn't be this way   uh we're seeing uh the FED raise interest rates 
trying to address the oversupply money into the   economy but what the administration and nobody's 
doing is addressing the supply side problems that   we have the reason that we're we're short on 
diesel fuel I remember where it's the lowest   amount we've had since the 1950s is because of the 
all-out attack on domestic energy from Joe Biden   and the Democrats so this is what we should expect 
with these policies but fortunately Republicans   have ideas on how to fix this I hope the American 
people give us the majority next week so that we   can put our policies into place and give this 
Administration the choice to make do you want to   do what's right for America do you want to develop 
our domestic resources or do you want to continue   to push bad policies like punishing Saudi Arabia 
on the military side right for something that's an   economic issue this is the wrong way to go right 
we wouldn't have to retaliate if we had enough   production here at home we wouldn't have a problem 
but Congressman um you know you understand and I   understand as well that nobody's going to solve 
the inflation problem either until we get the   energy situation straightened out because diesel 
is used to transport everything so as long as   the price of diesel fuel stays High producers of 
products are not going to be able to reduce their   prices and they're going to pass those extra costs 
on to you me and the average consumer out there   absolutely diesel is very important in 
transportation it's also very important in   agriculture and construction so if we say diesel 
process go up and shortages with diesel it affects   the whole economy but it's more than just diesel 
fuel it's natural gas it's all the fuels that we   use to make the electricity it's been an all-out 
attack on domestic energy production and we're   seeing increases to heat our homes to drive our 
cars but where it's really hurting the most I'm   afraid is at the supermarket because these 
energy crosses get they permeate all through   the food supply chain with natural gas being the 
key ingredient to nitrogen fertilizer which is   basically the the basic input to agriculture so 
these attacks on domestic energy have hurt people   that are on low income and fixed income most with 
increased food process and real quick uh last week   top Bank CEOs went to Saudi Arabia to speak at 
a forum there talking about energy issues and   and one of the points that they made was that you 
know essentially this Administration has to figure   out some sort of common ground and they voiced 
that rather openly I was surprised but in the   New York Post Charlie gasparino writes about 
how CEOs are trying to fix Biden's Saudi oil   mess because he won't and it's so interesting 
to me you know everybody seems to get it but   the president and I I have to stand back and 
think maybe he does get it he just doesn't care   it makes you wonder it's not that hard to see 
where the problems are and it's a shame that   our CEOs are having to go to Saudi Arabia why 
can't we produce the energy here we're blessed   with domestic energy we can be creating jobs in 
the United States keeping wealth here at home   instead of exporting it to foreign countries 
and depending on their policies uh on our to   supply our energy it's asinine that we're 
going down the route that we're going but   it can change and I'm ready to get to work 
on it on the natural resources committee   Congressman Bruce Westerman thank you so much 
we'll talk to you soon thank you all right

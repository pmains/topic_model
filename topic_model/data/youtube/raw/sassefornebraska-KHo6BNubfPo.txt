hi I'm Ben Sasse and I'm running for US Senate here in Nebraska I want to talk to you about a story I read this week that encapsulates why the American people are so fed up with our federal government according to the report members of Congress both Democrats and Republicans have been working frantically behind the scenes to exempt themselves and their staffs from some of the most punishing costly aspects of Obamacare and in a rare display of bipartisanship the White House agreed to essentially rewrite the Obamacare law so that taxpayers are still on the hook for paying insurance premiums for members of Congress and their staff one congressman actually complained that he might not be able to afford to pay his Obamacare premiums because he is stuck making only a hundred and seventy two thousand dollars a year could these people be any more out of touch now let's set aside for a second the fact that the executive branch just rewriting laws that have already been passed is totally unconstitutional instead let's talk now simply about the rank hypocrisy of all of this the American people firmly opposed Obamacare before it was passed it was rammed through anyway via a dishonest legislative gimmick and now that it's on the verge of being implemented the very people who forced Obamacare on the rest of us demand to be exempted from the most punishing aspects of it when it applies to them this is crazy not everyone in Washington however is playing this game there is a Republican amendment in the Senate to eliminate the insiders exemption and this is smart because one of the best tools we conservatives have to repeal Obamacare is forcing our elected officials who voted for this thing into the horrible system themselves well as you might imagine folks in DC don't like this one bit and I don't just mean Democrats either I'm talking about some establishment Republicans as well according to the report multiple Republican offices have reached out to Democrats begging them to either stop the amendment from getting a vote or to make sure that it fails if it gets a vote this is outrageous the millionaires in the Senate should not be getting a taxpayer-funded subsidy to pay for their health care they don't need or deserve an extra premium support plan that's just for insiders it is time for every Republican in Washington starting with minority ly Mitch McConnell to show some actual leadership on this issue by voluntarily giving up their healthcare subsidy if DC politicians are going to force this country to accept President Obama's experiment with socialism they have to live under it with the rest of us there is not one set of rules for Washington elites and another set for the rest of us the masses perhaps a history lesson is in order here under our founders brilliant system Americans are not peasants our elected officials in DC are not Kings what is good for we the people should be good enough for Congress the arrogance of this episode is a perfect example of what is so messed up about our capital it's the same mentality that leads bureaucrats to think that they can manage our healthcare system in a 2,300 page bill I'm not sure what's more offensive about this that they think they can plan our lives for us or that they actually believe they don't have to live under the same laws the rest of us do I've actually read the Obamacare bill I've worked in the health care sector for years and I know just how bad this bill is that's why I criss crossed america in 2009 and 10 explaining the bill to companies and warning them what it would do to their businesses and to their employees families what's so sad about this health care debate is that the solutions here are actually relatively simple we need to defund Obamacare repeal it and start over we should help States strengthen their high-risk pools to care for the five million sickest of our fellow Americans then we need to create a level playing field so that farmers and small businesses get the same tax treatment that big companies and unions get and we need to be sure that the insurance products families need leave them protected against catastrophic loss if they happen to get sick or in an accident even when they're changing jobs but this doesn't need to be done in a way that puts bureaucrats between patients and doctors problem solved no massive takeover by the government no bureaucratic nightmares just common sense conservatism and actual faith in American ideals this is why I'm in this race just look at our government we have Democrats who believe they can plan our lives better than we can and then on the other hand there are so few Republicans who seem to be interested in and able to articulate an actual conservative governing vision for America I believe our nation stands at a crossroads where we either roll over and allow the tide of government to expand replacing freedom with dependency or we stop it right here right now and we preserve this nation as the last best hope on earth our parents and grandparents gave us I have a lot of hope for this country our conservative ideas are right and when we stick to these principles we win families in America win if you agree with me I hope you'll share this on Facebook and Twitter and forward it to your family and friends but most of all I'd sure appreciate your support I'm Ben Sasse and I approve this message and I'll talk to you soon

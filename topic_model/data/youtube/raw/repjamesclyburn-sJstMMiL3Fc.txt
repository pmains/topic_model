from Democratic congressman james Clyburn of south carolina is the third ranking democrat the House of Representatives congressman thanks so much for joining us and what do you think I just want to get your immediate reaction to these CEOs these other business leaders bolting from these two councils because of the the president's statements or lack of statements well thank you so much for having me wolf I think what these CEOs are doing or demonstrating what this country is all about I congratulate them on stepping aside from this arrayed Ken Frazier just a great friend and I thank him so much for leading the charge on this what we see now is a tremendous credibility gap a morality gap that is developed in this country and the business community is stepping up to do its part to fill that gap now it's time for the last H Congress to step in someone said earlier on your show that he the president cannot fire the Congress that is correct and the Congress need to demonstrate that we are in fact a co-equal branch of government and I think it's time for the Speaker of the House the leader the other house the Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and for both Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell to bring together their leadership teams and let's begin to put together and approach to governance that will bring people together that will pass legislation that will move this country forward and pass it in a bipartisan way give 145 House members on the Republican side 145 Democrats and let's get the two or 90 votes that are necessary to have a veto-proof piece of legislation pass it send it to the to the president if he doesn't sign it let's override the veto and let's go forward same thing in the Senate 35 senators on the other side will pass legislation we've got to bring this country together and I think that when you have a moral crisis in the White House that's what we've got is time for us in the Congress as a co-equal branch to step into the gap and bring this country together we can do it we did it back in 2008 we did bipartisan legislation to bring this country back from the brink of economic disaster we're now approaching the brink of the what I would call them morality this.s or moral disaster in this country I think the Congress can serve that same purpose here today and so I'm calling upon the leadership of the House in the Senate in a bipartisan way let's do what's necessary to demonstrate who is what we are and less move this country forward in a bipartisan and in a multiracial way well let me ask you congressman because you've been a leader in the civil rights movement in our country for a long time going way way back it give us a little sense a little sense of history right now when you saw those marchers with torches screaming out racist anti-semitic slurs and you heard them say Jews will not replace us Jews will not replace as then they screamed up you will not replace us you will not replace us referring to African Americans when they uttered the slogan blood and soil blood and soil a clear statement that we heard Nazis speak out in the 30s in Germany what was your reaction as someone who has worked so hard in this area of civil rights all of these years well you know I've been saying to people for a long time my members and Congressional Black Caucus the colleagues will tell you I've been saying to them that we are approaching the place to where we've been before I was around in the 60s as you said and I remember some of the sloganeering and I remember what some of the political leaders had to say that was a different day in a different time we remember from our studies what happened in 1930s in Germany I told a business group down at Hilton Head several weeks before the election that what I saw coming was a replay what happened in Nazi Germany the fact of the matter is Hitler was elected as Chancellor of Germany he did not become a dictator until later when people began to be influenced by his foolishness we just elected a president and he's got a lot of foolishness going on and I'm afraid that too many people are being influenced by that foolishness and so what we've got to do now is step up and say we are not going to allow any one person to misuse an election and to abuse the process and and turn this country back on this head we are going to move forward I think the Congress need to sit in a stepping and do what's necessary to move us forward we've got to raise this debt ceiling so the Full Faith and Credit of the United States it will not be called into question let's do it in a bipartisan way I don't care what not it's a clean bill or deal with other stuff hanging on it so long as it's bipartisan let's do what is necessary to reform our tax code do that in a bipartisan way do the same thing for fixing the Affordable Care Act their problems with the Affordable Care Act we all know it just like there were problems with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but we came back and fix it in 65 and again in 68 and again in 72 that's what we need to do now is move forward and fix the Affordable Care Act and then let's do a bipartisan infrastructure bill that would do more than build roads and bridges let's have water and sewage going into communities that need them and less target resources and communities or need and let's have broadband deployment so our kids and get the education that they need the House of Representatives and the Senate need to step into the gap and let's do what is necessary to move our country forward because this president has marginalized himself in such a way it is never going to be able to provide any moral leadership which is what is needed from any president in order to move an agenda very strong words from congressman james Clyburn who I pointed out goes way back in the civil rights movement to the 60s congressman thanks so much for joining us well thank you so

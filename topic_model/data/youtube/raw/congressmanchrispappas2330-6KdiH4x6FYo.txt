i always tell my colleagues from across the country that in terms of support for veterans new hampshire is second to none and you are all a part of the amazing work that goes on to take care of vets to make sure they have access to services and that is particularly important as we face this once in a century pandemic and economic crisis that we know has hit our veteran community incredibly hard so thank you for all the work that you do each and every day i know that in terms of folks that access care at va we have lost about 10 000 veterans nationally due to the covet 19 pandemic and we know that it has also exacerbated mental health issues that veterans live with each and every day the increased isolation the economic stress the health concerns that so many have been coping with have compounded an already difficult situation for a lot of our veterans so it's critically important that as we work to provide relief to americans as we think about gaps in our health care system as we look at the services that are provided through va we do everything we can to make sure that no veteran is left behind

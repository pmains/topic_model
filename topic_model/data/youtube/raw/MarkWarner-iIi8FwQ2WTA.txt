hi I'm Senator Mark Warner and I want to give you an update on our efforts to combat the opioid epidemic with the president's recent signature this bipartisan legislation that I supported and voted for has become law it's comprehensive legislation that will help communities across Virginia by improving opioid treatment and recovery and by providing new tools for law enforcement I'm proud that this bipartisan legislation included many provisions that I authored particularly in the area of expanding the use of telehealth to treat substance abuse this will help folks who are struggling with addiction but live far away from a treatment center it will make sure if through telehealth they get the treatment they need now this law builds on legislation we passed under the Obama administration that invested over a billion dollars to help communities respond to the opioid crisis what we found since then is that there are ways we can improve Medicaid and other federal programs to expand access to substance abuse treatment programs that's one of the things that this legislation does another thing that changed over time as we all know who's been following this problem is the unfortunate spread of synthetic opioids like fentanyl this legislation includes new tools for law enforcement to keep these deadly drugs off our streets it offers also strengthens efforts to prevent people from getting addicted the doctor prescribed opioids in the first place and it includes provisions that my friend senator Kaine authored that will help recovering addicts get back on their feet their job training you know there's a lot of dysfunction here in Washington but on this issue I was pleased that both parties were able to work together on this important new law it's critical from the issue of substance abuse we continue to work together to make sure that every community and every family that's afflicted gets the support and help they need thanks so much

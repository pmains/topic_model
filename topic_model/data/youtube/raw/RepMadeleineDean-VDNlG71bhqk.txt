bounds of every monogram marlin dean is a democratic congresswoman for pennsylvania she joins us from washington you'll be familiar with her because she of course prosecuted donald trump in the impeachment trial in congress madeline dean good to have you with us thank you for being on the program um let me start with liz cheney because since you took such a prominent role in the impeachment i would dare say you have very little in common with her she has very a very conservative attitude but on this issue i imagine you stand shoulder to shoulder in fact i just did that as i walked on the floor to vote not 15 20 minutes ago i was right with her and i commended her on her bravery her honesty so while we have a lot of policy differences there's one thing we have in common that is much more powerful and that is an association with the truth and standing up for the truth and for integrity and for democracy i couldn't be prouder of what liz cheney has done to the business in the white house today um the gang of four are in there officials say to try and find areas of mutual agreement is there any i believe there is we all want to invest in our infrastructure and grow jobs in this country so i hope the republican party can find its way to yes an investment in our families i know that right now in pennsylvania my former colleagues in the pennsylvania house are going around the state bragging of the tremendous investment in the commonwealth of pennsylvania from the american rescue plan but those same legislators are desperately hoping that we will find our way to yes on infrastructure i certainly hope mr mccarthy can summon up support from his conference but you do see a conference really in convulsions with itself with an inability to tell the truth uh except when leaders like liz cheney stand up a congresswoman when kevin mccarthy came out of the white house today he was asked about the election and he said interestingly the legitimacy of the last election is not in doubt we are in the white house with the president he was implying that it was run by joe biden fair and square do you think now the republican party is going to be able to draw a line under that whole issue and move on to focus on issues like the infrastructure bill i wish i could say yes catty but i don't see that and certainly not in my own interactions with leader mccarthy just yesterday on the floor of the house unfortunately mr mccarthy speaks out of both sides of his mouth at one point the president was responsible for the insurrection and the violence that descended upon the capitol on january the 6th at the next point he supported the big lie uh i hope they stick with telling their constituents telling the american public that of course the election was won fairly and squarely by the new administration the biden harris administration because the american people desperately need the truth and they need to undo the terrible seeds that were sown by the former president and his attorney general and by many of them that somehow the election was stolen mr mccarthy needs to say that loudly and clearly over and over again without hesitation when you go back to your district in pennsylvania how much do people talk to you about the events of january the 6th about the insurrection on capitol hill my constituents have been so kind have reached out to me many many times or even if i'm just in the street or walking into a store they they say to me how are you we're worried about you we're proud of you but we're worried about you some even hesitate to ask me and say well we don't want to bring up those incredibly difficult memories but to a person uh republicans and democrats my constituents that i've had the chance to interact with in these intervening months have been nothing but compassionate and shocked at an attack by americans and cited by the former president on the very seat of our democracy congresswoman clearly the president wants to get caught trying to win over republicans and win republican votes it suits him politically but if he doesn't get some progress in in the coming weeks it strikes me that the progressive voices in your party the likes of bernie sanders are going to get louder and louder as this the summer wears on at what point does he have to call it and sort of force this through congress well i think he's been very clear and very bold uh in both his proposals and his strategy that yes of course we should go as far as we can to exhaust uh diplomacy and bipartisanship uh the very meeting today was a very important part of that conversation but at some point uh the president as he has told us is not going to let uh the big lie uh and uh in incapable uh members of the republican party uh from blocking progress for the american people i i have to tell you that i'm surprised uh that they the republicans wouldn't say yes this is something we need to be a part of infrastructure investment jobs investment investment in our families is exactly what we want to be a part of but we do see that the president will seek bipartisanship there's nobody better skilled at it with more experience and he's ably joined by vice president former senator harris but i think at some point we'll have to move we're not going to wait all year we're not going to wait all session the american people need the investment now congresswoman madeline dean okay good to meet you here some time again thank you thank you for having me so let's dig a bit deeper into this

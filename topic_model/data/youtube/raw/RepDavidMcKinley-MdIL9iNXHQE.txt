nate the president was very aggressive at president obama a then candidate obama was very aggressive in in contending that china was manipulating its currency is china still manipulating its currency remember what he he said they were is he st are they still and i believe that the china's that china is still manipulating its currency i believe that if that's the case he went on to say in his remarks mr secretary he said if they are then we're going to start shutting off access to our markets what market have we shut off the and say it to me again so he said if they're going to continue manipulating their currency we're going to start shutting off access to our markets i'm curious which markets now three years in administration has he shut off let me address what i is within my area of responsibility the department of treasury deals with the tax issues deals with the currency issues but what we are responsible for at the department of commerce is seeing to it that there's no violation of trade laws and it's important in direct response to your question that is anything that is done for example out of china or any other okay you're saying it's not in your department then what i'm doing is we that the reason that we have right now the very very large number of orders that make it such that we impose heavy tariffs on goods that come from these countries is an offset to the fact that they're subsidizing unfairly under those laws so that is maybe we get back if you can get back to us with a little bit more writing i would appreciate that if you could maybe explain because we are short time on this and and i'd like to understand you have acknowledged that they are manipulating their currency the second is you made an interesting remark that i appreciate let me just say if i could i can i we can refer that to the us department of treasury i'd be happy to refer it to them that is that is where the judgment is reached about teresa okay well yeah this the second issue that you were very you made some interesting remark earlier about um uh how they're reining in uh some of the regulatory effects and you said as long as it doesn't have an impact on manufacturing the jobs but but yet we're already seeing that the um using the clean air act the epa is has now caused up to approaching 40 gigawatts of power coal fire generating plants have now indicated they're going to shut down so the would you not suggest that that probably is going to increase the cost of electricity to some manufacturers when you have over 10 percent of our electric generating plants closing isn't that likely to close or excuse me increase the cost of utilities the you'll have to give me a little more in this case in point but let me say in general what the president has stood for very strongly is limiting reduction i don't hear what he's saying like what he what he stands for but it's what he's doing and he's allowing it to happen that's why i'm just asking your question is do you recognize does the commerce recognize that inc decreasing electric generating facilities is likely to increase the cost of electricity it's a yes or no let me let me address regulation then i'll adjust utilities briefly if i could the regulation is the only thing that that is allowed in this administration with regard to regulation is things that bear strictly on health safety and security that's it that's all so what as perhaps you've seen in some epa cases for example the president has not allowed those to go forward with regard to what happens to utility power costs new forms of generation are less expensive than all the forms of generation in many cases if they're subsidized i suppose i go along listen i know a difference in time the last is that comment that that the congressman from new jersey mentioned about the letter uh about russia this is a letter sent to you in february february 17th so for your staff to be able to find that there was a letter directed to your attention on february 17th asking so perhaps they they need to communicate that to you all right thank you very much thank you all right the chair recognizes mr pompeo for five minutes great thank you madam chairman good morning mr secretary thank you for joining us i appreciate your enthusiasm for the growth of american men

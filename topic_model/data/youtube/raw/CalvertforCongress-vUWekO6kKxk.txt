well one of the things that's always impressed me about Ken is he understands both the community and the business community and I think that's really important because you get so many different politicians over the years that have never worked in a business let alone owned a business and don't understand all the ramifications between regulations taxes and things like that and that's the refreshing part but he understands those things I know Ken personally I know his intentions and I know he's working for the people in Southern California

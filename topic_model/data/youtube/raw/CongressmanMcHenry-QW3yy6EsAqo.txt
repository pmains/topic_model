chair now recognizes himself for the purposes of opening statement for five minutes this afternoon our subcommittee needs to continue our investigations into allegations of discrimination and retaliation at the CFPB director Cordray we appreciate your willingness to appear before us today in April of this year seven months after a Deloitte Consulting report confirmed racial disparities in the bureau's hiring pay and performance reviews review ratings and four months after the defense investigators group confirmed Angela Martin's claims of Bureau retaliation director Cordray wrote to me to request that he appear before the subcommittee to discuss these troubling issues and his responsibility for controlling CFPB managers accountability is crucial to leadership and I look forward to a director Cordray specifying actions that he is taken to reprimand and terminate managers who have wrongfully treated and retaliated against CFPB employees equally important I look forward to hearing from mr. Cordray about how he has taken actual steps to end employee abuse at the CFPB people are suffering and feel unprotected at their place of work and we've heard from them their managers have been given unequivocal free rein resulting in a toxic management culture that lacks accountability and trust employees fear speaking out and they fear asserting their rights lest they suffer reprisals and retaliations this must change I think we all agree about that mr. Cordray testifies before us here today fully furnished with the capacity and obligation to have already taken immediate action against oppressive managers and to assert his internal accountability and leadership at the bureau anything less than this is an abdication of the directors responsibility to the bureau and its employees like director Cordray I have first-hand I've heard firsthand about the unsafe culture within the bureau in fact since the subcommittee opened its investigation and allegations of just termination and retaliation at the bureau no fewer than 32 employees have come forward about their maltreatment these 32 brave leaders have come forward to do what's right to protect their colleagues who suffer and they have stood up even in the face of retribution from their managers if they were found out and what do you think these employees are telling us mr. Cordray they tell us that other people are being harmed they're being harmed it's not disparate impact it's about individual cases of discrimination and retaliation it's evident that the bureau's problems run deeper than a manager's treatment of anyone Angela Martin a leaden ragi or Kevin Williams the problems are much larger than some modifications to performance management system the problem is the CFPB management culture that condones intimidation discrimination and retaliation and if the director has failed to reprimand and remove bad managers then the problem is also his leadership or lack thereof that's why we have this hearing today to give the director the opportunity to say what he has done and how he's fulfilled his obligations director Cordray dozens of your employees are coming forward to this subcommittee because they have nowhere else to turn or at least that's how they feel they don't trust their EEO process they don't get a fair shake in your union grievance process and some of them have even approached you personally apparently with nothing to show for for the CFPB employees watching I like to say this we're listening if you have already come forward to share your concerns know that you're not alone if you're unsure about whether coming forward will do any good please know that it will to that end I along with chairman hensel ling and subcommittee chair capita recently wrote the GAO to request that that had undertaken independent nonpartisan investigation into these matters I'm please report that the GAO has accepted our request and now shortly bureau employees will have an opportunity to confidentially share all of their concerns with the Government Accountability Office director Cordray the subcommittee recognizes that its investigations led you to initiate some action however changing employee ratings topping off pay hiring consultants and holding listening sessions around the office does nothing to hold your managers accountable and so they are wholly inadequate I'm not interested in hearing about the bureaucratic ways that the Bureau is papering over the real problem we need action we need results like you wrote to me in April director Cordray you said in essence you're ultimately responsible for the bureau's management and that's why you've agreed to come forward and to tell and give your response so today I'm interested in hearing about the actual steps you've taken personally to protect your employees and end the bureau's management culture of intimidation and retaliation now now real

. >> JOINING US NOW IS ONE OF TWO  COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO LED LAST  NIGHT'S HEARINGS, ILLINOIS  CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. WE JUST HEARD SOME REALLY  DRAMATIC TESTIMONY. MANY BELIEVE THIS MAY PROVE A  DERELICTION OF DUTY. DO YOU HAVE A CASE FOR CRIMINAL  CHARGES AGAINST THE PRESIDENT AT THIS POINT? >> THAT'S A DECISION THAT'S UP  TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I THINK SO. I THINK IT'S NOT JUST OUR  HEARING. IT'S BASICALLY EVERY HEARING  THAT WE HAVE DONE, I THINK HAS  SHOWN A UNIQUE,FRANKLY, CRIMINAL COMPONENT TO THIS.  >> ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE? THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LAST PLANNED SCHEDULED HEARING. BUT IS THERE A POTENTIAL THAT MORE INFORMATION IS STILL COMING YOUR WAY AND WE COULD SEE MORE? >> CERTAINLY. I THINK WHAT WE'VE NOTICED IS  ONCE THESE HEARINGS STARTED, WE  KIND OF OPENED THE FLOOD GATES  OF MORE INFORMATION, MORE  WITNESSES, PEOPLE THAT WERE  MAYBE RELUCTANT TO COOPERATE  THAT NOW WANT TO OR PEOPLE THAT  LEGITIMATELY DIDN'T THINK THEY  KNEW SOMETHING THAT WAS  PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT NOW  CAN PUT IN A PIECE OF THIS  PUZZLE.  >> THERE WERE SO MANY SHOCKING  REVELATIONS, A LOT OF SHOCKING  TESTIMONY TO PEOPLE WHO WERE  WATCHING THIS ALL UNFOLD. PERHAPS ONE OF THE MORE SHOCKING ONE WAS THE DRAMATIC  COMMUNICATION GOING ON WITH THE  VICE PRESIDENT'S SECRET SERVICE  DETAIL DURING THE INSURRECTION. IN FACT, I THINK WE HAVE A BIT  OF IT. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. >> THEY WERE STARTING TO FEAR  FOR THEIR OWN LIVES. THERE WAS A LOT OF YELLING, A  LOT OF CALLS OVER THE RADIO. THERE WERE CALLS TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO FAMILY MEMBERS, SO ON AND SO  FORTH. FOR WHATEVER THE REASON WAS ON  THE GROUND, THE VP DETAIL  THOUGHT THIS WAS ABOUT TO GET  VERY UGLY.  >> AGENTS CALLING TO SAY  GOOD-BYE TO FAMILY MEMBERS AS IF YOU'RE ON A DOWNED PLANE. IT'S PRETTY UNTHINKABLE. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO  HEARING THAT? >> IT'S ALL CHILLING. LOOK, I LIVED THROUGH THIS DAY. THEN WE INVESTIGATED THIS DAY. BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL REALLY  PROBABLY A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN I REALIZED THE VICE PRESIDENT,  WHERE HE WAS, HE WAS SO CLOSE TO BEING CUT OFF FROM AN EXIT  ROUTE. KEEP IN MIND AT THAT POINT THE  FEELING WAS, BECAUSE THERE WAS  NOTHING THAT LED US TO BELIEVE  OTHERWISE, WE WOULD ALL BE  INUNDATED. THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE SOME  KIND OF LEGAL BACK AND FORTH TO  TRY TO DEFEND THE VICE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, BUT  ULTIMATELY YOU'D BE OVERWHELMED  BY THIS CROWD. IF YOU'RE A SECRET SERVICE  MEMBER CHARGED WITH PROTECTING  THE VICE PRESIDENT, YOU THOUGHT  THESE THINGS THROUGH AND IT  USUALLY DOESN'T END WELL. IT USUALLY ENDS WITH YOU IN YOUR MIND SAYING I WILL GIVE MY LIFE TO PROTECT THE VICE  PRESIDENT. BUT FOR A FEW HEROIC ACTORS, THE VICE PRESIDENT HAD NO ESCAPE  ROUTE.  >> SOMETHING ELSE STOOD OUT TO  FOLKS. I GUESS THESE WERE OUTTAKES. SOME OF US WHO WORK IN TV KNOW  WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TRY TO TAPE  SOMETHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BUT THIS WAS FAIRLY REMARKABLE  TO SEE. >> SOME OF US WHO WORK IN TV  KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO TAPE  SOMETHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS WAS FAIRLY REMARKABLE. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN THE  PRESIDENT AT THAT MOMENT WHO  COULDN'T GET HIS WORDS RIGHT? THERE SEEMS TO BE PARTICULAR  WORDS HE WANTED LEFT OUT.  E FUN OF  ANY OUTTAKES. THE POINT WAS HE DIDN'T WANT TO  DELIVER THAT SPEECH,  PARTICULARLY WHEN HE SAID "I  DON'T WANT TO SAY THE ELECTION  IS OVER." THE ELECTION IS OVER. THIS IS AFTER THE INSURRECTION. HE STILL SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO  SAY IT, WHICH GOES TO MOTIVE AS  WELL.  >> I KNOW YOU ARE JUST ONE OF  TWO REPUBLICANS ON THIS  COMMITTEE. YOU VOTED FOR TRUMP'S  IMPEACHMENT. YOU'VE GOTTEN DEATH THREATS ON  SCIAL MEDIA. I KNOW YOU ARE NOT RUNNING FOR  REELECTION. WHO THEN TAKES YOUR SEAT? WHO THEN LEADS THE REPUBLICAN  PARTY OR AT LEAST IS SOMEONE  WILLING TO STAND UP TO WHAT  THEY BELIEVE IS WROORIGHT AND N  NECESSARILY TOE THE PARTY LINE? WHO OUT THERE IS WILLING TO  FOLLOW IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS? >> THAT'S A QUESTION FOR  REPUBLICAN VOTERS. IT'S YOUR PARTY. FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT IT TO  LOOK LIKE. I'M FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY  NOW TO SAVE DEMOCRACY, TO SAVE  OUR ABILITY TO SELF-GOVERN. FOR REPUBLICANS THE QUESTION IS, DO YOU WANT TO BE LED BY AN  AUTOCRAT, DO YOU WANT TO BE  ABUSED, DO YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR MONEY STOLEN FROM YOU? IF YOU DO, STICK WITH DONALD  TRUMP. IF YOU DON'T, TAKE YOUR PARTY

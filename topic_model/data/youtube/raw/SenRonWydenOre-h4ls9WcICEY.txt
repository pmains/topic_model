gentlemen let me leave you with one other kind of thought because I know not just this committee but others in this country are going to ask your opinion about some of the policies that we're going to have to address in the days ahead and I sort of start this judgment and come to the hearing to offer up the idea that to get good public policy you've got to get your arms around at least some common ground on the facts you may not get everybody to agree on every aspect of the factual situation but you got to find some ways to get to common ground on some of these key facts and in particular I serve on the Intelligence Committee for example and I certainly share the judgment that Iran is part of this whole debate there's no question about this but i will tell you i'm very reluctant to accept the idea that all of the risk is the situation arant in iran and that's to a great extent where you all have guided much of this discussion you look for example the fact that Goldman Sachs practically invented the commodity index fund I mean these are people who know a lot about the impact of non-commercial investment these are people who have played an enormous role in this sector and they produce an analysis suggesting that the speculative premium on crude oil could be 23 dollars a barrel or 56 cents a gallon at the pump and you have the CEO of the largest you know oil company stating that speculation had increased the price of a barrel of oil by twenty dollars so these are significant judgments and I hope that as we go forward we can continue to have this I understood that number of you said that you hadn't had a chance to look thoroughly at these studies and I respect that but I hope that you will I would very much personally like to have your judgments with respect to whether you think those analyses are wrong and I just want you to know as somebody who has been on this committee for quite some time I'm prepared to accept the proposition based on my work here and on the Intelligence Committee that the situation in Iran is certainly a part of this calculus but I don't buy the theory that this is the entire concern that we're dealing with and I hope that you will take a look at those studies because it was the fact that there were three of them and certainly by two sources with considerable expertise in industry activities one the consumer federation advocates for consumers but they do a good job of getting the facts and doing their homework and the fact that all three of them reach this judgment to me has got to be a significant part of this debate as we try to at least see if we can find some common ground to make policies and I'm prepared as part of that effort to make policy to acknowledge there's there's no question that the situation are in Iran is Part B as part of the debate dr. jürgen your colleague got his hand up first but we're happy to hear from okay from both of ya I just want to say that that you know the EIA is actually very interested in this topic and that's not you know that that's very important to lay out you know in in 2009 we launched an energy and financial markets initiative exactly with the aim of assessing the influences of financial activities and markets such as speculation you know hedging investment as well as our traditional fundamentals work we've produced a website energy and financial markets what drives crude oil prices you know we we certainly discussed the role of futures trading we're very interested in increasing the evidence the body of evidence so to speak we update that website on a monthly basis we've brought together many of the leading researchers in the area I know this paper by Professor singleton actually a former colleague of mine that when i was at carnegie mellon he's now out in California but we brought him in we brought the CFTC over we work with them we've held a couple of workshops we need to improve our understanding of physical and financial market linkages and we want to continue to collaborate with other federal agencies to improve the both the data in this area which is a lot of our mission and the analysis in the area so you know I want to really that's a serious commitment I know that the i guess the nominee to be the administrator of eia has been for this committee recently he's very interested in in this he has great expertise in this area I think it'll help us get more traction in this area but this is not something we were ignoring and certainly EIA has never said like it's all Iran or something that that is not our position so i really appreciate you bringing up the issue you know it's in a critical issue and i want to be very clear about that I mean I'm not I'm not disrespecting that issue or dismissing it in any way I do think the standard of proof that people apply does does vary I think what's important is to just get more evidence and that's where e is role would be thank you I think that the financialization of commodity markets what you're describing has really been quite mark since 2005 and so it is really important to under understand it and affects the oil market I think in terms of facts on the ground I think there's a general agreement that there's a premium it's kind of what's driving the premium and would just want to say it isn't all Iran I mean what is unique about this situation with Iran it's not only the tension but it's at the policy of the US government the policy of Europe is to drive down Iranian oil in the market and drive a million maybe more barrels out of the market in a very tight market and so the second factors that we have a very night market any way that it does in its tightness remind me of 2005 it reminds me of the eve of the 1973 oil crisis it's it's kind of that tight and we were using a number of 750,000 barrels a day of other outages I noticed paul's number is even higher closer to a million barrels a day of sort of above average so it's Iran but it's also and the concerns there and the focus of policy of what's going to happen start happening before after the end of June but at the other hand it's also that this is all occurring in a rather tight market to begin with so that's certainly part of it there's never been a time when dr. jürgen didn't highlight additional issues in my judgment on this question and without keeping you here all afternoon I just note that Saudi Arabia has 2.5 million barrels a day of capacity there now engaged in a major drilling program to expand their capacity Reuters is reporting I love 140 drill rigs operating in Saudi Arabia so this conversation is obviously going to be continued on the question of capacity on the question of Iran on the question of speculation but I want the four of you to walk out of here with a request from me that I would be very appreciative if you would analyze those three studies the goldman sachs analysis the Consumer Federation of America and we can certainly get you the testimony that led the exxon mobil CEO to offer the judgment of speculation and increased the price of a barrel of oil by twenty dollars and i would like to hear from you for recognized authorities in the field whether you think those three studies are off base because I'm stipulating to the fact that I think Iran's a factor i stipulate to trying to follow almost daily what's happening in the capacity area but it is hard to walk away from these judgments from three people who have spent a considerable amount of time all of whom concluding there is a significant speculation premiums so the door is going to be open to you and I would be very interested in your reaction gentlemen if you have something you feel strongly about i'll let you offer it and otherwise i think we've got our gotta wrap wrap this up would either of you like yeah i mean just on that point that person I'd be very happy to be good all three of those organizations on that point because they I believe they are wrong but I wouldn't like you I got the drift on that I I wouldn't like you to have the impression that those views represent the majority have used all the consensus among oil analysts it's very much minority view and I think it's an incorrect view based on faulty analysis that's why you are being welcomed to show us why people like Goldman Sachs are wrong all right gentlemen we thank you've been very patient through a morning that's been hectic even by Senate standards and without the energy committees adjourned and oh and let me also say for the information of all members all questions and additional statements for today's hearing or due by 5pm tomorrow March 30th we are adjourned

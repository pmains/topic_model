you know I was disappointed to see like with many other issues that there are substantial racial disparities when it comes to the dangers associated with the cosmetic products a study by the Environmental Working Group found that african-american women use products at a higher rate than white women and that they and what they used was proportionately less safe testing 1177 products targeted for sale to African American women the results showed that one out of twelve products were rated highly hazardous to human health potential dangers connected to product ingredients include cancer hormone disruption developmental and reproductive damage allergies and other adverse health effects this data is particularly concerning to me because I have a district that's nearly 90 percent Latino and African American doctor main what more can be done to address these racial disparities and Cosmetics and will any of the bills today help I think the goal we all share is making sure that these cosmetic products are safe for all consumers and some of the new authorities that are contemplated in the legislation would certainly be helpful for that at the same time I want to commit that we are we are always concerned about vulnerable populations populations who may have heightened disease risk at the FDA we have an office of women's health we have an office of minority health we are sensitive to those issues and we're happy to work with any individual communities that may have a disproportionate risk or need additional safety information that includes in some circumstances language translation safety advisories can go out in both English and in Spanish so we're always sensitive to the needs of specific populations is there any tracking that's done from reports of products that impact him use of color again we don't even know at this point who manufactures these products are what are in the market great thank you I yield back

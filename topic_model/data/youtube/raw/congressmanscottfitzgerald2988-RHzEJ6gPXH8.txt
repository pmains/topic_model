all right folks joining me now republican congressman scott fitzgerald of wisconsin congressman your reaction to what we just heard i mean the sort of complaints we're hearing people have known them uh these texas oil producers american oil producers still the white house is bending over backwards to try to get saudi arabia to help us what do you make of it yeah i mean uh charles what we're seeing today is uh you know fist bumps with the crown prince and uh it's just unbelievable i've been to those west texas oil fields and uh the level of frustration is just incredible we we could if we can get these guys to jump back in the game and make that investment we'd be in great shape but i'm not sure it's going to happen at this point so we find ourselves in a situation of hat in hand in the middle east and you know when you talk to former secretary pompeo he's saying listen this is just as much about stability in the middle east as it is about oil and i just don't have the faith in president biden he can negotiate anything yeah i'm going to pick up on that uh because it's not just saudi arabia we're still doing trying to do this thing with iran bring them back into the community of nations even though we know now they're going to be selling drones to russia to aid their invasion of ukraine i mean just how much how far backwards do you think this administration will be willing to go uh to you know to sort of check those boxes whether it's saudi arabia and iran because the last time they did it uh you know the obama administration did this the results were not good for the world no and let me just say i mean as a member of congress even a greater concern and a further concern is the back channel discussions that have been happening between iran and china for some months now so you know don't take my word for it all you have to do is kind of watch what's going on globally and you'll figure out that the us is not necessarily in a great position when it comes to any of these countries right now under the biden administration and of course the higher oil prices just help those folks who uh use that money to export terror whether it's a regional terrorism and middle east or of course putin's war i i do want to ask about here at home president biden just not not relenting at all he continues to pound away on small businesses like gas station owners really you know just trying to shame them uh and of course if it's not them it's everyone else is there at any point i mean you have inside scoop maybe you know some of your colleagues across the aisle where you think the white house might want to reverse and think about what they're actually doing is saying or is this a greater war on capitalism itself oh i think if it was up to some of the members of congress on the other side of the aisle they would have already tried to make or appease kind of some of the oil companies into luring them back into starting to make the investments that are going to be needed but but you're right i mean the white house has just been out there blocking every effort to make that happen and unfortunately i think what that means is summer is going to be volatile uh you know you see a little bit of relief in the state of wisconsin at the pumps but you know uh families are planning those vacations right now and it's hitting them hard i mean i hear it every day on the fourth of july that that's all i got was an ear full of people in wisconsin saying too much at the pumps and you're having a direct effect on on the bottom line of our pocketbook yeah and people are wondering what the next fourth of july is going to be like let me stay with the small businesses for a moment i know you're an advocate for them we have producer price index which was through the roof uh you know uh and a lot higher than cpi i keep saying businesses are doing profiteering all wrong the nfib small business report was uh really frightening will there is there anyone down there in dc trying to help the in the small businesses because i think they're going to be priced out of business more you know we've seen hundreds of thousands of them go out of business doing an economic boom that shouldn't be happening no and as a member of small business committee in the house uh one of the things we've talked about is kind of the tail end of the ppp loans and just how it did save some of these small businesses but now the transition has been painful and and the one sector i think that's being ignored is light manufacturing i mean if you think about the goods and services angle and whether or not those uh those products are going to be able to flow into these small businesses at any type of rate that that they need a lot of this was based on on-time delivery and some of the stuff that manufacturing has been doing for years that's all been derailed so for us to come back anytime quickly it's going to be difficult yeah well we're already seeing the numbers and it's it's really ugly and dispiriting considering that small businesses are the backbone of this country congressman thank you very much appreciate it thanks charles thank you

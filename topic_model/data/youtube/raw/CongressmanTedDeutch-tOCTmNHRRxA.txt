the police the firefighters the paramedics the doctors and others who rushed into danger as so many tried to rush out they knew they might not come home that day and will forever be grateful for those whose lives were lost but the ones who did come home for those who showered off the dust and then went back to cloth through debris and came back home only to do it again day after day until the job was done they are also paying a lifelong price in the early 10 years ago I was a freshman member of Congress and I had the pleasure of meeting a constituent Freddie na boa who moved to South Florida from his native Queens Freddie worked as a paramedic supervisor and on September 11th 2001 shortly after the North Tower was hit Freddie was dispatched to the South Tower to help run triage out of the lobby and then suddenly the ground ground beneath him began to shake and the windows burst and the second tower was hit Freddie was able to run for cover beneath an ambulance that was completely engulfed in smoke and debris over the course of the recovery effort Freddie spent 18 days digging through the rubble at Ground Zero today Freddie takes 14 different medications for severe asthma obstructive lung disease sleep apnea liver disease and diabetes his asthma is so bad that he doesn't drive anymore he can't catch his breath on the walk from his house to a car before the Victims Fund there were some months that Freddie was forced to make the difficult choice of food or medicine he will live with the cost and the pain his entire life we must do everything that we can to ease the burden that he and every first responder took in those days after 9/11 and to Freddie to the first responders who joined us here yesterday as witnesses and observers to all of the first responders in New York and New Jersey and across our country we remember the spirit of unity that you embodied in those days at Ground Zero we remember your sacrifice we are grateful for the sacrifices that you make every day and we thank you thank you again to my colleagues who strongly support this bill and I look forward to working with all of you to make sure that it becomes law

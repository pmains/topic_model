next senator senator cassidy thank you mr chair so i was a medical resident in 1983 to 1986 to an hiv epidemic when hiv just exploded so i'm very aware of the need to have a robust research and public health response to infectious diseases now dr wilinski part of this has got to be predicated upon trust between the american people and the agencies that the agencies are functioning as best as they can and i feel like that trust has frankly been dissipated and i'm sorry to say that because i respect you as a as a clinician as a person but i've asked you on multiple occasions as to what percent of the cdc workforce is actually showing up frankly you've always blocked that you've never given a straight answer so i'd like to enter for the record an article from the epic times in which they did a foia request to find out how many folks at cdc were actually working showing up so to speak and and roughly 2 000 2 72 out of roughly 13 000 employees are showing up every day but 78 percent are working completely remotely or come in maybe only twice every two months now why is that important first that was a noble fact but it was not shared with congress we the representatives of the american people and i think the american people would like to know that if cdc is not functioning well how many of the people are actually showing up now i mentioned cdc is not functioning well because i now reference an article which i'll enter for the record from new york times on august 17th in which you frankly to your credit point out cdc has not been working well um and that there is need for wholesale change and at the end of the article they quote an acting director of uh of uh under a president obama dr besser who says that it's hard it's first pointing out that you're still working remotely you yourself are working remotely at least of october august um the 17th and then he says but it's hard to see how dr lewinsky could execute wholesale changes when she only sees most of her staff at a distance quote i don't know how you motivate and inspire culture change when people aren't together now cdc is requesting billions of dollars for public health initiatives in an agency which by your assessment is not functioning well in which only about 22 percent of the people are showing up every day and in which previous obama officials are doubtful that you can affect change because you don't show up every day and i say that kind of painfully because i want the cdc to work and yet and one example and i'm sure there's a reason for it but there's been a lot of talk about the need for local agencies to have to modernize but but cdc was given 200 million dollars under the cares act for data modernization to be awarded to 64 different state territorial local jurisdictions and maybe this is hhs maybe it's not cdc but most of it has not yet been spent or allocated this is according to this is according to crs so it's incredibly frustrating that a deliberate decision was made to not be transparent with the american people as regards the amount of people actually showing up for work it takes a foia request from a newspaper and now you're asking for billions more why should we trust thank you senator for that comment um i will say that we are an agency of 13 000 people the people who need to be at cdc are at cdc of course are laboratory workers we have many people in the field we have people in 60 different countries but the article points out that there are many that it's just wide open that there's nobody showing up that the offices are empty so to suggest that all these people are field workers i think again is another example of being opaque i don't imply that they're they're all field workers i'm saying that many of them are field workers many of them are working at cdc and then deployed in responses and many of them are on the road i myself was in atlanta last week for a day but i was in new mexico with tribal visits and uh doing a secretary's um uh tribal advisory committee meeting so many of us are on the road um i am here today and i am working i'm sorry what percent of cdc employees before the pandemic actually showed up for work every day as opposed to the only 22 percent now i don't have those numbers for you yeah that's i i just feel like how shooting let me go back to why should we trust cdc with billions when it's very difficult to get i would say a straight answer on on what is the workforce in person effort and particularly when by your own assessment the agency is working so poorly um the the review that we did on august 17th was to demonstrate the lessons learned from the kova 19 response the people of the cdc are working well they're working hard and they don't necessarily need to be on site in atlanta in fact oftentimes they're more productive off-site in the field doing the work of public health so i would just we're out of time but let me just say that the former acting director of cdc from president obama when he said in the last paragraph of the new york times article he did not see how you were going to be able to speaking of you particular affect change when you only see people every now and then he was both suggesting that it was not a work completed but it was something that had to happen now and that when people not working together made that more difficult to execute and i don't think anybody in here or anybody watching really thinks that only 22 percent of the cdc employees showed up for work at the building every day before the pandemic they think it was probably 78 and now the numbers reversed it's going to be hard for me to support more appropriations until we have a better relationship a more trusting relationship a more transparent relationship between the agency and congress which you're asking to fund your activities with that i yield

uh thanks senator rosen uh congratulations on serving as chair of the international council of jewish parliamentarians a gary ackerman was a was a colleague of mine a good friend and a great leader elliott engel was a colleague of mine a good friend and a great leader and you following that great tradition formerly my colleague in the house now an important uh and vital member of the united states senate i congratulate you on your position i'm confident that under your leadership this body will serve as a resource and forum for jewish parliamentarians from around the world i'm honored and uh always pleased to work with you thanks to the world jewish congress and ambassador louder for uh for bringing us together uh thanks for inviting me to serve as the north american co-chair of the international council of jewish parliamentarians along with my friend anthony house father first as a state senator in florida and now as a united states representative my judaism has always driven my work and from my support for the cicero relationship my commitment to caring for our aging holocaust survivors to supporting policies that follow through on our promise of fairness and justice and equality under law jewish values underlie everything that i do as a public servant and i know that that is so true for the other members who are with us today now i recognize that i stand in a pretty unique position i'm a jewish congressman who represents a vibrant jewish community in south florida i serve in a legislature the u.s house that has a disproportionately high number of jewish members and i live in a country where the jewish community thankfully has thrived but i see the rising anti-semitism and challenges to democracy in my country just as i see the troubling trend in countries around the world i'm clear-eyed about the worsening situation in so many places and in so many ways for the jewish community part of this council's mission is to support the principles of democracy the cause of human rights and the rule of law and to combat racism anti-semitisms and a phobia terrorism and holocaust denial i don't have to tell any of you that these principles democracy human rights and the rule of law are under attack in many places around the world forces of racism anti-semitism xenophobia terrorism and holocaust denial are growing threats to peace and stability not only to the jewish community but starting with the jewish community it affects every jewish community all of us because we are one jewish community now as a jewish parliamentarian we have to fight against anti-semitic attacks wherever they occur we must come to the defense of every jew every jewish community facing hatred and violence and right now at this very moment israelis are israeli colleagues the israeli people are under siege by hamas terrorists launching rockets with the sole purpose of killing as many civilians as they can and we jewish parliamentarians cannot afford to be silent there are some around the world appearing to defend this onslaught by hamas a terrorist organization recognized as such by the international community some even try to justify the terrorists attacks let me say that again there are elected officials who defend a terrorist group sworn to the destruction of the state of israel so we must say unequivocally that there is no place on earth where a terror group firing hundreds of rockets on innocent civilians should be defended or its actions justified not if human rights matter to us the attack on israel is an attack on the jewish state and the tax on our people is something that all of us here understand uniquely and are tasked with speaking out on forcefully the response from legislators in my congress or any parliament around the world should be crystal clear whether rockets are raining down on london or paris or toronto or tel aviv the response should be no different throughout for our ally israel for our friend israel quite simply we stand with our friends we stand with israel and when anyone including any of my colleagues any elected officials especially questions the loyalty of the jewish member questions my loyalty i remind them that i am the son of a world war ii veteran who fought the nazis at the battle of the bulge we defended democracy and fought evil that's what we do when we support israel as it battles hamas terrorists now as i mentioned i stand in unique position as a jewish member of congress but i know that there are jewish parliamentarians who represent much smaller communities or maybe one of only a few jewish leaders in their country for those jewish leaders serving in countries where jews make up a small minority of the country's population it's even more important that they that you have a forum like this to connect with other jewish parliamentarians around the world and to collaborate on ways to protect our communities if the events of the last few years and certainly the events of the last few days have taught us anything it is that jewish communities must stand in defense of one another and all of us as elected leaders of those communities we have a particular responsibility to use our positions to ensure governments combat anti-semitism and protect those communities from harm so i want to thank you for convening this meeting for giving me the honor of speaking i am thrilled to take on this role in north america i look forward to doing more to engage with and to support uh all of you jewish leaders from around the world uh it's my great pleasure and honor to join you and i thank you again ambassador water to the world years congress i thank you for organizing this and bringing us all together

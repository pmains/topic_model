in washington congresswoman lauren underwood has made it her mission to protect our nation's veterans who are suffering from ptsd anxiety and depression yeah the sad and sobering reality in america is that each and every day some 20 veterans 20 are going to take their own lives so recently the congresswoman saw her bill the veterans care quality transparency act passed into law we want to say good morning to congresswoman underwood congratulations on the new law let's get right into it what is it designed to do yes so this bill is taking a look at five years worth of data you know the veterans administration has entered into agreements with outside organizations community-based partners to try to reach veterans for suicide prevention and mental health services but we know that they've largely stumbled in their effectiveness why because the data that scott outlined has not changed over the last several years we owe our veteran a debt of gratitude and want to make sure that the va is giving them the best of care that we can offer well you know i want to ask you to get because there's a question here why are veterans more likely to harm themselves even after utilizing some of the services that are offered right now by the vha yeah so we know that veteran um 20 veterans die by suicide every day half of them are connected with the va for care so the others are isolated and alone and they're suffering in communities like ours all across the country and so the va has partnered with these outside groups and to try to do outreach and bring those folks in to care um but there's been you know inconsistencies so that's what this bill is designed to answer quite frankly you know why is this happening and how can we make improvements both inside va and outside you know a congresswoman since the start of the pandemic we have been talking to medical professionals about the fact that a lot of people are reluctant to go through routine doctor visits dentists breast cancer screenings can you talk briefly about how the pandemic is impacting veterans and maybe they're not seeking the help that they need right now right so we know that uh veterans are just like everyone else in our community they read the news they hear the best advice and earlier this spring people were told to avoid um you know discretionary medical appointments that advice has now changed and so we are encouraging everybody that needs help to go and get it whether it's physical or mental health support and including behavioral health issues like substance use disorders it's important that everybody gets the care that they need and the va is a tremendous resource we have a number of va facilities here in the chicagoland region they offer excellent care and they are welcoming to all veterans but povid related we were able to pass legislation my legislation out of the house of representatives to ensure that veterans get free covent testing and treatment um but as i mentioned before we are trying to make sure that all veteran work um getting here at the va can get the best of care that we can offer certainly i think all americans can appreciate that kind of effort i want to talk to you about election day because it is just over a week away you're running against republican state senator jim oberweis you say it's a clear contrast and choice between the two of you he says you're too far left for the district what's your reaction well we're eight days away from the election everyone has an opportunity to go and vote today so we're asking you if you haven't voted yet make a plan to vote vote early and if you've already voted you know we need everyone's continued support so make one additional call chip in one additional dollar you know reach out to one additional voter and make sure that they understand what's at stake in this election folks can visit our website at underwood for congress.com to get find them well on that note real quick i want to mention to our viewers we have reached out to mr oberweis we hope to have him here on good day chicago live this week perhaps to uh you know uh talk about some of the things you've been talking about uh real quick before we let you go um your thoughts on last week's debate do you think that it impacted uh people's minds at all we know more than 50 million people have already cast their ballots well we know that this is a competitive presidential election and here in northern illinois i think people are excited about joe biden's message about change about decency about compassion and how those things are on the ballot and so you know i i've been hearing lots of enthusiasm for his candidacy and i think that election night will be special all right congressman lauren underwood thank you so much for joining us this morning appreciate your time thank you

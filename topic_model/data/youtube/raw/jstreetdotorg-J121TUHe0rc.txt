dear friends I want to tell you a story it is one of the stories that resonate most strongly in my head when thinking about the amazing year we've been through since the day in July when the citizens of Israel rose up into a new time in one of the largest protest not actually did biggest protest in Israel's history following that beautiful summer we moved from a period of huge rallies into a winter of more focused struggle out of the hundred and twenty tent camps that we build during the summer there were few who managed to survive one of them was located in a rough neighborhood of Tel Aviv hatikvah Hatikvah in Hebrew means hope Hatikvah however that neighborhood has nothing to do with hope it is a neighborhood of hard working people many works in more than one job and with no chance of ever escaping poverty supported by what's left of a welfare system they've been struggling to bring food to their families to send their kids to school like most Israelis when they go to vote they don't vote they take do it back not based on their self-interest on taxes or the housing reform but under position towards our enemy absurdly most of them end up supporting the parties that made new liberalism their new religion making them its biggest victims one rainy day we got an evacuation order from the municipality to evacuate the tent camp this wasn't an evacuation similar to the ones of other tent camps because this one was not a home for only protesters but also for homeless families for whom a tent was their only roof for the cold winter days we try to convince the municipality the Ministry of housing to find solutions for those specific families to no avail and then the last night for the 10th arrived but we could not give up we gather together people from many different places in Israel everybody has the right for a home we agreed and then representatives of those homeless families from the neighborhood went throughout the country and asked others who suffer from similar housing problems to join their protest they invited bad wins who were struggling to maintain their officially unrecognized villages and they invited Arab Israeli citizens who lived in towns were they never could get permission from the government to build outside of a very limited zone and then they also invited the young Middle East class middle class people who were fighting for affordable housing in the cities and so he came there together people from different worlds from different galaxies sometimes marching shouting and holding each other's hands when the police came we didn't fight we had decided earlier that violence is the tool of old politics none of the one that we're creating new what we could the only thing we could do to continue the protest was to be very creative we ran together through the little alleys of that neighborhood of closed markets drumming with people who came out of their balconies to the streets to join us it felt amazing to finally be there be one United all of us flushed and sweaty from the effort parents and grandparents and children and young students even a few babies in their father's hands it all went well until the police were ordered to step up the response they started to hit us heavily pushing some and punching others without a warning I was taken by five cups to a police car bit into the floor choked inside by a furious officer who hid his name tag we found ourselves locked up together for a whole night in one cell friends moms students ex-military officers all of us different people different worlds together ladies and gentlemen meet us the new criminals of Israel criminals because we can make me committed the most dangerous crime reunited this story sad as it may sound is actually a very happy one struggles aren't easy although they can be happy and ours is definitely the happiest we've ever had it's the happiest because this is the first struggle that really has hope I came here to show you what our government officials don't want you to know they prefer to brag about a great financial situation a wonderful democracy but for us the young citizens of our country we have quite a different perspective many of our best friends upon finishing their military service left the country and are today living in Europe or the u.s. many more have given up on future in Israel not only because of the challenging financial situation but also because of lack of hope in our political process it is the result of 30 long years shared by both left and right wing governments that reduced our Social and Health Services one by one and broadened or lack of equality to the vastest extent it could go according to the OECD report we're second in the Western world in income inequality just behind the u.s. ya hear you always win but we're learning that breach of our social security network made our differences stronger and broke Israel into fragments and sectors all fighting against each other filled with drama and hatred in Israel it's like that tell me what your enemies are and I'll tell you who you are Jews against Arabs Mizrahi against Ashkenazi ultra-orthodox against secular people twenty percent of Israel's population is not Jewish but it is not the only community who feels neglected so the doors all too often invisible citizens who don't live in the country Center and the more than half of Israelis who don't have white skin or European heritage for years the government hadn't listened to us so we blamed each other fed by constant fears of our external threats we could not argue when our government moved more money to the defense budget taking it directly from a welfare system with no social security and with diminished change chances of social mobility there was no way for us to become more United committee we developed only more hatred when summer five of my friends and I pitched hands on road shield boulevard to protest the unbearable cost of living we did not imagine that those events would create the first opportunity in Israel's history for society to put it to put its inner conflict aside and stand together to create itself on you this time is an egalitarian compassionate society for the first time we didn't look at the past with horror but at our future and with great hope for the first time we had no fear only shining eyes that could stir down any threat knowing history was being made that day in July saw the formation of the largest protest movement in the history of Israel wondering that eventually brought around half a million from all walks of life to the streets calling not only for affordable housing but for justice solidarity and democracy honda west activity the people demand social justice israel had the highest number of protesters per capita in the whole world in a long time something that would compare to 19 million americans out on the streets on the one single night protesting a cause just imagine that 19 million americans one night for one cause sadly there are those in government who wish to come to compensate for the missing social cohesion by overemphasizing external threats and beating again on the drums of war well the security establishment has been dealing with many issues Iran first and foremost with great professionalism and responsibility our leaders in government have exploited these fears and have avoided dealing with the health of the very society they claim to be defending the Zionist dream of our nation for national home as a safe shelter has morphed into a nightmare of her home as a bomb shelter our leaders are attempting to create a false sense of unity forged in fear and often in hatred as they continue to in practice and courage greater disunity and inequality but we cannot build if we're constantly in hiding a month ago my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came here to Washington DC and shamefully compared our lives to those of our grandparents who lived in the ghettos as if we were doomed to live under permanent intractable threat as if Israel were the modern incarnation of that ghetto we don't want this we want hope indeed our grandparents wanted hope as well they did not well exclusively in the past they built under threat far graver than today a thriving country our future cannot be guided by threat alone we must build a vision for a common purpose today we feel hope again it is not surprised that many of her friends living abroad came back to stand side-by-side with us during this miraculous reawakening they came back to fight for this thing called Israel to take back Israel if you like they came back to fight for our future in a short time we have already gained serious tangible results we compel the government to lower the age of which free education begins lifting a heavy financial burden from the backs of young parents we succeeded in winning the creation of new options for affordable housing we've had victories fighting for workers rights social justice has become more than a phrase now it's uttered approvingly by preschool kids politicians and media alike but this is a marathon and we have only completed the first mile there is so much more to do our generation has learned to see politics as a dirty world if we're to be successful in the long run we must learn to reclaim language and the practice of new politics we cannot fear engaging with our political institutions this will take time courage and resources and the political forces stepped up against us are not weak or simple there are the most powerful forces one could ever imagine perhaps some of you are waiting for me to say the world peace I know lines on a map are important I know investing resources on one side or the other of the line matters but we're fighting for something much bigger we're fighting for society's values to build a society that moves away from indifference to inequality and suffering to build a society that looks to embrace assured citizenship mutual respect and concern that asserts our rights not least to economical dignity that is a society that will stop doing certain things and start doing other things when our grandparents came to the Middle East with their crazy beautiful dream they did it with great courage and no matter how difficult this struggle will be we must remember them and have no fear when dealing even with those who mislead the people and betray these people's rights life and happiness we will never give up we spend our days and nights traveling throughout the country organizing communities establishing the foundations for a long-lasting social movement sleep is not an option this pair is not an option two we're here to stay and we plan to be everywhere in schools universities trade unions municipalities the private sector the Knesset the government everywhere I talked about the cross communal partnerships that we build one is missing you I know and admire the histories of many of the communities and individuals in this room I know of your important history in the trade union movement of your involvement in the civil rights struggle and of the role that American jury takes today in fighting for social justice in the US and throughout the world I know you're not only fight for my country but also for my values this is time to put those two together it's time to build a constitution for our country it's time to get involved it's time to look up it is time to share our hopes and make them reality we haven't got a lot of time but we do have great dreams and those dreams our best weapon instead of running away from our enemies let's walk together towards one beautiful and crazy dream beautiful and crazy dream of a new Israel one dream that can soon become true thank you very much

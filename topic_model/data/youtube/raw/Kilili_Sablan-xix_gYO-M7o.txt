Cena my congressman Greg Kelly Lisa blonde says the military should clean up after itself and Congress should pay what it takes to get the job done in the Commonwealth Guam and elsewhere but channel to Washington correspondent Matt cave reports Sablan pressed the issue just so far in Florida base this week Sablan started out offering a 21 million dollar increase above a committee passed bill for DOD cleanup of its facilities chemicals and munitions under the formerly used defense sites or funds program but he would through the amendment after the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee added 25 million above the President's request of 204 million still not what sablan wanted but an improvement having secured as much as he felt he could from Republicans sablan withdrew the amendment but stressed he was making a point but I want to make the point that we ought to keep funding at the same level we appropriated in fiscal 2015 250 million dollars and that is what my amendment would do because now it's not the time for the military to backslide on its clean up there are 5,000 sites in every state and territory that we know are contaminated and these sites are not in someone else's backyard they're in salons backyard as well and in my district I represent a northern mariana islands there are 24 contaminated areas dating back to World War 2 still waiting to be cleaned up for example 17 rust a few times in the little village of Tonopah leaking oil to the ground since Harry Truman was president and every day keeps walking back to school fisherman and illigal just a few feet away families living with the smell of oil in their homes and Sablan added it's not just an environmental issue the military buildup in the Marianas would mean more fuel and other facilities and live fire training and the people I represent are saying no to this expanded military activity now restoring Fox funding will not change anyone's mind about the military's proposed buildup in my district but at least the military will have a little more credibility when a promising that it will clean up after so because if the people I represent see Congress calling farms for thoughts does the Luthor promised us no credibility at all sablan points out the Army Corps of Engineers estimates total costs of 14 billion dollars so 50 years from now Sablan says we will still be having the same discussion with that Sablan withdrew his amendment separately the house defeated a Sablan amendment to the DoD spending bill to require that the Secretary of Defense reach agreement with the nmi government on expanded military activities that before Congress ok is funding pointing to do DS proposed takeover of paagan sablan insisted the enemy government must consent first before DOD expands use of public lands in the commonwealth but local consultation and congressional and presidential approval are already required in current law Sablan semaine men died 173 to 256 on Capitol Hill Matt k4k SPN Channel 2 News

Thank You mr. chairman and certainly thank you to our witnesses I think we're we're having a very productive hearing I appreciate the opportunity to discuss ways that we can help Americans plan and be ready for retirement I think there are many ways we can work together in this area on a bipartisan basis for example risa has broad bipartisan bicameral support and provides a series of solutions to improve our retirement system however I do have concerns about some of the approaches being considered in this hearing appreciate mr. Larson's efforts to bring forward proposals to address the current shortfalls in and shortcomings of Social Security however this proposal has issues and deviates from our bipartisan tradition in this area in particular I'd like to focus on the low income and middle class tax increase included in the proposal now under the tax cuts and job act a single mother with two children has zero federal income tax liability until she earns more than 53,000 dollars a year let me say that again the tcj under the tcga a single mother with two children pays no federal income tax until her income is more than 53,000 dollars per year and yet the Social Security proposal we are discussing today would increase the taxes of the same single mother earning approximately $50,000 by $50 every year because the economic literature tells us both the worker and employer it shares a payroll taxes ultimately come out of the workers wages and this is not a static $50 either it's a new increase repeated every year for the next 24 years over the course of 24 consecutive tax increases that certainly adds up by 2043 it would build to a tax increase of about $1,200 for someone earning $50,000 I think that's real money let me say we agree that we need to address Social Security's a solvency problem but implementing a $1,200 tax increase on single moms while creating a new social security benefit for millionaires I don't think is the way to do that we should empower people to make better decisions to help themselves their own families with the many the hard-earned money that they earn if saving for retirement or to buy a house or to start a family is the best use for your money I do that if your kids need new clothes or sneakers or you need a new battery for your car you have other needs that we sitting here on this committee couldn't begin to guess I'd prefer you keep your own money and spend it on what you need we tried to help families do this last year with the family savings Act through the universal savings accounts and provisions which would let families access their retirement accounts for life events like welcoming a new child into their family we want every one of our fellow Americans to succeed in the workforce we want them to earn more and benefit from what they earn we want folks to save for a secure retirement we want to have policies which empower the American people to make the right decisions mr. Biggs would you have anything to add to this well thank you you discussed some of the issues involved with raising payroll tax rates there's social security 20100 Act would it would increase the to speak into the microphone mr. Biggs I apologize thank you they're so scary 20100 Act would increases so security payroll tax rate over time from the current twelve point four percent up to fourteen point eight percent so that's a two point four percentage point increase it's important to recognize the Social Security payroll tax is the largest tax that most people pay more than they pay in income taxes so that's around a 20 percent increase you know in the dollars they would pay each year the question for a low income household is what do they do one possibility is they just suck it up they they spend less money at home less money and their kids you know less money towards buying a home well there's other research that says the low income workers they'll try to maintain their lifestyle in in the face of lower take-home pay and the way they may do that is by borrowing more borrowing more on their credit cards borrowing more on auto loans putting a smaller down payment on a home that is something that is worrying to me and is really based on the research has come out in the past several years so I understand why you might want to raise payroll tax rates to keep Social Security going but the impact on low income folks is not at all clearly positive thank you I appreciate the insight of all of our witnesses here today and like I said I think this is a productive hearing where we can discuss issues that we know are important for the American

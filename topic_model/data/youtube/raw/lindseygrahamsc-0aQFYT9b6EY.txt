reserved liberal activist he was booed repeatedly for standing up for our conservative values for supporting justice Dingell Gorsuch and for defending president Trump but he refused to back down instead our next speaker pushed back with a smile on his face so watch this short clip for an introduction come on try to do I'm trying to help our president Donald Trump be successful as possible because number one I agree with it mostly and I'd like to get this country moving again so oh yeah [Applause] I lost the resale replace Obamacare the wedding is both I'll write the foot just gorsek over to bring forth I want the culture cactus don't we need to I want to be off to rebuild our military the process I want to live [Applause] a large dam cross and I'm going to have talked about here is the rest of you [Applause] [Applause] Senator Lindsey Graham [Applause] for Henry that was a good civics lesson they may not be a free lunch but there's a free breakfast how many of you came to it the best thing I did for the Republican Party is feed people so you'll be out by 1:30 because I watch you eat you're not going to be able to stay up past 1:30 so that Town Hall tells you a couple things you live in a country where you can come and boost somebody you want to how many people would die to be able to confront a political leader so they confronted me they're very sincere and they're a little bit crazy I like to be in a crowd where I can say I want a gun do you own a gun I'm not going to bother you unless you make me bother you I like been in a crowd where I say I'm pro-life and very very proud of it there are people that disagree with us and have every right to you want to look forward instead of backwards we got it all we got the white house we got the house we got the Senate we act governorship we got States then stay down now how does that happen Democrats have done more to help us than we've helped ourselves they're off in a ditch in their world there's only one way to get health care from the government in their world you don't own a gun unless somebody allows you to not the Constitution there's a lot at stake here in their world every judge believes their many senator or a mini House member in our world we're electing judges to interpret the law and follow it as it's written not make it up now there are 150 judicial openings my goal is to fill every damn one of them soon so Harry Reid you made it possible for us to do that without one Democratic vote how's that looking now Harry to present Trump you beat me and everybody else you won I want to help you you know why I like most about him he listens to the military and I am so glad to finally have a commander-in-chief will actually listen to the generals he says I'm going to rebuild the military in a fashion we've never seen since Ronald Reagan I said I'm going to help you everywhere I can in a hundred days plus he's done more to reset the world than Obama did in eight years I am now glad to have a commander-in-chief that will tell our enemies enough is enough let me tell you a story about I tell you what the thing about Donald Trump you don't go to bed early and he I mean late he goes to bed late and gives up early he calls and I'm honored that he would call me and I want to help him he calls me while I'm still asleep and he calls me after I go to bed I wish he had rest more I gave him my phone number so far so good what have I learned about our president he's curious he asked questions and he knows no fear and he's under siege unlike any president I've ever seen in my entire life this is actually ridiculous you see these thousand people they don't believe he want I do now Obama was hard for us but I thought we were somewhat respectful mentoring good manners is a good thing to have and to the people who are attacking President Trump you're doing so in the most vicious vile ways and you're not helping our country bottom line folks is that let me tell you a story he got a call about 1:30 in the morning about the time he goes to bed and they wanted to know if he could would approve an operation to go into a town outside of Raqqa and he asked the general well who's making this request major so-and-so well does he know what he's doing he graduated number one in his class at West Point then Trump said why do you think I know more about this Nita that the commander chief within nating so we got gorsek cutting it done better and judge corset was a home run [Applause] there's another opening coming just hang tight we're going to cut your taxes where those people on that video wants to or not on health care I don't know what the hell we're going to do here's what I believe Obama is failing the world let it fail and make Democrats work with us because they created this mess we're going to rebuild your military we have a commander-in-chief but we'll listen to those who are in charge of the military we're going to get Washington more out of your lives than they have been in the last eight years we will make our fair mache mistakes but I think we have a chance as Republicans to do great things for this country and everything you've been working for in South Carolina has come to a head in a way you couldn't dream about thirty years ago a lot of dieren counties where you can't meet in meeting a phoneless as Republican ten years from now Democrats are going to be more organized than they are today in South Carolina is going to become more competitive because the demographic changes does that make sense to you so let it be said that our generation built a party and grew the party that we brought people from all walks alike into the Republican Party under a shared vision that Henry described to you I know at times I'll probably drive you crazy I get it but the one thing and I clap for that too one thing I want to tell you is every time I do something I'm doing it where I think it's best for the country and the party mom we're looking things got a partner now in Donald Trump who's very open-minded it will do things that the country needs not just the Republican Party me I really believe that Donald Trump is going to take the old-style party politics and replace it with a working together spirit that will make us all stronger I really believe that and I want to close with this we've had eight years of a community organizer to apologize for America at every turn all over the world who really believe that George W Bush was more of a problem than the Ayatollah no rhyme here's what I would tell the enemies of this nation you better watch it with this guy I was having lunch with the president the sb+ biggest concern I said in the near-term North Korea in the long term the Ayatollah with a nuclear weapon in a rhyme we're watching Fox News the TV is about as big as this stage I swear to God as soon as US that North Korea missiles came across the screen saying North Korea he leaned forward I said that's old tape that's an old tape he doesn't want to go to war he wants to work with everybody but let me tell you that you have a commander-in-chief is not going to let this country be walked over any more to that no job in North Korea you better listen to Trump so the Ayatollah you better understand that we're out to get a better deal I am so excited about the next years to come to put judges on the court that will change the law in a positive way for decades to fire all the Obama holdovers are running the federal government to create a sense if you work hard you don't get rewarded for it we've replaced a community organizer with a builder god bless america [Applause] you

well good afternoon everyone we're here today to talk about the keystone pipeline and the real leaders on this issue have been senator hoeven thune barrasso and murkowski so let me tell you why i'm here if the american people uh give us the opportunity to be in the majority next year i'll be setting the agenda in consultation with my colleagues or as i say to audiences i've enjoyed being the defensive coordinator but it's easier to score if you're on offense and the majority leader of the senate is the offensive coordinator so i can tell you if we have a new majority next year and a new majority leader the keystone pipeline will be voted on on the floor of the senate something the current majority has been avoiding for literally years and i think the reason they've been avoiding it for years is because they're afraid that it might pass with a broad bipartisan coalition with that let me turn it over to senator hoeven thank you leader appreciate very much you leading off this press conference and you know we're here today because tomorrow is the sixth anniversary of the application for the keystone xl pipeline so six years ago 2008 september 19 2008 the trans-canada company applied for approval of a pipeline and and this actually isn't the keystone pipeline it's the keystone xl in other words they had just built the keystone pipeline now they applied for approval of that in 2006 got approval in 2008 started construction 2008 built in 2010. so in 2008 when they asked to build a sister pipeline seems like a no-brainer they're going to get approval right but here we are six years later we still don't have approval and uh the president came to our caucus we had a meeting right here in the capitol uh last year president said he would make a decision by the end of 2013 i think senator brossel is going to talk about that a little bit yet here we are still no decision so we have a letter from all 45 members of our caucus every single republican senator has signed on to this letter once again asking the president saying hey you told us you'd have a decision here by the end of last year we're not the sixth anniversary no decision uh we'd like a decision we'd certainly like a response as to what you're going to do after six years you could tell the american people what you're going to do on something that's a vital infrastructure project and for those that think that somehow it's an environmental issue take a look at i know it's detailed but take a look at the chart on my far right five environmental impact statements five no significant environmental impact five of them what's he going i mean do we have to have ten what's going on i mean what about following the rule of law in this thing right i mean it's just uh absolutely unbelievable five environmental impacts no significant uh five environmental impact statements all of them finding no environ environmental impact and so what do we see these are the these are the uh segments of the pipeline millions and millions of dollars of pipeline stacked up in my state so we can build the pipeline actually this is the south dakota segment senator thune can tell you all about that but he's he's waiting to get a few people employed and some significant tax revenue generated from those all that pipeline that's stacked up in my state and has been for almost six years it's about energy it's about jobs it's about growing our economy it's about tax revenue without raising taxes right it's about national security you want to talk about the national security implement the implications uh for just a minute we're working on a resolution today to deal with isil right and we're getting oil from the middle east instead of canada really the administration wants to make an argument that we should continue to get oil from the middle east instead of canada think about the resolution that we're passing today isil is getting its revenue by selling oil and here we sit six years later well i think what's going to happen i really do i mean we may not get an answer now to this letter signed by every single republican addressed to the president on something he told us that he would do but i think as with all things the american people will decide this issue we have 57 senators that are strong in support of this project a strong bipartisan majority 57 and remember this is not just to move oil from canada but from my state from montana as well light sweet block and crude we have 57 votes for this project today bipartisan this thing has been bipartisan all the way through and i i strongly believe that next year we'll have the votes we'll have the 60 we need to pass this project and so ultimately the american people will speak on this they will speak over the special interests that are holding it up and we'll have the 60 votes and you know then we'll need to attach it to something that the president can't veto and that's what we'll do uh

mr. Hoyer we're delighted that you're here at the Chum strike well does that improve it or now you can hear me and perhaps you wanted to move the mic away you know I love to tell the story Paul sarbanes was speaking to a group of about 400 people and the guy in the back of the room raised his hand said senator I can't hear you immediately a guy in the front row said I can and I'll trade places with you anytime you want me to ship them Mike doctor I'll do it mr. Hoyer do you remember the story about President Lyndon Johnson who was in a meeting and bill Moyer was giving the prayer this has reported I was not there and bill Moyer was praying and the president said speak up I can't hear you bill said mr. president I wasn't speaking to you I won't go into what he thought been in the president Chanukah just came to a close we are four days from Christmas and we are nine days from the end of the year and much of the work that this Congress needs to do is undone and so we find ourselves some 24 36 hours from shutting down our government and until late last night perhaps early this morning we on our side had no idea of exactly what was going to be proposed we're now here at the Rules Committee at 8 a.m. in the morning to decide what we're going to do this afternoon and we have not been included in the discussions and that's unfortunate clearly we need to address many issues leader Pelosi is we have not passed a single appropriation bill to the prize in the United States we're not in control of anything not a single appropriation bill that's going to the president United States not one yes we pass them through the house matter of fact all of them through the house but the Republican leader did not put a single one of them on the Senate floor so we find ourselves not only with no appropriation bills funded but we also find ourselves with no agreement on the levels of spending that we will address the caps we've been urging to come to an agreement and we had an agreement under Ryan Murray for years in a row it said we've been at parity parity seems pretty simple two plus two two and two or whatever number is chosen is parity but we've been unable to reach an agreement so we find ourselves here with not only no appropriation bills done but no guidance to the appropriation committee at what level they should fund their legislation here to make an agreement so we find ourselves again with less than 48 hours left to go we voted for a CR overwhelmingly it was a no-drama CR in the middle of September which allowed us to have 90 days in which to resolve the issues that confronted us and frankly the only thing was considered was a tax bill which we think is a disaster you think is a bill spur to the economy we have a difference of opinion on that but that's what we spent our time on we did not resolve any of the substantive issues in that 90 days and so we had another CR two weeks ago we didn't vote for it because we thought correctly the only thing that was going to be paid attention to was the tax bill and none of the issues but which you voted for a CR you've got 90 of your people back and because they thought it was just two weeks that it wouldn't really damage defense as much as they thought it would in September when they voted against it 90 of your colleagues CR would not have passed that 90 days we would had a crisis in September had Democrats not stepped up to the bar and said okay let's work together let's get these issues resolved we didn't do that you spent all your time on your tax bill the previous ten months you spent most of your time on repealing the Affordable Care Act and taking health care away from millions of people so we have some very significant policy difference but we need to come to agreement and we have no confidence that any extension is going to get us to further agreement mr. Kaul mr. Pelosi we served on the Appropriations Committee we came to agreements but we have come to no agreements and once again we find ourselves the can down the road we're not going to tell defense what money they'll have for the next nine months eight months we're not going to tell the Department of Energy or their labor health Human Services Department of State Department of Commerce or other departments of governments and agencies we're not going to tell them how they can plan for the next nine months any business that did that would go bankrupt in a short period of time it is a terrible way to run the government of the United States or any other enterprise and soon we find ourselves here no closer to agreement frankly than we have been in the first eleven months and I have had discussions with your majority leader our majority leader with whom I deal in a constructive way on many issues and I told him that there were a number of issues that we felt were necessary in order for us to participate in helping the majority party which is extraordinary difficulty running this government you're a deeply divided party we saw that last night on the floor of the House of Representative those differences in the last 24 hours or not but it is clear that without our participation in September you would not have passed to see our government would have shutdown but we hope during that time we would have had some ability to work together I told the majority leader as long ago as August that the DREAM Act had to be resolved President took an action in September that your speaker urged him not to do as a result it put at risk some 800,000 really 1.6 million young people who've grown up in America who believe America is their country and going to elementary school junior high school in high school have worked and jobs have gone to school have served in our military and they're twisting in the wind rush limbaugh said we're not going to send those kids home we've said we're not going to send those kids home the president the United States says he loves the dreamers there is no excuse for us not having put a bill on the floor to resolve this issue over 300 members of the Congress of the United States will vote on that when you put it on the floor so the only reason it's not on the floor because the leadership has refused to do so that was very important to us and I've talked to the leader over and over again I've raised it in colloquy over and over over again opioids which the leader has spoken up a choice we should have resolved that bill Perkins loan program we should have resolved that issue community health centers we should have resolved that issue Medicare extenders we should have resolved that issue fire grants we should have resolved and yes the dreamers as well but here we find ourselves less than 48 hours before the end of the year or before the end of the the current CR and nothing has been resolved no discussions haven't led to resolution of these issues everybody's reading their their phones perhaps what I'm saying it's not relevant but on our side we feel it's relevant and you have needed our votes almost every fiscal issue that has passed this house because so many of your members you have over 218 you could pass anything on your own and you pass the tax bill on your own so when you want to pass things on your own you create consensus to do so but on almost every fiscal issue I'm one fiscal issue that John Boehner mr. McCarthy and mr. Scalise asked you to vote on actually I guess it was mr. Boehner mr. Kane or mr. McCarthy you've got eighty four votes to join the three of them in order to keep the government open and over 125 of your members voted no not to keep the government open and the director of OMB voted not to open up the government when you shut it down for 16 days so I come before the committee saying if you're going to offer a rule that is going to make in order some amendments or some alternatives if you expect our help you ought to put in things that we think are important and will have a significant number of Republicans voting with us including I presume many of you I don't know that so I come before you saying you have 36 hours to keep the government open we don't have the votes to keep the government open we don't have the gum the votes to shut it down and the American people you responsibility to do that and if you've got the votes you don't have to talk to us but if you don't have the votes we really need to come together in a bipartisan way to be the responsible stewards of this government so I would urge you to include initially an amendment which says that those dreamers will no longer be twisting in the wind and that we will give them the assurances that the president United States says he will sign to give them this is not a question would president I say say oh my veto that bill he said he would sign the bill he set it to leader Pelosi and leader Schumer and he said it to the world so we think that needs to be in there we think we need to deal with the VA we think we'll need to deal with FISA but we need to deal with them in a constructive bipartisan way and if we don't don't look to us for help because we're not included we're shut out as the tax bill no hearings no witnesses and a conference that was a fraud the only thing Democrats did in that tax conference was able to make a statement no amendments no suggestions that's not regular order but much more than that's not fair it's not what the American people expect of us so I come to you asking for certainly that amendment I ask as well because I understand you're considering the Supplemental your tax bill and the supplemental bill undermines ortho Rico 3.5 million 3.6 million Americans as well as the Virgin Islands they still have 35 percent of people in Puerto Rico without electricity if 35 percent of the people in Houston without electricity it would be a national scandal you would all outraged you would not allow it to happen and the tax bill treats but the RICO as a foreign government they are Americans fully a part of the United States of America if they Florida or anyplace else they come why because they're Americans so we believe this supplemental and also needs to be revised in a way that treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as full partners of the United States America not as foreign governments so I thank you mr. chairman for this opportunity I would ask that I submit a Dear Colleague which has been sent by Tim Walz two colleagues expressing his deep concern about the extension of the VA choice Act which he thinks will undermine the VA because it's not a full bill dealing with the needs of the VA and veterans access to health care doctors beds etc and asked mr. chairman did that be included in the record at this time and last and closing I would say I really do believe we can do some very good work if we do it in a bipartisan way and will I have to give something yes will you have to give something yes that's the democratic process we are not pursuing that and that's why we find ourselves in this conundrum 36 hours before the government is going to shut down Thank You mr. chairman objection anything chilling a bride will be in her rectum I appreciate the gentleman for his not only comments but for his time this morning to come before the Rules Committee

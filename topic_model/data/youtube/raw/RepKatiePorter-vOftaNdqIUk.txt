mr gonzalez you're the ceo of abv which makes the cancer drug imbruvica do you know what the annual price of imbruvica was for a patient taking the standard three pills per day in 2013. a hundred and thirty thousand dollars okay we had ninety nine thousand seven hundred and sixty six what about today for those same three pills uh i think it's 169 000. we have 181 but we can agree that there was a significant increase roughly in a matter of eight years abby more than doubled the price now mr gonzalez how much money did abv put directly into the research and development costs of imbruvica before it hit the market in 2013. we acquired in bruvica when uh when it was launched so it would have been the uh the company that we acquired so we're cleaning itself didn't spend any money to create a mobiket it was invented by a smaller company pharmacy clicks which you later acquired correct we paid 21 billion for the company correct it was expensive to acquire them so you paid fair market value for pharmacy clicks but abby then doubled the price presumably justified by its 2.45 billion dollar investment in r d are there fewer side effects for patients now than there were in 2013 we developed significant indications and expansions and other disease studies are there fewer side effects sir uh no it has the same side effect profile mr gonzalez do people need less of this medicine in brevika to treat lymphoma now uh no so abbvie took zero risk to develop this drug you bought it approved for the market knowing it would be profitable you hiked the price to pay for r d but you haven't made the drug any better even as you doubled the cost i wrote an entire report on what is essentially the improvica story big pharma gobbles up a small innovative company does nothing to improve the drug but jacks up the price now you told us that you spent 2.5 billion dollars for r d for umbreovica even though the drug didn't get any better really it was all for these innovations and indications which are designed to keep competitors off the market and find new sales opportunities so i want to look at what other money abby spends doing its business you filed 165 patents from bruvica you found patents for humera other drugs to keep competitors off the market how much did you spend on litigation and settlements from 2013 to 2018 arizona let me correct one thing that you i think you just said uh and it is not true that we didn't invest in additional indications and additional diseases as an example we received approval after the development work of uh graf versus host disease we also proclaiming my time mr gonzalez how much did you spend did abby spend on litigation and settlements from 2013 to 2018. uh i i don't have that number off and we'll be happy to give it to you okay 1.6 billion dollars 2.45 billion on r d 1.6 billion in litigation and settlements what about marketing and advertising how much does avi spend on that uh well marketing and advertising we spend about four billion dollars a year yep 4.7 1 billion how about executive compensation 2013 to 2018. 2013 and 2018 it's probably on average about 60 million dollars a year try 334 on for size now how much did avi spend on stock buybacks and shareholders start stock buybacks and dividends to enrich your shareholders from 2013 to 2018. well stock buybacks if you actually look at just poor stock buybacks it would be about 13 billion dollars stock buybacks and dividends is the question sir uh dividends that have to come back with a number for that over that period of time 50 billion dollars so mr gonzalez you're spending all this money to make sure you make money rather than spending money to invest in develop drugs and help patients with affordable life-saving drugs you lie to patients when you charge them twice as much for an unimproved drug and then you lie to policy makers when you tell us that r d justifies those price increases the big pharma fairy tale is one of groundbreaking r d that justifies astronomical prices but the pharma reality is that you spend most of your company's money making money for yourself and your shareholders and the fact that you're not honest about this with patients and with policy makers that you're feeding us lies that we must pay astronomical prices to get innovative treatments is false the american people the patients deserve so much better i yield back

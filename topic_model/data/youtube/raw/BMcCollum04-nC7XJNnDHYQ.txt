I am so pleased to be here with Minnesota's strong thriving Tibetan community I wish to thank the Tibetan American Foundation of Minnesota for inviting me to join you this morning only one month ago in May I was in India as part of an official delegation led by the Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi my colleagues and I were humbled to receive a very warm and gracious welcome by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and I will add a delicious lunch your holiness it was a very special visit so today your holiness is our honor to welcome you to Minnesota your presence and your blessing is an inspiration for all of us please accept my offer of strong support for the Tibetans in Minnesota and across the US for the Tibetan community in Nepal and all Tibetans living in exile the refugee experience being forced from one's homeland fleeing violence persecution it's a journey of loss and pain and great suffering you never forget home but now you have a second home and together we must make this home in America one a safety hope and opportunity I want this to be a home Minnesota to be home to be welcoming to your families a place where you have the freedom to maintain your culture practice your beliefs and sustain your rich traditions as Tibetans and I know firsthand the important contributions Tibetan Americans are making here in Minnesota and I'm grateful your community your community makes Minnesota a stronger and a better state it was in 2015 [Music] it was in 2015 when I was in Tibet your homeland I experienced the mountains the thin air in my lungs the warmth the Tibetan people that I met but there was also a very heavy burden there the people of Tibet are not free to practice their religion so today let us focus our minds our hearts and our prayers for freedom of religion for the people of Tibet it's long past time for China's repression for Tibetans to be able to practice their freedom of religion in must end human rights abuses must stop prisoners of conscience must be set free and the destruction of Tibetan culture the repression of monks and scholars also must stop and I will share with you why I am saying this and why I feel so passionate about it two weeks ago I received a letter from Chinese Consul General in Chicago asking me to quote refrain from any contact with the Dalai Lama in any form the letter call today is gathering a platform for a separate ation spot there is no plot there's only a path a piece and it passed a dialogue that is holding the Sikhs and that we see [Applause] so as a member of Congress who represents many of you and all of you here from Minnesota I urge the Congress and the President of the United States to stand with the people of Tibet promote Human Rights religious freedom in a meaningful dialogue China is a powerful country but the United States is a free and powerful country the United States must never ban abandon our commitment to freedom justice and human rights around the world and we must never never abandon the people of Tibet so let me close by telling you when I go back to Washington I will be working in the Congress to continue u.s. funding for all Tibetan programs scholarships and assistance for Refugees I will work to pass HR 1872 reciprocal access to de button act of 2017 and I'm also going to urge President Trump to meet directly with his holy lens Dalai Lama and to listen to his wise and compassionate insights mr. Trump needs to hear my ongoing support from the u.s. to Tibet it's vital the teachings of his holiness are not only wise they are in the best interest of the United States and all of mankind as a Dalai Lama teaches us let us learn to love our planet better to work to stop climate change let us welcome refugees who flee violence whether they're Buddhists Christians or Muslims let us open our hearts to the poor and the vulnerable and our own communities around the world Minnesota we are blessed by you at being our Tibetan brothers and sisters and today we are blessed by the teachings of His Holiness made peace together upon all of us as we follow this path together of love and compassion thank you [Applause]

hi everyone i'm honored to be with you this evening three years ago i attended my congressman's one and only public event of the year in saint charles illinois that night he made a promise to my community he said he would not vote to repeal health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions people like me my name is lauren underwood and i'm a registered nurse and public health expert who worked to implement the affordable care act so you know i was following this debate really closely two weeks after he made that promise to his constituents he went back on his word i knew our community deserved better representation in congress so i decided you know what it's on i'm running with the support of my community we unseated a four-term republican member of congress and a district formerly held by the republican speaker of the house i come before you today as the youngest black woman to ever serve in the congress and the first woman and first millennial to ever represent illinois beautiful 14th district i am one member of the youngest congress in a generation the most diverse congress in american history and let me tell you women's voices are the loudest boldest and most powerful coming out of our congress women are leading the way and are saving our democracy in congress it's women who are fighting for paid family leave and affordable child care women fighting for health care for our families women fighting for equal pay and women are fighting for our public school teachers and students these priorities have only become more urgent in the face of the coronavirus pandemic because these issues aren't just women's issues we're talking about our families our health and our communities this pandemic represents a once-in-a-generation crisis that will change our world forever but it's also a once-in-a-generation opportunity to catapult us into an economy and a health care system that works for everyone and i know that women will lead the way because it's women who are on the front lines of this pandemic think about our nurses our social workers our grocery store clerks our front-line workers in this nation are women we have to remember even in good times working women face a staggering pay gap compared to every dollar earned by white men latina women earn 54 cents on the dollar native women earn 57 cents and black women earn 62 cents so because our republican colleagues in the senate have refused to come to the negotiating table for another coronavirus relief bill it's working women and their families who are facing the consequences and let's be clear the consequences that we're talking about are life and death women need us to step up and fight for their families their health and their livelihoods and they need us now i'm here today because of the women who came before me congresswoman jeannette rankin a woman elected to congress four years before women received the constitutional right to vote was instrumental in passing the 19th amendment 100 years ago i were white in honor of her work congresswoman shirley chisholm a personal hero of mine showed us all how to lead fearlessly the first black congresswoman in our history unbought and unbossed senator carol mosley braun the first black woman ever elected to the senate as a child it was striking to see my senator look like me every single day i see women like shannon watts agent pooh brittany pachnet and laurella pirelli doing the work leading us to a more perfect union and listen i know we call it obamacare but we would not have the affordable care act without our fearless leader speaker nancy pelosi my family always taught me that courage was grounded and choosing to act courage is choosing to start that business you always dreamed of it's knowing that just because it hasn't been done before doesn't mean that you can't do it for me courage was stepping into my congressional race as a 30 year old black woman with a full-time job with the certainty that my community deserved better representation in congress and the belief that i could offer it during that campaign i heard from families in my community who desperately needed help i heard from people who had to rash in insulin and other prescription drugs due to high cost so i wrote the lower insulin cost now act which was signed into law by the president to make certain that no parent has to worry about how they would pay for their child's insulin and it's not just that prescription drugs are too expensive it's that premiums and doctors visits and co-payments are too expensive there are families in the 14th district who are spending 25 percent of their income on health care premiums so i wrote the health care affordability act and i know our future president joe biden will help me push that legislation across the finish line i also decided to take on a project that's deeply personal to me in illinois women who look like me are six times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related complication than white women 72 percent of those deaths are preventable the united states it has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world and it's only getting worse as a registered nurse i knew i could make a difference so i teamed up with a colleague from north carolina dr alma adams to co-found the black maternal health caucus and save moms lives in march congresswoman adams and i along with our future vice president and my friend senator kamala harris introduced the black maternal health mommy bus act of 2020 comprehensive legislation to address this health crisis look at what can happen when we have real representation in the congress and even though we represent more than half of the u.s population women only represent a quarter less than a quarter of the united states congress but i know that we're going to have more women join us come november ladies this is the most important election of our lifetime so here's the deal i know that we are always chatting with our girlfriends about the best books to read or shows to stream but this year we've got to check in with everyone to make sure that we know what's on the ballot this fall our democracy our health care our reproductive freedom it's all on the line and it's on us to send two champions to the white house for women and working families i'm talking about vice president joe biden and senator kamala harris girlfriends it's time men it's time i'm calling on you to make a plan to vote and join us in the work to restore our democracy friends it's on thank you

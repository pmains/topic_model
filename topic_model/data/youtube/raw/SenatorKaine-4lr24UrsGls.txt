the thing they worry about is not the inspection of existing sites they worry about the covert that's what you use them and that is frankly the worry because there's existing sites that are the uranium sites there was the existing site which was the heavy water plutonium reactor under construction but all of us believe look if Iran were to try to break toward a nuclear weapon they're not going to do it at the existing sites that are being inspected where we already have good Intel about what's going on there they're going to do it in a covert program and so it was very important as the White House said from the start to try to cut off a path under all these you know under the uranium path under the plutonium path but especially under the covert path the inspections regime sort of as it is described in the talking points now we're going through the agreement to see if it matches the talking points is an inspections regime that can go anywhere it can't go anywhere immediately and that's going to be the subject of a lot of analysis you heard the Supreme Leader say a few weeks ago no way they're going to go into Iranian military facilities well if they had if they had kept that up then the deal would have been completely falling apart because it's a non-starter so now under the deal there is the possibility to do inspections anywhere but you have to give some advance notice if the Iranians object there is a there's a committee that's basically the p5 plus one that has to say okay we agree or we don't agree and what is being reported is that process from we want to inspect going in could take as much as 24 days we need to ask the experts what does that mean does that mean that in 24 days they could you know clean up evidence that there was nuclear material and and completely obscure it or we'll experts say no nuclear material leaves a footprint with a half-life of a billion years or so if they were using nuclear material in any site and you got in 24 days later you would definitely know whether they were trying to do something contrary to the agreement so these are the kinds of technical details that we really have to dig into in the committee and I again it the a good agreement is still good enough if the inspections regime is robust enough and so that's going to be where a lot of the focus will be here's what it sounds like to me from you that you have heard what the administration has said during the process of reading it if after reading it it delivers what the administration says you'd be inclined to support it actually I'll put one more caveat on it you're close and here's what I said when the April to framework was announced that had many of these components and at the concessions were given up ninety-eight percent of enriched uranium two-thirds of centrifuges when it was announced I said if there is a final deal that is an essential match for that framework and if there is an inspections regime that is robust enough to make sure that those commitments can be verified then yes I think this could be in the best interest of America's national security so there are two things that I'm doing right now I'm going through the hundred plus pages in the appendices to determine whether the details match the talking points and I'm doing independent work as are all my colleagues to determine whether the inspections regime is sufficient that the commitments will in fact be verified those are the two questions that I'm digging into do you believe that their members of Congress who now are inclined not to support this but seeing the evidence as described by the president because the president firmly believes this will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon do you believe that people are prepared to listen to the testimony listen to the administration listen to the experts and vote for this that's a possibility yeah very very good question and my answer is I sure hope so because I would hate to think that on a matter this important people made a snap judgment or a snap pronouncement before they even read the deal and they're uninterested in the details and my one bit of evidence that gives me some hope that that may be true is you saw a whole lot of members of Congress come out against the interim negotiation when it started in November of 20 2013 and again some of the quotes a historic mistake Iran got everything they wanted America lost in this a whole lot of people made those kind of statements right out of the gate who have subsequently said you know what actually the interim period was significantly better than what we had before we've had a series of hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee and I've asked every witness who's been before us Hawk dove and everything in between has this period of negotiation been significantly better than the status quo ante before the diplomacy started in November 2013 and without exception everybody has said yes because of the way the process was written do you expect it to be an agreement that will go into effect this is appropriate charlie it is it is appropriately deferential to the White House because remember the White House was taking the position we don't want to have any congressional review because the the sanction statutes themselves gave the president a unilateral unilateral ability to waive or suspend the sanctions and so the president said so I don't need a vote of Congress well those of us who thought that was wrong said you know what you might not under the existing sanction statute but we're going to pass a new law that gives you the ability to conduct diplomacy and get the best deal you can but that sets up an appropriate congressional review if you decide you want to waive or suspend sanctions so basically what we did is we put a hurdle in the president's place in we put a hurdle in the place of this deal that wasn't there before and and if the president gets over that hurdle then the deal will go forward now down the road remember what Iran ones finally is they want the correctional sanctions to be eliminated completely not just waived or suspended for that to happen Congress has to affirmative ly vote in both houses to dismantle the statute that will likely not be for some years down the road while we test their compliance just as there are some provisions in the deal that Iran doesn't have to implement for some years down the road as they test the compliance of the p5 plus 1 with respect to sanctions relief now senator Kaine thank you so much absolutely glad to be with you so Tim Kaine from Virginia back in a moment stay with us Paul

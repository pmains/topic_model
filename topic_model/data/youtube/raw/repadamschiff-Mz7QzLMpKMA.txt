by intelligence committee chairman congressman Adam Schiff who is also a member of the January 6 committee Congressman Schiff thank you for joining us I want to begin with the news overnight that Donald Trump has been reinstated by Elon Musk on Twitter watching the January 6 committee hearings Trump's tweets were a big part of the story to be told what do you think of him being back on Twitter I think it's a terrible mistake and you're absolutely right as we showed in the January 6 hearings the president used that platform to incite that attack on the capitol his comments about the vice president his own vice president put Mike Pence's life in danger he showed no remorse about that he continues to lie about to his actions on that day he talks about pardoning the people who attacked police officers and attacked the capitol that day and it contradicts what Elon Musk said that he was going to establish a council to evaluate this and and further contradicts uh musk and his claimed concern about bots on his own platform uh to subject the decision to a poll in a platform that could be easily abused that way it just underscores the the erratic leadership of Twitter now under musk but also the security concerns uh with security people fleeing Twitter and what that means for the protection of Americans private data they did it with that snap poll and even then the vote was 52-48 uh close but let me move on to the Merrick Garland's decision to appoint a special counsel uh is this the right move I think it is the right move you make a decision like this not because you think you're going to persuade the former president you're doing the right thing or even his most extreme supporters uh you do they're still going to say it's political they're still going to say it but but it's the right thing to do and and most particularly if you ensure that it won't cause any delay so if the same prosecutors that have been investigating the former president and others can be moved onto the special uh prosecutors team then there's every reason to do it no reason not to do it um and and I think the person he's chosen seems to be Emily capable and qualified my concern frankly has been leading up to this point which is they were very slow at the department to work up the multiple lines of effort to overturn the election it took them a long time to get started and the delay has already been baked in I hope that the special prosecutor will move with alacrity and fulfill the commitment Mark Garland made at the outside it which is that everyone will be treated equally under the law and that includes the former president because I mean the timing is extraordinary you really could have if he gets indicted a trial and a presidential campaign happening at the same time you could uh and you know look for four years when he was president the department took the position which I think is flawed as a constitutional matter that you can't indict a sitting president you can't now take the position well you also can't indict a former president who wants to run again otherwise that President becomes above the law and the founders would have never subscribed to that idea what does this mean about the January 6 committee's deliberations about a criminal referral will you will you be making a criminal referral or referrals you know we're in the midst of reaching a conclusion on that right now should we make referrals what kind of Med referrals should we make I don't want to get ahead of that decision but I can't say that I think judge Carter in California who analyzed just one small piece of this concluded that the former president and others were engaged or there was evidence they were engaged in a criminal conspiracy evidence they were engaged in an effort to stop an official preceding The Joint session I think the evidence is there to make a referral and we just have to decide whether that's of course we're going to take Trump has said that he won't partake in the investigation I don't really know what that means but he's already defied the January 6 committee and your subpoenas will he before this lame duck is done will he be held in contempt of congress for that we're discussing that we have very limited options and and even where we have held people in contempt we're only batting 50 percent with the justice department and are willing to willingness to enforce it but once again Donald Trump took the Cowardly way out unlike other presidents that have fulfilled their Duty even after office and testified before Congress very not surprising with the former president it was disappointing with the former vice president who like others before himself sadly said I can't share this information with the American people and Congress but I can write a book about it that's very disappointing so obviously we have the Republicans winning back control barely of of the house one of the things that Kevin McCarthy has said is that he's going to strip you of your uh position on the house intelligence committee well I suspect he will do whatever Marjorie Taylor green wants him to do he's a very weak leader of his conference meaning that he will adhere to the wishes of the lowest common denominator and if that lowest common denominator wants to remove people from committees that's what they'll do it's going to be chaos with the Republican leadership and sadly the the kind of the crazy caucus has grown among the Republicans many Republicans who won primaries and deeply red districts are coming to Congress like the Marjorie Taylor greens and the Paul gosars in moderate districts I mean it's going to be harder because too much in One Direction he's going to have to worry about the other direction one of the other things that Republicans are saying is they're going to launch all matter of Investigations Hunter Biden Anthony fauci the Border Etc et cetera et cetera you were harshly critical of the Trump White House and Donald Trump himself for defying Congressional subpoenas not cooperating with congressional oversight what's your advice to the Biden Administration should they comply with subpoenas and and cooperate with oversight from this Congress they should cooperate with the appropriate oversight they should follow the law and that means complying with subpoenas but they're going to need to analyze whether the Republicans are following appropriate procedures and whether they're doing this just for vexatious purposes and I don't envy the tasks they're going to have but we continue to cooperate they should they should cooperate with appropriate oversight I think they will cooperate with appropriate oversight but we continually face A variation of the same question which is um should should the Democrats do the right do the appropriate thing when Republicans have consistently refused to I think we maintain The High Ground we follow the law we follow our responsibilities under separation of powers uh but uh but that doesn't uh detract at all from the abuse that we saw during the the uh Republican Administration so I I want to ask you you're on the Intel committee you you've you've spoken out strongly about against Saudi Arabia and uh and their and their leader Muhammad bin uh Solomon's claim uh you know uh the actions regarding Jamal khashoggi as implications in that murder now we've seen the Biden Administration say that he has immunity while he is effectively the the head of state uh for Saudi Arabia I want to read something that Fred Ryan of the Washington Post said in reacting to that in granting legal immunity to Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman President Biden is failing to uphold America's most cherished value he is granting license to Kill to one of the world's most egregious human rights abusers who is responsible for the cold-blooded murder of Jamal khashoggi what do you think of that movie I don't support the granting of immunity this is a guy who was involved in the murder and dismemberment of a person residing in the United States of America a journalist and you know we we ought to put our value on life not oil and I think this is a tragic decision I don't think it was a necessary decision they clearly in Saudi Arabia contrived to put him in the position of prime minister days before this court decision to get this we didn't have to go along with it and it's it's antithetical to our values and finally before you go today is Joe Biden's 80th birthday do you think he should run for reelection uh I think he should I think he's extremely capable what he's been able to do in the last two years is an unprecedented level of accomplishment if he wants to continue I'm for him all right Adam Schiff thank you for joining us here on this week on Friday I sat down with former speaker of the house and former vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan for his first Sunday Show interview since he

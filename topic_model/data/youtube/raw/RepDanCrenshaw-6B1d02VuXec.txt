we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back everybody this is a great episode we have in store for you and i don't think my guest needs a really big introduction who's the former secretary of state mike pompeo uh mr secretary thank you so much for being on this really great show dan it's great to be with you thanks for having me i'll have a good time today and hopefully be informative too i i think it will um i uh you know well look like everybody in the trump administration you were derided by the left-wing media as as i think the new york times called you the worst secretary of state ever um but as you have said you should take that with a badge of honor um because you know what they say that about everybody and it's also just not the case it's it's it's really i mean i think one of the big the forgotten and unappreciated moments of the trump presidency and you had just so much to do with this was was the wins on foreign policy and and and you were you were the architect of that and that's what we want to talk about today in our limited time um now but i do want to give people some background on you um because everybody knows you as secretary of state but uh you were also uh you went to the u.s military academy at west point you were an armored cavalry officer as well which is you know that's fine that's fine it's not it's okay it's not we could forgive you yeah um you know you were you were uh you were in the house before you were tagged by president trump to be director of the cia uh that's a fascinating thing too i'd love to talk about but um and then of course you wanted to be went on to be secretary of state and uh did a fantastic job there so um there's a few things we want to talk about today uh one one is what's going on in iran uh new president's elected i don't think a lot of people are following that uh i definitely want to ask you about china and how we should be thinking about our strategy over the next five years over the next 50 years towards china and um but i also want to actually start with what it's like because this is this is probably something you're not asked that often what is it like to be secretary of state what do you go in the office doing every day is it just like madam secretary are you like tio leone so just give us an overview i mean tell us tell us what it was like what was the first day like yeah my politics are a little different than hers too so lots of lots of things that are different i think uh you know dana i had i had seen it a little bit so it wasn't brand new to me in the sense of by the time i became secretary of state i had been the cia director so i've been part of the trump national security team for a year and a half at this point and before that i i'd been in congress like like you are today so i had a chance to interact with diplomats foreign service officers state department officials so i had a little sense of it but there's nothing like showing up it is a it is a workforce that amounts to almost 70 000 people uh 180 plus countries around the world uh three workforces three unions inside the building so there are there right so every day that you're in washington i would show up early i would read the intelligence materials that had been prepared and then it was on to a briefing on the the things that were of the moment the crisis of the day if you will and then i always had time in in every day to work on the things that were really a priority for president trump pushing back and confronting beginning to develop a strategy for the next decade to push back against the chinese communist party we worked hard on reducing our middle east profile and getting getting greater peace there it resulted ultimately in some good outcomes with abraham accords but but our understanding of the middle east and how we were going to approach it was very different than previous previous administrations as well we focused on religious freedom there were just a bunch of things that we worked on and so you know you have a big team you have a big staff around you it is easy to become isolated and i worked every day to make sure i was down talking to everybody throughout the building so i understood really what the pulse of and the capability of the team was to deliver for the president and i definitely want to talk about abraham accords i think again under appreciated uh win for for the administration and you personally so but i want to one one question that's burning for me though is look i know full well i mean i went i did my master's degree in at harvard at the kennedy school i went to tufts these this is the kind of graduates that go into the state department and they don't like me and they don't like you you know they don't like my politics so so i mean this this gets to a broader question about you know the so-called i don't like the word deep state i don't i don't it does you know but but it does there is something to it in the sense that look there's political bias amongst especially political appointees could we have done a better job of flushing out at least political appointees and and how do we how do we fix that problem with the political bias in a lot of our institutions in federal government again and you nailed it important problem something i'm going to continue to work on and i have an idea for something i might write about this too it was the case the state department is absolutely an organization that is filled with you describe the people right and they they come from georgetown they come from from sice it's on hopkins they come from tufts these are people that not don't share your and my world view these are people who are left of center or further with with exceptions but the the workforce itself is a status workforce right these are career government officials and they were it's not that there weren't great people there absolutely were but boy the resistor especially when someone comes in like president trump who has who doesn't come from government who says well let's go try something that is different or unique the the the the weight of the the flywheel to get it spun up to actually take bold action is enormously difficult i have a number of ideas about how we could respond to this you hit on one of them we were slow to get our team on the field we were slow to identify political appointees get them get them vetted get them ready get them through the senate confirmation process and get them out to the field to do their work it took us way too long not just at the state department but all across the united states government those are the people that that can translate what the president the constitutional elected leader of the united states is trying to achieve on behalf of the american people the mandate that he received and when you don't have those people when they're not in position all throughout the government then then those who've just been there 20 or 30 years who who may well be fine people will move on the agenda that's the one they've been working on or the one that they care about and not the one that the people elected the president to achieve yeah and that gets to you know conversation about the the abraham accords um you know john kerry famously said you can't have peace in the middle east without it we'll only do his voice you can't have peace in the middle east without a diploma or whatever and it's kind of his face kind of melts off as he says it and that's pretty good i gave you a b plus that's pretty good yeah it was more like a b minus it's not my best anyway but it it really that quote is so indicative of of the foreign policy blob of washington d.c um that that group thing that had occurred and i definitely saw it in grad school i saw it i did international relations um as an undergrad too there's certainly a way of thinking about about things and um to walk us through one i guess the resistance to those ideas and and also walk us through how much of the abraham accords was sort of orchestrated by the administration how much of it was ongoing already sort of the natural culmination of things because i think i think there's a little bit of both yeah just walk us through how that went behind the scenes i mean the public just kind of knows it as israel struck these great peace deals with all these arab countries and it just happened as you know i i wish it were so uh shoot you know your point about the conditions having to be right i think is true i think we i think the world and the gulf states had seen for you know 40 years or so maybe 50 that the palestinians weren't prepared to accept any deal we know they rejected multiple deals that were pretty darn good deals for them that would have made life better for the palestinian people so i think that that baseline existed but what in the end it took it took american leadership to begin to shape how those countries were prepared to take the risk right the risk was the one john kerry identified wrongly was that there'd be riots in the streets that there'd be that we'd have problems at our embassy if we did something like move the embassy we'd have problems in islamabad in in indonesia wherever there were large uh muslim populations they'd rise up well that was false and we we concluded that we could manage that risk and do a good turn for the middle east and so we built that three pillars uh what one was just the unambiguous support of israel so we recognize the goal on heights is the rightful property i made a uh a legal announcement that said basically israel's not an occupying nation uh we we moved the embassy we did all the right things to make sure that the israelis knew that they had a good american partner second the primary malign influence in the region is the republic the regime the theocracy of iran whether you go to syria where six million people have been displaced or you have houthis firing missiles into saudi arabia or hamas as we've seen recently firing rockets into israel those are all iranian-backed efforts it is iran that is the destabilizing force and we walked into a situation where obama and biden had signed up for this deal that was a pretty crappy deal frankly that really didn't prevent a nuclear weapon so we began to put pressure on the regime in iran with two goals one to convince them to change their behavior but in the absence of that which we knew was a tall mountain just deny them resources so they wouldn't have billions of dollars with which to create missile programs space programs high-tech cyber capabilities and ultimately a nuclear not only a nuclear weapon but a nuclear program so an enormous pressure campaign on iran those two things convinced the amazing leaders in bahrain and nbc woman they had in the emirates these are amazing leaders to say enough enough we're not going to have our primary foreign policy statement be the destruction of israel we're going to go partner with them they're great security partners they're great diplomatic partners who could they could fight they're going to find people they're jewish we're muslim we're going to figure out a way to make this go and we were over time being able to convince them and provide them sufficient confidence that together we could build out an understanding of how to create prosperity in the region and it was hard work it was remarkable it took lots of people on our side and great leadership from these countries sudan morocco as well to ultimately get us to a place where we have four countries recognize israel creating a better life and and last thing dan i'll say is we didn't neglect the palestinians we want them to the palestinian people have a good life too but when you have abu mazen as your leader and his primary motivating force is to steal and to loot and who's corrupt and who has no incentive to cut a deal to recognize israel then you have to move on you can't leave that well you can't let that be a precondition to having better life for people throughout the rest of the middle east well it's worth noting that and he's the better of two leaders and uh for the palestinians because the other one's just hamas yes that's right a terrorist a terrorist and a criminal so real quick uh did you have an opinion on the new leadership in uh in israel no i've i've known them a little bit although not as well as i know prime minister netanyahu i think all the changes for the us yeah it does it does in this sense look all israeli leaders across the political spectrum uh will will do the right thing to defend israel center mass but the question is when there's hard things that have to take place this is a government that has a coalition yeah that you got about 10 percent of the parliament supported naftali bennett who's the prime minister a very small minority of the knesset and you have leftist parties you have air parties part of the coalition that is going to make it hard to govern and more difficult for the united states when we want to work with israel to get a decision out of the process it's just complicated yeah so that will that will create real risk whether this government can can manage their way through this you know their only unifying force is they wanted netanyahu out everything else they disagree on that that's a tough way to govern you you've seen that it's strange could you imagine if we had a parliament like that in the united states it would be our founders chaos that one right yeah jeez um jcpoa can we talk about this which is the iran nuclear deal the the um just for for everybody um the bite administration is playing ftse with that again what are your thoughts on on how they're going to approach this dan i wish it was just what see yeah this is uh this has become an article of faith for the americans left it is uh and frankly for the european left as well and and i just i mean it can go on for a long time but just as a a matter of some people don't think about the chinese and the russians want that deal that should that should set off alarms yeah that doesn't mean we couldn't we should just because china and russia what's up doesn't mean we should reject it but man when they're both on that team you should you should wonder whether you've been walked into a trap look there's a deal the administration said secretary blinken said in his testimony when he was being confirmed he said we'll go we want to go back to a deal but we want it to be longer and stronger it appears the iranians have rejected that outright and the selection of abraham raci to run iran on saturday of this week makes clear they're not going to let longer and stronger it's going to be shorter and weaker right there's only nine years left on the major prohibitions on their nuclear weapons program imagine that imagine next week they announced they got a deal we have a big ceremony signing deal in geneva or wherever the heck they do it nine years in nine years iran will have a get out of jail free card on their nuclear program that is a blip in the moment of history this is this is not in the best interest of our friend and ally israel it's not in the best interest of the gulf states and a really bad thing for the united states of america i think that's absolutely right what a lot of people didn't realize was what what the iran nuclear deal did was ensure that we lost leverage in 10 to 15 years and you know what and you to to understand how that is do a simulation and have done this before where you you play the united states and you've got some of your you know somebody else playing iran and you look into the future 10 10 to 15 years when these deals expire and the united states wants to come back to the table because of course we do and renegotiate it and the iranians say why really why why would we we adhere to the deal and now we're good so stay out of our business and we have no leverage and in the meantime we've enriched them they've gained more influence over the region they've been on their ballistic missile program this entire time so they have more leverage and we have less and like you said in the grand in the grand scheme of things and then the span of history that's a blip and i don't understand and i like what you said about it's an article of faith because this is a common amongst a lot of policy issues with the left where they have a particular solution in mind and they're ideologically obsessed with it so for climate change it's like solar and wind right it can only the only way must be through solar and wind these unreliable energy sources it can't possibly be nuclear energy can't possibly be natural gas no and it's the same with the nuclear with the with iran too okay if the end goal is to not let them get a bomb well what other options do we have and and what's infuriating too is that they still play with this idea of a deal when it actually is clear that the maximum pressure campaign was effective deterrence is an effective language and especially in the middle east then we had deterrence for for four years we made clear to the iranians you touch an american you threaten something to our interests and it's going to be we're going to cost impose so qasim sulaimani was traveling from from beirut to damascus to baghdad he was trying to put together an arrangement to kill americans and we took him from the battlefield we sent a message to the iranians and by the way to chairman kim to xi xingping and to others america is going to defend the things it cares about we're not going to let you walk all over us those are this is basic this is this is a national security 101 right this administration just as they grab the wrong end of the stick they think if you appease the iranians because oh my goodness they're threatening to enrich to 70 percent uh no you you created the problem by permitting them to have the the centrifuges that can enrich in the first instance i remember secretary kerry back in 14 and 13 saying we're not going to let the iranians enrich but as soon as the iranians put pressure on the administration they caved and they gave them the capacity to enrich uranium in any nation that is like this regime that is intent on protecting their interest through their republican guards their authoritarian element you can't let them have nuclear capability if they do you'll you'll have a huge coercive capacity to your point 10 years from now in iran either with the weapon or on the cusp of that will be able to command the stage and and make no mistake too dan other coal states are watching this as well they are not going to let iran march down a path towards a nuclear weapon without responding so we risk a nuclear arms race in the region as a result of the jcpoa being rejoined as well it's just a great point i've been i've been i've been asked to explain that like why why would that why would the team biden think this makes sense and dan i often try to help people by understanding what the other side's argument is and you can often lay it out you just disagree or you have different priorities i cannot for the life of me understand how they think they're going to have leverage after they sign this deal to get them to stop their missile program or their uh maligned terror activities in the region it's well they they think differently they left off especially in foreign policy they often don't think in terms of leverage of incentives they think and they don't think in real politics they tend to think in in terms of hope and change i mean it was it was obama's mantra and but and i think that actually manifested into into foreign policy uh do talk a little bit about uh the solemnity strike he was uh one of america's drone strike recipients as we call them and uh um and and the less reaction to that the media's reaction to that this this i remember i was on the news quite a bit after that strike saying look this this was a good call but but they but they melted down over it and of course like many like in many many cases were proven wrong on it um can you give us any uh backstory on on how you guys came to that conclusion that that was the right thing to do and and then how you and how you dealt with the the political fallout which of course i think ended up being on the right side of we uh we were very patient with the iranians president trump was very patient with the iranians jill recalled they'd taken down an american uav it was an international air space the president ultimately chose not to respond they'd take some shots at our uh the embassy that i was responsible for in baghdad it harassed some of our folks in other parts of iraq and we responded but in a way that was tried to create clarity and deterrence but all the while knowing that the iranians were under enormous pressure right we destroyed their foreign exchange capability right they were down to 10 of the foreign exchange reserves they had when we began they were now i saw their leader on sunday announced that we took a hundred billion dollars in wealth away from them through the sanctions regime this was this was crippling to the regime and was allowing the iranian people a real chance to begin to protest and respond and against a weaker regime but we knew that that would mean that the iranians would lash out that there'd be some place that they would they would come uh make an effort to either distract from their problems at home or try to convince us that we needed to relieve the sanctions pressure because the cost would be too great on the united states or on israel we were having none of that we then we then began to prepare a set of responses for the leadership what were the kinds of things they could do how could we be sure that we could re-establish deterrence in the event that the iranians crossed the line we didn't want them to cross one of those options was to make sure that we could find iranian leadership wherever they were and prevent them from conducting an attack and we we came across that with respect to sullivan again you know the story of him right he was he was mythical in scale and size it's often the case we take down a terror leader and they replace them with the next guy and there's not much change in the in the capabilities of them to conduct terror operations uh solemnity was a different beast to be sure we we knew we knew he was special he was unique he was a general the irgc that had had truly become legendary within the force and within the iranian people and so we knew taking him down would be important not just from a tactical perspective stopping a particular set of plots he was working on but would have strategic implications as well as a result of that you should know lots of folks inside the bureaucracy says oh my goodness this will be world war iii the iranians will attack our ships they'll conduct assassination campaigns around the world we'll be off to the races with the iranians this will lead to kinetic warfare of an epic scale we we were convinced i was certainly convinced that that wouldn't be the case and president trump made the bull decision to uh take the work that we had done and respond to the iranians in this way we also combined it with diplomacy we made very clear to the iranians that this wasn't an effort to decapitate their regime was but was an effort to make clear that there were red lines for the united states of america and that determines re-establish deterrence and we had communications with them we communicated it through our friends and allies who talked to the iranians directly as well this is what we're doing this is why we're doing it this is this is why we undertook this trick they knew full well what he was up to so when we said we know what he was doing they said yeah they figured it out they knew what he was doing yeah uh so they knew they knew too it was a legitimate strike and so while they responded and there were some uh some of our service members who were injured in iraq as a result of their response it was pretty mild and very short-lived and they there was a warning too i mean i believe right they warned us through the iraqis i i think it should go down in history as a good case study and um in a you know a good operation um along these lines we have so limited time i really want to shift to china and um you know keep it broad i suppose at first but like i said our five year our five year plan with china our our 10-year plan our 50-year plan um you know a lot of the the issue and i'm going to divide this into two pillars here the economic war with china you know maybe war is a strong word but i certainly think they feel that way so maybe we should also look at it that way and then and then military capability that you know the the the rush to military dominance and i think the chinese are in this unique position well not unique everybody's in this position where all they have to do is worry about our weaknesses see our military has to worry about the global order we are the global order and i think we should remain that way but the chinese don't think that way they just they just need to build one missile that can take out a carrier and and that's that's a difficult problem to deal with with an aggressive rising regime um how should we think about this so dan you you you've been on the central challenge of our times the chinese communist party they you're pointing about war i think it's very fair if you just listen to xi jinping and the leaders around him they declared economic warfare on us a couple decades ago and we basically rolled over we basically followed the policy from 1972 of constructive engagement you talk about the washington blob this enormous political financial community that has deep roots in china and the relationship with china couldn't see that the leadership in china changed and changed its view and became aggressive and we sat on it the whole all of the west not just the united states europe too the australians the japanese south koreans everybody just kind of tolerated china we had exceptions for them and everything we did there was one set of rules for what the world and then we had the china exception president trump came in and said enough i'm not gonna let that happen anymore and so began to confront it economically with the trade policies and then we began to build a military that could respond in a way that would confront the chinese communist party without raising the risk that there would be an actual kinetic conflict and then i want to talk about the the space between those two so one piece is economic the other military in the space between them is what i'll call the tech sector the the information warfare space which has a commercial component and a military component we draw a sharps distinction between the two the chinese recognize no such thing and it gives them an enormous advantage anyone who's dealing with a chinese company should know that they are being touched by the chinese communist party there there is no separation between private sector and their military apparatus they are one and the same and that that has real connotations for how we think about five and 50 years for the united states we began to build out the architecture so getting our friends and allies to understand this threat as well right talking about the risk to our technology section from companies like zte and huawei and tencent and baidu talking about intellectual property theft and how we might respond to this in a way that for the first time actually preserved the good hard work that people do all across america to create and innovate and then we built out an alliance system that was preparing to work against the chinese communist party in a way that the world began to work against the soviet union back in the 1980s this is a very serious matter it will take a lot of thought and a lot of work across multiple administrations and i pray that this becomes bipartisan because it will take that much time and we'll need people all across the political spectrum to recognize this risk yeah it's strange because it's kind of bipartisan but for some reason it's it's not as much as it could be and so i mean what what should we be investing in is it is it more ships is it a bigger navy should we do we need to reimagine our capabilities the way that the way the chinese do um is it space force is is it is it is it looking to that next generation of military deterrence and next that next technological innovation that that puts the chinese in their place and stops them from from this kind of belligerent behavior i think the alliances are extremely important of course um you know is it is it is it more in the intelligence community i mean what how should or is it all of the above which is probably the answer it's it's likely all of the above and i'll leave the details to smarter minds than mine with respect to the actual military capabilities we need but you do have to reimagine what we're doing then for for 20 years now where i'm coming up on the 20th anniversary of 9 11. our military was focused centcom was the deal it got the resources we were fighting the counter-terror campaign that was appropriate we have done remarkable work uh the intelligence community has done great work the military has done great work our our civil systems have done good work and frankly our alliances have provided a network to take down terror plots all across the world we get an a it's now time to go confront this behemoth this chinese communism so so this will this will take first a set of defensive actions i'll give you an example in in your home state of texas the chinese were conducting deep spying operations out of the diplomatic facility in houston in my district this was permitted to go on for an awfully long time and finally director ray and i said enough we made the case president signed off we we we shut it down and there was a cost they closed down one of our consulates in china so be it we couldn't move we couldn't go i mean it was crazy imbalanced and we need to go create and impose real costs on china that are parallel and reciprocal and if we begin to do that and build out alliances with the indians right 1.4 billion people in india who went to war with china last year don't forget in the himalayas the chinese killed a couple of dozen of indian citizens with pipes and barbed wire it's a real war in the himalayas at 20 000 feet we need to go build out alliances with these with these democratic systems these economic powers and when we do we can begin to convince the chinese people some 900 million plus chinese people who aren't connected to the communist party who just want a better life we can convince them that you know there's a there's a better path forward and we can impose real costs in a way that will deter the chinese from what they've been getting away with both economically and militarily for the last 40 years so you can cut me off if you want because i know your time is it might be limited but one more question i'm i'm i'm trying to i'd love to ask you um and it's it's it's it's the politics of foreign policy domestic politics of foreign policy and you know the the americans left and right were very tired with with ongoing wars very tired with our our occupations and nation building especially now i think that went too far i think that that that fatigue with nation building was probably righteous fatigue but it turned into we can't even have anybody out there because it's just wrong and it's wrong because i say it's wrong and endless wars are bad now i think it's more complicated than that but what worries me though is that the reaction is so severe that that it has culminated over the last 20 years that we might be out of balance with the our our citizens perception of foreign policy where it's like we shouldn't be anywhere and that that that isolationism has gone has has has become way too strong and and veered too far from a reasonable conversation about costs and benefits for being in afghanistan or iraq or syria that's how i think about it i think if you send people like me over there as an insurance policy i don't think about it like we're trying to win a war i'm an insurance policy i go i go target bad guys so that they don't have the operational freedom to target you at home and that's an ongoing operation that might last a long time and that's how i see it but but but that that trigger point is very emotional for people and i worry that we won't be able to do what we need to do abroad anymore i mean you saw in december that last bill we passed uh and people were losing their minds because there was foreign aid attached to a covet bill it was and then i mean that was frustrating um and it was like this was president trump's he went against it but like this is his presidential request you know i was very frustrated by that as somebody voted for it um i totally get it um so so but that's the kind of visceral reaction you see so what do you tell people yeah i tell them dan exactly what you just described is that the mission set for our foreign policy has to be singular protecting american interest right president trump shorten that to america first we should be unambiguous about that but the best way to do that from time to time is to make sure we have people in the right places at the right moment to go take down bad guys in the same way we took down qasim suleimani right that that mission was enabled by the fact that we had forces in the region that could both identify and collect the intelligence capability to uh to understand the problems i personally know the guys on the ground who are doing that yeah by the way i didn't i probably didn't do justice amazing operation can't say much about it but my goodness if you want to talk about elite forces performing excellent work this was this was this was something wrongly believe that it's just as simple as flying a drone around and you can just find bad guys it doesn't work that way oh my goodness this was uh and by the way nobody in the world could execute that mission besides the united states military nobody to operate to conduct a mission like that thousands of miles from your homeland uh there's only one military in the world that can pull that off that's a complicated you know the back story make no mistake this is complex systems processes and amazing people and really good leaders making really good decisions but back to this issue dan leaders have to talk about this in a way that's sensible and reasonable and defend the things that keep us safe you know president trump in afghanistan and in the middle east would say to me mike i just have two things i want you to do i want you to make sure in afghanistan we don't ever have a terror act come from that land again and i want you to get everybody back and so we began to try and develop right as a i was the state secretary of state not the secretary of state a diplomatic effort to enable us to increase the likelihood we could achieve each of those two objectives but it it it takes having resources in places around the world and the right numbers in the right structure with the right capabilities to make sure that we don't have folks coming at us from abroad i i think dana i'll close with this thought you know we talk about our southern border you all live that in texas every day and the fact that drugs come across their human trafficking is all really bad but this is the first time we've ever had ungoverned space on our southern border we talked about ungoverned space in afghanistan or iraq or in syria and say this is a place bad guys can gather to begin to build up terror plots the the mexican government's capacity to control where these cartels are operating along our southern border is incredibly limited we have to be serious about making sure we understand how to protect even our southern border and attorney general bar and i had begun to think about what do you do when you have transnational criminal organizations like these cartels sitting on your border not 8 000 miles away or 4 000 miles away how do you make sure that you have how do you have this right these are these are the kinds of risks that we need to make sure that we talk to the american people about in a way that is sensible and logical when we do i'm convinced they will be fully supportive of the institutions that need to go execute these missions yeah we can talk about the i think the need to to pivot south uh with our foreign policy for quite a bit i mean it's it's our backyard you've got a you've got a fairly like-minded western civilization most predominantly catholic um right for development and prosperity and alliances and and and a security threat like you talked about uh that i think deserves maybe more american attention um okay well i but i know you gotta go we can talk

we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw has landed hey guys welcome back got another great episode for you cause that's just what we do here and i know you know that because that's why you're listening and you've probably given me five stars on uh apple ratings already and if you haven't well maybe you should i really don't know what that does for me but people seem to think it's important so um maybe a nice comment too today we have rob smith with us uh rob welcome to the show thanks so much for having me i appreciate it rob you and i met um hanging out with um at turning point events um very impressed by you you've you've got your own media company you're now an author you've got a book coming out next week you you travel around the country to college campuses speaking on you know what i would call cultural issues in politics and you've got just a really interesting background as well so what's the name of your new book so the name of my book is always a soldier service sacrifice and coming out as america's favorite black gay republican um so the the america's favorite black gay republican thing um that's kind of the the tagline i used to describe myself you know it's funny there's an element of humor in it and then i think that when people get past the joke we can really start talking about what doesn't mean um that that i'm a republican and i have these identities and what does that mean in politics in 2020 but yeah that's the book so the book is about 70 memoir um uh my time's been in iraq my time spent military and about 30 of talking about you know political and cultural issues that are going on right now were you always republican was there a time period when you started identifying that way no i was not always republican at all uh dan i was i was a good little liberal you know um i would say the red pill for me happened and if your listeners don't know that that terminology the red pill is when people start um leaning more towards conservative uh ideals and ideologies and my red pill came a couple of different ways first they came i read a book by ann coulter called adios america and that book is all about um immigration uh both legal and illegal but particularly how illegal immigration is really damaging um lots of parts of this country particularly on the african-american community and it made me think deeper about those issues in a way that i hadn't before and i would say over the past couple of years i'm very open about the fact that i did not vote for president trump in 2016. um i hated uh hillary clinton i i wasn't a fan of what the democrats were saying i didn't feel like they were speaking to me but i didn't necessarily feel like republicans were speaking to me as well even though i was becoming more conservative leaning yeah uh and after the president got elected i i kind of took a step back and started looking at the results and the results of what were really happening and i said to myself you know this stuff is really good and also the left likes to own black people they like to own latino people like to own gays and lesbians um they like to say that if we are not in power your life is in danger they will say this verbatim yeah and i started to realize that my life was not in danger and in fact in many ways my life was getting better and i had to take a real hard look at what i believed and why i believed it no that's so uh so it would happen during trump's presidency so this is a very recent phenomenon you transitioning were you politically active before that i think you were right yeah i was i was very politically active on the left uh so they this book always a soldier you know i served in the military during the don't ask hotel years which was basically it barred gays and lesbians from serving openly um and and after i got out of the military i kind of moved to new york got involved a little bit um into activism and writing and speaking and all that stuff i did that in support of the repeal of don't ask hotel so i was political i spoke out a lot about that i was i was arrested at the obama white house protesting the the don't ask don't tell law and you know with the help of of a lot of democrats and and not you know quite a few republicans as well we were able to get the donuts until repealed so now gays and lesbians can serve openly in the military and i'm not an egomaniac but i know that i had more than a little bit to do with that so i was politically active before right um and i i think i started shifting away from everything that was going on in the left because things started getting more and more insane and i i started look taking a hard look at my military service on what it meant to me and one thing about my military service is that it engendered a love of america in me that i'm not sure would have been there had i not served and i started seeing a lot of sort of anti-american anti-authoritarianism anti-military a lot of this stuff started bubbling up on the left and it just became a place that was no longer for me and yeah i mean i write about like why i think that is it's it's because the left is obsessed with identity politics which which really isn't that indistinguishable from from victimhood politics because the whole point of identity politics is to is to pit one group against another and one group has to be an oppressor and one has to be an oppressed and so this manifests into victimhood ideology and if there's a victim then there has to be an oppressor and then you have to look for it and i think then the ultimate oppressor eventually becomes as you move through groups as you move through institutions it eventually has to be america itself and the symbolism of america the american flag and all that and i i think that explains sociologically speaking why we see what we see today yeah you know i think it does too and what what i started to notice about and especially as i broke out of that that sort of uh leftist realm and i talk about this a lot in the book because i really do talk about you know coming out um as conservative and republican and which i did about two years ago at this point and the amount of hatred um the the amount of vitriol i mean it really is something because there really is this idea and i don't you know i don't like to there's a lot of black conservatives that kind of talk about you know the plantation um politics and the plantation stuff and and i'm not a big fan of talking about that uh or speaking like that but there was a sense of we you are ours and you're not supposed to be there because they hate you and they will ultimately destroy you so come back here where you're safe even though none of your what you really believe doesn't align with us just because you were black just because you were gay just because you were both you were supposed to be here um and it's really quite wild to be on the receiving end of it's so strange and so like this is actually a good spot to transition into what i just saw on the internet um yesterday it came from you probably know what i'm talking about am i screwing this up it came from the african-american museum the national museum of african-american history and culture and i mean this is it's strange on so many fronts and so basically this is a poster that was published by the museum and it's titled aspects and assumptions of whiteness white culture in the united states and you're like okay what is this going to be about and the subtitle here is white dominant culture or whiteness refers to the ways white people and their traditions attitudes and ways of life have been normalized over time and now considered standard practices in the united states and since white people still hold most of most of the institutional power in america we've all internalized some aspects of white culture including people of cover so i mean the premise the premise is obviously strange right from the get-go is that culture is based on skin color now that's not true ever in human history just ever like that's just not true uh i mean so so it's like right off the bat the premise is is is totally false i mean um it's it's outrageous it's completely outrageous it's crazy i'm looking at this right now okay so but yeah then this and then and then get into the actual cultural elements because they're like wait a second this is like you're telling me black people don't believe in this stuff this is some of this is really good stuff yeah rugged individualism self-reliance apparently self-reliance is a white thing believing in the family structure that's a white thing um objective rational linear thinking is apparently a white thing protestant work ethic hard work is the key to success if you didn't meet your goals you didn't work hard enough then i had no clue that these were were white things i thought that these were people things i thought that that this was what you do to achieve success it's so strange isn't it it's like it's like simultaneously highly insulting and racist but also like wait a second these you did a really good job actually capturing um what i write about in my book quite a bit like just good things and of course like the naysayers are like oh that's because you're white well i'm like no have you not met have you not met black people also i mean that you know this says christianity is the norm in real in the religious section you know it's like the black community likes church you're kidding me and they will tell so they when you say these things then they will say oh it's because you're white because you've never done anything and i so um a couple months back i i testified in congress you know and aoc and all of her cronies were there and i literally i just told my story i said you know i came from from very little in akron ohio i decided to join the military at 17 years old i deployed to iraq i i get out and i've got you know this this really amazing life right now i work really hard but i i really enjoy what i'm doing and you i'm a bootstrapper that like i am a bootstrapper because i've done it and i am not particularly special and i think that anybody could do this in a lot of different ways they hate the idea so much that anybody of any color in america can hold onto these ideals and become successful because it negates everything that they are trying to push on us and when i say that i mean the left they're trying to push this idea that people are not individual individuals right so it's just individualism versus collectivism um they try to push the idea that just because somebody is born with a different skin color that they are permanent victims throughout their entire life and if you go through life with that frame of reference and with that state of mind it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy yeah and the difference between my my frame of mind now that i've come out as conservative and now that i've decided to to really internalize these principles um is that i i've seen success and i've seen a lot of different things whereas before i was always number one waiting on somebody to give me an opportunity or number two when i failed when i fell short when i did not work hard enough i thought it was always always racism and it's a really destructive um it's a really destructive way to go about living your life yeah it really is i mean it removes agency from from the person i mean personal responsibility you know apparently which is just these crazy white principles um it's it's it's a foundation of conservative culture for a reason um i i think it's the basis because it's about empowerment and and they can't have you empowered if they're always going to be again the entire the solution comes from the supposed cause and this is what i mean by that for democrats the solution to all problems is excessive government control centralized top down we need as much intervention in your life as possible we're the only we're your only savior and if that's if that that's true then it must mean that you're powerless and so they have to define you as powerless it's it that has to come first before they can actually offer you this this kind of savior ship that they do yeah uh and i mean that's it and for me my transition and it really became a point and again i talk about that i i break down a lot of different elements that that sort of made me try and transition or come out as conservative as as i like to call it i don't know if i coined it or not but uh it's definitely uh something that i started talking about a lot and it's really kind of coming coming out of that and realizing that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter where you come from doesn't matter how much money you have doesn't matter what your skin color is doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is no matter what your religion is none of those things matter because you always have the agency in your life right and and you you have to go through life with that and you're right about the fact that a lot of people on the left seem obsessed with this idea of removing agency from people um just because they are whatever whatever immutable characteristics that they have right and i i kind of fight against that and the the thing for me which is the most fulfilling when somebody's either said they pre-ordered my book or they say that i gave them their red pill or they say well i look at you and think that i can do it and i'm like exactly that is the point so we have a lot of and we don't even have to say the names we have some some very very successful bootstrapper stories and some very prominent political figures on the left and they did it but yet they want to pretend as if nobody else can do it which is really insane to me it doesn't it doesn't add up i hear that all the time it's very it's very strange to me and like you live by the values that that we say you should live by and yet you diminish and destroy those values in public and why one and i but but i bet you teach those values to your kids because you love your kids so it begs the question why wouldn't you treat the american people the way as if you love them the way you love your kids and it's it's ridiculous um let's get back to get back to your personal story well did you want to say something um no no i was just gonna say you know look it's it's the easiest thing in the world it is then it's easy to lie to people right it's easy to tell people what they want to hear it's easy to tell people that they are not successful that they are victimized whatever because of because of racism or whatever and it's easy to remove them of their agency and that is why there's such a difference between what these people say and how they live their lives they will i mean we'll just get deeper into they will say that we want to dismantle the nuclear family structure but they were born and raised in a two-parent household their parents are still still together right you know they they will they will be anti-capitalism they will give 20 000 speeches railing against capitalism and it just it boggles my mind but yeah let's get back highly contradictory yeah so i mean you're you're you see yourself as a new yorker now but you grew up in acton ohio um or akron sorry akron ohio um you you didn't perform or you didn't you didn't attend high performing schools you you talk about how disaffected teachers would routinely come unprepared uh counselors who didn't didn't know what to do so i mean is that why you ended up i mean you and then you ended up in the army joined the army at age 17. so was that sort of an escape like what what what led to that um you know it was an escape and and i talked about this like the the the first i would say 20 or so pages of the book kind of get into that a little bit but then you know we're right into infantry basic training and we go into that but yeah yeah we'll do some vet talk here soon oh yeah yeah the vet talk so i'm from akron i'm from akron ohio i'm from west akron ohio you're talking about the city you know i was not born in a suburb that the thing about me is that a lot a lot of people that try to tear me down and discount my story they i think that they like to create a story about me in their heads that uh i'm some privately educated prep school kid from a two-family household and i was making a lot of money and this is why i would believe in these you know these beliefs and i'm like well no that that's obama okay that wasn't me um and he realized that you know the hustle was going you know growing up in privilege and then telling people that they're victims yeah so that wasn't me um i i grew up in in west african ohio this is this is a city that's 98.6 percent black um my middle school and high schools were were very very very underperforming and i say this a lot about my high school i never say the actual name uh if you google enough it will probably come up but this is a school that was rated that is to this day rated a d or an f by the ohio public school system um so so this is the kind of education that i got in my middle school and high school years now in my elementary school years my mother did send me to a school across town she used my my grandfather's address to get me into that school so i was in the quote-unquote white school when i was in elementary school and that came with this a lot of different issues but i actually did get a decent you know elementary school education there and i was actually learning and i was actually a very high performer and then you know i i came to these low-performing schools where people were getting in the fistfights and and there had to be security and all of that stuff for my middle schools in high school and people didn't know what to do with the smart kid um they i didn't play sports i wasn't very athletic in high school as a matter of fact that was pretty heavy so he didn't quite know what to do with me so i graduated high school at 16 years old um and there was no next there was no going straight into college there was no nothing there was just i graduated did you skip grades i did graduate at 16. yeah you're super smart yeah i skipped a grade in elementary school i think i skipped like fifth grade or something like that it was either i think it was no i think it went from third to fifth or something like that it was way back but they saw so look i was a very high performing kid um that was born into you know a broken family structure and that was around a lot of um lazy administrators that didn't quite know what to do with me so that that is what it is so i ended up um i don't spend too much time on education policy but you know since you've lived through it i mean and basically you're a product of school choice your family had to kind of force school choice there by actually moving obviously in in by definition school choice the way conservatives push for the policy would allow you to simply choose to go to that school is that is that something you're pretty passionate about school choice or and what what what else though i mean what else because school choice is one thing right and that saves some kids but what about that failing that other failing school that you spent all of middle school and high school in you know you could throw more money at it does that change it i mean what is there is there just cultural issues there is it is it the single-parent households that i mean there's so many factors and so what's your general opinion on this there's so many factors and those things are cultural i am a huge proponent of school choice because here's the thing then the the the biggest factor in performing high performing kids is how involved their parents are in their lives and i think that school choice gives high involved parents in maybe lower income communities the the chance to send their kids to a school that's actually going to pay attention for them it's a chance for everybody to work together right yeah so when we talk about these very low performing schools and in my middle school my high school they were very very low performing schools they were just people just getting shuttled from grade to grade to grade i call them they're they're little more than teenage day care centers i'm sorry and it's controversial but it's true and the reason that these schools are so underperforming it's not because of a lack of money they throw you and i both know that billions of dollars are thrown into these schools right but if you have kids that are coming to these schools from with uninvolved parents from single parent family structures um from all of the stuff that happened um that is not preparing these kids i should go in school and learn because there's so much else going on you know the state and the government can't intervene in that you know we the the state and the government cannot raise these kids right so that's a cultural factor in that you have to to start working on family structures you have to have involved parents i was i was raised in a single parent household my mother raised me she was a very involved parent she was very involved in my schooling and education even though i went to very low performing high school i still did very well grade wise but i and i'll be completely honest with you and this is something that i think that we should all do but i've continued my education in my adult world because you know i i am not um very literate when it comes to the american classics um the american classics of literature um american cultural history you know i just geography things like that i've had to teach myself because those schools were so poor yeah and then you joined the army um was there like a moment where you're like i'm i'm gonna join the army i mean what what the heck happened okay so i graduated high school 16 years old i you know i was waiting tables i didn't wasn't living much of a life still kind of like living in my grandma's basement i you know not like i was some scrub you know i was still granted only barely 17 years old but they i knew that there had to be something else and there had to to be a different way and that's when i decided to join the army and uh and i talked about this a lot in the book and this is kind of embarrassing but it is what it doesn't talk about this in the book obviously yeah i was a gay teenager at the time and i called the recruiting station and the recruiter comes and i'm i'm telling i had a massive crush on this guy just is what it is um so i had a massive crush on this recruiter um and you know he seriously i had a massive crush on him when did you come out as gay when when was how long ago before this moment so look uh i i i don't know that i knew what gay was i knew that were you not openly gay in high school i was not openly gay in high school absolutely what do you think that would have been like um you know if i was coded as gay in high school so i got a little teasing and bullying i think openly being openly gay in high school would have been a little bit more than i could have taken on at that point um so i was not openly gay and i don't even know if i knew what gay was i knew that as a teenager the same way that most boys felt about girls i was feeling about other guys so that's all i knew there wasn't a definition of it and i didn't really come out as myself or like uh come out to myself or to my mother or anything like that for a couple of the years got a massive crush on this recruiter he's spending a lot of time with me you know taking me back and forth we would have lunches we talked about what i wanted and he presents this idea of the infantry and my 17 year old self is saying wow how cool you know i just shoot a gun um i get to to go out and and do camping and all this stuff like that you and i don't know that the infantry it's a little bit more intense than that what what year was this oh god right now i'm gonna age myself uh this was in 1999. whoa i thought you were yeah how old are you i am oh my god dan i tried to keep my age for myself i just turned 38. okay okay sorry i thought you're a little younger than that yeah well you age well good job everybody does everybody does okay everybody does so yeah so i go into um so i go into the military um i go into uh boot camp and it was it was the probably the hardest thing i've ever done this entergy boot camp mind you this is i'm a pudgy heavy kid no sense of discipline eat everything no sense of physical fitness at all and it it broke me um and then it both built me back up and i had these two drill sergeants and and this is what if anybody takes anything from this book and this is what i i get into the most my two drill sergeants self-described redneck um you know country drill sergeant they helped me and they built me up by tearing me down and it's a process and so when i started you know coming over to the conservative side and i saw these people saying oh well these rednecks you know these trump supporters these whatever they hate black people and they hate this and they hate that and i would just have to look back at my military experience i'm like no you know i i knew these people and that was not it um but it was uh one of the most difficult things i've ever done and um i i came out of it on the other side in no small port and no small part due to those drill sergeants and due to another joe sergeant that came in and in learning that physically i could do this and learning that mentally and emotionally i could do this well um but you you do talk about experiencing some racism derogatory homophobic homophobic slurs as well i mean throughout your life and so and and so talk about that but but also relate it to the to the reactions we're seeing now with with with black lives matter um because i mean and and i guess my other question would be you know police growing up in ohio um as a black teenager what was what was that like dude is is is this narrative you know a quarter correct half correct fully correct what is it okay so um racism and homophobia absolutely i've experienced it in my life experienced it in the military it was so the the the homophobia aspects of the military it was at that point enshrined in military law because granted don't ask honestly the law of the land if i came out as gay if i told anybody i was gay if i was caught um at a gay bar on a date or anything like that i'd be kicked out and so you know i went into the military um to find a path to to find a path to a college education to a better life to all that stuff so the homophobia was enshrined in law right and so yeah you know you get a couple of guys that that call you sag every now again and it just is what it is um so that was the biggest aspect the racism aspect it was never there was only one real sort of like overt thing that happened in iraq and i talked about that a little bit in the book where somebody just actually like oh you know um i'm you know i'm from the south and those ends know their placed there and that said with an ear shot i was like holy crap you know like that's crazy i mean i've never been in my face that much before and and and one of the other guys like oh yo you know you can't really say that here um the military is extremely diverse um especially the army yeah and well in the navy yeah and and then to this day there are people it's um in the thing when the left gets so anti-military and they say well that's not a place to vote because you have to understand enlisted is 30 black most people who have never had a black boss in their lives will have their only black boss in the military you know yeah because it's it's about rank and it's not about anything else it's a pure meritocracy you know and it's yeah i i always i tell everybody you know even for a few years the military is uh you know just it just sets you on a great path please do it um so were you were you there for so you're in kuwait where your five years started around 98 so that means that means um afghanistan we're 99 to yeah 99 2004. so were you were you in iraq during the invasion i was in iraq um i deployed to iraq about three weeks after the invasion um into 2003 and i was in iraq for just under a year wow um what part i was in kirkuk so what happened was so when when i was in arrived for the initial invasion we flew into kuwait and we convoyed up all the way from kuwait through to kirkuk so we um we crossed the border and we were in a convoy for a good month before we hit a little town called already which is about 45 minutes south of kirkuk so we went through baghdad we went through samara we went through that whole just a little road trip just a little road trip nothing else yeah were you guys driving where were you guys driving not not you know people people think of hum are convoys now and we've got these giant rg33s you know huge armored trucks they're like monster trucks they're awesome um that's not what we had back in 2003 yeah bradley fighting vehicles oh well those are pretty good too okay you see those are those are nice so not so not the not the humvees with no doors no not the home bees with no doors like some of us some of the mps were so when i was around uh the mps were doing the humvees with no doors so so were special operations yeah yeah so i had i had two jobs and during the entire time first um i was a mechanic and then i went straight to i i went straight to an infantry unit so i was an m249 machine gunner um actually no i'm getting that backwards at first i was a driver and then i drove for a couple of years so i drove the bradley fighting vehicle for a couple years as a matter of fact in my deployment in kuwait that's what i did and then after kuwait i got transitioned to a field team um and so then i was a 249 machine gunner so during my time in iraq i was the m249 saw machine gunner so that that baby was my best friend um yeah so we we convoyed up there you know saw combat not on the convoy saw combat i i think two or three times when we finally got to already i talk about those combat situations in the book and it wasn't so much that it happened during an actual mission that we were supposed to do because we ran a couple of missions but we would always my unit was kind of always ran clean up so when we were in tomorrow we were in tomorrow like a week and a half after there was this massive fire fight and we were going in to clear out um this building look for intel and all that stuff and everything it kind of already happened so when i saw combat it was more our my base got attacked so our base of operations got attacked a couple of times i talked about that in a book um and i talk about how i and and i don't use real names in the book i every everybody that is not me is a pseudonym because some of these guys are still serving and they don't need that attention they'll know who they are if they ever pick this up and i'm still in contact with a lot of guys that i served with um but i use pseudonyms just because like i don't need to be using people's real names and bringing them into any of this but i had a squad leader in a rock who he was you know he was looking for something to do and he would take us out on on on missions that didn't necessarily need to happen and a couple of those times is when we saw incoming fire and he wasn't a great leader and i talk about that situation a lot because when you're a grunt when you're a specialist which is what i was and you have this this sergeant that is that is getting you into dangerous situations that is that is exposing you you know and he would expose us for no reason um and and that stuff got contentious and and i get into that in the book what do you say when you're a specialist and you have a sergeant that is exposing you and putting your life in danger for no real reason because we because those missions that he was taking us out on those are not real missions you know that that wasn't real that was him wanting wanting to be uh you know wanting to play soldier yeah once he had his combat action ribbon yeah that um i've seen that dynamic play out um before in in one of the one of the tenets of leadership is you have to explain why your troops have to understand why um you you there is there obviously isn't a higher hierarchy in the military and you you can give orders just based on the insignia on your caller um but it's it's not real leadership and and eventually that when once when when things really get hard that that hierarchy is not guaranteed to stand there has to be mutual respect and that mutual respect one of the first things to do is simply explain why explain why we're doing this you have to we dealt with this in afghanistan because i mean i don't think we were i don't think we're doing anything we weren't supposed to by any means these were real missions but even then guys are like why really why i mean we're getting blown up all over the place there's you know there's ieds everywhere we're not so much worried about the people shooting at us when they do that they're just you know it's it's really just not that big of a deal it depends on what part of afghanistan you're in um on how good they are at firing and maneuvering but we're in kandahar where we were i mean the danger was ieds and so i mean to the point where we wouldn't even fire a maneuver well we would fire back but we would not maneuver back because you never step outside of something that isn't cleared and um and guys are like why do i want to lose my feet you know it's it's um so it's it's hard on the psyche um and everybody just you know they put their heads down and they they deal with it and we mitigate risk the best we could but um every once in a while you get your face blown up which is obviously what happened to me um and but but but i was you know and i could blame people for that but i knew i was there um maybe that particular mission doesn't matter but the overall mission does and um you know that's that's what i explained and i think and honestly then what i really wanted to get into with this book you know so you're you everybody knows your story and then there's a heroism to to your story and there's a heroism to you as a public figure and a lot of our military there's a heroism to what they've done and i wanted to kind of subvert that a little bit with this book because i we we have so few stories of what it's like to just be the guy on the ground trying to stay you know what i mean just being the degrade the guy on the ground the grunt on the ground trying to stay alive what is that like what is going through your mind how do you experience that we we have so many stories from you know like like you were a navy seal and we have so many admirals and and great heroic stories about people that were really leaders in charge and i was like okay well when i sat down to write this i said i wasn't in charge i i wasn't you know i let you know some of the the private behind me but i wasn't a true leader so how do i how do i make this relatable to the average person because most of the people who will read this book will never will never serve in the military will certainly never go to iraq you know what i mean uh so how do i make this relatable to them and i said i make this relatable to them the same way that i make myself relatable to people when it comes to when i'm doing speeches or political commentary or whatever just take it down to the ground level right and and that's what i really try to do because i could i i look rob smith is never going to be saying crenshaw he's never going to be you know all of the these leaders um that that have that heroic sort of um public well i don't i don't think i have a heroic military history either i think i think we do default way too much to simply calling veterans heroes and i think we should reserve the term hero for some you know i i didn't like save anybody from a burning burning you know vehicle or anything um you know i just i just got hurt uh you know and it's it's i i i suppose everybody serves heroic honorable i served honorably um yeah you know i i guess but uh there isn't like some some single moment of heroism um yeah you know i mean you know did i i didn't act poorly when i when it was in the worst of times i suppose you know i suppose i got my ass up and and walked it off i guess that's the best that's the best that i can point to um but but we do we overuse the word hero to a huge extent that's fair that's fair and i certainly like i don't and i like what you said about you know i don't know if i'm a hero but i definitely served honorably that's all i that i know never gotta never got an article 15 never got arrested never got anything like that like the only the only way i ever broke the law in the military was because i was gay and everybody knows that that law was bs anyway and then you did get arrested for it didn't you you did get arrested i got i got arrested after the fact i got it after the fact then and you know i'm like protesting right the the this is after the military just to be clear for all the listeners this was yeah yeah for everybody listening so i got arrested protesting don't ask them at the obama white house afterwards this is around 2010 um which is funny because we're uh we're coming up on the 10-year anniversary of that um and i was proud to do it it was something that i felt very strongly about because i know what it's like to be to be a closeted gay guy in the military and when i look back at it i having to keep that secret kept me from building stronger relationships with with my brothers and i say brothers because i was in an infantry like this is an all-male unit um so it kept me from building a strong relationship with them because there was always something that i had to keep secret and i eventually and i talked about this in the book um i did come out to my best friend in the military and some of these guys and this is kind of a funny story um and that i talked about this in the book uh my my first kind of gay club was this place called uh hide and seek in colorado springs colorado but i was under 21 couldn't get in until after 2 a.m which means that they were no no longer serving liquor and then it became the after hours club which everybody went to so it was me there and then i found some of the guys from my unit there and i'm like oh crap you know like oh my god they see me at the gay club like i just better go pack my stuff like they're gonna kick me out like it's gonna be a whole big thing and then those guys are like nah never turned me in never did anything just kept it moving yeah well it's a you didn't tell i guess i don't know it is in hindsight it is kind of a silly um what what do you think about um so what do you think about current military because it's it's much it's it's the the transgender issues become much more complicated um from a military standpoint and frankly i think the current strat or the current um policy is is just right um basically what it is is you can be transgender but you but you have to act in your biological sense or in your biological sex and that makes a ton of sense so you you show up to work one day rob and now you're now you're robin um and and then i say okay fine get back to work but you you still have to take the male pt tests you still have to dress in this uniform your behavior can't change you you can be who you are but your behavior at work can't change and i think and also we we cannot possibly pay for the the um you know reassignment surgeries that would also make you undeployable and that that just seems to be obvious even though that's fought against by the left um you know so it's really funny because i knew that this was going to come up i didn't know it's going to come up now so here's the thing about the transgender issue and like i consider myself i consider myself very um intelligent when it comes to this stuff because people have to understand that when it comes to the transgender issue there's medication right so this so people that are transgender are on some form of medication at all times so either if if you're you're male to female transgender you're on hormones or estrogen if you're uh female to male transgender you're on testosterone there's just a lot of stuff that goes into that now where it is and i haven't dug down into where the policy is right now i know that the policy is kind of like an outright ban and i know that people are trying to fight it and and i know that you know this has become kind of a political thing but but fundamentally we are talking about literally one one third of one percent of the population in general and in the military it is so much less than that you're they're just so so few people to which this would ever be an issue so i don't know if i believe in an outright ban and i don't know if i believe in just throwing it open so that everybody can do everything because i i say case in point when i first went to a rock when i first deployed to iraq i went a month without a shower okay so i went a month without a shower not only did i go a month without a shower i went a month without if i was going to be if i if there was some medication that i needed every single day for a month it was not going to happen right right so you can't have somebody that's deploying in a combat field that needs to have all of this medication every single day like all this is not going to happen right right we're not allowed to deploy if we haven't gotten our dental checks you know i mean there's a there's a pretty strong checklist of things that you have to have before you deploy and so i mean from the medical side of it it's just it's a it's a total non-starter but you know what i wanted to ask you that maybe what i want direction i want you to go is is kind of just thinking about generally anti-discrimination law um you know the recent supreme court decision where it's a murky decision but you're basically saying that somebody could show up to a funeral home which is it which is a sensitive place and and they were dressing up as a guy a minute ago and now they refuse to and they and they want to wear a dress and they're in there and they change their name and they change their identity even though they're still clearly a man biologically speaking um you know why can't that employer say well your behavior has changed and i think this is the right way to think about anti-discrimination law because i don't want people to be able to be fired for immutable characteristics you know and i think we all agree on that because and this gets into the debate the conservatives have should conserve should political beliefs be a protected class and i'm like you know it's interesting but in the end maybe not because it's behavior and i think you should always be able to get fired or not hired for behavior and i think if we as a country just distinguished it that way we'd be better off so i can't fire you because you're transgender but if you start to act a certain way which is which is unbecoming of of of my place of employment then i can fire you and you know what i mean and i think that's probably the right way to think about it but um as as i've tried to struggle with this you know walking the line here what i mean what do you think i mean you know it's a struggle because on on one hand you know in on one hand you want to you want to respect everybody you want to respect everybody's decisions but i know that in the case of this funeral home um if i am not mistaken you know what i'm not even getting into that because i think that i don't know the details enough nobody want we don't want to fire anybody for immutable characteristics but at the same time you want to make sure that that people are are fitting the standards of their jobs and you don't want the workplace to become you know people people doing their activism and i and i think as i i have a chapter uh in the book it's called literally escaping it's called the cult of lgbtq right and so i i there are gays and they're lesbians and they're bisexuals and they're transgender people and then there are people that are in the leftist lgbtq cult and so the people that are in the leftist lgbtq cult um think that whatever their characteristics are with whatever they identify as that is the most important thing in the world and and we have to be careful about how much we sort of elevate that like obviously that's being elevated to a very high level in the left because they think that it helps them politically um and they think that that gays and lesbians in the lgbt community that that that's another victim class for them and that's why we're seeing all of the transgender stuff right now um look i i think it's really sensitive and when you when you get into that stuff you also get into the fact that there are a lot of women right now jk rowling being the most famous example of which that are being bashed by the left for for standing up for female faces and for standing up for women's sports and i get into that in the cult of lgbtq chapter as well is there are people that are that are really trying to destroy women's spaces and they're really trying to shut them up and they're really trying to do that under the guise of of inclusiveness and that's the stuff that you really really do have to be careful about when it comes to the transgender issue when it comes to transgender issues i always think what are what are the rights of women that are being trampled upon because i there is no threat at all for me i'm a fully grown man i work out six days a week a male a female to male transgender in a in the changing room in my gym poses zero physical threat to me and it never will but you can't say that the other way around right we really have to be careful with that and and the party of science right the left loves to call themselves the party of science all of that goes out of the door when they start talking about transgender issues so that's a that's a a conversation that needs to be had with compassion but it has to be uh it has to be rooted in biological reality yeah no that's not how they do it everything's a social construct that can therefore be infinitely malleable um last question i want to get to you before um before we end is um changing topics again um from one easy topic to the next uh the uh so you you were still on you were on the left um about back when black lives matter first came about um you transitioned to the right uh and and we're finding ourselves in this moment again i mean how has your thinking changed evolved on this and what are your what and i asked you this before we didn't really get to it i mean growing up as a black teenager if you listen to blm you would think that every black teenager is just is constantly um harassed by the police you know is this your experience is this do you think you have to have different conversations um with your kids if they're black how does you know what what is true and what is not uh what is what is not true is the idea that because i'm a black man in the society there are just roving packs of racist police officers that can't wait to kill me in the streets no that's just not true danny you know it's not true and i know it's not true and to a certain extent um the the leaders of the black lives matter movement no it's not true as well um it is so a couple of years ago when when black lives matter first started um it i think that it was a movement that was about empowerment i think it was a movement about okay like we really have to have some sort of reform in the past couple of months it has morphed into a political organization that is is raising a lot of money for democrats and now that that shift has happened uh there's a shift towards the black lives matter organization and i always call it black lives matter organization because this is not a movement it is an organization um it is not a 501 c 3 nonprofit they are getting millions and millions of dollars not only for not only from corporations but a lot of this money is being funneled to the dnc as well so when we talk about black lives matter we really have to talk about it in terms of this is a political organization that is being propped up by democrats and and being used to help elect democrats so so we always have to i mean the fact that they use act blue means that that data is shared um and and then fellow democrats can can use those same lists that's how they do it just so everybody understands how it works yeah and so it has become a political organization and when you when it is now a political organization it can now be criticized by everybody criticizing the black lives matter organization doesn't mean that you're against black people or against black lives um and the black lives matter organization certainly doesn't define my blackness and the way that i live my life and i would i would hope that that a lot of these people aren't letting it define theirs now when you have this conversation about the police right you ask me what my experience is like as a black man living in america for over 30 years dealing with police when i grew up what i was taught by my mother and my father when he was around is that the police were your friends that's what i was taught i always thought that the police are your friends that if you're not doing anything wrong then you don't have anything to be afraid of now as a black man in society how the society treats you changes as you start getting older as you you know become a fully grown man and so whenever and i've and i've never had a true negative reaction with the police i'll tell you case in point so i went to grad school at columbia uh columbia university uh grad school of journalism that degree is worthless i don't even know where it is i i wanted to ask about that if we had time because i'm like what the heck was that like that's what i was doing for for my studies i was going out i was filming some b-rolls so i'm on the train going downtown i'm filming some b-rolls just subway ads whatever you know white woman says stop doing stop telling me i said i'm not filming you i'm filming the ad um so she gets off the train on 96th street i am greeted by police officers at 14th street because apparently this woman had called the cops and so i look at these cops and they're coming towards me and i've got my camera i'm obviously just doing work and so i rolled my eyes and i was just like hey guys what's going on they were like yeah we got a call this is like look you know this woman is giving me crap um it just is what it is like i'm a guy at j school and like i'm just trying to do my job i'm not bothering anybody and they're just like yeah like we see have a good day and that's all it was yeah it was it it wasn't intense now had i came to that interaction with antagonistic energy totally and i had somebody filming me and i wanted to make a social media moment out of it it would have probably been something a lot crazier than what it was so the way i look at this policing conversation is i think and this is black white latino chinese whatever when you have the interaction make sure it's de-escalated and what i make sure it's de-escalated to the best of your ability because when you de-escalate they'll be escalated yeah that and that's always what i was taught i mean what this notion that people are taught different things it's always struck me as a little strange depending what skin color you are because i was always taught to be extreme like you know a fearful respect was is maybe the right way to to describe that when and i think that's extremely healthy just yes or no sir like no matter what you know no argument a lot of these people don't but a lot of these people don't number one they don't have respect for authority they've never been taught that because they don't have fathers in the home yeah and and i'm sorry it's just it's real i didn't have i mean i generally always had a little bit of respect of authority but what gave me that respect for authority like that was being in the military that's that's what i got from that and we don't have a lot of people that have respect for authority because they don't have authority they don't have fathers in the home that's why you have so many people acting out in so many crazy ways when you see look at um these football coaches that are dealing with these super talented um black men that come from broken homes never had dads never had any respect for the authority the the football coach has to become the de facto father figure yeah and teach them that and teach grown men that you know so so you have a lot of grown men that need to be taught these things because they're not taught them in the home because there's no fathers in the home and that is just the reality of the situation and it's interesting the left kind of latches on to that reality and and takes advantage of it and says and they've moved a step further because i don't think this would have been true even 10 15 years ago but they moved a step further in their sort of post-modernist thinking and saying that authority authority even as an institution as a as an idea is oppressive and you shouldn't have to listen to it so i mean they're constantly undercutting the foundations of success you know maybe that should be my next book how to how the left undercuts the foundations of success um great title just thought of it right now but uh because it's true whether it's personal responsibility or it's or it's authority hierarchies which oh god sounds so scary but it's but they're important and they're based on on things like merit as long as you base them on fairness and and and ethics and meritocracies and then they're deeply good things i mean empowerment self-empowerment is a good thing it's it's an element of success and they actively undermine these things and that's the thing it's not that they just ignore them they actively undermine them now that's that's that's scary as hell yeah and you know it's only gonna get scarier and it's only gonna you know it's only going to continue um but yeah i uh you know i guess this is this is something that i can i can get into it hasn't been officially announced yet but i i really do want to invite everybody that is hopefully if you've listened this far i i am an interesting person um i really want to invite them to follow me on all my social media platforms i'm at rob smith online everywhere

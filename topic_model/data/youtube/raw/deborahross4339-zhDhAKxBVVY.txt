well welcome everyone um and thank you so much for joining this really important and exciting discussion about voting rights at this critical time in our nation's history i'm congresswoman deborah ross and i represent the second congressional district in north carolina which is pretty much most of wake county many of you know that i have a background in civil rights and i have a background in voting rights and i worked on these issues as chair of the election laws committee when i was in the north carolina legislature but we have had our hands full in congress dealing with voting rights issues you'll hear in a minute from my colleague and mentor congressman g k butterfield about all the work that he has been doing in this area on the committee on house administration i serve on the judiciary committee and the coat and i am vice chair of the subcommittee on constitutional rights and um and civil rights and we have had six hearings on voting rights most recently congress passed hr4 the john lewis voting rights act which basically restores the voting rights act that we have had in place in the past due to two very very serious supreme court decisions one in 2013 the shelby decision was which effectively gutted pre-clearance would which would be pre-review for any changes in our election laws and redistricting this affects north caro many of north carolina's counties um while not all of the counties many of them and many of them represented by congressman butterfield we also just recently had the brnovich decision which was a supreme court decision about arizona's voting laws and that gutted section two of the voting rights act which is the way that you sue in order to get your rights under the voting rights act and allison knows all about that because she's brought so many of these lawsuits and north carolina has benefited from section two particularly in combating the monster voter suppression law which targeted african americans with almost surgical precision and without a robust section we just passed that in the house and sent it to the senate last spring we passed hr1 the for the people act which expands voting rights in a number of areas including automatic registration restoration of voting rights for people who have served their time making sure that polling places stay open and also dealing with other issues in election laws and ethics laws that's so so crucial so we're going to hear from some of these wonderful experts i'll introduce them all and then we'll start after that in the order in which we introduce them with their comments so that you can hear about where we are on voting rights right now and have your questions answered and we've already got more than a dozen questions in the queue first we're thrilled to have congressman butterfield from the first congressional district he's served in congress since 2004 and risen up in leadership he's chief deputy with as i've said he's on house administration that has been handling voting rights he's also on the energy and commerce committee and represents much of eastern north carolina we're also fortunate to have professor joyner irvin irving joyner from nc central who has been there since the early 80s and has been working on these issues in north carolina and particularly issues affecting the minority community and then we've got allison riggs who is co-director of the southern coalition for social justice and has been on the front lines including up at the supreme court advocating for north carolina in terms of redistricting and countering voter suppression laws and then we have my friend um who i co-taught a class with a duke but now he's just moved on up to harvard professor guy arkell um charles and he will um be sharing with us what's going on throughout the country so um we will start with congressman butterfield um for a few minutes then professor joyner ben allison and then professor charles and um then we'll eventually get to your questions so congressman butterfield thank you deborah let me say good afternoon to all of you and thank you so very much for joining this very very important conversation this afternoon let me just say a word about deborah ross i'm not going to take my entire time talking about deborah but let me tell you deborah has come to washington well prepared to do this work i've been in congress for 17 years and and i pride myself on mentoring new members when they come to congress but this member did not need mentoring she mentioned a moment ago that i am her mentor but let me tell you she is well prepared for this work she has landed two wonderful committee assignments and she is a very valuable member of our democratic caucus uh when you hear that she is vice chair of the subcommittee on the constitution i think that speaks volumes and so i want to publicly thank deborah for her leadership and for her friendship deborah mentioned that we have our hands full in washington and that probably is an understatement uh it is it is a full plate uh we have so much that we are working on right now but there's nothing nothing nothing more important than voting rights and when i tell the voting rights story i always like to start with the year 1900 and i can do this very quickly in the year 1900 the north carolina general assembly enacted the literacy test the literacy test essentially provided a qualification for voting that qualification was that you had to be able to read and write and there was a third prong you had to be able to satisfy the registrar that you were literate and because of the literacy test thousands of african-american voters were removed from the voting rolls and did not have the ability to really effectively participate in the franchise until 1965. in 1965 congress passed the voting rights act and the first thing the vra did was to eliminate the literacy tests uh professor joyner we don't talk about that very often but number one on congress's mind was elimination of the literacy tests uh number two it did act congress enacted a a section two and and we will get into that during this call section two empowered african-american communities and now it's communities of color to litigate any grievances they have regarding election systems and so we've used section two and we've used it very effectively uh that's why we have a large contingency of african-american members of the general assembly that's why we have african-americans serving as superior court judges across the state and that's why i am able to serve in congress as well as my colleague congresswoman alma adams in the 12th district we have used section 2 very effectively section 2 2 has been weakened uh we we should talk about that a couple of months ago the supreme court in in an arizona decision weakened section two and we will talk about what we're doing uh to try to breathe new life into that finally section five was the other component of the voting rights act uh section 5 empowered the department of justice to pre-clear to approve election changes uh that that were that that were passed by local jurisdictions not all local jurisdictions but some local jurisdictions most of them in the south and congress had to decide which jurisdictions we would be subjected to pre-clearance and congress set out the ones that were subject to to pre-clearance well that's what the supreme court dealt with in june of 2013 in the shelby county case the court said look section 5 is probably okay and i'll qualify that allison by saying probably and i think you may talk about that or maybe professor charles may mention it uh but the court said section five is is uh probably okay but the formula that congress enacted back in 1965 is inadequate uh to meet current conditions and so the supreme court invited congress to update the formula and so that's what we've been doing over the last few months our congresswoman ross's subcommittee my subcommittee we've been building a record we've written a bill hr 4 the john lewis voting rights advancement act it has passed the house of representatives by voter 219 to 212 and now it will be decided in the senate uh when we return in september well this is september later later in the month and so thank all of you for joining us today this is a very challenging time we need all hands on deck and that's what this call is all about thank you thank you thank you great and i changed up the order so i i think we're going to go professor joyner then um allison and then professor charles um so he can give us that national perspective hey uh representative ross and representative butterfield uh both of you are my congressional representatives uh i invested in butterfield a long time ago since he's a an alum of this uh illustrious uh institution and i've worked with representative ross for for years and know of all of the great work that uh that she's done and and clearly i'm happy to uh stand on her shoulders uh because she has provided a foundation for us uh quickly since we have a short period of time uh voting is the most important right that we have without the right to vote and to participate in the political franchise we lose every other right that we are supposed to have and we live in a country uh where the constitution and our laws provide uh protections to uh minorities and we are a country of uh of minorities whether we're talking about racial minorities ethnic minorities people of color religious minorities but those rights are shared by all of us and we lose those rights if we don't one register the vote which is the first part of political participation because it allows us then to participate in the political franchise where decisions are made about how our funds are spent what kinds of life uh style we're able to uh enjoy uh what kind of education we will receive what kind of benefits our government will provide uh to us and if we can't participate in those decisions then our interests will be left out uh representative uh butterfield as always for as always provides us with an outstanding history uh as to where we've come from and the 1965 voting rights act was critical uh like representative butterfield i grew up in jim crow uh in the jim crow era and i saw my grandparents who were unable uh to uh to vote and uh so i made it a point that uh i would vote uh as often as uh as i could every time that there was uh and uh an election so 1965 was a critical point uh for us but what it did is helped us to realize that uh having the right to vote is not enough that you also have to increase the opportunities for people to vote you have to increase the opportunities for them to get to the polls have to create the increased educational opportunities so that people will know what to vote for how to vote and whom to whom they are electing uh to office and i would certainly and these increase the opportunities for people to vote and that has resulted in a wide uh uh spread uh success uh for us uh to be able to uh to deal with the political franchise it's under attack uh it's under attack we fought to get the voting rights act we fought to increase uh the opportunities to vote and today all of that is under attack not only in north carolina but all over uh the country and those people who are attacking it are feeling no shame at all so we have to respond in a very robust uh manner uh in order for us to uh continue to have this opportunity uh to uh participate in the political franchise in our democracy because if we don't protect our democracy it will be gone and i know allison is going to provide us with some outstanding uh uh antidotes and information that we need to go from here but i look forward to answering any questions that you have thank you professor joyner and thank you representative ross and representative butterfield for having me here today i wish i could paint a rosier picture than is actually what we're facing on the ground with respect to voting rights uh but professor joyner is correct since we lost section five of the voting rights act effectively in 2013 it's been a non-stop onslaught and it is in response to that increased political participation by historically excluded communities we face a increasingly hostile federal judiciary the federal judiciary that gutted section five of the voting rights act is also the one trying to kill section two of the voting rights act in a death by a thousand paper cuts um and we need to understand what why that's happening how that's happening in the way that it's it's happening so that we can put the full weight of our advocacy and organizing behind um representative butterfield and others who are pushing to restore the voting rights act in hr 4 the john lewis act and also pass other proactive reform in the for the people act but i want to also acknowledge that not everything not in the attacks on voting rights are insidious and congress there may be some things beyond the reach of congress so first um i'm so excited that constituents want to learn more about this because awareness is the first step to vigilance and it's the first step to combating it so we see the host of voting rights attacks we have seen since 2013 have included voter id currently and joined by a state court uh onerous restrictions on early voting and and just in the last year attempts to restrict absentee voting and to further underfund elections and that one's a a tough one i think to message around and understand but election administration um is the linchpin of exercising the fundamental right to vote so as professor joyner said we need opportunities and we need proactive outreach um to historically excluded communities and that costs money and you can undermine uh participation almost as a strategic and purposeful underfunding as you can with voter suppression laws and so we need to be aware of this we need to be pushing for more federal funding for elections we need to be pushing for more state fund funding more county level funding and we need to tell the story that our north carolina constitution guarantees free elections but your ability to access the elections may depend on what county you live in so that's something that we need to be aware of and lastly i just want um redistricting is starting to capture our attention and i want to make clear for folks listening that this is the first redistricting cycle in decades where we won't have the protections of section five of the voting rights act that's game-changing and it means and we don't have the governor does not get to veto redistricting plans and so any fail-safe that you had with the governor um acting as a mediating influence won't be there and we won't have the department of justice administering section five of the voting rights act absent quick quick action by congress and so what that means is we need you all to be watching this process when public hearings start going um attending if you can um and watching what's happening staying informed uh listening to what the legislature is doing because at the end of the day we need to check be a check on discriminatory attacks on the right to vote whether it's in the form of voter suppression laws unfunded elections or redistricting plans that are discriminatory and i look forward to answering your questions later good afternoon it's a pleasure to be here it's a pleasure to engage with two amazing congress people who are really doing the hard work of making our democracy work and we're so very thankful to have them it's also a pleasure to follow in the footsteps of dr joyner who's been a pioneering academic in this area and ms reggs who has litigated so many of these cases and who knows so much about these issues and really stand in the gap so this is a tremendous opportunity so i want to simply make two particular points one is that what we're seeing and we'll build upon the comments of my previous colleagues what we're seeing is a national strategy to undermine the both the process of voting and the results of voting and that strategy is justified on two particular points one of which is the fact that communities of color and marginalized communities have been exercising their right to vote do things as the congress pers and men put it earlier due thanks to the voting rights act of 1965 we've had greater participation which has changed both the composition of legislatures at the state level as well as congress so nationwide and as a result of that we are seeing an attempt to then make it harder for in ways that impact particular constituencies and that's that's a national strategy it's also an ideological strategy in the sense that a fight going on as to the importance of voting and a respect for the underlying results of the electoral process so some people really do believe that um making it harder for people to vote um is a is a good thing um so uh you know we talked earlier about the literacy tasks some people actually really do believe that only certain people should be allowed the right to vote so this is why i think this forum is is extremely important because what these amazing congress people are doing is not simply listening to their constituents to all of of you and making sure you're engaged in the process but also making the case for why voting and political participation is a fundamental right and ought to be protected as a fundamental right um and the through hr 4 and hr 1 which are the two types of important legislation that has been passed so far by the house so we're seeing a national strategy that makes it harder for people to vote that do not respect voting as a fundamental right and then that challenges the results of elections uh and so uh this is the reason these are some of the reasons why um seeing what is going on nationwide this is not just about north carolina it's not just about georgia it's not just about the south uh so we're talking about michigan we're talking about wisconsin we're talking about uh places in the northeast we're talking about the west coast as well um this is really more of a national strategy it's ideological and so even across very many states we are seeing um states passing laws whether it's alabama or whether it's kentucky whether it's ohio right not in the south to make it uh shorten the window to apply for mail ballots or to make it harder to deliver ballots to make it harder to remain on absentee ballots to impose harsh voter ids to limit the number of locations where people can drop off their mail ballots to remove voters from the rolls to purge voters or remove voters from from the rolls to make it harder for groups to support um voters exercising their right to vote so we're seeing a number of different types of strategies and we're seeing it across the country so it's important to recognize what is going on and then to think about how to combat it and to combat it will require a number of different sets of tools so it will require organizing at the local level as well as at the national level it will require education such as the types of form that we have here to make sure that people stay engaged should know what what is coming down the pike and to be ready for it it will require litigation um and litigation has an as an important role uh and ms riggs has talked about the importance of of litigation and standing up against uh some of of of these types of issues and we'll obviously will acquire legislation now the difficulty is that um and all of the processes that we're dealing with whether it's the courts whether it's congress there are a series of there are a number of obstacles um and so what so that's why it's so important for organizing on the ground for voters to stay engaged for voters who support the congress folks congress persons who are really doing the hard work of protecting their right to vote to continue to engage and continue to support them so that way voting really does become a fundamental right and that it's no longer up for debate in our country whether people can exercise that right whether elections ought to be respected whether gerrymandering ought to happen uh to make it easier for some people to stay in power so all of the shenanigans that limit the ability of voters to exercise focal power ought to become a feature of the past they're not so but with continued organizing and continued support we can make that happen thank you well wonderful um setting setting the stage and bringing people up to date um kimberly moore who's on in a couple minutes is going to start to take your questions but i want to just pose one question to this group and i'd like congressman butterfield to start if he can with this one um but why right now is it so important for congress to act given where we are with the courts and given where we are with the states why is congress's role so important and then i know that congressman butterfield had field hearings and took um evidence from all over the country and if he could share a little bit of what he learned as the foundation for why it's so important for congress to act and what we need to tell the courts when they look at what we've done so we'll ask congressman butterfield to start with that and then a few words from each of our other panelists thank you congresswoman and i've changed microphones can you still hear me thank you thank you thank you very much for that question uh the legislation that we are considering now is of the utmost important the importance the reason is that 47 states across the country have enacted laws or about to enact laws that will make it more difficult to vote and so this is urgent we know what we've seen here in north carolina but what's happening in north carolina is being played all across the country the opposition does not want voters of color to vote in large numbers if they had their way they would just pass legislation which said which would say that african americans and hispanics and latinos and and asian americans simply cannot vote well that is not allowed under the constitution and so this is a new new technique that is being used it's called vote denial uh and it's also called vote dilution and and those are two terms but each one has a has a very significant meaning a a vote denial would be if if the state or the jurisdiction requires voter id you had to produce you would have to produce a voter identification card or photo identification that would be vote denial if if we want to talk about vote dilution we might want to look at at redistricting like the north carolina legislature is getting ready to engage in now whether african-american communities would be held together so they can vote cohesively or whether african-american voters will be fractured and and splurted and placed in into different areas into to different districts and so states are using a variety of techniques right now to disenfranchise voters of color and so we must act very quickly in the congress and we are doing so uh we have passed the the legislation in the house of representatives very proud of it it didn't get a single republican vote but nevertheless we we had the numbers on the democratic side in order to get it passed and maybe later in the program we could talk about the details of hr4 but it's going to be a game changer if we can just get it out of the senate and get it to the president's desk great um do our other panelists want to talk about the crucial role that congress is playing right now i just add briefly that i know we're here as north carolinians or folks with north carolina connections professor charles and we are here uh because of that but uh taking a step back congress's involvement is necessary to um avoid a situation where we have a patchwork access to your fundamental rights depends on an accident of where you live or where you can afford to live or where you were born and the only entity that has the authority to impose that is a federal one and so i don't want our neighbors uh in south carolina to enjoy fewer rights um particularly when it comes to the franchise um than we do and ours are under attack as we as we speak so that's that's just another angle of why congressional action is so important well let me just just add add to that is that the congressional actions like the 1965 voting rights act creates a national floor that every state has to measure up to uh right now uh congressman butterfield talked about 47 states out of 50 that's engaged in some shenanigans to impact negatively the right to vote with congressional legislation if passed and signed by the president that will create a floor that every state has to uh satisfy uh with respect to the rights to vote in that uh in that particular state and then uh so the importance is that now uh we have to run around and attack this matter in 47 different states whereas if there was a national floor uh we would have a common focus that we could uh look at and use that to guide our struggle then to uh maintain this right uh to vote so i just want to just add that caveat to all that's been said professor charles do you have anything to add before we turn it over to kimberly i think the only thing that i would add is um to emphasize the fact that uniformity and this domain also has its importance so part of what makes it hard is fighting on multiple fronts and what congress can do is to provide for uniformity um so that way and this supports an earlier point so that way we're not having some folks who are voting under less favorable circumstances and this is particularly true at the at the national level for congress because we know that you know even though i no longer live in north carolina but i consider um congress congresswoman ross and congressman butterfield as my representatives um so and i think that's true for many people regardless of where they live that is they still look at people who share their values in congress as really representing them and i think that's one of the things that national legislation does well kimberly take it away i know we have a lot of questions from our constituents good afternoon we have i guess congresswoman ross mentioned quite a few questions so we do want to get to those the first question i have here is what is the difference between hr1 and hr4 why do we need to pass both i guess i can i can take that one kimberly if that's okay thank thank you for for asking that question because there is some confusion as to the differences between hr1 and hr4 hr1 is referred to as for the people act we we we want to make it more convenient we want to make voting more accessible to every single american for example we want to expand early voting we want to loosen voter id requirements we want to allow same-day voter registration we want to require states to offer online voter registration we want automatic registration for eligible voters and expand expand access to mail-in and absentee voting those are just some of the things that are involved in hr1 hr1 has passed the house and is pending in the senate hr4 is somewhat different hr4 is intended to fix the voting rights act to restore it to its original meaning uh back to 1965. we want to reinstate section 5 and make it fully enforceable that is to give the power to the justice department to pre-clear election law changes and without section 5 pre-clearance states can kind of do what they want to do and there's no penalty there's no oversight at all the only oversight would have to be multi-million dollar litigation and so so hr 4 is intended to fix the voting rights act now here's the dilemma that we have in the united states senate a 60-vote requirement is is required to to pass legislation uh all of us have heard about about the filibuster and that's that's what it means technically only 51 votes would be required to pass a bill but it takes 60 votes to close debate it's what we call invoking cloture and so democrats do not have 60 votes in the senate republicans do not have 60 votes in the senate it's a 50-50 deadlock and if the senate were to divide evenly 50-50 then it would be the prerogative of the vice president to break the tie thereby making the vote to 50. but both of these pieces of legislation will require 60 votes which means that we're looking for at least 10 republicans to join with 50 democrats to get it passed now i want to go ahead and acknowledge that there are not 10 republican votes in the senate to pass this legislation that is regrettable so what is the alternative the alternative is to surrender or the other alternative is to change the senate rules to allow a simple majority and i've said time and time again that if a simple majority can confirm a a united states supreme court justice then certainly a simple majority should be able to make voting more accessible in the united states and so those are the two differences between hr1 and hr4 thank you so much next question what specific examples do you have of anyone in north carolina who has been denied the right to vote in the last 10 years purpose does your legislation have that is not already covered by current law regarding voting rights i'd be happy to take that one since i we uh on behalf of our clients we conducted a three-week virtual trial in a case called holmes v moore which is the state court challenged north carolina's voter id requirement in the course of investigating that case we um unearthed dozens and dozens of known cases of voters being disenfranchised in the march 2016 primary which is the only statewide election in which we've had a voter id requirement in the last decade and the instances range from voters like our lead plaintiff uh jabari holmes who was doesn't have a photo id to to clients of ours like daniel smith who um lost his id and and was not offered an opportunity to cast a kind of provisional ballot that would be counted so lots and lots of voters disenfranchised we don't have to go back much further to find thousands of more examples when north carolina got rid of same-day registration which representative butterfield talked about and representative ross fought so hard for when she was in the legislature we saw tens of thousands of uh voters showing up who would have been able to use same-day registration during early voting uh whose votes were were tossed essentially because we didn't have that mechanism of voting and voters had become reliant upon it so you don't have to look back very far we also see consistent evidence that these mechanisms of creating new barriers for voting in the political voting and participating in the political process disproportionately impact voters of color so um i'd be happy to point folks towards some of our briefing in the state court if you really want to go on a a bit of a nerdy streak but we're not we're not making it up when we say that these um these laws create real barriers and we're telling the story professor joyner represents folks telling the same story in other cases as well but we've got the receipts i i just like to add one thing to that because it's something that um congressman butterfield brought up so those are direct cases of vote denial like i can't cast my vote north carolina over the last 10 years has experienced extraordinary vote delusion which means i casted i cast my vote but it was deluded because a redistricting plan was unconstitutional violated the voting rights act or had a problem and north carolina has had to redistrict its congressional seats several times over the past 10 years and that was even when we had the voting rights act back before shelby came down and so the parts of the legislature have had to be redrawn the congressional lines have been redrawn as recently as two years ago and that means that people who voted in those elections had their votes deluded and that there were people who were elected essentially in an illegal district making the laws for north carolina and the country for the last 10 years and i just think that's important to mention because we're about to go into the redistrict redistricting process again and let me just add add to that i have uh personally witnessed literally hundreds of people at uh a polling site here in durham at north carolina central university school of law who come here on election day to vote under the impression that they uh are registered to vote and in the past they've been uh registered to vote and because of some administrative action by the board of elections their uh uh right to vote has been canceled and they were not aware of it and uh on election day they were unable to cure uh that that the board of election has has done so they are repeatedly over and over again county after county instances where people show up to vote and their names have been mysteriously removed uh from the uh road due to no fault of their own but through some administrative act uh that's taken without their knowledge and uh without their uh their consent so there are literally thousands of people who are denied the right to vote and if you don't believe me come stand next to me at the next election thank you thank you all next question any eligible american should we offered the opportunity to vote are there any issues associated with absentee ballots well clearly they are here in in in north carolina we have uh the uh uh the congressional district nine where you had balloting harvesting uh going on but people who are in nursing homes people who are invalid who can't get to a polling place don't have family members to get them there uh they have to resort to uh voting uh by mail and the restrictions that are placed on the ability to get those ballots back are very onerous and has presented have presented prevented a number of people from being able uh to uh to vote because if the wrong person takes your vote your ballot uh to the mailbox or take it to the board of elections then you have violated the law and your vote will not count i just want to add very briefly that north carolina has a long history of using absentee ballots largely because we're a military state and so when you think about absentee ballots and a lot of the conversation that's going on around the country um disparaging them keep in mind that um our north carolina military personnel are given that right to vote but if they didn't have those absentee ballots um and a long period of time for them to come in and be received that we would be disenfranchising our men and women in service the other thing that i will say is that that those absentee ballots and um you know we want everybody to be able to cast their ballot yes and we want them to be able to do it safely yeah if i may just add and build on what representative ross said i mean i think there as dr johnny pointed out there are some uh issues that one can wear with respect to fraud and absentee balloting and um and honestly when those things happen they you can catch them um you know so uh there are mechanisms and and plays for noting that um the returns were fraudulent whether it's it seems like one you know one group of people are voting for the same person the numbers don't don't add up um right so so it's important to make sure that we have ways of making that determination but at the same time vulnerable people need to have access to absentee ballot and that includes um vulnerable republican voters vulnerable democratic voters right sort of a whole series of groups of people it's not just voters of color it is also rural white voters so so standing up for absentee ballots is not promoting a particular party or ideology it's just making sure that folks who have a hard time getting to the polling place can in fact have their ballots counted and their voices heard and the political process thank you all for that this next set of questions um focus on the issue of voter suppression first question what are voter suppression tactics that you are seeing in north carolina i mentioned this in my opening um but i do think we're seeing more and more the the manipulation of money or the lack thereof as a means of um impeding fair and fulsome access to the ballot box and we saw that when um particularly when the general assembly was making appropriations relating to the pandemic last year they needed to do much more the state board of elections was doing the best it could to throw money at the problem but they were at a point where it just wasn't clear that there was money to throw at that problem and so i think that the legislature realizes that there's only so much a state can do uh without that money and we see it in the in local bodies uh too we see folks say well um this polling place which might be critical to access for hundreds or thousands of voters isn't as popular as this downtown um early voting site and so we don't need to keep it open we need to be cautious and conservative and of course we do but the the right to vote is preservative of all other rights to vote and if we don't have a political process that really goes the extra step to include all voices and we're making decisions about money and about policy without the input of the folks directly affected by it so that's one of the the more subtle insidious things that we've been tracking around the state that i'm worried about i also think that one of the sneaky ways of dealing with voter suppression and i'm sure that professor joyner will have war stories about it is um the way of moving around polling places from popular areas and popular neighborhoods and off of campuses in particular to make it harder for students to vote and so we've seen this um in wake county where been in an african american neighborhood where everybody knew where it was was all of a sudden during one election cycle not going to be held there anymore or um in the western part of the state there's a perennial fight over whether or not appalachian state university will get a polling place because that is where so many students would vote and so many professors and so many people who are close to the university so those are just a couple of examples that i've seen and and you can and you can add to that and people have a short memory and in this case short memories but for the last three election cycles in north carolina we have been visited with catastrophic weather conditions that closed down polling sites that uh required people to uh evacuate uh from their homes and to move to other areas of the uh state and uh the normal and regular voting process was unavailable uh to them so they had to make adjustments uh in their ability uh to vote and many of them uh went through uh heroic efforts to ensure that that they were able to vote but the inability to adjust to these emergencies creates a suppression of the ability of people to vote and we have to guard against that and must have a procedure in place that's flexible enough enough to adjust to those changing conditions and i'll just add that to the mix thank you and next question i saw recent news that felons were given the right to vote in north carolina how can we ensure important decisions like this will stand well a lot has to do with the continued fight to ensure that we maximize the ability of every citizen uh to vote contrary to popular opinion uh people who have been convicted of a felony are citizens uh they pay taxes they do everything that everybody else who have been lucky enough to avoid a conviction can do uh so they are entitled to a right to vote and the constitution guarantees to every citizen the right to vote and this expansion or this recognition of that right by the court now puts things in place and we have to continue to fight through that so that our north carolina supreme court will endorse that view and judicial elections in this state matter they tend to be lower on the ballot and a lot of folks may not get the information that they need we we all have a collective responsibility to make sure that folks know about all of the races on their ballots but north carolina is a state that elected state court judges and we need to know what what they've done what they stand for and what their judicial philosophy is and have it inform how we cast our ballots and so the judges who decide these important cases under the state constitution have a lot of power and we need to make sure that those aren't um bubbles that are just not getting filled out on our ballots and i had one last question that i will lift up for the group how do you think the election cycle during the pandemic highlighted the need for voting rights reform i'll i'll say one thing about this because it's something i've been very very vocal about and then um maybe professor charles um can uh can pipe in from a national perspective so um during the pandemic north carolina had the longest voting period in the country with the most um opportunities for different ways of voting so we had no excuse absentee voting where you could mail in your ballot we had same-day voter registration at early voting sites we had early voting sites for people who had registered to vote um a month in advance and then of course we had election day voting all during the pandemic so that people could pick the way of voting that was not only the most convenient for them but the safest for them and in north carolina because of that we had record turnout and we didn't have any problem with our election administration none even the pres even the then president donald trump was happy with how we ran our elections in north carolina could have been because he won but he was happy with north carolina and so north carolina should be lifted up as a model for having these extended ways of voting and offering people a variety of ways to vote so that the administration of the election can be done over a period of time and be done safely and i think we are a testament to how all of these methods of voting can be done safely and fairly and conveniently and produce election results that are not disputed by any of the parties i may add just a couple points i completely agree um so two things one is that we saw during the pandemic was how a number of states uh to build upon president ross's uh point really made it easier to vote and that in fact that the fight over voting access um in many respects is just ideological um it isn't that we can't do it it's that we won't do it uh and so many states that's kentucky is uh often held up as an example of a southern state that actually made it easier to vote during during the pandemic northeastern states did it western states did it um and you know no excuse absentee ballot providing ballot boxes modifying the state laws so that way vote the health of the voters could be protected now we also saw some states that didn't make it easier and some that even went in the other direction uh and you know wisconsin is held up as a state that refused to modify its its voting laws um so the pandemic provides us with with a couple examples and one example is we can in fact make it easier where there is the political will and um as we saw from this last election again to reiterate a point record numbers of people turning out that's not unrelated or to put it in more positively it is related to the fact that voting was a lot easier yes there was a lot of political interest but it was also more possible for people to participate sorry had to unmute thank you um kimberly's the timekeeper so she's uh told us that we are now running out of time um but i want to

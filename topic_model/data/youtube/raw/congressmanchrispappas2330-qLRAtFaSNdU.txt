well it's really great to be with you to uh draw attention to the urgent need uh to shore up our democracy to make sure we have a level playing field so that everyone's voice can be heard um and to ensure that we're moving forward in a way where we can make progress on the fundamental issues that matter to the people of this country i think there's a long-standing frustration about the disconnect that exists between the community level and our government in washington dc where sometimes people feel that their voice can't be heard and we know there are a lot of outside influences that affect that process whether um there are large corporations or special interests that have a lot of money in the system it's critically important that we seek reform as a way to put the power of our democracy back in the hands of ordinary americans that is important that is critically important right now as we face a once in a generation pandemic an economic crisis a crisis around climate change and and health and disparities in this country and so we feel that it's important to prioritize hr1 the for the people act as we get to work on behalf of our agenda trying to make a difference i think there's something to be said about putting our house in order making sure that we're taking on these big forces that have prevented us from making progress over the years as a way to set the stage for us to get some wins on key pieces of legislation and move an agenda forward that lives in the in the hearts and minds of the american people but sometimes is stymied by the way our political system is structured and obstacles that have been put in the way over the years

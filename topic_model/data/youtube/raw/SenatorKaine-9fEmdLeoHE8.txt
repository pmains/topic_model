senator tim kaine of virginia is a member of both the senate foreign relations and armed services committees he joins me now senator it's great to see you again thank you for making time for us this evening uh sir you're you're privileged to a lot more information than i certainly am uh you see things differently than i do are we in a proxy war with russia right now and how should americans think about our involvement in that war um eamonn we're not in a war with russia we have no designs on russia we wouldn't have invaded russia putin is lying about all of this but we do want to protect ukraine a sovereign democracy from an illegal invasion conducted by a war criminal and so we and our allies not just nato allies but democracies that care about the rule of law are trying to help ukraine repel this invasion and maintain their sovereignty and if russia pulls out then we're happy and they can go figure it out within russia themselves but we're we're in this to stop an illegal invasion so is there a danger of the us getting drawn into a bigger conflict if we try to do more than just help ukraine protect itself there is obviously the reporting that you know us intelligence is being used by the ukrainians uh in a very effective way that is leading to direct consequences to both russian lives russian military assets inside of ukraine perhaps even outside the question then becomes what if russia interprets that as direct u.s involvement is there that threat um there are risks here aim and certainly and you know like people uh ask the question will this provoke putin the guy was born provoked so i mean i'm not sure that um anything we do is a it's a provocation again we have no designs on russia no interest in any incursions into russia you guys run your own country and do what you want but when you decide that you want to invade another country and violate their sovereignty and lie about it and commit war crimes and claim that one of the few nations in the world with the jewish president is rife with nazis if you're going to do that we're going to stick up for a democracy that that wants to be even more democratic and it's not just the us sticking up for ukraine it's other nato allies and countries that have never been in nato like sweden and finland and countries that always sit on the sidelines like footstore we many many nations are realizing that the russian illegal invasion and the war crimes they're committing uh have to have a deep and consequential response and i give credit to the biden administration for enabling so many nations to link arms and do that uh senator while i have you i'd like to switch gears for a moment if i may and talk to you about another big story this week obviously senate majority leader chuck schumer officially saying that the senate will vote wednesday on legislation to codify broad abortion rights protections in this country it seems that legislation will not pass because it does not have enough republican support it certainly would not pass even if democrats got rid of the filibuster what can the senate democrats specifically do to protect abortion rights what do you want to see the president and your party do um eamonn beginning in 1923 the u.s supreme court in the in the case of meyer versus nebraska started to say that look due process that's guaranteed to all americans in the 14th amendment which might be the powerhouse amendment of the constitution due process includes giving people rights to make personal decisions in their intimate lives and relationships without unnecessary government interference and there's been a hundred years of cases basically laying that principle out the leak last week suggested that some on the supreme court want to throw that overboard but in congress we shouldn't throw it overboard because a century of americans have grown more and more accustomed to living their lives making personal decisions about relationships pregnancy reproduction who they're going to marry who they can have relationships with without government needlessly intruding the vote we're going to have wednesday is going to be a really historic vote trying to codify for the first time a federal statute protecting people's right to make their intimate decisions without unnecessary government interference you're right it's likely to go down because we won't have sufficient republican support but we're not giving up on this we're going to do what we can to protect people's rights to make their own decisions about contraception about carrying a pregnancy to term or terminating a pregnancy and this is not going to end on wednesday senator we're almost out of time but i do want to just ask you really quickly do you believe the members of the supreme court that justices based on this leaked memo misled the congress when they testified under oath that they believed roe versus wade was either settled law of the land or that americans had a right to privacy and that this was not going to be something they were prepared to overturn lied or misled yeah no i i think they misled in the past it's not unusual for a justice with life tenure to do things that surprise the people that put them on the court but i think what we're seeing now is a little bit different people looking the judiciary committee and telling them one thing but doing something else yeah it is a troubling trend if that continues senator tim kaine greatly appreciate your time sir thank you for joining us this evening

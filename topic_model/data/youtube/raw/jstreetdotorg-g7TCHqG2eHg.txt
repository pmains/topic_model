I'd now like to turn the discussion over to our moderator this turning yellow Peter thank you good morning from the full room I gathered that you agree with me that I have a complicated test this morning of moderating the panel of such great minds the good news is that I don't have to do a lot of moderating the bad news for you gentlemen is that you'll have to listen to me when I tell you you're out of time so let's see if great minds think alike a few years ago I attended the World Economic Forum where I heard from chief no negotiator Saeb Erekat in a room bigger than this one where he said if as well doesn't want it two state solution that is fine we will wait we will get our one-state solution the the palestinian you in bed last September's calling for a Palestinian state and the 67 borders shows that in spite of failed negotiation the two-state solution remains the framework for the PLO that the pillow is committed to however since we have failed to accomplish a final agreement Palestinian interest in a one-state solution has seemingly grown Stachel solution is generally presented as a nightmare scenario for Israel the likelihood that Palestinians might one day constitute an electoral majority and a bi-national state which is inevitable is viewed by many Israelis Jews as a threat to the Jewish character of the country but let me read you a quote it goes like this the negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas do not look promising President Obama must think differently if a bath speaks for anyone it's rarely for half the Palestinians the chances that something good will come out of negotiation is not great another option is Jordan if Jordan was ready to absorb both territories on population it was much more easier and natural but Jordan does not agree therefore it is possible to look at another option the option that Israel will apply its law to Judea and Samaria great sidon grant citizenship for a million and a half Palestinians this quote is not as you can imagine by a radical left Israeli who favors the vision of a bi-national state the speaker grew up in battle he's a laconic former defense minister and foreign former foreign minister his name is moshe allen's the article that he wrote which i quoted from was written in 2010 and it was calling for breaking the taboo and Israeli politics of the two-state solution this is now becoming a growing trend in Israeli right-wing circles so our panel today would look at the bases of support for various options out there one state to state green state blue state and what the costs are and the viability is I invite welcome to the stage please each speaker will get eight minutes and then we'll open a discussion thank you very much it was weekend this help those eight minutes are closer than the five-year closer to reality than the five years for a slow process three kids conclusion and so forth the question of whether a two-state agreement or any kind of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank is possible or whether we've passed the tipping point is hardly a new one the first person I remember and certainly wasn't the first person who said this but I remember asserting this strongly was research for Mayron benveniste in the early 1980s then claiming that the occupation was irreversible and that we'd reached the point where a two-state solution or a partition of the land between the river and the sea was irreversible if so the argument goes there is no way forward except for some form of single state between the river and the sea but differently the argument is that since there is a single hegemonic power in that territory despite all sorts of internal administrative divisions Israel proper Gaza West Bank and within the West Bank areas under some degree of PA control and those that are not that essentially a one political entity exists then the job is to transform that entity rather than dividing it into two I'll add by the way here that there's an irony the PA is a sort of photo negative of the classic colonial model of home rule in which the colonized population would receive control of everything but defense and foreign affairs the PA controls its own foreign affairs but laughs at specs of critical aspects of control of domestic affairs so the claim is that we the claim for the idea that we simply have to reform the single existing polity is that we've reached a tipping point where partition is too costly in this argument is normally aimed at Israel and the situation that Israel's created that Israel and tranqs minted in the occupied territories especially the number of settlers approximately 200,000 within the next East Jerusalem and another 300,000 beyond over half a million Israelis living beyond the green line by the way the figure that Bibi Netanyahu gave here last year that there were 650,000 Israelis living over the Green Line was apparently a fiction invented to show the impossibility of partition based on the 67 lines so an netanyahu provided additional ammunition for the argument that we've gone too far to to go back a second argument in this direction is the idea of the resistance of the settlers themselves to evacuation the potential for violence and the potential for some sort of breakdown in discipline within the army if the government were finally to decide on evacuation and beyond the practical difficulties the political difficulties that there's a lack of political will or support within the Israeli public much as a two-state solution has become mainstream it's also as a as a possibility to discuss certainly a radical change over the last 20 to 30 years there doesn't seem to be the will to carry it out and complementing that is that there is a lack of will internationally and especially in this city to push for a two-state solution and part of the reason behind that is supposedly the difficulty result not supposedly but actually the difficulty of resolving issues such as the refugees the holy places water use economic relations the military and again borders and settlement however i would like to argue that measuring a the potential for reaching a two-state solution versus and one state agreement can't take place in a vacuum you have to ask equally what the costs of one state are as an outcome not the current reality but a reformed single political entity a democratized one state and what are the political barriers to achieving that before you can compare the two alternatives I would like to stress before going into that the details of this that it's a little bit too easy in the American context to think of it one person one vote between the river and the sea in terms of an individualistic liberal society what you would be doing instead is combining in one state to highly mobilized ethnic communities for whom national identity is the most basic identity you ask a young Israeli Jews or young Palestinians who are you and their answer is much more likely to be Jew or Palestinian long before they're going to say I go to such-and-such school or I or a little bit later in life I am a student or I am an accountant or I am the primary identity is is is national there's an each side and intense national narrative built around the history and the conflict in the view of the other and the highly nationalistic connection to place and for many many people on both the israeli-palestinian sides an extremely nationalistic interpretation of religion so you're taking two national communities not just a collection of individuals and putting them within a single state a single state in that context whether built on one person one vote or parody of representation between the two communities or even a federal structure poses the following situation it would take boarders off the table as an issue unless of course you chose a federal solution in which case you'd still have to decide what the boundaries were between the federal territories are Canton's or whatever the particular proposal is you'd have a new single Parliament insured judiciary today if it took place at the moment it would be more or less 50 50 divided if built on one person one vote and you would still need to deal with virtually all of the other issues on the israeli-palestinian agenda you'd still need to deal with the settlement issue because the settlements are built largely on land that will be claimed by individual Palestinians as private property and if that claim is made before any court willing to consider their claims it is an extremely strong legal claim most of the smaller settlements are based on a membership only charter would single state allow that continued residential discrimination are try to eliminate it who would force the eviction or integration of such communities I shared military force a Jewish force who would do it the same issues that we face in terms of the settlements would now be the internal problem of this shared State the right of return would not disappear from the agenda instead it would be an issue to be dealt with by the divided Parliament or perhaps judiciary of the single state the control of holy places would now be a domestic issue in addition to that you would have new issues of shared education of a curriculum of economics the per capita GDP in the West Bank excluding settlers is about one tenth of that of israel-palestinian parties within a shared Parliament would rightfully demand redistribution of wealth Israelis would resist this and the problem of enacting any kind of redistribution would be that the engines of the Israeli economy are entirely portable we are not dealing with South Africa's and actual resources the the development centers of Google and Intel can is easily be located in Palo Alto or Cypress as they can on the Israeli coast the best case outcome of this the utopian outcome of this situation would look like Belgium where it's simply impossible to form a government but we have no shared history of cooperation or nor do we have the exoskeleton of the political exoskeleton of the European Union to keep us together more likely a approximations of what would happen is Bosnia or Lebanon in other words the one state arrangement poses an extremely high risk of leaving leading to a failed state it's true that many of the issues which I've just stated could be worked out in negotiations before at the transition but in that case you're again negotiating on the same issues which you said you were moving to a one state agreement in order to avoid negotiating and you would be negotiating them within the more framework of assured quality moreover despite when the impression one might get from looking at the editorial page of Haaretz our conversations in certain small enclaves around the coffee shop senior Israeli universities the resistance to a once trade agreement a once trade agreement that is meaningful I leave out of this the ideas of Arts and rivalen and so forth which I do not think are intended toward actually quality the resistance to a real one state agreement is far higher within the Israeli public than to a two-state agreement in fact it's almost impossible to come across pulling on the subject because the poster is simply going to ask a question which seems your relevant to the people that they're talking to so you have a situation where somebody's is my metaphor this is our sick ship is going down somebody has proposed the lifeboat of a two-state solution you say well that's a rickety lifeboat so the proposal is then we'll flap our wings and fly to shore a very difficult to implement and a politically difficult to achieve solution is replaced by one which is less workable and even more politically difficult to achieve against this and and here I'm summing up is that the status quo is not static settlement is continuing and the real question is the longer we go on in the current situation the higher the price is of a renewed partition that longer we go on the greater is the international isolation is for likely to be for Israel and the greater the risk heaven forfend a new round of violence that neat brings us back to the need for instead of talking about abstract and utopian solutions for the hard work of political action on three fronts to bring two states those three fronts are the Palestinian front where there is a need for overcoming the conflicts of the past the deep introducing battles that have afflicted Palestinian politics working on reconciliation in order to provide a single front and on a strategy of non-violent distance on the American front okay you guys have started I'm glad you're all here now you have to step it up the hard work comes afterwards this is great but the Long March has just begun and there's tremendous need for a much much higher level of political pressure on the American government and within the American Jewish mainstream which tent claims to represent you in terms of shifting the position of the American government and and motivating it to be involved and thirdly most importantly is in terms of Israel is in terms of instead of despairing of working toward a rear entry of the Peace Camp into politics based on the reality that there is a partner and the dangers of not changing directions the thing that bothers me most about talk of there's no chance of moving are the only chance that we have of moving is toward one state is that both of these are forms of despair that act as as a valium that prevent people from from continuing the hard day to day work of of working for change thank you very much thank you goes on for a very elaborate of opening and for keeping time and menachem please thank you very much the AL thank you very much for all of you coming so early in the morning and they're hearing so bad news I don't sorry but I maybe I have some optimistic conclusion but at first the bad news where we are today we are not in a limbo so the question is not in my view is not okay we have a neutral space now we live in a neutral space in the israel-palestine West Bank and we can choose between one state or to state and we are we are still in an open a open space no we did factor live in a one regime from Jordan to the rid Mediterranean it is the Israeli regime Israel rules the whole area from Jordan to the Mediterranean it is a discriminatory ruling system overall palestinians living from Jordan to the Mediterranean on a different level of discrimination and I will not go into details to analyze this ruling system this regime I made it in my book the shift but definitely the problem is not which direction to take from a neutral space either to one state or to state but how to move from a defect or discriminatory one regime it's not a state but it's a regime to either one state or two states this is a completely different a different question but this is the the question that we deal with how we abolish this regime in order to get something different that's first second what are the options or in its better also to know not just the the options and I agree with the with the report or the balance that girl from made but also to have to bear in mind the cost of each option first let's let's deal with the what what the one state option egalitarian one state option of course this has also subdivisions it we can speak about one man one vote or we can speak about a federation can't owns any kind of a political structure that brings together two different ethnic groups or different ethnic entities under one umbrella and that the other option is the division of the territory to 22 states the two-state solution now what are the prices of the first option of an egalitarian one state first and this is a very difficult and very rarely we hear about this cost it calls to change both national identities if we go to two-state solution it's very easy to say and to conclude okay i have my right of self-determination i speak now as an a israeli jew i have my right for self-determination i take control over my own territory and I exercise my identity and my sovereignty in this territory I don't care what they do there it's their problem the same goes also for the Palestinians but once we live under one state it means that the other is also my own in a way or another in my own self identity I have to include the other as a Palestinian and Palestinian must include me as a Israeli Zionist into his or her vision identity this was not done ever both Zionist views Israeli national identity or the Palestinian national movement the past the Palestinian national movement or the Zionist movement is acknowledged is acknowledged today to acknowledge to recognize the other as the other not part of me so going to one state means fundamental identity change rarely we hear about it we speak about other things but this is a very very serious challenge and the second is if we move from two-state solution which we lose the international legitimacy for the solution since the pill commission report 1937 when one definitely when the first time the international community recommended to to divide mandatory palestine since then the international community supports the division of the territory into two different political entities and then they we if we move from the two-state solution to one state we must move change the direction of the international community the whole discourse the whole resolutions and so on it's a very big revolution in the mind of the international community and and international law and diplomacy everything so okay don't misunderstand me the other option is is no less problematic okay the two-state solution the two-state solution of course enjoys worldwide international legitimacy and it's it's built on self-identity both in Palestinian national zionism okay that's fine but taking into consideration the present in the West Bank and the structure the ideological structure of the State of Israel of the Israeli society I am afraid that any final status agreement with a well-known price concessions for Israelis including evacuation of all almost all settlements giving up sovereignty over Temple Mount letting an agreed number of Palestinian refugees to return a very active an agreement on the right of return how to phrase it in the in the agreement this will lead Israelis to use weapon to resist but in arms against this agreement even in my view even after the agreement approved in elections or referendum anyone who follows what's going on in the Israeli society the extremist views and voices inside the Israeli society I don't speak only on settle settle settlements and settlers I I speak about Israeli society in general the problem is not with the settlers because the settlers enjoys enjoy support also within the State of Israel areas anyone cannot I cannot undermine this option it is in the back mind of security service officers it is a back mind of the army officers it's back mind of anyone who deals and follows with extremist voices both in the West Bank and the State of Israel we spoke yesterday it in the pet in the panel on religious radicalization we we spoke about about other expressions of this extremism but it is there just bear in mind one fact Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated not on final status agreement but only on a interim agreement in which no single settlement was evacuated so we we must think differently on the present we must think differently on the cost of each option either one state to state and unfortunately work hard if we support the two-state solution work hard in order to minimize the bloody cost of moving from one state from the current the present the discriminatory regime to the two-state solution work hard in order to minimize the bloody cost that the implementation of a final status agreement with Palestinians will bring about definitely there are no in my view no no return points if the door for two-state solution is closed then it is not locked if it is locked we can break it and they pave and your way thank Thank You Menachem I agree that the identity is not too often and the discussion I think one of our problems and I'm saying this is an Israeli is that the conflict is part of our identity to dr. Mustapha please thank you so much and thank you again for inviting me to your convention and let me tell those who were not with us today yesterday that let me repeat to them that your worker mobilization your activity gives us a lot of hope so thank you for what you are doing I was planning to use some PowerPoint slides like a couple of them because I think this would have clarified many issues but unfortunately the technical aspect of this conference could not manage that I guess we have better technology in ramallah than him so I have nothing unfortunately that's why I have to invite you all to come to her mother and show you the presentation there let me say that let me remind you that back in 90 in the 40s the Palestinians wanted one state solution it was under lots of Israeli pressure and international pressure that the Palestinian national movement decided in 1988 to accept a compromise and that compromise was two-state solution when we agreed on that we accepted to have a state in twenty-two percent of the land of historic Palestine instead of forty-four percent which we should have had according to the partition plan of 1947 so this was a very painful compromised during the last 30 years maybe or 25 years but we've witnessed is a process where Israel Israeli governments have been doing one process which is compromising the compromise and that's why we find ourselves in a very difficult Shin today too many Palestinians after signing Oslo agreement today they feel that they have discovered that they were living in an act of deceit that the two states option was not really meant to produce a two-state option but to produce a system of segregation and apartheid the main factor that is destroying the two states option has always been there which was the continuation of settlement activities and if Palestinians have made a big mistake then their biggest mistake probably was to agree to sign an agreement in Oslo without insisting first on freezing all settlement activities this was a mistake and should not have been done today to ask Palestinians to go back to the table of negotiations again while settlements continue to happen it's like asking two people to sit down around a table negotiate over a piece of cheese one side is tucked behind bars and walls that is the Palestinian side and the other side the Israeli side is eating the cheese at the end of the day there will be nothing left to negotiate about that is the reality in one way or another the Israeli government the United States government their majority of the people in this game are putting in the hands of the settlements the right to decide the future that is the problem and with the continuation of settlements the whole solution of two states becomes impossible what we witnessed today is a creation or a consolidation a to be precise of a system of segregation and panto stands proposals to Palestinians to stick to what they call interim solution in less than thirty seven percent of the West Bank in the form of separate ghettos from each other and have it as solution some people might not like the word apartheid when we say that we live in a system of apartheid of segregation and I understand why you wouldn't like it because it is there is nothing to be proud about having a system of apartheid and segregation in the 21st century but as Menahem said we actually live in that system it's one regime what is apartheid apartheid is a system where you have two laws to different laws for two people living in the same area if you don't like the word apartheid give me an alternative to a situation where a Palestinian citizen is allowed to use no more than 50 cubic meters of water per capita per year while an Israeli illegal settler in the West Bank is allowed to use 2,400 how would you classify a situation where the path the israeli gdp per capita is around thirty thousand dollars while a palestinian gdp per capita is less than 1400 and yet we are obliged to pay the same prices for products as the Israelis do more than that I don't know if you know but we are obliged to pay double the price for electricity and water that Israelis do although they make 30 times more than we do segregation of roads is another issue this is the last place on earth actually the first place on earth where people have been segregated with roads when people inside I'm not talking about roads in Israel and talking about roads inside the West Bank where major roads are exclusive to Israeli settlers or army or citizens I cannot describe to you the level of violations of human rights we've left to see the Israeli army using dogs against our non violent demonstrators in the most vicious way which reminds us of what happened during the segregation system here in the United States so the problem is very clear of course it is either two states or one state but the reality is what we are witnessing today with the passage of time is that people will be up front of one of two alternative is either it's a segregation apartheid system or ones democratic state system this is the choice we will all face unless some kind of a miracle happens and I don't know what that miracle is two-state solution will not happen as long as the balance of power between the two sides is so skewed in the interest of one side that's why we are opting today for nonviolent resistance and we're opting for strong international solidarity movement because we want to change the balance of power so that a solution can be found there are five or six principles that we have to look at if you want to be precise first when do we decide that the two states option is over when is where is the time point at which we both decide that it is over two-state solution cannot work anymore I don't know maybe we've crossed the line already maybe we are about to cross it but the fact that you are having this discussion in this conference today in DC is an indicator that we have either crossed that line or about to cross it second there is no way you can have a Jewish Democratic state and keep occupation and operation of another people it's impossible we cannot have this operation not only because from the moral point of view it is inconsistent with your history and with Jewish traditions but also because we as Palestinians as people will never accept to remain slaves of occupation that has to be understood very well second point if the two states option is dead please understand me here this time it will not be the Palestinian responsibility as many of you would say the Palestinians were responsible in 47 for not having the two states option this time it is an Israeli responsibility and nobody can avoid that third issue to those who speak about let's have and I've heard that with Daniel Levy in a debate we had in New York the other day those who come in and say okay it's difficult to solve Jerusalem is difficult to solve refugee issue it's difficult to solve the issue of settlers the settlers might fight back so let's look for another interim solution let me tell you you cannot have have you cannot have half piece as much as you cannot have half pregnant woman it doesn't work either there is a solution or there is no solution talking about a Jordanian option is another illusion that will never happen the Jordanians will never accept that it's a suicide for them so it's not realistic and it's better not to talk about it fourth point the policies of the Israeli government today and unfortunately many other governments is against the interest of the Jewish people as much as it is against the interests of the Palestinian we are here as I said yesterday and I repeat that we're here struggling for our freedom for dignity for human rights but believe me when I tell you that I feel like many of my colleagues that when we struggle and when we suffer we are struggling not only for the freedom of the Palestinian people but also for the freedom of the Israeli people from the last colonial settlers system and this has to be well understood and that's why what we need is an alliance an alliance of people who are against apartheid against segregation against racism and against discrimination and against the violation of the security of everybody that's the kind of Alliance we need for the future and we need to decide together if we reach that point if we reach that point where the option would be either an oppressive apartheid state or a democratic free state we should all be for one Democratic free states thank you thank you very much Daniel you're already up so first I want to thank ya el and acknowledge what a phenomenal addition to the j street team yeah L is and how excited if I keep going I get extra time right when I see where J Street scum I I get goosebumps and to see so many familiar and friendly faces in the room is it's very moving I want to share for thoughts with you and I'm happy to be on a panel where where I'm thinking and you and and questioning where I am all the time not necessarily on that dichotomy of 12 states but on on how to get forward so so let me share some thoughts with you and the first which is probably the most obvious is given that I think we have to acknowledge there is such an absence of inevitability today an absence of inevitability to the two-state solution that we have to develop strategies that are up to the enormity of that task we have a one space reality as you've heard from all the other speakers it's not going to be easy to translate and perhaps not desirable to translate a one space reality into a once democratic state reality but it's going to be tough to reverse-engineer that into two states and i still think in many respects that's the challenge and it it's a reality on the ground but it's much more than that would barely mentioned the word gaza here but to get to stage you have to reintegrate gaza back into the picture and we're a long way from doing that and if we thought seven years ago when there was the withdrawal from gaza here we go the unscrambling of the egg is possible well since that time we've had seven lean years 4d occupation and seven very fat years for entrenching lee israeli presence in the occupied territories one in ten Israeli Jews live beyond the Green Line one in five of residents of the West Bank and East Jerusalem are settlers one in five residents of Israel are Palestinian Arabs living and in an increasingly more ethno cratic and less democratic reality you know for me one of the most fascinating things of the past few weeks I don't know how many of you follow this this incident of the Supreme Court justice the only Palestinian Arab on the Israeli Supreme Court slim gibran not singing the hatikvah the anthem I thought the most telling thing was my Prime Minister's response Benjamin Netanyahu's response which wasn't to attack Gibran for being a traitor it's to say what do you expect for me that means my prime minister does not see a possibility in which twenty percent of his own citizens are real citizens he said I know it doesn't speak to him he shouldn't have to sing the anthem for me a two-state solution that doesn't address that actually isn't a solution at all because twenty percent of Israelis will continue to be essentially at a fundamental level disenfranchised now there is a new right elite in Israel Benjamin Netanyahu may have said two states at bar-ilan but there's been no Israeli government decision to acknowledge two states the liquid party platform doesn't acknowledge two states and I think we've got to recognize and this would be my second point we've got to recognize that there's a new reality and that the right some of the right and now no longer timid about saying that yes our goal is greater Israel what did you think we were doing when we returned to Zion what do you think we were doing with 44 years of settlement just having some fun there's there's give some credit there's a little bit of gray matter behind what's going on here but I think we need to start seeing that as an opportunity that we can turn to our advantage the right wing have opened up this debate and I'm not so much talking about the one-state debate because in some sense is what I'm trying to suggest is that one state to state could even become a distraction it's certainly a distraction for the new right the debate we need to have is that yes this is about values and to my mind the greatest failing of our collective Zionist project which was not to develop an inclusive Israeli pneus that could confer deep democracy not a technical solution on a piece of paper oh wow we drop a line for two states we managed to work out how many American soldiers and how many Paraguay and soldiers are going to be in the Jordan Valley no a deep Democratic to state vision with partners like must offer if we go down that path how do we reconcile how do we create two democracies what is our shared vision I say to the new right bring it on let's have the conversation about which values are ultimately going to carry the day I don't appear to be naive and if we lose this we lose this and we live to fight another day we don't give up on the Jewish community in Israel we don't give up on thinking about how we shape a Jewish future but we've got to have this battle this can't be a technical thing of numbers oops Palestinians hit 51% game over try next time and we have to therefore think also about new alliances Stav Shaffir was here on the opening night from the from the protest movement it's an entry they're trying to do something challenging to the parent I'm sure our issues weren't front and center but you have to build you cross communal alliances I think the Greater Israel nationalist right has to be defeated sometimes there are political enemies that can't be won over and can't be co-opted they have to be defeated I'm not sure that that is true of all of those who constitute the current ruling coalition in Israel I'm not sure that we can't win over we can't change the outlook of some of the Putin asst populace that we can't change we can't change how some of the hair community view to state versus one state which leads me to my third point which is tactics that many of you have probably heard me talk about incentive structures I come down firmly on the line that the current incentive structure for Israelis mitigates against a serious conversation in Israel mitigates against building a coalition in Israel to get some kind of solution to get some kind of move away from more entrenching of occupation why because the cost-benefit calculation is easy there's no cost to the occupation it's a difficult road to go down but I think we have to acknowledge it and I disagree with those who argue on balance if you go that route Israeli society will hunker down more it will be less receptive etc I think on balance as long as Israeli society can have its cake and eat it could not have to confront these hard questions it's pretty obvious to me which way it goes and in this respect Peter Beinart is right if you're serious about two states it's a no-brainer to draw that line with all the caveats I don't like the phrase Zionist BDS of course the israelian entire economy is caught up in that and I'm not a member of the comprehensive BDS stuff I understand by the way the position that J Street took j street is about working in Congress about working in Washington about building up locally and about challenging the jewish center but we need to take people out of their comfort zone whether it's in the ways J Street is doing it or whether it's in the ways Peter Bernard is doing it and let's face it the entire Jewish mainstream so-called flunked the x naught and the J Street test now you know they have their excuses oh it's the Palestinians and I think most def I said a lot about that when we start boycotting Jews what happens next the Holocaust please if and all I'd say to them is if you're an apologist for the occupation wear that badge with pride don't make excuses that don't pass the laugh test and if you are and if you are a tues data then develop a backbone even if you spend your day blogging at the Atlantic final word because I do want to end with this I would argue that there is a greater resilience to the two-state paradigm then we perhaps give credit for if if we're not stuck to just one model of what two states can look like and I think that's where Menachem was going and I give nationalism its jus spell either way really um and I think it's not you don't have not in Hamas not in Fatah not in the BDS movement you don't have a Palestinian vision of a one-state that speaks to me in terms of my needs of my aspirations on the collective Jewish side so I think we need to liberate ourselves from the idea that there's only one way of skinning this cat maybe we go back to 47 partitions not on the ground border but is the concept the concept without having to do a line I don't know I think we need to think more about it I think we need a new vector though and a new language to add to our conversation because I think we've overindulged the state fetishization of the Zionist project and right now it's I think it's failing us in terms of collective Jewish security but not just physical well-being the moral and spiritual well-being of the Jewish community in Israel and of Jewish communities around the world and and I would say let's just have that values conversation and win that values conversation and so much flows from that thank you very much Thank You Daniel we have 15 more minutes so what I would like to do is to give each of you two minutes to react to each other if you want to if there was any point that you want to grab it then I will give the audience an opportunity for a few questions so that the microphone is over there if you want to line up questions okay please sir Wayne Smith Portland Oregon I think the current government seems committed to the maintaining of the status quo which I think the consensus here is that's unsustainable and unjust well I can't wrap my mind around that I'd really love help from the panel is where do they I mean I know they are not monolithic I know that there's a diversity of opinion but trying to get my head inside their head how do they project this for the future do they really think the status quo is sustainable do they really just hope the Palestinians will sooner or later by attrition leave what what is there in game that they're trying to deal with thank you Wednesday two more questions dr. Barr gude Jewish tradition is rich in self-criticism our entire Torah is filled with self-criticism indeed this entire conference is essentially Jews and self-criticism my question to you is are you willing to acknowledge any Palestinian culpability for the current situation and where is the Palestinian version of j street Brett's Islander from Boston University also for dr. Park Rudy sorry Brett from Boston University for dr. Barr gude yesterday you were talking about your nonviolent resistance movement so today I want to ask you what are the firm indicators that your party the P&I and the movement are gaining traction and seeking alternative paths to the stoop the two-state solution thank you since since dr. Bell Gogarty got two questions I'll have another one more yellow a third question for dr. Burke oudhia oh no um Eric Alterman dr. Burke gude I realized this is a lot to say but leaving issues of justice and fairness aside I'm serious serious because we want to solve this problem I can't imagine the United States given its current given given its political context in any time forcing Israel to make a concession to the Palestinians for a state that the Israelis opposed I can't imagine it politically speaking which means the only way that there can be a solution is for the Israeli populous the Jewish Israeli populace to embrace the solution Israel Jewish Israel is a democratic country which means as unfair as it may be the only path to a solution is for the Palestinians to somehow convince Jewish Israelis that it is safe for them to make the concessions necessary for there to be a Palestinian state how can we get to that path as unfair and unreasonable as it may be thank you for this privilege of giving me many questions I like that well first of all let me let me explain I think the status quo is unsustainable but definitely those who are advocating the continuation of settlement activities and keeping this regime of apartheid on the ground of course they have a hope and that hope is that Palestinians will simply eventually leave or many of them would leave they don't speak about ethnic cleansing but they hope for some kind of gradual slow ethnic cleansing of people in West and Jerusalem first and then that many people because of social and economic conditions would find themselves obliged to to go to other countries well this this is not happening for two reasons first of all because even although there is a certain number of Palestinians who are emigrating because of social economic conditions the growth rate is compensating for that and second because the vast majority of Palestinians have no place else to go to it's very simple so status quo is not a solution what you will see is a rise of course you are right if we we know how politics are done we know that eventually decisions are made on the basis of the balance of power that exists on the ground and that's why what you will see is a growth of Palestinian nonviolent resistance movement and a growth of boycott divestment sanctions movement here in the United States in Britain in many Western countries a what you will c is greater solidarity that is growing on the side of the Arab world especially after the Arab Spring that is going to be the response of sustaining status quo and you could like or dislike these reactions but in my opinion this is much better than enhancing a new military conflict in this situation you asked me about Palestinian self-criticism I think I've just made one when I spoke about the mistake of signing Oslo without insisting on having a complete freeze of settlement activities we did mistakes of course many times I think in the Second Intifada the biggest mistake was the militarization of that Intifada it was a big mistake and it doesn't serve our purpose but today you cannot ask us when we are struggling to in this operation to not not use non-violence not to use BDS not use this and not use that what you can't ask us to surrender to a system of oppression that is unacceptable do we have a similar movement to just read I don't know if it has to be exactly like J Street movement I know two things I know that our movement Palestinian national initiative which was created ten years ago is succeeding it is definitely now the third most powerful force in Palestine it has managed to convince both Hamas and Fatah to adopt nonviolent resistance which is a great achievement and it represents a Palestinian aspiration not only to freedom and national rights but it also represents two very important aspects for our future which is democracy internally and social justice as a system and and I have a great hope that this will grow and this will will will will will be even more more strong in the future stronger in the future now I the last point this is the fourth question I think you spoke about the United States the unrealistic approach of expecting the United States government to pressure israel i agree with you this will not happen but I also I i want to remind you with something that happened four years ago I was speaking on CNN and they asked me about US policy and I mentioned the fact that at that time about four years ago or a little bit more mr. Nelson Mandela was the most respected politician in the world with whom every American president is trying to have a photo opportunity at that time that same man was still on the terrorist list of the American Congress I don't have that interview help but later Condoleezza Rice asked them to remove them remove this shameful thing and they did so I personally believe that we as Palestinians if this situation remains as is and a miracle does not happen in politics we will Joe go through the same that South Africans did struggle for our rights struggle for our freedom our civil rights be the SF necessary and continue the struggle till this system of apartheid ends it will start with grassroots it will what you see today in America is wonderful in the universities I know of many activists here ingested students who are active in different universities you have other movements that are growing and I am very glad always when I come to the united states that the most activist in solidarity with the Palestinian people are usually Jewish people and that is encouraging and that's why I have hope and I tell you injustice can last for decades maybe sometimes for centuries but there is no way that injustice can last forever I'd like to respond first of all to the question of what they think is the end game with a moment of history during the original discussion a few days after the six-day war when Israeli cabinet discussed what to do about the West Bank there were members of the cabinet said we can't stay there it will be colonial if we keep it will end the Zionist project and one of the cabinet ministers who was in favor of keeping it all you sir i'll go Lilly said well we'll have to work out a constructive solution in the future you know a way to keep it without keeping it but the constructive solution in the future it is what you see now this in a large extent is their endgame Israeli settlement a discriminatory system in Israeli rule of everything from the river to the sea what with the disenfranchisement of the Palestinian population and the goal is to engage in havre which can equally be translated as information PR propaganda in other word I won't use here a as a way of selling this as a viable solution so you have to not buy in but this is their endgame they're at their end game in a sense they think that this is a sustainable solution as as long as they can keep selling I'm not talking about the radical settlers who hooks are explicit about wanting to have to push the Palestinian population out but I think unfortunately from you know from my conversations with with Israeli politicians of the mainstream right they think that they can just keep going this way i also want to relate for a moment to some of the questions were asked to to dr. mustafa one is the issue of division on the other side it is a basic quality of conflicts and particularly of national conflicts that people see the divisions on their own side and because they don't know the faces see the other side as a solid mass that is undivided and the irony is the number of times i've read palestinian descriptions of what's going on on the Israeli side the assert alliances between people that I know could not possibly be aligned with each other and Israelis tend to do the same thing they tend to Andrews do to think they look at the Palestinian side which is rife with internal division and argument that is it as sharp as it is on the Israeli side and they see faces that they don't know and names that they don't know and they assume that everybody's united okay so we have to educate ourselves a little bit better and at last I'd like to relate to the unmovable ax t issue you know that American politics is unmovable and I just don't get it I don't understand why you're asserting that you're sitting in a country that has an african-american president in that it's passing gay marriage look I made a Leon 1977 okay if you had asserted either of those as possibilities not 1977 but 1997 it would have been an excuse for somebody to propose that you needed to up your meds but somehow or another when it gets to Israel so I'm gonna say again stop talking about what can't be done and do it I'm sorry we have no more time for questions so i'll just give Menachem and Daniel no we have we have one minute so you just have to give your closing remarks okay okay I short very short see we have three strategic options one I say we all of us here and Palestinians Israelis and Jews we can give up territory and go for a territorial compromise which is this two state solution alternatively we can compromise on our sovereignty and identity and go for a type of one state to translate solution or wednesday problem according to together but a kind of a shared state we compromise over sovereignty and identity I would like to stress that this compromise also is a Zionist compromise and I'm ready to to argue on it as the compromise on territories a Zionist compromise and third third option to have a compromise on democracy which is the status quo on behalf of so called Jewish values because Jewish values contradicts fundamentally democracies this is the right wing argument this is the status quo regime which they compromised over democracy on the name of Jewish values I think that all of us here share that we reject this option so we have to choose between the two other options bearing in mind I said once again that going for for a two-state solution may drive Israeli Jews to use arms against the state authorities and against the IDF soldiers and perhaps a split inside me units we must bring it to the fore not run away from it and discuss it in order to deter those who are consider using arms not to do it and find Democratic ways how to do to go to approve the two-state solution thank you I'll just make one comment and I'll make it in response to to Eric's question which was albeit directed at Mustapha I I don't think that you can say you know Palestinians you've gotta have a strategy that that gets Israelis over there security hurdle I think that's part of it but there's no such thing as a hundred percent security and and actually you go in all kinds of ugly directions when you start trying to implement that as a state I I think that there are ways of taking Israelis out of this denialist comfort zone which partly address that but they address a lot more than that but I especially you know want to double down on what Gershon said to say you know sorry but this is down to you and you've got to convince the Israelis and to take a pass on it not being down to you to convince fellow Americans and co-religionists I mean I can understand why one party in your two-party system would be in a particular place on this issue and by the way don't fall into the trap of thinking oh these are wacky people who deny the existence of Palestinians who don't support two states anymore they're so out of sync with Israel their absolute lling slap bang in sync with what I will call the new right in Israel and the new right wants to redefine this relationship not about shared democratic values of liberal democracies but a shared values of embattled democracies in a sieve zayshul struggle against Islam and I don't see how maybe not overnight but eventually we can at least win this fight in the other party there isn't in that direction let's not pop out on it I just want to say one final word about the issue of changing America you know I know from the history of this place the Jewish community has classically been part of the Liberal Democratic movements in this kind and specially the civil right movement the anti-vietnam war etcetera etcetera but what surprised me when I started to learn about the new alliance that is created between the right-wing Israelis or Jewish movements and the neocons and the United States and I try to understand what are the neocons about and when I see an alliance with a group that says that all Jewish people should go to Jerusalem so that they will be exterminated there or transformed into new questions I just asked myself how come you are doing that it's so strange so please stop that before concluding this session I want to thank the excellent panelist and the excellent participants following this session there will be an advocacy day training that will begin at ten thirty five for those of you participating in Tuesday's advocacy day go there and check your program details thank you

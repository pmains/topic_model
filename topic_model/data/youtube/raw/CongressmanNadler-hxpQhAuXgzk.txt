his Democratic congressman jerry nadler he has endorsed Hillary Clinton congressman thanks so much for being here pleasure um people were worried yesterday voters I mean you know just regular viewers we're worried when they saw her stumbling getting into her van should her campaign have said a day earlier she has pneumonia well ideally they should have but I think that in this day and age when everything about a candidate's health or anything else is exaggerated they thought they they could think they could avoid doing that unfortunately they couldn't but the fact of the matter is she's a generally healthy candidate than in person she has new walking pneumonia and she'll get over it did you were you with her yesterday yeah to a little while before that yes how did she said she seemed fine I was standing near her in the the memorial service it was very hot in steiff and I could see someone uh feeling a little faint or something i left cuz I to go somewhere else just shortly before she did so I didn't see the whole incident someone in the picture of health could feel faint yesterday I mean it and ND punishing pace that these candidates keep up 24-7 I mean it's incredible the stamina they have but that this video here was really troubling I mean watching her stumble a few times and seemingly almost fall to the ground well when you have pneumonia and you have have a it's very heightened you have heat you can stumble yeah that can happen um isn't that it doesn't mean there's anything significant about your help it it's gonna go mine more than a few days is it time for both candidates to release their full medical records so the voters really know for sure and don't have any sort of voters remorse in November I think it's time for candidates to release more Hilary has released considerably more medical records than Trump as Trump's medical record was it wasn't a metalworker it was a letter from his doctors say there was a joke there was no real information um Hillary you see your cholesterol level all the standard things in these things I mean doctor has a dis rajat as a two-page summary but certainly not the full report I I think it would it would serve everybody if all is both candidates released more but you can't compare the two campaigns she released a reasonable medical summary he did not she has shown your taxes he is not and and so much of this campaign really should be should be about the fact that he hasn't released his taxes what are his business relationships with Vladimir Putin and with the oligarchs in Russia what has he paid taxes how many people as he cheated I mean we know he cheats people all the time well his taxes won't reveal that oh they'll reveal a lot you'd be under what they would reveal the fact is it has become standard that every presidential candidate releases taxes without doing that and yeah he says he's released the financial disclosures I do financial disclosures as a candidate as a congressman they don't show as nearly as much as your taxes look we ask for these things all the time how do we compel the candidates to release more well you can't you can't compel it only the voters can someone set down in the show a little while ago only the voters can but I think far more important frankly than the health results I mean we have two relatively healthy candidates I'm sure is the tax returns because what would that reveal that we don't know yeah I know you visited 911 yesterday as you were saying you went to the site what were your thoughts 15 years later hello my thoughts were what a waste what a terrible thing obviously and we have mean the lower Manhattan has recovered there twice as many people live there it's economically booming but the devastation on the people I also remember I worked I represents Ground Zero and I worked very closely with Hillary when she was sending from New York and getting the 20 billion dollars in funding for recovery and other things and in trying to deal with the health impacts and here people don't even talk about it it was the Bush administration and Mayor Giuliani who were telling people it is safe to go back to work when some of us are screaming don't go back to work don't send your kids his lives in high school you're going to get sick move Wall Street we were saying that it was obvious that that they were the toxins were all over the place and thousands of people are sick today and will die because the Bush administration Christy Todd Whitman and Mayor Giuliani told people it is safe when all the data said it wasn't so i know that you're fighting for the 911 health and compensation act to be reauthorized what will that do well it was reauthorized last year we got it reauthorized there that provides two things it provides health benefits health care under central hell thing that specializes in all the diseases from 9-11 for all the first responders and the survivors that is people who live their lives downtown or work downtown to go to school downtown or happen to be there and secondly provides for victims compensation from the reopen the victim stomach it doesn't need to be reauthorized in December or no no we reauthorize it last December it's reauthorized for 75 years for the health benefits and five years for the victims compensation so we may have to revisit in five years there you go congressman jerry nada thanks so much for being here yeah that's good all right

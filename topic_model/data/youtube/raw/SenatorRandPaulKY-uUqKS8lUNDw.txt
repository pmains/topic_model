our next guest lighting up the senate floor just before lawmakers voted on the 900 billion dollar stimulus bill senator rand paul blasted his fellow republicans as no better than socialist in his now viral speech watch this bill is free money for everyone maybe these new free money republicans should join the everybody gets a guaranteed income caucus to so-called conservatives who are quick to identify the socialism of democrats if you vote for this spending montrosity you are no better now with more is the republican senator from kentucky senator rand paul senator merry christmas thank you so much for being here with us a lot of people absolutely good morning a lot of people loved what you had to say on the senate floor react to the recent developments because it's been exposed how much pork is in this when you tie an omnibus to an emergency bill like kovat19 everyone throws their prerogatives of washington into the bill is there a way in which if some of that was stripped out you could support one-time additional payments to individuals beyond 600 or is it both that you object to sir you know it'd be great if they were actually that alternative if they said oh we'll quit spending money on uh selfies to see if selfies make you happy and we'll quit sending money on the mating call of panamanian frogs but guess what they never do that they always add it no one ever takes away any spending that's my big gripe it is of course festivus so i can tell you why i'm unhappy with all these jokers the thing is is they never take away wasteful spending they only add more to it and the bottom line is the only way we recover his economy is we've got to open the economy up unemployment's actually lower than it was during most of president obama's term so we really can recover but we got to get these governors out of the way of our restaurants and our bars and our venues we got to get the economy opened up is the only way we survived this you know senator one of the most important things i think that you said in that floor speech is that congress is enabling lockdown behavior from democrats who have taken this way too far in terms of stifling their own economies but in the meantime president trump last night said that he wants two thousand dollar checks going out is that something that the senate and congress can do before next week you know i saw the president's speech and we've actually included this morning as part of our festivus celebration because he was on a rant and so am i he was unhappy with all the spending to pakistan and sudan and all these far-flung places where we aren't taking care of our own the problem is is if we were to get more money to americans we would add it on top if it were an either or it'd be a little bit different situation but i can tell you from experience in washington these jokers never replace spending i've asked for it all along like i've asked them look if you want to build infrastructure in our country quit spending 50 billion dollars a year on infrastructure in afghanistan but i never get them to bite they'll add it on but they'll never do the responsible thing and exchange wasteful spending for useful spending senator i've long said that fiscal conservatives is now in exhibit at the smithsonian to go and see from the 90s because both parties are spending like drunken sailors it seems in the last decade or more but my question to you this morning is so what do we do at this very moment pete talked about a little bit uh earlier this morning about whether something could actually be done or does what the president has done now put uh mitch mcconnell and republicans in a very difficult spot here at the end of the year yeah the thing is is you need better people there was only six or seven of us who uh you know opposed this smorgasbord debt but if you ask the american people should we spend money we don't have should we run a balanced budget i bet you 75 percent of republicans will tell you they'd rather have conservatives in washington the people in washington run as conservatives like when president obama was in power they said it was terrible the spending and the debt and all this and now they're no better i told people in my speech that it's not that the difference in parties is adam smith versus marx it's really marx versus ingles and i don't think they're happy to hear that but they're always talking about socialism and so am i but that bill yesterday was a bunch of socialist spending and if you voted for it you're no better than the democrats and so that's the problem we have people need to get involved in primaries and elect better people but the people in washington are bankrupting us both parties it's hard to refute what you say there senator when it's a 5593-page bill that you have six hours to attempt to read which means of course no one reads it and leadership has all the prerogatives and their giveaways you've been front and center and trying to expose this for years you've got a festivus report which we've now can confirm is your favorite holiday here's a portion of some of the things in there 10 billion on botched covet 19 test tubes lizards walking out i mean i i that seems like it has to be fake but i i don't think it is walking on treadmills finance a taxiway for airplanes on nantucket island it goes hot tubs see if they reduce stress which we all know of course is true but i don't know why we need to study it what shocks you the most when you go through our budget and realize how much money we're wasting here's one of the worst the national science foundation spends about 8 billion every year uh william proxmire started complaining about in the early 1970s one of their first projects was back then fifty thousand dollars to study what makes you happy well last year they spent about a million inflation i guess about a million if you take a selfie of yourself while smiling and then you look at it later on will that make you happy that's the kind of stuff your government's doing we can't we got a bridge that's broken over the ohio river we've wanted a new bridge for 10 years and we send money to pakistan for gender studies for my goodness sake we can't build our own country because we're too busy rebuilding everybody else's country it's what president trump has always gotten right it's why president trump got all these new blue-collar workers into our party because they're sick and tired of sending money shoveling it overseas and they want it here at home but the thing is is the establishment republicans i call them the big government republicans they never were on trump's side and you can tell you know he butts heads with them they like the spending they've been doling it out ever since they've been up there and i don't know how it ends until we get new people up there that's true senator i'm going to try that study right now on the air i'm going to smile look at it later on the program see if i feel better i hope you do happy i'll be in a hot tub later so if you're going to send me two million dollars to study stress that'd be great senator paul we are dealing with a pandemic obviously the vaccine's been rolled out you criticize congresswoman alexandria cortez for getting the vaccine ahead of more vulnerable populations she has now responded to you do you have a response to her well the thing is is i think the most vulnerable should get this all along i think we should have been protecting the most vulnerable now we have a way to protect them until everybody in the nursing home who has not got a vaccine gets one until every 80 year old 70 year old six year old 50 year old 40 year old gets one aoc ought to be at the end of the line waiting her turn because she's at very very low risk but we're not using any science here so for example i've also said if you've had it you ought to be at the end of the line i've had it and so i might be a little higher risk than aoc but i'm a much lower risk than an 85 year old a nursing home who doesn't have it yet and so really what we need to do is we need to pay attention to immunity the thing is if you're in the nursing home and you've had it we should give it to the other patient in the nursing home who has it we have millions like 18 million people have had it they do not immediately need it i'm not saying they can't take the vaccine at some point but they really don't need to be first in line let's get the most vulnerable done before we get to the least vulnerable and senator i would finally just add that we need our members of congress senators and representatives vaccinated so they can be in washington working here on important legislation i want to just leave it by putting you on the spot here if the president does veto this legislation will you vote to override you know the thing is is that i hope he vetoes it but the only way i would vote for any spending or any additional spending is if it take if it came out of existing spending so if they want to cut the 30 billion dollars we shovel and send overseas i'm happy to vote for that and we can discuss where we can spend it here in our country i think there are a lot of things i think giving money though to people who already working look my kids are working and don't need to check they're not rich but they don't need to check and most working americans don't need to check right now it's a really foolish egg-headed left-wing socialist idea to pass out free money to people so i part ways with the president on giving people free money we should help those who are unemployed by extending unemployment but we shouldn't add to unemployment there are things we can do look in 2008 president obama extended unemployment they didn't juice it up by giving people more money not to work than they were so we've done a lot of terrible ideas that are much worse than what we criticized president obama president obama is now a conservative when it comes to stimulus because his unemployment didn't juice it up he just extended it we didn't give cash payments back then but the cash payments is a ridiculous terrible foolish no good idea because you're just printing up money to give to people why not do it all the time give people a thousand ten thousand why not a million it's a terrible idea and it's going to ruin the value of our currency ultimately it's a scary world where former president obama is a fiscal conservative senator rand paul thank you so much appreciate your time thanks merry christmas and happy festivus

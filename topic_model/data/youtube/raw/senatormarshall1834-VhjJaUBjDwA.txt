at a time when vladimir putin is murdering and killing innocent ukrainians my democrat colleagues want to murder and kill more unborn americans for any reason up until the moment that baby takes its first breath up until the moment the baby takes its first breath if the democrats had their way they would allow this baby to be killed moments before i did the caesarean section this indeed is the most egregious horrific attack on the lives of unborn children and the health of moms in american history listen to what this law would do it goes way beyond far beyond roe v wade it invalidates state laws to protect the unborn child and the health and well-being of the mom it will lead to american taxpayer dollars for abortions at home and abroad it will tie up faith-based hospitals in courts who don't offer abortion services it blows open the door to sex-based abortions it eliminates informed consent and parental consent it eliminates conscious protections i would dare say that half of the medical students in this country and the nursing students in this country would quit if they knew they had to participate in abortions it's a total disregard to mom's health they would allow these procedures to be done in a back-up room apartment in a garage not supervised and overseen by a health department not to the standards of a surgery center it would allow non-physicians to do the procedure think about this i had to take care of women with miscarriages that every gestational age we would not let a an intern do this procedure they would need to be a second or third year resident having completed four years of medical school and two or three years of a residency this procedure is wrought with complications infection hemorrhaging and infertility it goes beyond the pell to think that we would turn this procedure over to non-physicians and finally it prevents any state laws that restricts telehealth abortions abortions by phone i think it's malpractice for people to describing an abortion pill who have not examined the patient themselves no no position would think that that would be acceptable again i was the doctor that had to take care of the complications when those women were hemorrhaging and bleeding and having infection problems in the er that some other physician had prescribed the medicine but it never laid their eyes on them and couldn't take care of the complications i'll tell you this i never thought i'd be fighting harder on the senate floor to protect the lives of unborn babies and the health of moms than i did in the emergency rooms and delivery rooms of great bend kansas thank you

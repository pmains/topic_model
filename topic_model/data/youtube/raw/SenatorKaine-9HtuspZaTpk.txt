all right that's the Republican side let's turn to the Democrats joining us now is Democratic senator from Virginia Tim Kaine uh Senator Kane thanks so much for being with us glad we got the shot going I know all about that uh always you know worried about the live shot being a live reporter for so many years but let me ask you this you know seeing on other outlets have projected that Democrats will hold the Senate that your party will hold the Senate um there were all of these predictions of a red wave I was wondering were you anticipating a red wave you used to be the head of the democratic party um what do you think happened what what what happened well um Jim yeah if you'd asked me in May and I and forced me to be really honest I would have said things look tough but after the Dom's decision and the August referendum result in Kansas I felt very confident that we would hold on to the Senate uh if you told me we would advance and get more seats in the Senate I would have been somewhat surprised but we have a chance to do that um my only surprise frankly was that we I thought we were going to get hit a little harder in the house than we did but it was a great night for Democrats in the holding the Senate uh minimizing damage in the house and obviously we still have a chance to take the majority but also governorships and secretaries of State and State legislatures in a time where President Biden's approval rating is bumping around 40 and people are really worried about inflation crime and some other issues the fact that the party with the White House advanced in the Senate advanced in state houses and essentially held the house even it's a remarkable uh uh evening a remarkable Victory and I think it's a real tribute to the American voters who figured out well we got problems now but one side's trying to deal with them one side standing in the way on a good day and on a bad day preaching weird conspiracies and trying to take our personal freedoms away and let me ask you this because there's still a race to come uh this Georgia Senate runoff that's going to be held on December 6th um do you view that runoff as critical to your party's agenda I suppose it's better to have 51 votes uh than 50 votes for a whole host of reasons uh in particular to be able to continue to put President Biden's judicial appointments on the bench and I suppose there's always the prospect of a vacancy on the Supreme Court to keep in mind as well uh absolutely Jim this um we feel very very good about Senator Warnock um the fact that the ref that the special election on the sixth is just one race Rafael Warnock against Herschel Walker uh Brian Kemp the governor's not on the ballot it's not going to determine whether Republicans get a majority and so I think that will be dispiriting to Republican voters I think their nominee is dispiriting to Republican voters he got hundreds of thousands fewer votes than Brian Kemp did but but you're right to the outside world what's the difference between a 50 50 majority and a 5149 majority well on legislation like the inflation reduction act you don't have to get every Democrat on board you can lose one and still get it passed with the vice president and then the second one is as you point out judges and Biden nominees to keep positions in the Pentagon and state um with a 50-50 Senate every committee is tied and that means Republicans that want to block Biden nominees I'll vote no so they don't get reported to the floor you have to undergo a laborious motion to discharge the committee on the floor before you can even then turn to the nominee and the Republicans use that to chew up time even on non-controversial nominees so we don't get to important business at hand so 5149 would make Chuck Schumer's life so much better than it's been in the last two years and Franklin will get a lot more done let me ask you this President Biden was pretty outspoken about threats to democracy that some of these candidates Republican candidates posed across the country people running for Secretary of State running for the United States Senate Governor all sorts of things one of those races might get resolved this evening out in Arizona D what did you make of that did you think that was the right strategy there were a lot of folks in the Democratic party who are saying no no the president's getting this all wrong he should be focused on bread and butter issues gas prices and all those sorts of things but he really he stuck to his guns and I'm just just wondering what your thoughts were on that um Jim I think the president was right and most of my campaigning was in Virginia with congressional candidates although I also did some work in other states with Senate candidates and both hearing them but hearing this the dialogue with voters voters were concerned with the economy but just because they said that that didn't mean they were voting for Republicans they were unhappy with some economic Trends but they often felt like Democrats were at least trying to address them Republicans weren't they were concerned with autonomy including abortion rights but they were very concerned with democracy and extremism and a whole series of issues bundled into that this was the first federal election since January 6th we've got the January 6th committee you had the attack on speaker Pelosi's husband you had the proliferation of election deniers you had president Trump injecting himself into the midterm which was stupid he should have stayed quiet the fact he injected he's the only thing that unifies every Democrat in the United States Donald J Trump and he put himself right in the middle of it and all of those issues together raise real concerns in voters Minds even those who weren't necessarily thrilled with the economy that this is more than a midterm this is about patriotic people standing up to protect our democratic values and that energized a lot of Voters and I want to give a shout out especially to young voters participated in unusual uh turnout levels in a midterm election in this one Latino voters African-American voters Women Voters once that Dobbs decision came down and you saw the Kansas referendum there were six referendums on abortion rights in very different states red blue and Battleground and they all ended up Landing easily on the pro-choice side of this and energized voters as well and you you sit on both the armed services and Foreign Relations Committee I want to ask a foreign policy question with Democrats holding the Senate and it being very tight in the house no matter who ultimately controls the house what does that mean for military and humanitarian Aid continuing to flow to UK crane does that make the situation a little bit better there were some Rumblings before the midterms about you know Republicans saying well we want to dial that back revisit some of those questions what do you think um Jim we're going to continue to stick by Ukraine a democratic Ally uh in a in a Consortium where we're linking arms with democracies around the globe to show Vladimir Putin or any other would-be authoritarian Invader that they can't invade the sovereignty of a democratic nation and expect the world just to go to sleep on it President Biden has done a superb job of hitting the democracies of the world to link arms and the support thus far in Congress has been bipartisan as you know we voted in the senate for a treaty we don't do a lot of treaties in the Senate but this was to let Sweden and Finland into NATO it was a 95-1 vote we may not get unanimity on votes about Ukraine but I'm I'm convinced we're going to get a solid consensus and that it will continue to be a bipartisan one to support Ukraine and show any dictator around the world that democracies are not giving up on our allies and and just very last question a very quick President Biden is set to sit down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in his first face-to-face meeting is it what do you hope to come out of that meeting does he need to issue a warning to the Chinese leader regarding Taiwan um I think uh Jim it's going to be a really important meeting in both Xi Jinping and Joe Biden had just gotten real political wind in their sails Xi Jinping with another five-year term Joe Biden with a very solid midterm Victory I'm glad he's walking into that meeting with a with a tailwind and I think he needs to be real clear that we're not we're not allowing Nations to just casually invade others um and if if they wonder whether it's words or deeds just look what we've done in Ukraine the Xi Jinping looks at the democracies of the world standing together and he knows we'll do the same thing what I hope though that the leaders will do these are the two most powerful nations in the world maybe in an unexpected way they could find something where China and the United States could work on together a humanitarian project you know something we could work on together because look the China relationship we are economic Partners we're economic competitors where sometimes is in competition other times in direct confrontation it's a multi-level relationship with a lot of challenges but I think the world would would sleep a little bit easier if U.S and China could fight something maybe in the humanitarian space where we could link arms and try to help people out all right very good all right Senator Tim Kaine thanks so much for the time appreciate it glad the signal held up it looked great the whole time we really appreciate it thanks Senator thanks for your time all right still

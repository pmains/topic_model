Thank You mr. chairman I also want to welcome my witnesses today today's hearing is important to help understand the role Russia played in 2016 presidential elections as the US intelligence community unanimously assessed in January of this year Russia sought to hijack our democratic process and that most important part of our democratic process our presidential elections as will learn today Russia's strategy and tactics are not new but they're brazenness certainly was the hearing is also important because it's open as the chairman mentioned which is sometimes unusual for this committee due to the classified nature of our work we typically work behind closed doors but today's public hearing will help I hope the American public writ large understand how the Kremlin made effective use of attacking steel skills to steal and weaponize information and engage in a coordinated effort to damage a particular candidate and to undermine public confidence in our democratic process our witnesses today will help us to understand how Russia deployed this deluge of disinformation in a broader attempt to undermine America's strength and leadership throughout the world we simply must and we will get this right the Chairman and I agree it is vitally important that we do this as a credible bipartisan and transparent manner as possible as we said yesterday at our press conference chairman Burr and I trust each other and equally important we trust our colleagues on this committee that we are going to move together and we're going to get to the bottom of this and do it right as this hearing begins let's take just one moment to review what we already know russia's President Vladimir Putin ordered a deliberate campaign carefully constructed to undermine our election first ruckus russia struck at our political institutions by electronically breaking into the headquarters of one of our political parties and feeling vasta doubts of information Russian operatives also hacked emails to steal personal messages and other information from individuals ranging from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta to former Secretary of State Colin Powell this stolen information was then weaponized we know that Russian intelligence used the quote unquote guccifer to persona and others like WikiLeaks and seemingly choreographed times that would cause maximum damage to one candidate they did this with an unprecedented level of sophistication about American presidential politics that should be a line of inquiry for us on this camp committee and candidly will help one candidate this time they are not favoring one party over another and consequently should be concerned for all of us second Russia continually sought to diminish and undermined our trust in the American media why burnt blurring our faith in what is true and what is not Russian propaganda outlets like RT and Sputnik successfully produced and peddled disinformation to American audiences in pursuit of Moscow's preferred outcome this Russian propaganda on steroids was designed to poison the national conversation in America the Russians employed thousands of paid internet trolls and botnets to push out disinformation and fake news and a high volume bothell basically focusing this material on share Twitter and Facebook feeds and flooding our social media with misinformation this fake news and disinformation was then hyped by the American media ecco che our own social media networks to reach and potentially influence millions of America this is not innuendo or false allegations this is not fake news this is actually what happened to us Russia continues these sorts of actions as we speak some of our close allies in Europe are experiencing exactly the same kind of interference in their political process Germany has said that its parliament has been hacked French presidential candidates right now have been the subject of Russian propaganda and disinformation in the Netherlands their recent elections the Dutch hand counted the ballots because they feared Russian interference in their electoral process perhaps most critically for us there is nothing to stop them from doing this all over again in 2018 for those of you who are up or in 2020 as Americans again go back to the polls in addition to what we already know any full accounting must also find out what any contacts communications or connections occur between Russia and those associated with the campaign's themselves I will not prejudge the outcome of our investigation we are seeking to determine if there is an actual fire but there's clearly a lot of smoke for instance an individual associated with the Trump campaign accurately predicted the release of hacked emails weeks before it happens the same individual also admits to being in contact with GU super to the Russian intelligence persona responsible for these cyber operations the platform of one of our two major political parties was mysteriously watered down in a way which promoted the interest of President Putin and no one seems to be able to identify who directed that change in the platform campaign manager of one campaign who played such a critical role in elected the president was forced to step down over his alleged ties to Russia and its associates since the election we've seen the president's national security advisor resign and his attorney general recuse himself over previously undisclosed contacts with the Russian government and of course the other body on March twentieth the director of the FBI publicly had now acknowledged that the Bureau is quote investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russian efforts in the quote I want to make clear at least for me this information is not about whether you have a D or in our next to your name it is not about relitigate last fall's election it is about clearly understanding and responding to this very real threat it's also i believe about holding russia accountable for this unprecedented attack on our democracy and it is about arming ourselves so we can identify and stop it when it happens again and trust me it will happen again if we don't take action I would hope that the president is as anxious as we are to get to the bottom of what happened but I have to say editorially that the president's recent concept with his wild and uncorroborated accusations about wiretapping and his inappropriate and unjustified attacks on America's hard-working intelligence professionals does give me grave concern this committee has a heavy weight of responsibility that prove that we can continue to put our political labels aside to get us to the truth I believe we can get there I've seen firsthand and I say this to our audience how serious members on both sides of this dyess have worked on this sensitive and critical issue is a chairman and I have said repeatedly this investigation will follow the facts where they lead us in anytime I believe we're not going to be able to get those facts and we're working together very cooperatively to make sure we get the facts that we need from the intelligence community we will get that done mr. chairman again I thank you for your commitment to the serious work and your commitment to keeping this bipartisan cooperation at least if not all across the hill alive in this committee thank you very much I thank you

You earlier this week the attorney general sessions stated We won't be a better healthier nation if marijuana is sold at every Corner grocery store. His Justice Department also signaled that it would raid marijuana industry convention being held on a tribal lands in my state of, Nevada. Now while, it's pretty clear that the attorney general has some other problems to worry about now, I would note that his statement in his department's actions demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of the legal marijuana industry. The industry which is highly regulated in states that have chosen to legalize marijuana does indeed face challenges, in banking, taxes, advertising security, working with veterans. These need to be addressed by Congress. But in the meantime, I invite Mr. Sessions, come to Nevada meet with members of the industry find out how it really works before you may rash decisions about enforcement that will counter the votes of many people across this country. Thank you.

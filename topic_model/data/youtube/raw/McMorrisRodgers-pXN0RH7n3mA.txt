Thank You mr. chairman included in today's markup are two bipartisan bills from the consumer protection and Commerce Subcommittee HR 3851 led by mr. Welch and mr. bill raucous extends the travel promotion program brand USA brand USA promotes travel to the u.s. bringing tourism to areas like Eastern Washington and spurring economic growth in areas that may not be able to market to foreign tourists it also does this at zero cost to taxpayers in fact brand USA offers $25 in return on investment for each dollar at spends and brought in over four billion in foreign spending in FY 18 I'd like to thank mr. Welch and mr. bill raucous for their leadership on reauthorizing this program and urge my colleagues to support it today the second CPAC bill is the u.s. safe web extension Act which I'm leading with representative Kelly Bhushan and the chair woman jan Schakowsky the Internet has made life changing innovations possible that have raised our standard of living and connected us with the world however it's also created new opportunities for criminal activity especially from bad actors in countries like Russia and China to protect Americans the FTC is our top cop on the beat both here at home and abroad the u.s. safe web act is the successful tool that the FTC uses to protect Americans from online threats from overseas and I'm glad that we're extending it on a bipartisan basis on a similar note I'd also encourage support for the bills related to securing our telecommunications supply chain and networks as we work to beat China in the race to 5g it's imperative that we we remove any security threats from our network infrastructure using equipment from companies linked to the Chinese government such as y way or ZTE would be a grave mistake it would threaten our national security and weaken America's ability to win in a global economy I'm pleased that both ENC and the FCC are taking action this will to maintain our leadership and beat China thank you and I yield back

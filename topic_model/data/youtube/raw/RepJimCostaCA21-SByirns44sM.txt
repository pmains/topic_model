9:18 the gentleman from California mr. Costa and a member opposed each will control five minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from California Thank You mr. Speaker I want to thank the the chair of the committee and the ranking member and and all of the staff for their support and work on this important amendment it's a simple amendment to the Water Resources Development Act today as a result of action taken by the Congress in the previous war two bills the Army Corps of Engineers has the authority to accept funds from non-federal interests to update rules that govern the operations of reservoirs owned and operated by the Corps unfortunately there are a number of facilities that are regulated but not owned by the Corps of Engineers and previous order bill so failed to provide similar Authority to accept funds to update the operations of these manuals these manuals are very important as it relates to flood control issues although the Corps regulations specify that water operation manuals including flood control curves should be reviewed and updated regularly the reality is as the Corps does not do this because what they got budget constraints Government Accountability Office reports release of the July 2016 found that the Corps own projects for revisions to water control manuals are often a lower priority than other operations and maintenance activities such as equipment repairs sediment removal or levee repairs as a result the Corps oftentimes doesn't I get to funding these revived water control manuals and this is important you know we have floods all across the country and it's important that these get updated non-core section 7 projects having even lower budget priority the Merced Irrigation District in central California which I have the honor to represent is the owner of such a facility called new exchequer Dam an important reservoir that has served for decades and decades to provide water supply flood control benefits for the people of the San Joaquin Valley the Merced Irrigation District wants to improve the spillway and water storage capacity of exchequer Dam and reservoir and it's going to fund all of the improvements but it's from prevented from doing so for years because the Corps doesn't have the funding to review and revise the projects water control manual as a matter of fact the last time it was updated was over 30 years ago which is of concern so Merced offered guess what to pay for the process but the Corps said well we can't do that because it's not they're not legally able to accept the funds that doesn't make any sense so this amendment would it would resolve this by giving the Corps the authority to accept funds to update operation manuals from the owners of all section 7 private facilities that are in fact regulated by the Army Corps of Engineers so for the good folks of Eastern Merced County this amendment will provide an opportunity for the Merced Irrigation District to explore the raising of the spillway gates at new next record am therefore increasing flood control protection and at the same time increasing the storage capacity of this reservoir that I said has existed for decades to and some years another fifty-seven thousand acre feet of water fifty-seven thousand acre feet of water is a important addition it's a lifeline can be to our way of life in areas like the valley where drought where drought as many of you have heard about is an ever-present threat every drop of water counts so I want to thank the co-sponsors of my amendment representatives Denham and representative Garamendi and represented McClintock for their working together on a bipartisan basis to provide not only tools for the Merced Irrigation District but all other facilities entities local water agencies that have a similar type of project so this is good common-sense amendment I know of no opposition to it and I would like to if not seeing anyone else who would like to speak on it yield back the remainder of my time gentleman from California yields back

she's a mother she's a radio host the list goes on and on I I am in constant mob of how she has served this community because she is born and raised right here in st. Louis Missouri and she has served this community in every way imaginable as an activist and as a surgeon woman she was on the front lines of Ferguson she became herself a victim of police brutality as a nurse she provides and supervises nursing services for the homeless the underinsured the uninsured and other disenfranchised groups as a mother she is raising her kids to know to see firsthand what strength and resilience looks like to know and see firsthand what it means to fight for justice Corey is about the truth in fact she co-directs the truth-telling projects that's another one of the hats that she wears and she has received countless formers for her dedication she was appointed a woman encouraged by the Emmett Till foundation she was awarded by delux magazine empowered 100 women one of the top 50 women of st. Louis and she was also awarded the unsung human rights Shiro award by the st. Louis Coalition for Human Rights and I can't speak as well as she can so I'm ready to turn the mic over to her to tell you all about what she has represented her entire career which is truth and justice it is my honor ladies and gentlemen to introduce to you the one and only miss Laura Bush [Applause] good evening so let me first say I don't often get nervous when I have to speak but I'm nervous today the first reason why I'm nervous is because I'm standing behind the podium like you'll see shortly that I don't do well behind the podium and I'm demonstrative I'm animated and so I'm going to try to work work this so I'm a little nervous about that because I'm all over the place so if you get to the point where you can't hear me you know just wave and let me know because I may be over there so first of all let me well the other reason is just because you know this is a work and is so near and dear to my heart and so it's so near and dear to my heart you know just even thinking about speaking about this I kept getting choked up and I'm like keep it together for it you get together and the reason for that is because when you are doing a work that speaks to people that actually can speak to people in the way that saves lives when your work saves life after life when your work changes lives directly when your work changes families when your work can change your city your town when your work can change your nation that's a heavy it's a big job and so it makes me nervous to get up and talk about it and and again the other reason is because as much as we want to do as much as we want to change there is always somebody to effect so thank you to each and every one of you that showed up tonight that decided to be a part of this organization that decided to be in this work whether you are formerly incarcerated whether you are from the correction system whether you are an activist whatever your role is thank you as a matter of fact you can be doing something else any of those different groups that I've named you can choose to do a different work or you could choose to do no work and just be at home with your family or just be in your little circle you know about yourself and just do your own thing like some people do and that's what they do that's okay but for you that decided that this is the work that you need to dig into regardless of the fact that it's thankless regardless of the fact that even though you do all the work you can that you leave people there that you don't need to affect as many as you want that it there is a hurt that comes from this work thank you for standing so let me just say give yourselves a round of applause [Applause] so welcome to st. Louis so this is the subject I'd like to talk about it st. Louis Park st. Louis is a place that I love and messed up is some things are in this in this town in st. Louis City and st. Louis County I have to say that you know when you get mad at your kitchen your mother your father your spouse you know you're mad and I mean you see all kinds of things the bottom but you know but but you know what nobody else to say anything bad about it that's not your mom that's not just a little you so they can't say anything bad about me but that's how I feel about things so yeah we got some jacked up stuff we also have some amazing things so you know as much as I want to complain and say things about it you know I feel a certain way with other people talk bad about it this is my city this is my town this place is the home of the st. Louis Cardinals it's the home that you know didn't make it to the World Series it's the heart of the setting Louis Blues that actually went all the way it's the home of a freedom it's a free zoo if you want to go it's free it's a home of the place called City Museum where you go when you're in a dump and you'd like to go through jungle gyms and all of that if you want to go from the top of a high-rise building on a little all the way to the ground and still be an adult and they'd be okay that's the place to go it's the home of the arch the st. Louis Arch which college you know you know called the Gateway to the Westin and then issues about that but anyway is the thing that was marching home we have a botanical garden here and we have great barbecue let me just say I'm a barbecue soul food chick and this is the place where you can get this and those have some amazing food if you're a vegan this is a great place for vegan and vegetarian let me say just look it up this is a place where we have a park called Forest Park that is 450 acres larger than Central Park in New York City let me just say we are home to nearly 3 million people 300,000 in the city limits and the largest most populous city in Missouri founded by Pierre Laclede and August Shoto in 1764 which we have streets named after them single became part of the United States in 1803 with the Louisiana Purchase that we joined the Union and slaves there we joined the viewing in that display stay even though the other you know the other territories the other the other land with the Louisiana Purchase didn't but Missouri Missouri is home to where the Dred Scott case was heard and let me just say when you came to this particular place there was a courthouse that she passed to be able to get here that is the courthouse where it was hurt and I'm pointing that way because that's exactly where it sits that is the place where the US Supreme Court ruled in Dred Scott who lived in a free state who lived free territory couldn't have this freedom because as an african-american he could not be a citizen he was not and could not ever become a u.s. citizen there was this Sun so even right there at that location you know it's beautiful that it is if you go out there and look at it people go and they take pictures you know it's beautiful you know as beautiful as it's supposed to be it was also the place where slaves were auctioned if you walked a little bit further down the street and around the corner those streets are where slaves were auctioned those streets also ended up being areas where we protested but I'll come back to that there was a great divorce in 1876 the split-finger was sitting in fabulous County and that thing that Great Divorce I believe is the reason why we have some of the issues we have today and if you came here to hear the great things about st. Louis and how wonderful things oh is this that I'm sorry I wasn't the person to come in to speak because I'm going to tell you the real about st. Louis because it's real people deal with the real issues that have real hurt that's not being addressed because of what is happening we put band-aids on stuff that we want to be politically correct and we don't want to hurt feeling then they want people to just smile and go on but there are people that are being left behind that I'm hurting that are bleeding in our communities well what about the feelings of the people that live in this out so let's talk about it st. Louis is a place where there is higher poverty high crime and another one that FBI finally cried a list all the time one two back and forth redlining environmental injustice we have so many children that you know I'm living with lead poisoning and asthma such a high incidence of asthma and all of these issues and and you know but we get to look at the end at the plants and how the pollution just floats on over into the one of the heaviest populated black neighborhoods in our city high incidence of police brutality we are number one again we get that stat we are another one again for police violence in the entire country racial profiling profiling and gentrification and all of those things that happen in other places but welcome to st. Louis so this work that we do I'm a registered nurse I working most of my work has been in community based mental health or community health so we started the underserved we start the underinsured we have contracts with the Department of Corrections and said hey when this person comes out it comes out of the system they within 30 days they have to come and see you when they think it to come and see me and you know and they get to come into my office in and I get to go through that I get the opportunity to go through their charter see what happened with them when they were a child and see what happened with them while they were incarcerated it see what their condition is now and then I get to also see where we failed I get to see where we failed because I'm looking at a chart 90 percent of my chart started out with trauma a trauma there was an address before things happen and it wasn't addressed inside and it still isn't being addressed it was such a hard work and it still is a hard work because what happens is no matter how much we want to help people and and and people come they come out to the clinic or they come to the hospital because they're saying hey I was told I have to come here or I need help but there's nobody comes to the clinic because you got six hours to just hang around and you just want to watch this old television you know you you know you just want to sit there no you're there because they told you to come and you're there because you have a need but we've messed up because there's not enough mental health services to be able to take care of the needs of the people there's not enough services to make sure that people are connected to their families before they get I don't know how many times I had to I work with patients who say came into my office and said nurse I've been out 18 days then you know what I just want to go back so I'm then you know it's been 22 days it's been whatever I just want to go back and so on let you know right now that I'm about to go back I'm letting you know right now somebody walked into my office he said I got five family members and I'm about to go check out a little mouth you told me to let you know but they I was doing it and today is the day you walk out of my office so as much as we want to think that we've done this great work we pat ourselves and you know and people I guess still hurting here and all over the country and we think about my network is about building families and and I think that's about all of our work but work is about building families because when you build families you build tiles that you build cities and you build the nation when you do that so how do we say even as people who are of this community people that are lovers of this United States of America and all of its issues as much as we love our country how do we say that and we don't understand building families means taking care of I've been incarcerated not just before they go in after they come out but even while they're inside because the issue is we have to do but there is a trauma there is something that happens on the inside I think about children that are ordered that are in detention centers and I think about the trauma that's happening to them and I think about that child is going to be 12 that child will be 21 that child will be 46 one day what are we doing to these what are we doing to them it's so in the same way people that are incarcerated what are we doing if we're not making sure that they receive the things that they need I don't know how many times I've received messages from inmates that have said to me can you come to this prison can you come can you all just come and shut it down the marital stress the taxes on families this trauma on the children with 40 over 4,800 children in just Missouri alone have a parent that's incarcerated but then we tell our children to do well in school we tell our children to you know teacher the puddin amount of in st. Louis gets to be part of st. Louis get to be a place where you know we have this high suspension Brady we have one time it was number one in the country for him apart when I think about the work in Ferguson so Michael Brown was murdered August 9th 2014 Michael Brown was murdered and I just remember what people were saying about oh he's just done look and he's this and that and the Garland's of what he was or what he wasn't and actually turns out he was not any type of anything he was just a person I think about how people had their mouths on this 18-year old baby that laid his body laid on the ground in the hot state Louis 100 degrees but a Sun for four and a half hours with people walking around and little children walking around and his mother couldn't touch him she got to see you land on this ground and she couldn't do anything at that couldn't do anything all they could do was listen to what people said about their child days after I think about how so many of us could have been in that same position so many of us probably put our mouths on my ground what we put our mouths on Eric Gardner Sandra bland so many others we put our mouths on them to say you know what they could have done this to the validation for all of these things but for me I remember a day when I've made some decisions that I probably wouldn't make now at 18 I made some decisions at 18 19 1622 I made some decisions there now at 43 I wouldn't bet on 43 that I wouldn't make people villainized for decisions that they made that each and every one of us could've easily made let me say if you've never been hungry I know what it's like to be hungry and I know what that pain is like and then be safe when I when I would give food to my kids did not eat myself day after day there was a pain that comes with that and there was a pain that comes with not knowing not only can today but I know that I don't even know how I'm going to eat next week there was some thoughts that went through my mind to do some things I would have never thought I do and you may say what only thing I've ever done is look to the grocery store data feed grapes so how much regular how much greater are those people so our compassion should be just humanity love is humanity because there's not one of us that's greater than any other we all have our issues we all have made mistakes or we've all done some things that we may be that we probably could have made some different decisions on and I think about the day that I could have ended up in prison it's filthy because I was riding with the wrong folks and I didn't know what they had as a pastor people say well how did you you know I you know I didn't want to be a pastor pastor the politician can you don't you do that and we're gonna Ferguson and how you doing all of that you know and you know I remember the day when the police decided that it was my turn I guess you know his story started to get you know it's right I remember I was just saying hey I just you know I'm a nurse and I'm a pastor I'm just helping this person and they the police decided well you know what if we don't care that you're helping this person and I'm like no this person's having a heart like yeah okay put the person down and I'm like no I'm trying to save our life put the person down next thing I know they took my body up in the air and I just remember seeing the stars coming to my face and then I remember seeing the ground come into my face and I will stomp like a rag doll by six to eight police officers but I didn't get up Haiti because my love for people and my love for life that I can't hate I don't hate you I just know we have more work to do when I think about the racial profiling that has allowed so many people in our community to end up in the prison system when I think about that 1994 crime bill that took so many of my people away that took my friends away if they did not our gun shop they weren't taken away by gunshot think was taken away by a bunch of dynamited offenses three of whom are me but I can say are still imprisoned for nonviolent offenses in that movie was like 17 but after pastor and a politician merging those says better work should be if I love you if I love humanity I care about whether you eat if I love you might care about with you have shelter if I love you I care about that you have that you have health and wellness if I love you I care about I care about what happens to you physically and mentally if I love you they're not make sure that when you come up and get someone that does not look like you that there is not a physical reaction that's a negative physical reaction that's my work to make sure that that does not happen if I love you that my work is to make sure that you prosper and so that's what all of this this is about one thing that we've done and I'm about to close one thing that we did was our campaign I don't know if you all know but I'm running for US Congress and that's not what this is the bottle but they weren't running for US Congress and people said well you know give this petitioner why are you doing this and you know I was able to go to some companies some corporations now not about corporations I don't do corporations I don't ask them for money but one thing that I did ask them for I said in order to build communities in st. Louis in order to build family in st. Louis we need to be able to make sure there were people when people come out of the system that they have access if sometimes access to healthcare but that they also have access to some money it's not what does that look like that means we go around and we say oh we need more jobs everybody all around the country we need more jobs we need more jobs st. Louis company said you know we don't need more jobs we have plenty of jobs available we just don't have people qualified for the jobs we have special certification that nobody has these certifications so we have 70 open positions at this corporation 30 at this one 60 and so we said well you know what I tell you what if you will hire people that have been incarcerated regardless of what they were incarcerated for if you will hire them if you will tell us what their certification is we will put together our own training for your certification we will run it and then you allow them once they make that once they reach that reach their goal and get that certification then you hire them we have several companies that said absolutely the problem was I didn't win but we're going back again to do that because we that's the work that we have to complete connecting talent opportunity is our work leaving people in the state that there are things were build and how do you build when you're designing we're dividing people saying that you deserve more that you deserve a quality of life so no more divided people this is our word and that's why I started with thank you for your work thank you for every single day that you cared about somebody that was not you because actually that's what this work is whether you formerly incarcerated whether you're an activist whatever your position is whatever you do this says that you care about somebody that is not yourself whether you were there or not you're saying that you know what today I'm not there regardless of what yesterday is I go home to be doing something else but I chose to give my soul but to make sure other people don't walk through the things that I did you chose to make sure that there are the quality of life for people you chose to love people and I and two things there are there's a group of people that say that I'm doing this work but you're not you know I'm doing this work because I've been there and I don't want people to go through the same thing I've been through and then there's another group of people and say I never went through those things but I feel like I feel compelled to help people I felt I feel compelled that's one thing I thought my Ferguson was people that were not directly affected we're the ones that went out there helping those they were I will never forget I'm a preacher so be close to returns I'll never forget being under Ferguson and the police officer was picked up the baton I was about to hit this young black boy crossed his head he picked it up and he was about to him simply because the boy was younger now saying I'm a police all kinds of names but it was just work he didn't touch him the officer picked it up and was about to hit him and this white will became and she grabbed at the time and she said no you won't in the police officer back that she's somebody who was least affected but she was somebody that stood up so for the people that are not necessarily the ones that have been directly affected thank you so for all of you this work is about all of us we are all part of grassroots movement this is a national work that we have to take care of and we look at other countries and they get to space and what's wrong with the United States you know we don't have those problems here it's about us changing them we can't look at what politician is in the seat if they're not doing the work we need to change them out we need to make sure our people are making sure that making sure people know that they can vote and get to change happening in this country look in your communities and stay with is that's actually speaking to this work there's actually doing the work forget just our checking boxes and hitting them nothing clicking the name simply because you know it let's say as you can make sure we're getting the right people in office that will change this system welcome to st. Louie let's get this work done I want you to talk also remember that each and every one of you is a change agent so if you didn't realize it before you are changed each and every one of you was influential in your areas so when you walk outside this door just remember whatever you were doing before that thank you but you know what let's take it to the next level you've got to take it to the next level because each and every one of you was saving lives say I'm saving lives I'm saving lives saving lives you must don't believe it but I'm telling you to do it in this day again I'm saving life people's lives are counting on me if you didn't know before you know it now the point is the point of that thing is to get it down in your spirit so that when you walk outside of these doors you understand the width of what it's on you because let me say this it's thousands of people that could be in here right now that harm you decided to stand up you decided to grab a hold of that mantle so you take that mess when you will be fired for somebody else this is your work get what you need this weekend get this fire take it out and gonna save our communities thank you thank you welcome to say [Applause] [Applause]

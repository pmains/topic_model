hi congressman tracy man joining you from my office here in washington dc have a good few weeks being back home in kansas our kids started school last week which is always good i know that's true of a lot of school districts all over the state typically august is our in-district work period uh that's been true this year that we have been called back for a handful of votes i have enjoyed the last few weeks being able to get out and host a bunch of town halls over the last few weeks we've hosted almost 60 town halls all over the district there's nothing i like more than hearing from kansas the issues that are top of mind and of most concern to to them we're back in washington d.c this week all the talk is about infrastructure and the budget and those things so far at least have been are being combined by the leadership the democrat leadership in the house a total of what's been proposed to be 4.7 trillion dollars i'm going to strongly oppose this you know we are approaching 30 trillion dollars in debt uh if this all passes um in total the spending that's been proposed would add um six trillion dollars in debt over the next few months and a total of 16 trillion dollars here over the next 10 years way too much money not sustainable or good for the country good for or the next few years and good for the future generations other thing that's going to come up this week potentially is hr4 this bill like hr1 i'm going to oppose this would federalize our elections you know kansas counties and kansas don't need washington d.c to tell them how to run an election i believe that that very very strongly and these are bad bills for the big first and back bills for kansas other things that are top of mind for folks certainly vaccine mandates i strongly oppose vaccine mandates i think the federal government provided a vaccine they provide information and now it's up to free americans to decide if that vaccine is right for them and their family so strongly opposed vaccine mandates you're going to see us pushing back on the administration in that regard and also a lot of talk about afghanistan and what we've seen so far has been a complete debacle and very concerned we've got to have a plan in place immediately that's going to get americans out that's going to get people our translators and people that have helped us out of the country and there should have been a plan in place to secure our equipment but what we've seen happen so far over the last few days has been shocking and very much a lack of leadership a lot of bad decisions so we're going to be talking about that a lot as well any needs you have please contact me in our washington dc office here or at our manhattan or dodge city office and thanks a lot

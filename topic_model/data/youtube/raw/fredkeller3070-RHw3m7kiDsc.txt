things weren't always easy growing up we lived in a house with no running water or electricity but no stuff times I learned the values of working hard and telling the truth I went straight from high school to work in a factory eight years ago I was elected to take our values to Harrisburg and as a conservative Republican I fought tax increases now I'm running for Congress to keep that same American dream alive I'll help president Trump create more jobs and opportunities I promise to always work hard and be honest I'm Fred Keller and I approve this message

here now is the republican senator bill cassidy from louisiana he's a member of the senate finance committee senator great to see you thank you for being here we talked about the tax section of this and the uh the committee the tax committee from congress bipartisan it's it's very fair but then there's the inflation aspect of all this it's called the inflation reduction act but in point of fact penn wharton which is from the university of pennsylvania a very fair organization the administration itself has quoted some of their studies before they looked it over and they came to this conclusion quote the impact on inflation from the inflation reduction act is statistically indistinguishable from zero so it's called the inflation reduction act and penn warden says it has zero effect on inflation what do you make of that yeah it's just the way the bill opens up the fact that it's misleading in this title makes you suspicious that it's just leading all the misleading all the way through and you mentioned of course actually in the first two years it can even slightly raise inflation but to your broader point david is this good for the individual's pocketbook well okay inflation it doesn't lower but taxes you're going to pay more of and that same joint council on taxation joint committee taxation speaks of 16.7 billion being paid by those making less than 200 000 a year including those who have reported income less than ten thousand dollars a year this is going to touch the pocketbook and it's going to touch the pocketbook in a bad way for most people and of course it completely violates president biden's pledge has continued he pledges it over and over no taxes are going to be raised raised on anybody under 400 000 this directly violates that it really does and the jct report also shows that over time the percent of the money raised paid by those who make less continues to rise so at the beginning about fifty percent of the increased taxes are paid by those who make less than two hundred thousand at the end of the ten-year window two-thirds of the taxes are being uh you know attributable if you will to those who who make less than 200 000 and so it's really going to touch the middle income and lower income american in a bad way well and of course the inflation tax has already touched us all i mean to the tune of about from anywhere from four to six thousand dollars for average americans uh on everything from food to gasoline etc i i do want to get into joe manchin a little bit here though because it is pretty clear that what motivated him were promises that he thought he was getting from schumer and other democrats that in fact there would be more oil and gas production more pipelines etc here's what manchin said today on fox news let me play the tape you can listen to it i'll get your reaction roll tape you've got to produce your way out of this you can't sit back and wait your way out so are you going to open pipelines absolutely we're going to build pipelines we're going to do how are you going to sell that to the president of the united states on day one it's already been slipped it's already been it's part of the deal it's part of the bill senator cassidy is that part of the bill it can't be part of this bill because it's reconciliation and leasing and permitting cannot be part of reconciliation i think joe would say was going to be in the year-end spending bill all i can say is one of the leaders of the progressive caucus on the house side has said that he he's going to oppose this or he used those words almost and so the point is there's going to be a significant opposition from the environmental left i don't know what guarantees he has but one thing let me say the fact that the president could bring this to the table as a bargaining chip tells you that he already has the power to make it happen when joe biden stood in the rose garden and said i'm going to do everything i can to lower the price of fuel he had in his back pocket things he knew could lower the price of fuel and he chose not to pull them out waiting for this moment now going back to the title the inflation reduction act not being true the fact the administration said they were going to do everything to lower the cost of fuel wasn't true either and if that's not true and this is not true what else is not true but you know joe manchin has been around for a long time i mean one would think that he's seen enough snookering going on inside the beltway that's a technical term by the way uh that that he would know that that he was being taken for a ride yeah well joe's uh a good politician all i can say when we look at it when the joint council of taxation looks at it when pin wharton looks at it when others look at it yeah it's not adding up all right final final question about you're a member of the veteran affairs committee uh you care a lot about veterans i certainly do i got a son who's who's about to retire from the military uh the so-called burn pits bill protect protecting veterans is it gonna pass first of all and and will it pass in a way that democrats won't be able to shoehorn spending that has nothing to do with veterans into it no i'm all for this bill passing there will be republicans are trying to make it better offering three amendments to keep that from happening what you just said we're going to get a vote on those three amendments i think every democrat will vote against them so they'll fail but we felt like we had to get those amendments at least voted on and then the bill will pass tonight so the burn pit bill will pass tonight all right senator cassidy good to see you senator we appreciate you coming in see you soon i hope

today I'd like to honor the life of the Reverend Billy Graham this week I was able to pay my respects to the Graham family at his service in the US Capitol rotunda as Reverend Graham often said my home is in heaven I'm just traveling through this world today I wish to thank dr. Graham for dedicating his life's travel in this world to Jesus Christ message of salvation and the redemption of all men's souls I remember working on my grandparents farm just north of Eldorado Kansas we'd wake up early and work all day in the hot Summer Sun but you can believe that every evening my grandparents would make sure that we were in front and sinner whenever Reverend Graham's program was on it was a great time when families could come together to join in prayer and listen to God's message to my family and families across the world Billy Graham was the most respected voice of faith and a constant message of hope in these times of uncertainty and trial the message of the gospel couldn't be more important and no man understood that more than the Reverend Billy Graham Billy Graham was a man of honor integrity humility and a messenger of Christ's salvation

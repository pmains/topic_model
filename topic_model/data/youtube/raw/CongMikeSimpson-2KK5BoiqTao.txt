Thank You mr. chairman and thank thank you for being here today chairman the economy seems to react almost everything you say sometimes it reacts to things Congress does or fails to do you said earlier that we need a plan to deal with our or at least a plan to deal with our long-term financial debt is important to current economic conditions is that correct yes does Congress's inability to even be able to pass a budget for this current year and therefore our inability to do our appropriation bills for this current year have a negative impact on our economy would you say and if so to what degree well it's important for us to persuade the markets that we have the political will and ability to address our long-term debt and deficit problems so what you're saying is you know inability to pass a budget could be a negative in that respect I have to say in all honesty that so far we're not seeing it in the markets the interest rates remain quite low but it's certainly one of the things that the markets will assess is the political ability of the Congress to work together to develop a longer-term budget plan that will bring us back to sustainability in terms of tax policy you said it needs to be small business friendly obviously with small businesses create a majority of the jobs new jobs in this country does it need to be consumer friendly also and the reason i ask that is is this a time to let taxes increase or to increase tax rates on anybody in our economy we've heard a lot about all the tax rates that we've decreased for small business and investment income and other types of things what about increasing tax rates on consumers i'm trying to avoid as you can see trying to avoid get into the detail debates about specific measures but general but in general in general I think you know right now we have a broadly stimulative fiscal policy which which at the moment is is helping is needed that includes lower taxes and probably higher spending as well but I think in order to for that to be sustainable we need to have a plan in the medium term to bring us back down to a sustainable trajectory and that's what's critical as long as we have the confidence of the markets that we will be able to exit from this situation with a sustainable fiscal program then I think we'll be okay if the markets take the conclusion from our actions that we're unable to do that then we face some risk that interest rates will go up and markets will be unconvinced do markets care in this long-term fiscal plan to bring us back into some sort of balance how much of it is is based on fiscal restraint or spending restraint by Congress and how much of it would be a tax increase I think it depends on this on the detailed structure of exactly what the spending in taxes is again I'm trying to avoid taking sides on this because it's really up to Congress make those decisions but clearly their expertise are well no there's plenty of people have that kind of expertise including the Congressional Budget Office and others but but the point is that we need to find some combination of reforms taxes spending however you want to put it together that's going to assure markets that deficits will be kept under control over the medium and long term one last question chairman mentioned are we looking at a double dip in the economy I continue to hear concern about the commercial real estate market and that it is going to hit it's going to be worse than the home mortgage market that that drove us into the first recession are you concerned about that and what are we doing about what we are concerned about it it clearly is a very weak point in the economy for many banks particularly small or medium-sized banks it is a problem we have done a number of things we the Federal Reserve worked with the Treasury to develop a program to try to restart the commercial mortgage-backed security market beyond that we have issued guidance to banks and commercial real estate and we're trying to work with them to restructure commercial real estate loans and to find ways to manage troubled loans so we're doing the best we can with the banks and with the with the markets this seems to be I would say a few glimmers of hope in the area there's some stabilization of prices in some markets for example but it does remain a very serious concern and we're watching it very carefully thank you take you mr. chairman

first of all thank you to each one of you and each one of your schools that is joined today I appreciate it more than you know uh and this is always the brightest part of my day anytime I get to virtually and meet with you all uh and also uh have so many outstanding students that really want to know more about how they can serve their country with the greatest educational opportunity that the world has to offer so to all the teachers principals administrators and school service Personnel who do so much to support all of you I thank them also last year members of the West Virginia Board of Education told my staff that there had never been a larger Gathering of West Virginia schools to discuss the U.S service academies and this year even more schools have joined our discussion so I'm pleased with that very pleased I'm happy to be speaking to all of you today and and I applaud as I've said before your interest in joining the military there's such a great opportunity to attend college for free and to serve your country also so whether you want to attend a service Academy or you want to go into ROTC or join the guard there's a way to do it and that'll keep you debt free also so you have to apply soon my service Academy deadline is October the 1st so it's coming very quickly this year 2022. the board I have a Academy board they're going to conduct interviews from October 17th to the 21st okay that's October 17th to the 21st but now you have to put applications in October 1st by no later than then uh I don't need to tell any of you all that we live in a troubled world but in all the classified briefings that I've ever had I've never heard that our country has a problem with people wanting to leave so we still have the greatest quality of life and the greatest freedoms of any country on Earth and people basically understand that that's why so many are trying to get here and so many different desperate ways we have to protect our borders we have to make sure that we have secured borders but also we have to have a legal Pathway to immigration that's the growth that's the strength of America diversification coming into our country that want to add their skill sets they want to add their knowledge and basically improve upon their knowledge to be more contributors to a great free Society we are still the beacon of freedom for the world no matter how bad the news may sound or what you see on TV I can assure you we are that Beacon so it's important for all of you to have this this important mission to know more about what opportunities you have in front of you so what I see from some adults on TV in the news is just absolutely just disingenuine you're getting driven by so many different forms of communication and you're getting so much information thrown at you I really have a hard time understanding how you are able to process it you've got five social media platforms you've got then on three cable networks and you have basically the uh the network news so it comes at you at so many different angles you don't know what's right or wrong what's true or false it's up to you all to decipher that but I can tell you the difference is this we are a United States of America not a divided States of America and you can't have people in public office that want to keep telling you how bad things are or how horrible the other side is if I don't have good things to say about my country or the job that I think I can do to help improve your quality of life then I shouldn't be the person representing you or that you should support or vote and if all I talk about is the other person that must not have very much good things to say about myself and my purpose and my desire so remember that you all have something to offer and even the people that you think you have had disagreements with it's people that you might not even like they have probably some good knowledge and some good advice that they could share with you you got to open up it's called communication when you fail to communicate you're going to fail basically to bring people together you're going to have more discourse you're going to have more challenges from all different sides you're going to go to school in the morning say oh God I hate to go because so and so I had bad feeling it's not good someone's bullying you someone's on on Facebook or on in the internet saying things you've got to denounce all of that that is not right the human touch were you all sitting together right now figuring out what's your next challenge in life what's your next course in life what's your next opportunity in life there's not a better opportunity than basically serving Public Service somehow serving you live in a republic the definition of a republic is We Own It You and I when you own something you have a responsibility if you don't take care of it it doesn't last if you invest and take care of it maintain take time to maintain it it'll give you good service and hold value that's what the country is if we have people not willing to serve in capacities that they should not willing to give back to their Community I'll guarantee you we have a harder time holding on to this democracy if you remember your history lessons basically when the Declaration of Independence was signed that for someone people that walked out of walking out of the signing of the Declaration and that Benjamin Franklin was sitting there and someone went up to Benjamin Franklin says Mr Franklin what form of government do we have they were interested in finding out what we had he says you have a republic young man if you can keep it so we're still in that experimental stage 230 years later we're still experimenting because it's never been done before to hold a democracy for this long has not been done in history it has not the freedoms that you and I have come to expect and demand are cherished around the world people would love to have these opportunities that's why it's so desirable to come to America you can't do it unless we do have a proper entry way to enter this country not coming illegally becoming legally because we need that there also has to be a a pathway for service everyone should serve somehow in your community and basically in your government if you want to be involved in government service or in the military and the thing about the military I will tell all of you this there is not more a greater admiration than any of us me included have than people in uniform when I see a person in uniform that means you have taken an oath not only to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States but defend every citizen against any harm from foreign land any adversary that means you're willing to sacrifice your life because you've taken a pledge and an oath to protect and defend against all all enemies that's pretty special and that's what holds our country together right now is all the fighting and all the name calling and everything else you say in the horrible political situations that we hear about every day the only thing that holds us together is our military and public service people who are doing it for the betterment of the good and without that without people continually wanting to serve in different capacities that we're not going to continue to have the opportunities you have so when I was at WVU I I went and it was a land-grant school still is but it was mandatory that we had to be two years of rozzi every male had to be in Roxy so we had two choices either the Air Force or the army and for two years we had uniforms we had to March we had to learn about the freedoms that we have how we defend our country and it was the greatest experience I had and I enjoyed it very much it's not mandatory anymore it's mostly optional so you all can make that choice and also you can get your education paid for by serving the military if you go into the Roxy if you're able to be accepted and go into a military academy you get the highest value of any degree or any type of education that's offered in the world because it's so well-rounded it not only gives you the vocation as far as whatever you choose your vocation to be it gives you an understanding of the world that we live in and how we've become the greatest superpower that the world has ever known and what it's going to take to maintain that if you're that type of a dedicated human being and you want to be part of that then you're doing the right thing today by learning more that's what it's all about Terry and my team are so excited every time we get to work with you all because we look at the leaders I look at the next generals I look at the next leaders I might be looking at the next president but I'm looking at the next Senator I'm sure I'm looking at the next congressperson I'm looking at people that want to serve in so many capacities This Is Where It Starts it starts by you lying that fire to be lit and you wouldn't be on this Zoom right now if you don't have that fire lit inside of you you got to decide what you're going to do with them you got to decide how far are you going to take it you want to see how how what what your character is and how far you can push yourself that's what you're really testing and what we're trying to do is give you that vehicle we want to give you that pathway for it that's what this is all about today so I can't tell you how pleased I am to be able to to come to you all virtually with the technology we have available to us uh to be able to explain a little bit of what we're about and who we are and understand the country that you live in the freedoms you have didn't come free it wasn't given to you it was passed down to you but I guarantee you there is sacrifice and bloodshed for every one of you sitting there for me sitting here there's someone made the Supreme sacrifice for me to live in this country and for you to live in the country for you to have the opportunity of an education education is only as good as you want it you know people said well I didn't get a good education you must not have wanted it then I didn't have this or that I didn't have this opportunity well my goodness this country has grown and born out of very little opportunities but basically determination if you're determined to get the most out of Education you'll have a great education if you're determined to give back to society you will find a way to give back if you're determined to be in the military and give back and defend your country you can do it each one of you on this call can serve if you would like to have a further education and for it to be offered to you free with a commitment of service that you can give back to your country you can do it every one of you and there's going to be some of you lucky enough to be considered to be considered to be in one of our military institutions that they can basically whether it be West Point whether it be a Naval Academy whether it be the merchant marines whether it be basically the Air Force Academy you're going to have that opportunity to be one of those select few but all of you can serve all of you can get education all you can go debt free make a commitment that you want to serve that's it so if anyone has any questions at all I'm happy to take them Terry and do them my best I can to answer them to you all thank you again everybody thank you God love you and God bless you and and we all I always said this I believe in you more than you believe in yourself now you just got to show me something okay

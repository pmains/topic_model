a loss uh congressman mike johnson sixth congressional just district joins us uh mike how you doing hey moon doing all right man good to see you doing great i saw i saw uh proving that i say we post christian country uh little demon uh i just uh disney ghost satanic antichrist movies right there cartoons at that and they said it was really for adults but uh man you you you put out a post and whoa you got more people hit you posted actually watched it on tv i'm taking it most of it's positive too for for uh for christ not the antichrist well i don't know it's about half and half and you know i was compelled to do it yesterday morning i watched that shocking ending to the lsu game like all the rest of us did that was disturbing you know but i made the point that there were other disturbing things too and for me the the worst moment was that commercial break in the second quarter and they played that that uh that ad i guess for this new uh it's a cartoon moon it's a sitcom that's how they label it a sitcom called little demon disney owns fx so they produced it they're marketing that together disney also owns abc of course which is broadcasting the game and you know i was watching it with with my kids one of my youngest is 11 right and a lot of kids i mean every kid in louisiana watches the osu opener right i mean they were it was uh labor day eve so there wasn't school on monday sunday night big ball game everybody's watching all the kids in the living room and this ad comes up the trailer includes these really dark images of hell and demons and satanic imagery and then the explanation that the main character is the antichrist okay it sounds like we're making this stuff up and so i go online to say what in the world i couldn't grab the remote fast enough to shield my 11 year old and i'm just so disturbed by you know i'm wondering you know how many kids are exposed to that but more importantly how many millions more are going to tune in to watch this new series that disney's putting out for people so i i went on facebook and talked about a little bit and man it created a firestorm well but but sometimes you have to do that telling the truth i always found it you can cheat lie cheat on your wife lie steal you can become president united states tell the truth they'll pound you to death that's just that's just the society we live in now they will pound you to death because it's like they want no body to make anybody feel guilty about anything they do now well you're exactly right okay and now here's the irony right so i i looked at the uh the demographics and the tv ratings right so abc disney they you know on that that broadcast the game there was 5.87 million total viewers on the game they estimate and that was the biggest audience for a college football game in a while it dominated sunday night ratings but um as of this morning ironically my facebook post a little critique of their ad just surpassed that number reached more than 6.3 million people so look free speech is an important principle okay by the way go to rep mike johnson on facebook or twitter you can see all this free speech is important in this country we value that we fight to defend it i was in the courts for 20 years defending free speech and religious liberty okay and in this country obviously everybody can make their own decisions about what media they and their families consume okay but a corollary to that is that christians have the freedom to fulfill our biblical obligation to speak the truth in love that's what the bible tells us to do and it's it's even more important to do that when that truth may not exactly be popular so that's the point right we all of us have to speak up we're in a culture war it's real and we have to be very careful today not to let evil things be minimized so they gradually just become normalized in the culture yeah it's uh it's a pretty sick thing mike so i guess the ones that were negative uh i'm not gonna say they're saying this but uh i'm sure they were saying some really not too nice things to you because that's what i notice on the other side they get so ugly so mad and so hateful so quick oh yeah i mean i you know can't let it bother you it never does i mean we're in politics man you're you're on the radio yeah we got pretty big skin you can't offend me i mean look but but i will make this point i mean for a lot of people because the comments are about half and half i mean i don't know i haven't done the math i've lost count you know there's tens of thousands of comments but um there's a lot of very supportive very grateful parents and grandparents who didn't know about this and now are going to be on warning there's a whole bunch of people by the way canceling their disney subscriptions and vacations okay so disney may feel this um if enough people speak out and and maybe that'll make them change their course of action but um but there are a lot of people who got on there and tried to make excuses for this and some of the opposing comments are very revealing i mean revealing they um i was just reading one just a few minutes before we came on uh he said this show isn't so bad and the quote satan actually comes off in some of the episodes is a really nice guy you can kind of have empathy for him unquote say what i mean well you know by the way by the way by the way that is a biblical uh that's biblically correct satan will appear as an angel of life right so that is true and he's lighting a lot of different things so i get it but i know what you're saying in the big picture he's come to steal kill and destroy no no i don't name one of those three that's really good that you think is a good thing to tell your kids about listen all i said in the original post was be careful right our job as parents is to guard the hearts and minds of our kids and the culture has become alarmingly dark and desensitized and this is not a game disney and effects have decided to embrace and market what is clearly evil and i just said stay far from it and and i quoted first peter five eight be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour your kids are at issue here right and look they made a sitcom cartoon about the antichrist okay what else do we have to say i mean this is not frivolous lighthearted entertainment this is serious eternal business and we need to regard it as such yeah mike johnson congressman mike johnson's 6th congressional district were you shocked by the response with that many people responding should i say well you know i had a i couldn't sleep sunday night i'm so disturbed about this and i i kind of felt like i mean i really felt like god wanted me to do that so i thought it would get some attention but i had no idea it blew up like it has and i mean it's just now taking off because now uh you know media outlets are covering it and hayride did a post on this morning and um fox news todd starnes they've written about it so it's really taken off but look maybe it sparks a conversation that's important you know i think it should and i'm happy to have that debate with anybody who wants to wants to do it but look the bible's very clear about this stuff right and if you are a bible-believing christian you have no choice you're supposed to be the salt and white and you know we got to call this stuff for what it is i get burned all the time as being a mean guy because telling the truth is hard and uh you know we do things we go about our own way but people get upset but i i'm not really concerned about i am concerned about this and i think that uh i think people ought to go to a hayride they can i read the a-rod article it kind of goes into detail of what you just said but the post you didn't really make a big big post you just made a post about what you saw and let everybody know what it was about now you can disagree with you you have a right in america to do that it's amazing the left who wants us to always go along with their narrative they don't even want us to disagree with them anymore they got people that disagree with you me and everything else they have the right to disagree you're not saying they don't have a right to disagree but you also have a right as a daddy and as a person in this country as a citizen to voice your opinion opposite of what the narrative is well i i believe that and i believe i have a responsibility you have a giant platform you know god's given me a platform you know i'm a member of congress and so if if leaders and people with a platform and a voice don't speak up then no one will right i mean and look by the way anytime god's people speak the truth of scripture it's going to be offensive to some people it has been since jesus walked the earth he told us it would be right but if we don't call this stuff out right now our culture this the culture of this country is going to be so completely morally descent desensitized that millions of people are going to lose the ability to even recognize and reject what is clearly evil and so we got to take a stand and you know i'm willing to do that and you are and i'm grateful for that yeah mike uh you could take something as simple as marriage i have a right to believe the biblical definition of a marriage somebody else has a right not to believe that correct they have a right to believe that and and the same thing with this you you think you think satan's work is is is a a joke it's a weak all who gets over that well you're gonna see what's gonna really happen and that's the sad thing about it well that's right and the bible says they're the literal souls that lead to people or for eternity or at stake in this little debate about a but about a sitcom this may be a factor you know so look what we tolerate in moderation are children excuse in excess all right always i mean and look by the way anytime god's people speak the truth of scripture it's going to be offensive to some people it has been since jesus walked the earth he told us it would be right but if we don't call this stuff out right now our culture this the culture of this country is going to be so completely morally descent desensitized that millions of people are going to lose the ability to even recognize and reject what is clearly evil and so we got to take a stand and you know i'm willing to do that and you are and i'm grateful for that yeah mike uh you could take something as simple as marriage i have a right to believe the biblical definition of a marriage somebody else has a right not to believe that correct they have a right to believe that maybe and the same thing with this you you think you think satan's work is is is a joke it's a weak oh who gets over that well you're gonna see what's gonna really happen and that's the sad thing about it well that's right and the bible says they're the literal souls that lead to people or for eternity or at stake in this little debate about a but about a sitcom this may be a factor you know so look what we tolerate in moderation are children excuse in excess all right always remember that like if we just turn the other cheek every time we just turn and look away there's a time to every purpose under heaven there's a time to take a stand we are in those times right now it is you were you were required to speak the truth and you should regardless of the consequences yeah it's it's the sentence of shame this is the kind of stuff they're putting out but once again i know a lot of people they're going to disney they're going to disney they're going to this i don't tell them go ahead and go but you're supporting this when you buy ideas and go to disney support i know disney has a lot of innocent a lot of fun stuff and everybody's probably gone at least once and most people i get it but that's not what this is no it's it's it's a slippery slope and they get slid and far down it and when you make a sitcom about the antichrist you've gone too far you got another few minutes oh god i got to take a break i just look quick thing on binding with the mag of speech and he continues to do it you got a few moments yeah sure okay we're gonna take a quick about four minute break come back again six seven minutes i'll get you in and out mike johnson congressman mike johnson

why does america import oil from russia why do we import oil from saudi arabia or uae or other dictatorships republicans say it's president biden's fault that his war on american produced energy is to blame but that's not true in fact it's just an oil industry talking point so in this video i want to explain to you how the oil industry is pulling one over on america making people believe that america can achieve energy independence just through more domestic oil drilling first let's get the basic facts straight after bottoming out in 2020 under president trump domestic oil production has actually been on the rise under president biden and the two big changes biden made in u.s oil policy have had virtually zero impact on current drilling biden put a pause on new drilling leases on public lands but this has had little impact because the overwhelming majority of u.s drilling 90 in fact happens not on public lands but on private lands and even if biden issued new leases for drilling on public lands tomorrow it would take years before any oil is actually produced same story with his cancellation of the keystone oil pipeline now that pipeline was years from being finished and it mainly was going to deliver oil for export to other countries like china not oil for u.s consumers but the story gets better the oil industry is actually deliberately not drilling right now on land it already has permits for right now the oil industry has 9 000 active permits for drilling on public lands alone that they aren't using why well there are a lot of reasons like the price of a barrel of oil is too low to justify the cost covid has reduced demand for oil and there's a general workforce shortage in the industry but none of those reasons are joe biden and it gets even better even if we drilled more here in the united states the oil isn't guaranteed to stay in the u.s market oil producers sell to the highest bidder because they're businesses that make decisions on profit not patriotism in 2020 america produced 18 million barrels of oil a day and exported nearly half of that because if the best price is in china then the oil industry is selling that oil to china they aren't going to keep it in america because they like america more so here's the real story joe biden isn't waging some war on domestic energy production it's the energy companies that have deliberately chosen not to drill in america and keep us reliant on oil produced in places like russia and saudi arabia and even if they did drill for more oil here it all wouldn't stay here it would go to wherever the oil companies could make the most profit the truth is the only way to make sure that american produced energy stays in america is to invest in renewables wind from wind turbines in iowa or solar power from solar panels in california that energy stays in america it doesn't get sold to the highest international bidder so if my republican friends really cared about energy independence and not just oil industry profits they'd be pushing more wind and solar power not oil industry talking points

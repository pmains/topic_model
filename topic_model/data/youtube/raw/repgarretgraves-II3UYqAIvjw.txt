here on the shores of grand isle the road to recovery is still long there are many houses that look like they have not even been touched since hurricane ida came through but speaking with the mayor he says one of the biggest priorities is focusing on the coastal restorations in order to better protect this front line island if another major hurricane cuts this island though what's going to happen is probably have eight to ten feet of water in new orleans or it's saint charles parish we just we just you know we just feel like sometimes we don't count they think they want us to wash away mayor david carmidel is doing everything he can to protect the community he's lived in for decades being a barrier island they are no stranger to storms but as the coast washes away he's trying to do what he calls cajun engineering to protect against the next storm i'm just aggravated you know here every good season is you're here today and knowing that i got 12 gaps in the levy and i got my own little bulldozer pushing you know derrick to try to save what we can on the beach but it shouldn't take that long with federal government there have been major projects to improve other barrier islands across the coast the trinity east islands spanish pass and the terrebonne basin islands funded through the deepwater horizon oil spill payout they're the line between the gulf of mexico and our coastal bays so they're important in that way kind of from an ecological perspective separating kind of the again sort of the deepwater gulf of mexico with our more shallow bays and our estuaries that are more inland for those who live on grand isle it's not just the coastal protection that makes the island important to them the island is magical you wake up in the morning you're looking at a gold breeze you know my grandmother my granddaughter was this morning on the porch looking at the gulf and saying papi this is quiet it's nice and then she sees the dolphins right there in the water with each powerful storm insurance rates skyrocket for coastal communities some don't want to return after ida others are considering packing it up for good and moving inland can't afford the insurance for the town hall or city hall so i want to keep that money to keep my budget just alive to keep a steady check for my employees and the hell with the insurance and i got to do it right and i don't mean that ugly is that it went quadruple on us the island is faced with a lot of the issues the bayou communities are facing delayed insurance payouts contractors not wanting to make the trip south and cost being too much to even begin work mayor carmadel says that he will keep fighting to rebuild and believes more can be done to prevent such catastrophic damage i was raised to give you the last dollar to wallet to help somebody that's what i did i do it every day i feed people whatever i got to do you know but and i don't believe in cutting off no water gas it's just uh pay me later and that's what i do you know but uh just one grain of sand to plant the american flag we're not going to west i can promise you that and i appreciate everything everybody does um it's it's tough and i think you know if i need to run higher up to wake up america or wake up somebody to tell them that you know we belong to america and we need to protect the little towns the mayor has made multiple trips to washington d.c to share the island's story congressman garrett graves is fighting to help them you can't just go out there and build protection after a storm happens that's not helpful you can't come in and charge people unaffordable insurance rates that's not helpful we've got to be more proactive and lean forward a major issue after hurricane lora was the long delay in federal money graves says that process has to be faster when it comes to coastal projects he says the process is always slow and it takes convincing of the critical need louisiana is in a unique situation with how the gulf and rivers impact the geography and the coastal protections are being watched around the globe you can't replace south louisiana and while we're experiencing some challenges with our coastal loss with community sustainability resilience in some cases this is also an opportunity for us because what's happening to our communities now is predicted to happen to coastal communities across the united states and around the world grand isle is just the tip of the spear as the congressman described it the bottom line is we like we're on the front line and if we don't protect this little island that's more water more energy coming in but all the way up the bayous and into the big cities climate change and powerful storms will continue to devastate but they don't have to the people of south louisiana will keep rebuilding

thank you chairman mervin and ranking member rosendale i really appreciate you agreeing to allow me to join today's hearing i i have the honor of representing man grand staff and i think we all agree that achieving top-notch veteran care is the number one priority in everything that we do and i'm committed to doing everything that i can to make sure that this transition to the electronic health record is successful i'm very excited about what it could mean uh there's been a long time goal and so i appreciate all the work that's been done i appreciate all of you on the committee i know many of you have traveled to spokane and everyone is committed to assuring that we have a successful rollout and modernization of the electronic health record i want to thank dr fisher uh who is the director he was on here just a little bit ago but boy he's been on the front lines and uh as the director of man grand staff and just doing all of this in the midst of a pandemic is not easy and i also want to thank cerner who has been very engaged with my office in sharing information and answering questions about the situation on the ground we all share the goal of making sure that this electronic health record modernization serves our veterans and serves them well so i just i had a few questions that i wanted to be able to ask today uh i'll start with mr sendagger i you know we we are getting specific complaints in my office about the electronic health record at man grand staff and one of the most common complaints right now is about the prescriptions and the patient portal and i understand that any new patient portal is a big adjustment but anything that impedes people from getting their medication and getting their accurate medication is is dangerous and what i'm hearing is that the wait times for the call center which is the workaround for the veterans who are struggling to refill prescriptions in the patient portal are too long as another workaround the medical center employees are sending veterans to urgent care to get a 30-day refill of prescriptions so i'd like to i'd like to ask just what is cerner doing now and what does cerner plan to do moving forward to solve these problems with the patient portal so that veterans get the prescriptions that they need and when they need them thank you ma'am for the question i appreciate it and and thank you for your and your staff's support and making sure that we do get feedback uh on the ground and that we can quickly address that um to start with the prescription feedback um as uh alluded to earlier with the medication migration making sure that clinicians were able to get through that medical medication reconciliation quickly and identify the meds that need to be renewed shortening that workflow improved accuracy for the providers in their prescriptions secondly we also held a number of what we call favorite spares which is just working with uh providers on here are the medications that you order for veterans most frequently and helping educate them on the fastest way to go do that so that they can reduce the time it takes them to order and we've seen a significant drop in the time to order on meds from the initial go live until now i personally met with the pharmacy director along with you know all of a lot of the providers on the ground when i was out there and those improvements right off the bat are immediately seeing results the number of uh error and prescriptions has gone way down the pharmacy has been tracking uh in addition ma'am to your question on the wait times um we do track wait times both for clinical staff calling in to our clinical help desk as well as for veterans calling into what is on the commercial side called our consumer help desk okay very good um i just uh want to try to get in another question here too um because the serna system we're getting complaints that it's starting to freeze up more more often and i know i i understand that these are very large patient files and and the history being loaded but we've we spent the va has spent millions of dollars to replace computers and upgrade the infrastructure per cerner's specifications so i just wanted to ask are there further upgrade uh uh upgrades whether hardware or software adjustments needed um we will continuously upgrade the system we have upgrades scheduled you know every six to 12 months we're constantly taking new code to make sure that the system's always modern um and we'll absolutely look at any of those transaction response funds if there's any freezing in any workflow we're constantly working to optimize yes ma'am okay okay thanks again good to be with all of you i i yield back

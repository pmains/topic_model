well good evening thanks for all coming out tonight it's a it's an absolute pleasure just in the just a short amount of time I've been here I saw more smiles than I've seen in the whole month of January in Washington DC so there's something corny about being a dentist but you know there's something about a smile a smile empowers people to come to solutions that means you're willing to meet people and listen and communicate so there's something about a smile so before I get started there's a couple people I want to share in introduce first of all I'd like to share one of our veterans that works in my office Sean Johnson would you wave that everybody he runs my he was a wounded warrior he comes to us for the Wounded Warrior Program he's been absolutely insightful and in regards to our veterans and some Steven Smith he's runs by mail office Jeremiah anyway better ready he helps me over in the Prescott office and then penny is my district director who else do I got Oh where's Garrett where - Garrett go oh right here Garrett's gonna help me with the IT you know so we're gonna have some fun so first of all what we're gonna do tonight is we are going through a PowerPoint everybody that I go through oh I forgot one last person I didn't see him come in here Tom been flying my chief of staff back in the zoo so one of the things we're going to start doing is in every Town Hall I do now everybody has to go through a PowerPoint because we have to understand what we're going to base our decisions on in the future based upon facts compare and contrast and so what we're going to do is you may gravitate to something on the graphed a little bit differently than your neighbor same thing with me but at least it gives us a core fundamental aspect that we can start to share on so we're gonna get started here now the biggest threat that we have to our national security is our debt now it actually came from Admiral Mullen he was right on this he was wrong on the advisory board from Benghazi but he was right on this next one now you know why he's crying because that is the debt that everybody inherits when you're a little one $54,000 and what did they do to deserve that we have to understand what is causing this debt process it's twofold so let's go through the steps to find out why he's crying next so I hear about 2010 we're gonna see the sharp escalation in our debt what's creating this pathway we have to start understanding what's creating this so we can solve it next this is probably the most important graph we were trying to get the 2013 data but everybody is so slow in Washington DC they say they got to be very accurate and it's not accurate but this this will give you some format to base everything off of the red areas here are called mandatory spending okay so they're on autopilot these two areas are the keys that most of us deal with in Congress one is called non-defense discretionary spending and then defense discouraged spending so these are very very key okay so when you look at this these two numbers have gone down over the last two years until this year they actually went down not even growth rate but actually went down overall the budget increased because these were on autopilot and they grew so let's come let's have a conversation this first one right here this interest is abnormally small for the time most economists believe that this is going to double or triple in the next 18 months to two years inflationary aspect so we're dealing with times of 223 billion dollars just in our interest payments it's gonna grow so that's gonna get much bigger so let's come back down here to Social Security let's start talking about Social Security because this is gonna be one of the first things that hits us in about a year we're going to see those that are dependent upon the Social Security disability fund get a severe wake-up call they're gonna see a lot less in their money because it's there's no money left in here it's running out no we'll come back and talk about it okay because I'm brutal about the facts okay but this is going to be our first indices well let's talk about Social Security when Social Security was first started there were 23 workers for every retiree it was meant for a two to four year window not a 10 to 15-year window which we're talking today even if we did have a lockbox and we put our money away and the government didn't touch it and we look back 20/20 hindsight for best management practices it gives you seven to eight years not 10 to 15 and what we've done is elected bureaucrats and politicians back that didn't answer up to China take China changing times so we got problems let's talk about the next one Medicare no go back Medicare big one right here in 1965 when Medicare started when you had a heart attack thirteen dollars buys Yuma enough glycerine tablets for a year in bedrest which was state-of-the-art for for help you know for a heart attack today we're gonna put you on a table we're gonna crack open your chest we're gonna reset those we're gonna put new valves and we may even give you a new heart and the medications that go with it it's expensive now John F Kennedy never did see Medicare but he made a comment he said for these programs that were promising for perpetuity if we don't take the increase of age and the advancement of science will become victims of it home run he hit it field goal you name it he was dead on we have got to start looking at these so when we start pointing at these the success models they're doomed to failure if we don't change so go back to that picture of that little kid crying now we know why he's crying for the most part we've had one spending we don't understand the programs that we have on automatic pilot and we're not willing to discuss them and make changes so we got problems folks Mayday Mayday go back to that so what I was hoping to do is hoping to have some to compare against hopefully the next time I come around we will actually do we'll have a compare and contrast but these two I've told you back and forth have gone back and forth okay yeah I'm gonna pick on something else right there defense I believe in a strong defense but I don't think I should be spending my money while unwisely everybody now I'm not a military guy but the military tells me that out of that six hundred and seventy billion dollars every year up to a hundred billion dollars yeah I said it up to a hundred billion dollars is done in a procurement process that's shuffling papers now oh I'm one of those Republicans that says listen we got to have a strong defense but I'm not paying that hundred billion dollars well by the way I was one of those people the only member of the delegation and the Congress in the house to vote for sequestration because what did I promise you I promise Shell's gonna cut the budget cut spending and I did okay so we wanted that so what did we just do now in this last little budget deal we let the defense often do bad habits again and what we did is we attacked our veterans the last place we should have done we had to go back to this okay so on an equal-opportunity chastiser okay we let the military off and allowed him to go back to bad behavior okay now we'll keep coming back to this one because this kind of these are the numbers that will set you free okay excellent so this is our trajectory and this is our spending problem what these two actually show us is that the most important part is this last year about this right before Christmas we passed it Congress passed I didn't vote for it is tax increases because one of the mantras is we got any increased taxes we're gonna it's going to benefit everybody well that's all it generated that's the only revenue that generated but what it did is it implicated businesses verily and you're gonna see this over and over again now I'm a science guy so what I want to do is if I got a theory I'm going to propose a theory I'm going to put out my idea I'm gonna run it through and I should come up to a conclusion and then I should be able to hand it to you you do the same thing and get the same results okay scientific method in theory hypothesis okay over and over again we're seeing more taxes more spending and it's going nowhere it's actually having a reverse effect so remember this one okay next one so when we look at and anticipated revenues over time back to 1965 and going forward this is what we see this red line trajectory these four programs Social Security Medicaid Medicare and net interest about 2022 will absorb 100% of our budget so what's escalating because remember what I told you back when we started Social Security there were 23 workers for every retiree today 2.3 and falling fast where's my job where's my opportunity okay so big problem here okay go back to that pie graph again what's missing out of this pie graph coming up this year wasn't it it wasn't passed at this point in time Obamacare Obamacare is gonna have another pie piece on here okay so it's mandatory it's mandatory spending autopilot okay so once again we got problems we have to start putting people here they're gonna have a conversation about facts okay fast forward Garet now I get a lot of people saying a lot of debt there's just what's brought up in the news we now China 1.3 two trillion dollars okay so why I say that is that's that little piece right there you the taxpayer are owed the most 52 percent you are owed so security fund is one of them okay and you're not even first in line but look at how it's grown in 1970 was 6% were foreign holdings 1990 19% and in 2012 was 48 percent something about this grass should alarm you late last year in November China didn't show up to the bond market they didn't buy our debt actually Japan and Great Britain and Germany did but if they don't we're in trouble and becomes your paper money becomes worthless then you can't print enough money so Mayday Mayday you better come to grips with economics here otherwise we're all going to suffer unequivocally ok next one if we don't take care of this debt we're gonna see historic tax increases and we're also seeing historic unemployment just a fact it's its life that's what happens and so let's get let's let's address it and grab hold of it next one ok so we did a case study I want to go back to this procurement process that billions are being misspent in here just pushing paper that means that something that would help our military today is not available for 5 years that's crazy that is absolutely crazy men and women that are putting their lives on the line don't have access to something in the military that can actually help because we got a bunch of pencil pushers this has got to change I said this over and over again I will debate anybody in regards to this aspect you have to have efficiency all the way across the board so we have to be an equal-opportunity you know reviewer of this aspects next one these are some of the key points and we want to walk through these panel by point there's lack of trust in central planning leading to increased bureaucracy so some of the things that we see in like elbow joints a little plastic PVC joints you can buy them for $0.99 dollar 35 but why is the military contractor getting $13.50 that's ridiculous we've got to have a Joint Board and they're actually happens to be one that oversees that preference to defense unique versus commercial solutions this isn't this isn't rocket science we got to be able to have a common-sense application that's not just science-based but also common-sense application in the commercial industry distrust of the defense industry and profit motives well that goes both ways but we have to have transparency the way that you air that out is by showing everybody the know it makes it very very important okay and feared that this work workforce is incapable exercising discretion well part of discretion is transparency in holding people accountable there has to be a ramification for bad behavior if there's nothing that we have wanted and bad behavior hence Congress preoccupation with cost certainty and maintaining low prices over achieving results in value yeah they're so predicated that they can't see their nose despite their face so we got problems here in the defense industry and it's worth a hundred billion dollars that's something I don't want ten years from now I want it tomorrow because that gives me closer to a balanced budget so that we're not going into the red and gets us better opportunities for people to get jobs okay so so Point Blank now why do I bring this up because I was one of the people that a gentleman by the name of Barry Broome chastised he actually said that we gotta get rid of those Republican congressman because they're causing a problem in our defense industry he'll know he'll know and he'll know I want my industry I want my cake and eat it too but I want to have oversight I want to be as transparent is what we've been promised I want to be able to share those that information maybe one of you understands it better than I I'm gonna lean on you tell me how we cut okay oh I know oh I know but that's my point he made the comment that we're losing defense industries based upon my vote absolutely not those were gone beyond this so we gotta start looking at these equal and applicable next one tax reform is sequestration okay you know I voted for sequestration I don't run from it I don't hide from it you know I actually make cuts and we just lost all those cuts just in this last budget deal okay next one we were told that the sky is falling the sky is falling absolutely not most of us didn't even feel any effective sequestration and these are some of the biggest cuts that we've done in 20 years real cuts real dollars being cut okay next one we're gonna go through these real quick this got flipped differently than me this just gives an idea for FY 23 2013 we actually had sequestration okay so we actually made cuts and we raised revenues by taxing the rich okay so we saw one trillion dollars in deficit go down so we actually reduced it based upon this and this basically tells us what we did okay next one what the sequestration do it cuts it was supposed to cut 1.2 trillion dollars over ten years so a hundred and twenty billion dollars everybody sick got us a lot of money really let me tell you what I discovered okay I put myself through school as a construction guy okay does everybody know what prevailing wage or davis-bacon is it's the artificial inflation of all government contracts an additional 22 percent so certain labor unions get those contracts let me repeat an average of 22 percent increase so that certain groups can get those competent that-that-that-that contract okay so I put amendments on the floor I can't even get Paul Ryan to vote for okay I want to open competition is gonna save us money right there's no difference in the job I got to still satisfy the same person that's looking over my engineering threshold right so I can't get it so what happens is there's this good there's this agency called the Government Accountability Office and they audit agencies so last year they audited davis-bacon I am sure glad you are sitting down because not 99 not 91 not 95 not 99 but a hundred percent of those calculations for the failing wage were fraudulent Wow that's government it's the best right who so we did a study in our office well by the way we do things like a team so we start working on this so we found out it was the Department of wages that was conducting these equation of davis-bacon and we found out they're pretty crappy at that job I think they should have got a F on that for a hundred percent fraudulent in their calculations right but we found is if we transferred it to the Bureau of Statistics doing a bill which we've actually introduced just six words the calculations of the prevailing wage will be conducted by the Department of Bureau statistics and taken away from the bureau of wages or the departmental wages Bureau statistics do you know how much you would save fifteen to twenty five billion dollars a year without Homeland Security and DoD because they haven't been audited and if you to or include them you could possibly save a hundred billion dollars a year billions be billion and we won't do it oh that's what I'm still trying to figure out okay so anyway we can do this one hundred twenty billion dollars of cuts every year we can do this these are some of the things that they were supposed to roll out but these have been negated now okay next one I'm gonna go pass this one because it really is negated now because of what the budget deal is going next one these were real results so we're actually showing better than Clinton and Gingrich and even Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill so these were significant cuts they were making government accountable to you oh by the way itself to hurt the American public it's meant government to be accountable to you the taxpayer for how they're spending your money that's that's what sequestration is about it's not the first time we've done it either okay next one real savings keep going keep going we had a failure okay so we had a deal conducted by patty murray and paul ryan behind closed doors that obfuscated this whole thing okay we didn't do our budget we didn't do it well we didn't have insights I had 48 hours fifteen hundred and forty-eight pages to look at it in less than 48 hours I will compliment my staff we divided it up we read it we found out why we weren't going to vote for it and there's planning we'll go through all that but this is wrong this is unaccountability and both Paul and Patty are wrong with this okay so once again I'm calling out a Republican I'm also calling out a Democrat this is not big-boy politics this is not what you deserve being an accountable party next one so why did they kill tax the sequester one of them was the military lobby okay they didn't want to have to change they wanted to use bad behavior okay that's one of them who lost taxpayers who won the lobbyists point blank call it like a CEO don't like it now that's what I don't give you a rosy lens you know a color lens picture from my eyesight next one now you're gonna feel the impact okay does everybody know what tilt is payment in lieu of taxes there are zero dollars in there that means us with lots of federal land are going to get no taxes a compensation and this goes to our law enforcement our fire suppression and our education folks we already get less than one-half of the tax dollars that are spent east of the Mississippi for education we get less than one-half are we the stepchildren of the federal government and we get zero guess what we were told we're going to actually take and pass pill with a farm bill really farm bills in trouble so we're trying to extort votes on the farm bill goes on there okay so we were promised that we would actually get this now I actually have something on the table Arizona sovereignty at land act basically present prevents the president from unilaterally making any dictation of federal lands away from the state of Arizona or any state we're dependent upon this were rural Arizona and we still have to actually upkeep roads ask your County Supervisors to all these federal lands you know healthy this is omnes so a very bad bad taste in my mouth based on pelt okay and the speaker and the majority leader actually heard about it from the Western caucus okay and by the way next slide none of your your Republicans actually voted for it okay this actually bloats it up to one point one trillion dollars in in spending it's riddled with pork and waste it's infected with bad policy it's bloated with giveaways passed overwhelmingly with no debate and no amendments it was 1500 plus pages less than 48 hours no one can actually read it there's only 67 of us to the fought back their whole entire Arizona Republican Party delegation said no okay well it gets worse border security cut by 160 million dollars oh absolutely 160 million dollars security in our embassies across the world you remember Benghazi cut by 240 million dollars okay well we were told is is that the president wanted new spending levels for educational programs we've told he didn't get it no got almost a half billion dollars half a billion dollars in let's program headstart something that's never shown any value and in the educational process so we actually invested another half a billion dollars in headstart okay so something's wrong with this equation and it's not just Democrats by the way folks it's Republicans to once again equal opportunity here okay next one so part of the equation is cutting government spending the other part of this is what job creation getting jobs opportunity because we can you can't cut all this away you also have to be able to look at it but starting January 1st things happen here what happened full-time employees based on 30 hours okay and there's a 53 employee threshold in regards to Obamacare why do I bring that up for folks like us with those jobs majority of them now are temporary work 30 hours or less I guess that's full-time work but for us out in rural Arizona we need three of those jobs for every household to to pay for the 40-hour wages and when to pay for the benefits something's going to miss something's going wrong okay go ahead next one plenty of job bills dozens upon dozens are sitting on Harry Reid's like what everybody says okay next one like the Skills Act it actually takes long-term unemployed people and get some training in to re-enter the workforce still sitting on his at the Keystone pipeline 20,000 jobs 100,000 jobs indirectly opportunity energy independence reins Act which require Congress to approve any rule or regulation that costs a hundred million dollars or greater sounds kind of come common sense doesn't it okay so these are sitting on the desk next one what's my focus my focus is getting people back to work what's special about Arizona five C's cattle citrus climate cotton and next slide DejaVu copper southeast land exchange would bring a billion dollars yes a billion dollars a year each year for the next 50 years and almost 4,000 jobs these aren't 30 hour jobs these are jobs that pay anywhere from forty some thousand to one hundred sixty five thousand dollars these are jobs that you buy a house you buy a car you invest in America and you vest in your community oh by the way they pay royalties to where do those royalties go to education there you go you want some money here's a great way of doing this and you know what who loves their cell phone I do sometimes yeah but you know what you don't have copper you don't have this you don't have everything the new cars 30% more copper number one number second to only I'll lumina MS copper for the defense industry so copper is king this would bring almost 25 percent of what we're importing now of 30 percent to our state this is the same mine that has been mine for a hundred years it's just that it's 7,000 feet in the ground unbelievable what we're looking at okay next one buyers holy lordy let's talk about fires my first term we had the Wallow fire in my district you spent over two hundred million dollars putting out that fire you as taxpayers lost 2.5 billion dollars with a B dollars of assets oh and by the way I'm a conservationist remember those little spotted owls 20% of the known world number burned up in that fire who won nobody we lost we got to put people back to work everybody agrees that thinning the forest is it okay so we finally got some resolution here we have up to 50,000 acres there right now we stand at 30,000 we're making a push for a hundred thousand we may be able to have six hundred people in the forest by the end of May these are real jobs folks again they're thirty to seventy thousand dollars here we go we've got opportunity and this is what is happening in Arizona oh by the way here's what's riding on it if we fail here so does the rest of United States there will be no log there will be no logging and thinning forest projects in the United States in mass scale this has to be a hundred thousand acres a year not 20 not 30 but a hundred thousand acres numbers work and we're finally getting some people to help us out okay so there's two of them and boy these are rural Arizona jobs so if we had 3,700 from the first one in the now 600 700 here we're starting to add those up folks we're starting to build some some ass here next one yamo generating station any businesses want to come to Arizona or they're flying for over here there contact my all my office all the time from California why because if you're gonna have a business you have to have dependable energy here we go now mo generating station by the way is historic sits on Native American property that lifts water out of the Colorado delivers 50 percent of the water to Tucson to Phoenix and 80 percent of the water to Tucson take that away half of Phoenix goes away eighty percent of Tucson goes away and what you know of Arizona goes away because we're part of it here too because we're part of the lift cycle okay so this is dependable the government the agencies the administration can't come in here and do cap and trade it never passed House or Senate never passed the legislative body you can implicate or implement an executive order based upon that can't do it that's how we're trying to get in the Supreme Court okay next one health care big one big one these days okay so what we're going to do is we're going to show you some videos because I get chastised a lot I if I remember right somebody chest size being your paper and I'll bring up their name here in just a second I'm very accountable and I hold people accountable as well so what we're going to do is we're going to find out what America thinks about Obamacare okay but our problem with Obamacare is website is just the tip of the iceberg okay now they said there's been no breach but they've actually shared your information with people that shouldn't have had your information government did that through the exchange crappy exchange you spent well by the way that davis-bacon competitive bidding we didn't do that we actually gave it selectively to this group who did a crappy job okay and now you're gonna double your money because you're gonna redo it all over again and make some changes okay demographics you have to have a lot of young people signing up otherwise it's not going to work we're already in the death spiral I told you that businesses are coming to me they've been promised that now because they got a one-year moratorium didn't they so now they're like the rest of us individuals some of them saw a 60% increase those were revoked and added another 30% on those people that lost their insurance the insurance companies are actually adding to that because you're changing the actuarial tables you're destroying them folks cost we've seen premiums rise out of pockets rise co-pays rise and we've seen everything rise your deductible rise people gonna pay more last but not least you're going to be limited in choices so the next photograph should be the big lie Thanks foot nope okay it's going to cost us two point six trillion dollars eight point nine three eight hundred nineteen billion dollars in taxes forty five billion dollars in cost penalties to adjust Americans for not taking health care and 10 million Americans our respect to have lost their health plans you know do it by the end of March by the numbers three point five we've already been notified their plans going to be terminated now we're going to have businesses come back into the play ok this is not about new ones fifty nine Democrats voted against a resolution that would allow Americans to keep their health care plan 59 okay six people and the first 24 hours actually signed up nationwide on Obamacare and zero people have been fired to date that's not what I kind of call accountability okay at all okay that became the lie of the year it's not me this is everybody calling this out because if you wanted to keep your health care plan you couldn't keep your health care plan you wanted to keep your doctor you couldn't keep your doctor so here we go but to the most important the lie of the year control room I don't even know if we have this can we get a drumroll so here it is by popular demand the number one lie of the year based on something the president first said in 2009 and then updated in 2013 if you like your health care plan you can keep your health care plan what we said was you could keep it if it hasn't changed since the laws passed yeah so this was a runaway favorite oh no Jake trapper is conservative or liberal okay so it's not out of my mouth so just FYI you're gonna go back okay now we're gonna turn up the volume so we have some Millennials so you need to know exactly what young people are thinking to watch is careful oh I see you chose to sign up for Obamacare yeah it's actually my first time here well here we are then change it to a gown and the doctor will see you soon okay your vitals look good they changes when we've died our exercise all right can you swing on over smooth on down and try to make yourself okay [Music] what did you see there was uncomfortable but Uncle Sam told you what you're going to do and what you're not going to do so let's watch the next one because we're an equal opportunity employer here okay next one okay everything seems normal when I see you're new to Obamacare as well yeah I saw the ads and I figure why not take your pants off okay [Music] [Applause] right hop up here lay down bring your knees to your chest [Music] this is necessary we'll try to make this quick watch his eyes [Music] okay so the whole point is here is his government's going to be dictating this okay so what happens in January of 2015 fine Uncle Sam is going to be 15 Uncle Sam's called the iPad board so instead of one saying that and remember the doctor has checked out because he's gonna have to have everything okay here 15 unelected bureaucrats are going to decide what's good and best my name is your practices so if you feel uncomfortable with one Uncle Sam in there I don't know about you but I want my healthcare provider to have a conversation with me so the other side of the aisle keeps saying you know dr. gosar what do you stand for well the one thing Paul Gosar has been doing has always been putting something on the table I've always said no isn't an answer it's what is it going to take to you for you to say yes next one a patient-centered patient friendly health care system I practice this for 25 years you're the center of the world everybody competes for you that means hospitals that means providers that means insurance companies oh by the way yeah you heard it insurance companies the only guy talking about breaking up the insurance monopoly is yours truly it's called mccarran-ferguson doesn't allow them to share their information they got to compete like everybody else and ERISA being able to understand what you're getting in your benefit the only we're talking about ERISA is yours truly okay everybody's got to compete number two is tax and tort reform in this health care bill do you see any tort reform absolutely not you gotta have everybody has skin in the game so what we do is we've actually got a plan that actually does this and what it does is embraces states rights states like California and Texas already has some good lost empower them for states that don't have it we backdrop it by the Federal Tort Claims Act so there are something there that we can work off but empower States to have a competitive edge okay last one all you saw tax reform how about you carry more pre-tax dollars just like a business and in in the Republican plan that I helped kind of point that I helped pen a family could put 20,000 25,000 dollars away as a family pre-tax dollars an individual 7,500 and it's an opportunity we're not telling you that's fixed in stone we're starting the discussion okay and last but not least we got I've redefined public health public counts got to fill in the gaps now is this gonna cover everybody everybody goes well dr. gosar you're missing something pre-existing conditions and high-risk pools oh we thought about that we actually put 25 billion dollars in a pool and because we broke up the insurance industry we said we're going to reward you with good best management practices because we saw high-risk pools in several states five of them doing some incredible things instead of costing more money this actually saves money lowers costs and brings a competitive edge means that I control my healthcare by the way I pick on that I'm allergic to wheat and gluten okay I have a seven-day greater chance of having a lymphoma you can figure this out I want an insurance company that comes to me I'm a doctor so I'm one of the worst patients okay so what they're gonna come back and say to me is dr. gosar if you'll go and get an exam twice in three years where are you gonna incentive we're gonna give you an incentive on your premium because we know lymphomas are easier to treat when we catch them early Wow amazing inspired behavior that I win so there's opportunities in this is this gonna do it for everybody absolutely not but it works it actually works and we need to have a discussion with the American public of what we stand for so I have been out there from day one talking about this there is opportunity there is an alternative so we need to be able to challenge and hold people accountable for our challenge okay oh I just got to ask you a question I think the gentleman's name is Dean Wolfe slagle Democrat chair do I sound like a mean spirited angry mob because I want you to have the best of healthcare we ought to choose our definitions than our adjectives a little bit nicer because we ought to have a conversation and why do I say that I'm one of 10 kids five Democrats four Republicans one independent my brother's democratic chair for the state of Wyoming if I can have a conversation in my household and boy they are fun-filled no not at Thanksgiving but at Christmas remember these issues aren't democratic they're not Republican there are American issues there are American issues American solutions okay we're gonna speed it up here because we want to take some questions okay next one he's a number of things that we tried to do cross state lines done that all the way through keep going now the president says we're the party of no I am wait a man next slide we are the party of no I'm not running from it I was a health care professional for 25 years I've sat there when we've had to pull a tooth when we had oral cancer and we sent you for chemotherapy my friends and colleagues have been there delivering your best your kids and your your your grandkids you saw those joys we saw your spouse die we saw somebody die we've been there so we do know I don't run from it I run to it okay next one immigration okay I'm not afraid of immigration do you need to have a conversation though but we need to do it in the right way okay so who knows what the problem with the Senate bill is Senate bill what's wrong with a Senate bill oh that the little ball keeps coming off Senate bill is unconstitutional absolutely revenues revenues and taxes have to start in the house so the house has not seen that bill okay because if we were to give it it would be blue slip because it's unconstitutional if we go to the trashcan okay well what they're waiting for is they said listen we'll do something germane let's talk about border security let's germane to the issue it's gonna we're definitely going to put money to it we're redefining money so it generates revenues so once it goes across it becomes son of Obamacare they take the Senate bill they strip our bill and they put everything on it I want to have a conversation though the next slide what we want is a step-by-step approach go back to that we want a step-by-step approach this has to start with border security the rule of law means we have to have an attorney general upholding the rule of law before we go into this conversation I'll shock you because we're have that conversation about that gentleman at the end of our little conversation piece so we need to have this everybody is subject to the rule of law no one no one is treated above it a civil society cannot exist unless the equivocation of law is applied equally to everyone everyone okay so we'll come back a doctorate sure we'll have some conversations and some questions next one some updates we've done a number of things everybody ought to be scared of IRS it's not a Democrat or a Republican issue it's an American issue you know we're going to give subsidies to on your behalf if you're going to require a subsidy it's going to go to the insurance company and if they've overpaid they're going to come to you to audit it it doesn't sound like a very fair exchange to me proving myself innocent when I should not be guilty in the first place government abuse we need to help Eurocrats to the same aspect that we as law-abiding citizens are nobody exempted and the reins Act talks about some of the economic impacts of rules and regulations governments not here to build jobs it's to foster an environment so that we can create jobs I'm not here to succeed guarantee you're gonna succeed Jim did you were you given a guarantee to succeed or fail where yeah I don't remember it either I don't remember when I signed those loans as a dentist very expensive to deliver I didn't see them for Sam like coming from behind that guy's finding the water with it doesn't exist but I should have opportunity opportunity to succeed or fail equally and if I failed and magical Americans have to try again okay next one okay this is a fun fact we have 77,000 federal vacant buildings we're spending one point six billion dollars in maintenance on and they're bacon so if you've got a federal building you want here come see me okay a lot of things we can do with it you put it to work okay next one boy NSA yeah and say everything they told us hello yeah they're already recording me that's okay I'm sure I'm gonna get audited too but this is the number one issue with Millennials number one issue everything they said that they weren't doing their doing and they've lied we have to have a conversation about that next one thank Ozzie very important things happened this last week okay you had a Senate bipartisan committee that said it was totally preventable they weren't listening and weren't reading the tea leaves both the day before Benghazi occurred the president was on a meeting in the White House he was in part of the time they talked about security in Benghazi so they knew it was coming are you sure something with you in Syria there were 11 gas attacks after that 11th one we actually had five destroyers on one aircraft carrier there in Libya we had 200 terrorists attack we had 50 in Benghazi and we had nothing the first time in US history we abandoned people they let people die and we did nothing now England standards why do I bring that up well when when we buy an embassy from a country and it doesn't meet our standards called inland standards the Secretary of State is personally held accountable for it these are not made in Inman standards so miss Quentin is personally responsible in every step of the way and you're gonna see that what difference does it make well you know what let's not take my word for it let's hear their words we just talked about that so let's go to the first one remember Susan Rice let's listen to Susan Rice there was a violent protest outside of our embassy sparked by this hateful video what sparked the recent violence was the airing on the internet of a very hateful very offensive video that that has offended many people around the world is that in fact what this began as was a spontaneous not a premeditated response to what had transpired in Cairo in Cairo as you know a few hours earlier there was a violent that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated Wow a bold lie had nothing to do with the video in fact the email is out we're Cairo talks to Benghazi and they're talking about the administration is talking about this video it's got a thousand yes that's higher drily viral these aren't my words folks you can double check on this on on fact check this is something wrong here these are the people's own voices this is their own words why do I bring Susan Rice up was the accountability Review Board in our discussion on our committee brought up something remember Nairobi Kenya in 1999 we had a similar problem there was an accountability Review Board can anybody name me the three names are can common from Nairobi Kenya and Benghazi ambassador kennedy ambassador Pickering and Susan Rice oh boy let's go to the next one who no this is Hillary Clinton right yeah let's hear from Hillary Clinton the fact is we had four Dead Americans was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans what difference at this point does it make now wait a minute does it make a difference if it's Chelsea it does it makes a difference because this was a totally preventable occurrence we knew was coming in fact the ambassador was there on behalf of the the Secretary of State to spend extra money he was warned in Europe not to go there so let's talked about the third one because I can't take this when somebody keeps bringing it on a video and even up to ten days later at the United Nations is the following conversation Savan we understand why people take offense to this video because millions of our citizens are among them I know there are some who ask why don't we just ban such a video and the answer is enshrined in our laws our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech Wow we're talking about a video and they knew it wasn't any thing to do with the video folks that's wrong I don't know about you but my mama raised me to tell what's right and wrong and when you abide by that narrative you're as guilty as the person perpetrating it the president is actually indicted himself here this application we need to have the conversation about what happened in Benghazi and hold people accountable that means it's going to be an ugly chapter for us because there's gonna be high-ranking military involved here as well but the State Department knew the White House knew we have an equal branch of accountability from from Congress and we deserve to have now let's go to the next part Attorney General the United States Gago so here's a guy that supposed to be the holder to the top law enforcement person he's supposed to have judged the rule of law and hold it at plic ibly of equally across the board here's a guy that won't even tell the president folks you know sir your sir septum the law of the executive branch you can't actually write statute and Obamacare you can't give exceptions to the rule oh and this is the same guy by the way December 31st of this year something heinous actually happened we actually had an attorney convicted of four acts of treason she actually represented the blind Sheikh and she conveyed information to the al Qaeda that resulted in 90 people being massacred with machetes oh she was found guilty folks she was given a meager sentence of 10 years he gave her off after four because she was going to die she's got 18 months to live I don't know but somebody that is a co-conspirator against this country needs to die in jail it's no different than anybody else but how did that occur how did that occur a doctrine by Eric Holder for early release for political prisoners you actually have the guy who masterminded 9/11 who's got a 35 page affidavit and a 25 page affidavit now being circulated come on folks play the game right what's right is right equal access across the board with the law this is a guy who's divided over and over again he's been implicated in fast and furious we need to let the facts fly he said he was going to be the most transparent administration well let us have the facts that imply why can't we get the information on Benghazi because the whistleblowers have been retaliated against in Fast and Furious oh by the way it's common you got three of the Intel guys who said you know mr. president screw you they're talking to committee and they're gonna face ramifications but you know what we better be there for them because we need accountability okay it's time for Eric Holder to see the door we need a new Attorney General that will help hold the rule of law and by the way I hope he doesn't go too far because he has to be jerk he has to be judged by a jury of if their infractions judged based upon the facts I tell you this for a reason bureaucrats are held to a different realm than the rest of us if you're gonna hold the Attorney General to those town you're gonna see a lot of people starting to line up and get line start doing their job right it's by example I was that first ticket of ten so I had a lot of discipline worked on my siblings and I had to pay the penalty okay last night next one I've done this in floor speeches I'm bit I'm vivid I actually show the blood that came out of the young kids one of the things is the racially motivated aspect really is it how do we justify that how do I tell those Hispanic people and their parents that saw the 14 and 16 year olds lined up at a birthday party and executed how do I tell them that this is a racially motivated charge it's about the rule of law folks nothing less nothing more I want you to vote up or down I want my colleagues both Republican and Democrat to vote up or down whether you have faith in the Attorney General the United States I personally do not but I want that vote and I want it now okay I'm sorry you can contact me you got a number of staff we're here as I told you I like coming to see rural America you teach me more than I can teach you so I'm here to give you some facts help me you got ideas let your light shine because who knows if your light will shine light on an idea that could turn this around a lot of our success has come from you so get involved make a difference America is worth it I mean I think of all the benefits that I've been getting I've got a wonderful family I've worked hard I've never been given anything I built my own house I built my own practice it's amazing what America gives back when you try so thanks for coming out I'd like to take a couple of questions if you'd like yes thank you in the House of Representatives mr. DeSantis has a resolution expressing disapproval of the failure to satisfy the constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed in the usurpation of the legislative authority of Congress by the President of the United States or oh okay I didn't know that great so you know I do one of the things that we're looking at is there's a group of folks that are attorneys I'm not an attorney they are looking at the the duties and oversight of the president and trying to get in the Supreme Court I have a different gauge one of the committees I sit on is Natural Resources yeah and I'm on that sometimes it's not updated but I'm on ok yeah so one of the things that we're trying to do is is is when we start to rebalance power the the Supreme Court is the last rule of law a lower court cannot hear that claim and so what we're trying to do is have standing now Barry Goldwater challenged it as an individual must turn down in 1975 so an individual member of Congress has no standing in the court but that doesn't mean the house doesn't for example in when you go through impeachment processes starts in the house a separate entity passes on for adjudication in the Senate in contempt charges we held Eric Holder in contempt based only on the house so there's opportunity that can be done there the thing is it's never been challenged so we're you got you've got Congress people trying to get into the court to rebalance the power bring in action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in response to the failure of the president to meet the requirement of the Constitution how are we on that one thought we were but we're trying there's so many bills being put in that we don't know but we get a lot of our folks to tell us about them but that would be something would be a no-brainer for me my question was regarding Obamacare how I I like your idea of reform repealing and replacing but how is it possible with all of the trial attorneys that there will ever be tort reform because we've been going against that how can we make it happen my husband is an ob/gyn and some of the lawsuits that we've had they've all been thrown out eventually but at a cost as you know and it's it's ridiculous it may it's like practicing medicine with both hands tied behind her back that's how he often describes it it will be the last domino to fail or to fall and so you have to have everybody on one side versus the trial attorneys and then you can win you can win so what we're doing is methodically trying to get everybody on track to say listen we want a competitive environment that everybody has skin in the game and then the last straw is a trial attorneys they won't have the one of the most powerful lobbyist groups in the country you know I have tons of attorneys in Congress you know I'm one of two dentists in Congress it's a very lonely place a lot of not nice miles but I have some power I ask those forceps and I'm prepared to use them on to be repaired [Music] congressman thanks so much for taking our calls thanks for coming out and thanks for the presentation but I'm gonna bring this back locally Kingman and Mojave County is the doorway to the west we've got interstates we've got airports and we also have the rail system that runs 24/7 if we live in Kingman you know it's running all the time because the horns are blare what are you doing to try to develop that economically for our state and for our County to be you know economic development because those are three or four key issues that can bring money back into the state absolutely but I have a philosophy that federal government's not here to create jobs I'm here to foster an environment that's a little different okay so if I were to tell you that there's actually a company looking at Mojave County as one of the finalists to actually be one of the sole providers of gunpowder and primers and casings all built in Arizona that would really affect you well what they're doing is they're looking at the way Mojave does their business you're gonna need to look at what your environment is where are you willing to have some manufacturing I've been visiting all your manufacturing you've got some phenomenal aspects your machinery here on larren is one of the top in the western United States there's nobody does it better than Lehren it's right here he came in Arizona but what we have to do is we have to foster that environment people have to know that you're available we have lots of people from California that are moving to Texas I say hey stop come take a look at Mojave County come look in little paws come look at Yuma come on cat you have a pie the thing is is you need to welcome them as well you're the ones that are gonna create the environment for them you're the ones that are in a welcome we just got to draw them to you the other thing is is that rules and regulations one of the biggest job win hindrances is Obamacare okay I'll give you an example one of my good friends has three hair had three McDonald's and Flagstaff he sold one because he could make the mandate work with Obamacare that's not that's not incentivizing people to get better that's incentivize people to be average okay rules and regulations over and over again we're impugning new rules and regulations that don't even have jurisdiction from Congress they never even were passed so one of the things I'm trying to do is trying to hold the executive branch accountable for those actions that's why I'm trying to get in with the Navajo Generating Station you lose that one stack you lose everything well one of the ones that I'm on is is the I 11 corridor well between Vegas and and Phoenix the last two metropolitan areas over a million people not connected by an interstate the problem is is we gotta go find that money so one of the proposals I've met with the folks for transportation infrastructure is davis-bacon okay let's do this smart wise so if we can save all this money twenty five billion dollars let's just say it's twenty five billion dollars what if we were to take the savings divided in half put half of it to the deficit reduction Act and put half of it back into infrastructure projects sounds like a winner to me sounds kind of common sense to me that it's kind of a win-win situation because for every dollar I'm investing there I'm getting more additional input but I also got to do the opportunity for rules and regulations to streamline that process that not just federal issues that state issues and local issues from what I heard today in the scat the time that I've been here is is that we got a pretty egregious Planning and Zoning issue time is that my time is money I was a businessman time is money okay the more and more I got to put out in the more more time I've got to do something you ought to streamline the process walk me through it make it work for me because they're going to invest back into Kingman so those are the opportunities that we're trying to do but that's why we keep coming out to you so we want to hear what's on your agenda you know we're in Bullhead City today we're in Lawton we were in Parker last night and and tomorrow we're going to Lake Havasu Yuma after that so we're here to listen to what's special about Kingman and Mojave County because you're the ones that there are job creators I got to keep the government out of the way but I have to let you know that you're on them down the map and we're open ready for business that helped yes yes yes my name my name is Bruce Bollinger during this afternoon I was meeting with a business owner in Bullhead City who lost somewhere around $22,000 during the time that the government shut down this was due to restricted access to Lake Mead and the Colorado River the government employees in Washington were paid back put our friends who make their livelihoods here on the river and in national parks didn't get anything I have a suggestion actually have a bill perhaps the next time that the government tries to shut down things could we declare eminent domain on those national parks for the citizens of Arizona we actually have a similar bill to that it's right now pending in Natural Resources it says when there is an imminent restriction of government whether it be restriction in trade or closure that those private entities that are determined upon the federal lands in which they exist will not be impugn and have access through the state thank you it actually came through our web page so we do read our web mail you talk about a runaway federal government but we have runaway unelected bureaucracies that tell us what to do they're called the US Fish and Wildlife the EPA and you know all those things that they put upon us the endangered species it's destroying us so what can you do there to help with that we've had a number of hearings we have a number of bills the problem is is once it passes the house it's dead on arrival in the Senate you got to have a conversation about in this aspect we're looking at diminishing returns on rules and regulate and we're not even promulgating good science I'll give you an example up on Marble Canyon we may need a real big release to help the humpback chub and the reason I know so much as my son was the one taking the data didn't help the humpback chub it actually benefitted the rainbow trout who eats the humpback chub we're trying we have we want that conversation but it also comes back to tort reform there's got to be impugned damages for all nonprofits so you've got to have skin in the game otherwise what ends up happening of groups like cigar club the wait to the 23rd hour 59 minute with the stamp on an envelope they stop everything in fact we've just over with mayor hey come over in Bullhead City that's exactly how the disposal of BLM land along the river has been held up on which on board city fishing has become a business over here and so what we've got to do is empower that and what we have to do is have a transparency review on where fish hatcheries are actually beneficial we got a number of them across the board that we've actually engaged with wildlife services to say listen this is what benefits this area of why are you taking it out of them this is what we need to have this needs to stay in aspects and then go back into the budgets and find their operating budget well we're trying to we're trying to have jurisdiction but what ends up happening when you're running under the rule of law this lawless makes no difference because there's no enforcement of it one of the opportunities we have is pilled when you zero out hill this is going to hurt a lot of our federal lands this is our opportunity to pit education versus environmental groups and I intend to do that there's a number of us looking at that there's got to be a balance and there's got to be something based on science it's just like the Forest Service just getting to have the contracts we're starting thinning projects to two fires the wall of fire in the Yarnell fire we lost two point five billion dollars of assets and put out 200 million dollars in the Wallow fire how do you replace 19 firefighters we're putting people in harm's way they couldn't never succeed and why do we even have contracts of 30 thousand acres because we're pushing ahead and putting bureaucrats and saying listen you're the ones causing this you got to be part of the solution process no isn't an answer I said that over and over again and it's good enough for us that's good enough for bureaucrats in some cases yes in some cases no it just depends upon how you want to look at firefighters they gave us some assets some old military assets and and redirected some of the big catastrophic fires because of California but it's not directed in the proper fashion it's ludicrous we can actually be putting people back to work and actually having people bid on this instead what we're doing is we're paying people to fight fires that are catastrophic and we can only lose it's it's absurd Jeanne bishop I'm here from Kingman and I'm a down winders and I just wanted to know if you could update us on your legislation that you introduced last year I know it's stuck in subcommittee my question is can you get it out of there can you reintroduce it what can you do with what we already have well a couple of things that we did is we introduced it as as the bill as an amendment process and we keep getting ruled out of order that it's not pertinent and then we keep getting the CBO score that's detrimental because they keep saying that it's going to add increased costs so we got furious so we went to CRS which is the attorneys that when the government said how do we do this to make this succeed because you actually have admission from administration's this is with an administrative oversight and how does this work when you look at Rica now here's the area closest to these above-ground blasts and part of it is exempt give me a break so we're dealing with CRS we're hounding them and they keep saying well you have all these budget discussions we'll get to it we'll get to it that's our problem is trying to find some way that it's ruled in order so that can move forward and then and then having a negative score with CBO that's that's part of our problem there's going to be a lot of money left over it's an argument that we've got to find somebody captivated within CRS that will empower us to make that sissel solution that's what we're stuck because doing the same thing over and over again and asking for a different result is insanity hi ray Carlson Haven Kingman great presentation you did kind of throw a curveball now something probably totally off-base and that I become allergic to a lot of stuff and I've heard you mention you're allergic to wheat and gluten what can we do about GMOs and in what Massino is doing because a lot of the research coming out now is they're killing us through our food and we need to change how all that came about and what would you have to say on GMOs well first of all you got to base it on science with the science is very very poor you know we as man have been genetic engineering all of our food from day one taking one one plant versus another and trying to get a hybrid so what we need to do is base that based on facts and say listen we're going to study GMOs in this case case versus something not and what we have to have is reliable science the problem that we have is we're not getting reliable science give you an example in dentistry when I started 25 years ago I actually twenty eight years ago there were like two journals very well reference very peer-reviewed so you could take the results that they got take the circumstances and get the same results or contrary but very peer-reviewed today there's thirty some none of them are peer-reviewed I go through them look at the title go back and see who paid for them let's see who's paying for them I don't even read the title it's not worth the print they're on there and that's part of our problem with the science with that we haven't spent the time really studying the GMO case there's a lot of hearsay there's not a lot of facts well we have to do is passed budgets because when you pass CRS administration spend your dollars when you pass budget I direct that money to a certain cause for a certain outcome that's what happens with budgets but we haven't passed a budget since I've been in Congress you keep harping about it over and over and over again the power of the purse is executive executed when you pass a budget that's the biggest kirei and that's the most frustrating thing in the world is president done water budget Harry Reid don't want a budget I'd rather do a CR more question two more questions James barber from Mojave Valley Arizona my wife is a cashier at a local grocery store and she sees the people come through on on EBT cards and she gets very frustrated because we're on a regular budget but she can see the waste and fraud every every day she noticed the people have cards that are so old that the embossing is flat and the stripe is gone and the numbers are written in sharpie what can we do to revamp this program so it's like we only have one program and it's efficient doing what what it's supposed to do well you're having the discussion right now it's called the farm bill the farm part of it is the easy part we've actually taken the farmers away from subsidies and moved in to do insurance a nice stair step to save money the problem is is is in food stamps we have a 13 to 17 percent fraud waste and abuse in food stamps personally I'd like to see everything under WIC because there's half of the fraud waste and abuse if it's good enough for yeah if there if it's good enough for women infants and children you want chicken fingers go get a job but here's the problem is we've asked for in the House budget a less than 5% cut which is 40 billion dollars over 10 years that seems reasonable we're not taking it out of Grandma and little kids to be fed properly we want some incentives for bureaucrats to have some oversight in it now what we're being told that's why they move pills out is that the number that we're hearing is between nine and eleven billion dollars in cuts over ten years less than a billion dollars and we're advertising overseas to get your EBT cards in your SNAP program come on folks but I'm the oh I'm the wicked Republican you know this taking it away from people stand up and be counted because this is accountability issues it's less than five percent in a cut here so what they did with me and them but I can tell you the Western caucus lambasted Boehner you knew kilt wasn't put in there half a billion dollars you told us that the president wasn't going to get his needs with with education he did come on give up and now you're going to extort me and Western people because we need the pelt in exchange for four abuses and food stamps come on and once again if we pass budgets we can hold people accountable but we have to be able to pass a budget give me some people that want to pass a budget all right I'm following the microphone Michelle Arnett Bullhead City Arizona congressman Gosar I have a pen and I have a telephone I think you know where I'm going with that right we're gonna start our own agenda well yeah we're gonna bypass Congress you know and also I read in the paper today that you're going to be invited to weigh in on NSA re-regulation so I isn't that somewhere in our constitution like article one section and wanting something like that that no laws and all that have to come through you yeah well why is that not happening I understand the standing thing in the imperialistic presidential thing that we've got going on how how likely is it that Congress is going to get standing in the courts all they can say is no the opportunities all up right that's why trey Gowdy and a number are looking at the legal implications I'm looking at it from natural resources but it tells you how frantically we're trying to save this republic now I'm just going to step back for a moment we find ourselves with an administration that's his hideous in regards to the Constitution but let's wait a minute let's go back let's go back for a minute there's a bipartisan flavor to this the executive orders didn't start under Barack Obama we've been doing this a little bit at a time folks and we didn't call it into question we didn't I'll give you an example who those Ronald Reagan here I do well Reagan grew the federal government he also was the first Druze the firs R which is unconstitutional so if we're going to ask the other side to look reflectively we need to reflectively look at our past - and not repeat it we're human that's why it's important for us I mean our framers wanted our to come back and be voted in every two years as a reason why we're closest to the people that's why I've told John Boehner let the people's house do the people's work and stand in front of it don't stand behind it stand in front of it with them don't go make special deals cuz you reek at it you'd never do a contract for me well you don't know we're gonna go into retreat here Democrats are is divided as Republicans I'll tell you that right now I'm not sure I'm not sharing anything that's not been being reported there's directional problems if there's one person that could go away to make things much better it's a Nancy Pelosi I'll tell you that right now but I'll share this with you I'll share this with you this is how we reviled she is there was this election in South Carolina from my friend Tim Scott seat there were 13 Republicans we elected a guy that's got some baggage he went up against Stephen Colbert's sister two weeks out and I saw the polls he was down by a minimum of 10 points there were some polls showed him down 20 points he stopped campaigning against Stephen Colbert's sister he took Nancy Pelosi's face put it on on a popsicle stick and said I'll never vote for her you either get me or you get her and in two weeks he won by 10 points all right we'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight and especially the Supervisor subra Angus and mayor Watson and we appreciate your questions and your attendance tonight so thank you very much thank you very much for coming out tonight [Applause] you

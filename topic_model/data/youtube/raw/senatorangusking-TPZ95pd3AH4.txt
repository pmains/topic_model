senator Hirono did you say that we spend twenty billion dollar years on corrosion yes that gives new build rocks are ever sleeps doesn't it's unbelievable Undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment Ellen Lord has said that the sustainment cost for the f-35 will become unaffordable I had a meeting recently with an the Deputy Secretary of Defense he said the same thing why is the f-35 so expensive to keep flying anybody want to tackle that Admiral I'll start from a warfighting perspective we need the airplane no doubt about that I'm just someone affordability cost so much to keep it going from affordability aspect we have to drive down the operating and sustain the cost there's a 30 30 % reduction goal within ten years I understand that - my question is why is it so expensive what is it about the airplane that's costing so much I think the fifth-generation airplane in and of itself is an expensive airplane to procure I know that and then I'm gonna operate I'm gonna ask again this fourth time why is the f-35 so expensive to maintain sir I think so the aircraft is is very expensive period so a lot of the parts on that aircraft are very expensive so far a component fails the repair costs at this time are quite high we're still having to go back to the original equipment manufacturers for the repair of most of those components because the program collectively not pointing for the collective was late to stand up things like depo organic depo level repair capability we're just now starting to stand up intermediate level capability we're actually just starting to fund it in PB 19 that's one of the new things in 19 the reliability of some of the components is not as high as we expected it to be at this point in time so we have more failures you see bent as a manufacturer responsible for those failures when we get for a warranty throughout there's no warranty sir there is no warranty no sir you mean a product can be delivered to us that cost a hundred million bucks and and if it fails it's on us there are some criteria in the contract sir but we there is actually congressional language from that dates back many many years about the government paying for warrant paying industry for warranties we actually have to get special permission to pay industry for warranties on things we buy well we'll talk about that I guess I'm astounded well I hope that as throat the aircraft would have cost even more had we insisted on a warranty sir yeah there's very few exceptions I'll give you an example an exception age 60s we were able to buy the warranty because that was a standard that Sikorsky used at the time for their commercial practices and they just rolled it into over to the government but in the vast majority of cases that is not true well perhaps we could have some discussion of this I I can argue it both ways but the idea of buying something like this and having parts fail and having nobody the manufacturer the OEM not responsible strikes me as an odd way to procure most anything let me ask a different question yeah yeah that goes back to what year I'd have to it's it's a long time sir I'd have to go back and look before I was even before senator King but well if you would supply that yes sir to us because there's some interest in the room obviously there yeah but I would be interested in in the overall question of the sustainment costs and why they are so high because as I say Helen Lord said they are unaffordable that's a finite unaffordable means we ain't gonna be able to do it and we've got to figure that out quickly in in the Air Force we've had a lot of work on the pilot shortage is there a pilot shortage and the Navy and the Marines as well we're talking about acquiring aircraft here do we have the pilots to fly them down rotor we are or percentages below where we should be so we're not in as dire of a pilot shortage as what I think we were seeing on Air Force front but it is to no secret that the airlines are hired and will work on our pilot art so we're working on a few different fronts I'll give you some examples we the Marine Corps and the Navy along with our Air Force we started up no pilot bonuses again we hadn't done this since 2011 and we were probably at the low end of that we were two years with two years bonus 20,000 per year for tacky air or a Bab f-18 f-35 in v-22 tube because we're worried about our tilt rotor because they are a high-value item out in the market as well so far we've had 68 percent take on that so 33 out of our 35 f-35 pilots took the bonus 123 at 126 569 v-22s took the bonus so with that we are we're still watching it close and I'd say we watch it every day on a normal 10-year program of pilot retention attrition rates probably around eight point nine percent we're probably at about 10.5% tacker wide so what it means is we're putting as many folks as we can in our squadrons and maybe some of the be billets for fighter pilots maybe aren't filled in some cases and we keep people in the squads longer but we are looking at throughput to make sure we we keep up the the pilot rate because for us and as a Navy we both are in this thing together would transitioning to the f-35 we have to be able to stand down f-18 squadrons to stand up the f-35 score and so we got to make sure we're transitioning those people to those squatters while we're still maintaining their legacy fleet as well Admiral Connor I'm over my time but is that how's the Navy doing on pilot retention for our department ISM and post command commanders were not meeting our goals the bonuses may may provide some opportunities to address some of those my focus and my position is on readiness to get the aircraft up and get those pilots flying to make sure that lack of flight time is not a distractor I would commend to both of you senator cotton and I on the air land subcommittee had an informal roundtable with a group of Air Force pilots to talk about this issue without a lot of officers and brass or anybody and it was very interesting because what we heard was that it wasn't necessarily about money it was more about op tempo of time with family and interestingly time to fly that the the pilots didn't want to be in desks and on different tracks so I would the Air Force is doing some serious work on this I would urge you to talk to them about because they're sort of it I was about to say there at the front edge of this that's not a good place to be but they're working on it so Thank You mr. chairman

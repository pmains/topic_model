or posse our joining us now member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut he is here with his new piece for The Atlantic entitled how to make a progressive foreign policy actually worth what is a progressive foreign policy well a progressive foreign policy is one that admits the mistakes of the past it understands the limits of American power when you try to project force and influence around the world just through military might but also understands that America can still play a role for good in the world and we're gonna have a lot of work to do after the Trump administration is done to try to reassert American influence when it comes to projecting human rights and democracy promotion around the world and my hope is that as I think Joe Biden is starting to realize there is an opportunity in the 2020 election to go straight at Trump on the issue of national security he has made the United States a laughingstock he has walked us away from our historic role in promoting democracies and human rights around the globe and that ultimately makes the United States less safe and so I'm hoping that Democrats are gonna run on national security historically it's a big gap between Democrats and Republicans and this is an election in which we can close it well telegraphing to the American public that we get that the way in which we throw our military weight around the world hasn't worked there's other ways to project force to project influence at the same time though I mean there there is time there are times we have to use military force right I mean do you think Donald Trump made a mistake pulling troops out of Syria I do I do in part because he had absolutely no plan for what came next and so in that piece that are over the Atlantic you know I lay out exactly when military force is appropriate let me ask you about Afghanistan Donald Trump now wants to do a deal with the Taliban and have our troops pull out of Afghanistan just like we did in Iraq and 2011 led to some really bad unintended consequences in Iraq might do the same in Afghanistan what is the progressive foreign policy look like in terms of Afghanistan do we just leave our doesn't look like South Korea no listen I have supported the president's efforts to try to get a deal with the Taliban and there are lots of conservative Republicans in Congress who would like to see us to stay there for the next 40 years but I think you need to use the tools that we have we have leverage at this moment and the leverage is American forces and the fact that he is disappearing our leverage right pulling our troops out at the very moment where he's trying to get the Taliban to come to the table on a political deal is just you know basic foreign policy mismanagement and so you know I think progressive foreign policy also involves a dose of realism and in Afghanistan if you're a realist you have to use the troop presence today to try to get the Taliban to make concessions but ultimately I think we have proven without a doubt that the u.s. occupation of Afghanistan is not going to make that country a functioning western-style democracy and so we should stop having our bar for leaving Afghanistan be the end to corruption we should make sure that al Qaeda doesn't find a way to get back as using that country as a safe haven and if we can get some basic guarantee on that some assurance on that I think that's when we get respect as you know Center one of the president's talking points will hear through the campaign is I'm bringing the troops home let Syria fight for itself let them manage their own border let Turkey get involved if they need to there was a report yesterday that he was considering sending 14,000 troops to Saudi Arabia as a buffer perhaps to Iran he denied that on Twitter you sit on foreign services do you know more about that are we sending troops to Saudi Arabia I mean what's stunning to me having just come back from the region is how his own military commanders in theater don't know what the policy is right so we were supposedly moving out of Syria but we aren't anymore we now have 500 trains that are once again trying to set up mokou elisions with the SDF in country and in fact we have more troops in the Middle East today than we did at the beginning of the trump presidency maybe he's going to send a couple thousand more but already we have more US soldiers in CENTCOM in theater than we did at the outset we've just moved them from one place to the other and don't think that they're safe in Saudi Arabia right the provocative behavior that the president is engaged in today with Iran could end up putting those troops in jeopardy as well senator Sam Stein has a question for you Sam a Senate senator as we speak right now the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is again overseas in Europe meeting with Ukrainian officials and other foreign officials ostensibly about Joe Biden and other election hackings in 2016 two questions one is your committee keeping tabs on what's going on or at least trying to and two in addition to this impeachment push do you feel that Congress has a role here to legislate and codify limits to what personal attorneys can do in terms of specta foreign policy and/or to make sure and clear that foreign governments should have no role interfering in the u.s. elections well I think there's a bunch of different pieces to this what we know is that the corruption didn't end when the impeachment process started in fact it's ongoing the fact of the matter is these guys are shameless and Giuliani is going to go back over and over and over again I don't have any faith that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is gonna do anything about it I went to the chairman of the committee back in April and asked for hearings in two Giuliani's early attempts to try to interfere and had no success and I think it's probably difficult to set congressional limitations on the way in which a president uses outside advisors I mean there is a long history of presidents being able to rely occasionally on people who don't officially work for the government to do right business for the United States overseas and so I'd have to think a little bit more about that we might end up tying the hands of future presidents in a way that's not super constructive and kETK Cadi senator one of the points of the Donald Trump gets in terms of favorability from people who are otherwise critical of his foreign policies on his handing of China and the argument is that in the past presidents haven't taken on China at least this president has done so if you were to urge a progressive Democratic foreign policy when it came to China what would it look like would you continue the campaign would you urge continuing the campaign of pressure as this president has done on China well I think there's there's two pieces to it you absolutely have to take on China's unfair trade practices but you can't do it alone Donald Trump is ultimately going to lose this trade war with China because China understands the leverage they have on him as we get closer to the 2020 election it's going to be Trump who has a short term view that is desperate to get a deal China who always has a long-term view is gonna be able to sit back and so will ultimately get a deal that's good for China and bad for the United States what we should be doing in these negotiations is involving our partners so progressive foreign policy is a multilateral foreign policy and there are lots of willing potential partners in Europe that would love to be tough on China with us second though you have to understand what China is doing to export things like 5g all across the world and if we don't start coming up with alternatives to these Chinese technologies that are gonna lap American and Western technologies everywhere then we can't compete with them so that's about public investment in things like advanced battery technology and artificial intelligence so that we don't get caught with our pants down again like we have on high-speed Internet connections how does a progressive foreign policy deal with supposed allies like Pakistan Saudi Arabia Turkey so here's I think the most difficult question I think we've got to push human rights and democracy but it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition I think there are some countries that cross a line where there have to be consequences Saudi Arabia would be on my list right I think you have to Telegraph that there is a point at which you have so abused the relationship in which you have so abused your own people that you can't be on the same terms as it used to be with the United States and so I don't think it progressed in foreign policy says if you're not a western-style democracy if you don't have a spotless human rights record you can't do business with us but it does set up a line in a way that this administration hasn't and if we had said to Saudi Arabia after could Shoji's murder that there's going to be a change in your relationship with the United States because of it it would have been a notice to all sorts of other countries that they better get right or at least try to get moving in the right direction or there were gonna be consequences so it's not an all-or-nothing proposition but you have to draw a line somewhere quick final question different topic have you spoken to a single Republican colleague in the Senate who's even considering voting for impeachment yes do you have yes okay would you like to name him how many it's a it's a it's a small list on one on one hand French and by the way I don't buy this secret ballot like I mean if there was a secret ballot there's still be only a handful of them there would you think of the maximum right now that given what we currently know like maybe thought there's about five Republicans who might vote to remove the president hat max I think that's probably right now all right okay senator crisper hey thanks guys thank you come

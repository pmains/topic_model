BACKGROUND CHECKS ON EVERY GUN  SALE. I'D LIKE TO END MY OPENING  REMARKS WITH COMMENTS ON TWO  FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH CARE BILLS  INCLUDED IN THIS RULE. THE WOMEN'S HEALTH PROTECTION  ACT AND THE ENSURING WOMEN'S  RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM  ACT. THESE BILLS WILL EMPOWER WOMEN  AND REAFFIRM THEIR RIGHT TO MAKE INDEPENDENT AND INFORMED HEALTH  CARE DECISIONS. OVER THE PAST YEAR, WE'VE SEEN  AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON WOMEN'S  BODILY AUTONOMY. THE APPALLING SUPREME COURT  DECISION TO OVERTURN ROE VS.  WADE WAS JUST THE BEGINNING. WE'VE SEEN STATES CRIMINALIZING  WOMEN'S RIGHT TO MAKE BASIC  FAMILY PLANNING DECISIONS. WE'VE SEEN A 10-YEAR-OLD CHILD,  A VICTIM OF RAPE, FORCED OUT OF  HER STATE FOR THE HEALTH CARE  SHE DESPERATE KNLY NEEDS. AND WE'VE SEEN RESTRICTION TO  ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE,  CONTRACEPTION. THESE ASTOUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON WOMEN IS THE REASON WHY WE NEED  THE WOMEN'S PROTECTION ACT. IT WOULD CODIFY ROE VS. WADE. WE ALSO NEED TO PASS THE  ENSURING WOMEN'S RIGHT TO  REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM ACT,  LEGISLATION I PROUDLY  CO-SPONSORED. IT IS A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS WE  NEED TO CODIFY THE FUNDAMENTAL  RIGHT TO INTERSTATE TRAVEL IN  THIS COUNTRY, PROTECTING WOMEN  FROM CIVIL AND CRIMINAL  LIABILITY EVEN WHEN SEEKING AN  ABORTION IN A STATE WHERE IT IS  LAWFUL. THE FACT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN  EFFORTS IN STATE LEGISLATURES TO PREVENT WOMEN FROM SEEKING  LAWFUL ABORTION ACROSS STATE  LINES COMPLETELY CONTRADICTS THE CLAIM THAT OVERTURNING ROE VS.  WADE WAS ABOUT TURNING THE  DECISION OVER TO THE STATE. THE RADICAL HAS AND WILL ALWAYS  BE ABOUT RESTRICTING WOMEN'S  RIGHTS. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE WE'RE  LIVING IN 2022, NOT 1722. BY PASSING THIS LEGISLATION,  WE'RE MAKING IT CLEAR THIS  ASSAULT ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS CANNOT STAND. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SHOW  THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD THAT  WE RESPECT WOMEN, WE TRUST  WOMEN, AND WE SUPPORT WOMEN AND  THEIR RIGHT TO MAKE INFORMED AND INDEPENDENT HEALTH CARE

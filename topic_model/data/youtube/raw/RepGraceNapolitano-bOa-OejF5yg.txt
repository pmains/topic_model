it's a real pleasure for us to jointly present the next award to a real champion for mental health and suicide prevention and I would like to ask somebody to come up and join us on eight would you come on up and join us up here those who don't know Annie Romero worked for Representative Napolitano for many years so and now she's on our policy couch she stole she's an advocate so we'd like got to come up and join us too I got to coast staff today or did I haven't done in a while so I'm very excited so um we'll go back and forth okay so 20 years for 20 years ten terms in the house representative Napolitano has been a voice for people with mental illness and to prevent suicide so it's really an honor for us to recognize what you've done Paul yeah those those comments as we have seen there are so many advocates that we have but when you go back over time and over decades one consistent advocate who has always been there and around whom mental health policy at the national level always seems to circulate is representative grace Napolitano so again I echo Bob's coming it is an honor to have you here tonight to be able to recognize you in this way a founding member of the mental health caucus as well as a voice for young people and their mental health needs veterans and their mental health needs and really all Americans and our mental health needs all so well with half of mental illnesses beginning by the age of 14 three-quarters by the age of 24 we have needed people who have been champions of children for too long we've ignored the fact that many of the people that we need to be dealing with and many of the people we need to be thinking about our kids and the reality is that representative Molly tano was one of the first people to recognize and understand the importance of focusing in an hour children if we're actually to focus in on prevention and so it's critically important that she has changed the way people have thought about mental illnesses and about the onset of mental illnesses in America we know that you have introduced several times legislation to to focus on mental health and schools and our pledge to you is we will continue to fight for that and your name and on behalf of all of our young people who need help so thank you would you come up and receive your award [Applause] because I have an audience that I'd like to talk to thank you Anna thank you very much for this award it really is truly remarkable the time that we spent trying to get people to recognize the issues of mental health and Nani being young lady in Los Angeles I was doing the forum and on mental health and she I was in the State Assembly and she came and I said I want her and I hired her and she became a mental health but person in Washington but now she's doing other things very good fighting for the good fight that I am proud well you talk about the fight for children in 2001 I got a half a million dollar grant from Samsa to start a program on in schools and it was a beginning in one high school and through middle schools to put on-site clinicians to deal with cutters bipolar schizophrenia etc bullying hadn't entered the picture yet but we found soon there was great reticence from the schools to accept a program like that in the school we don't want to be known as crazy schools now there's a waiting list in Los Angeles which the county has picked up we're now in 26 schools and growing and so far knock on wood there have been no attempted suicide it was labeled latina adolescent suicide prevention but it was meant for any child regardless of any gender no questions asked no money free service and that has grown because they've seen the need and shown that it is something that is necessary in our schools to help children cope and deal with the pressures that they're facing but I am very proud because I have great staff Daniel Cho my chief of staff here the young man that leads it in my office is Jonah where are you Jonah all of you get to know him he's the one to call i co-chair the mental health caucus when I saw that there was a caucus had been defunct when I first came in I thought it's time to pay attention to it and we started holding meetings if we got five people in the room that was a lot now you're beginning to see the attention paid to the necessity of addressing the issue but no funding so we have to urge Congress mr. Keck on my colleague my co-chair makes a comparison of Zika they put a billion they'll also in life and yet they don't put hardly any into mental health we have to change that dynamic simply because we're losing too many lives and we certainly know that from your standpoint and I I came to this sort of by accident when I was in the State Assembly there's a mental health hospital close to my home in Norwalk and we started delving into and finding out that they were people letting out with no safety net and when there's the federal government side to close hospitals there was no safety net for the people being put out in the community they expect to the community take care of him so it was something that it was near and dear to my heart because it came from where I came from is addressing an issue that nobody wants to talk about it is a stigma and we have to work together reduce the stigma it is a certain that that is part of it but in what we find out and I have to tell you a little story I went to Colorado for a water meeting when about eight years ago and the driver assigned to me was a gentleman with the family he was very courteous wonderful man and when he got home after dropping me off at the airport you went home to find his daughter hanging in a closet you know suicide is happen to anybody everybody know that the immediate now begin to pay little attention to it we've got to capitalize on that you've got to get them to understand it goes beyond the wealthy and the well known well the stigma is still quite an issue we have to learn competitive we have to learn that we cannot give up we must continue to fight and we must always be aware of our role and do what we can and continue working for things to happen and so I would urge anybody to please talk to you state to your federal to use city thanks funny communicate to anybody and elected office they have to know that it affects people in the community and if they are not aware of it they should be aware of it they should be made aware of it because it is affected not only the community but their business and that's where it hurts them little well I talked to you about Zika but there are many other things that would talk to you about but you'll have to excuse me I just get a little emotional thank you very much [Applause]

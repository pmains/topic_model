to see people treat it like they did horses barely running over people being strapped it's outrageous i promise you those people will pay they will be an investigation underway now and there will be consequences he also said that it was an embarrassment uh and that it's a dangerous and wrong congressman yeah you know that was probably the the part of his speech in the last 30 minutes that made me the angriest like we could take an hour debunking all the lies that he told on all different subjects and there was a lot but this one was really egregious look it seems like the only people he wants to hold accountable for the mess at the border is his own border agents for doing their job he put them in this position and then he lies about what they're doing he lies about their actions you can't imagine a worse leader right now if you're trying to get a mass exodus from the border patrol if you're trying to get them to quit and lose morale then this is a great way to do it i mean to blame them and you know who else isn't held accountable all the people illegally crossing our border all the unvaccinated all the people with covet all the people infiltrating our country um and lying about their asylum claims they're not held accountable but biden doesn't care about that look and we have to stop pretending like this is incompetence this isn't incompetence they're doing this on purpose majorcas was on the record what yesterday bragging about how there's too many of trump's policies that they've rescinded to even count so they rescinded all these policies they act surprised that it causes this mass migration across our border this unsustainable mass migration and they act like it's you know just a tough situation that they have to deal with but it's not it was done on purpose yeah yeah and i guess that's the question is you know you look at this congressman and you talk about what the president is saying and then you look down at the border and we've been trying now for a couple of days to get secretary mayorkas the administration to give us numbers right we know there are about 3 500 of those haitian immigrants still down under that bridge in del rio texas we know about 1800 1400 have been taken back to haiti we don't know how many were released into the united states but it's in the thousands and we cannot get exact numbers and yet we know they do have the numbers well it gets worse than that look everybody's focused on the haitians right now these are mostly single men it's much easier to deport them under whether it's under title 42 or under other immigration laws everybody's focused on that right now don't lose sight of the fact that well over a million encounters have occurred this year and they won't give us numbers on how many of them have been released so that's going to be in the hundreds of thousands right and over a million what does that mean that means the eighth largest city in america that means a population the size of the eighth largest city in america has infiltrated our country and this administration doesn't care it's it's it's a dereliction of constitutional duty because he's willingly he's willingly refusing and deliberately refusing to enforce laws

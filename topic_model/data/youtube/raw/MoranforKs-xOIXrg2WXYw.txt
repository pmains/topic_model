shootings in Chattanooga have raised questions about military recruitment centers being gun-free zones Kansas senator Jerry Moran is introducing a bill this week to eliminate those gun-free zones and he joins me now from Capitol Hill senator are you going to try to eliminate all gun-free zones all across the country no matter where they are or just recruitment centers well it's actually in between Stewart it's not all gun-free zones although that may make a lot of sense what we're focused on is military installations not only those recruiting centers but other places within the military in which our military men and women are denied the opportunity to carry a firearm and we thought most do you have a republican and democrat support for this we're working to accomplish that to me it's it shouldn't be a partisan issue and I hope it's not it's just a common-sense issue that's what I was getting ready to say is we have some of the best trained most disciplined individuals and yet the policy is such that they're unable to carry a sidearm to protect themselves whether it's at a recruitment center or at a military installation otherwise this just makes sense to me to utilize the ability for self-defense and more than self-defense defending your colleagues as well I believe that this the gun-free zone idea of military recruitment centers that was introduced back in 1992 I think that's the case and he was introduced because there were several shootings on military bases when soldiers were armed fully armed and walking around with their guns little worried maybe that will get back to that situation well certainly I hope not I mean I continue to believe that people are better protected in almost every circumstance when they're able to protect themselves protect their friends and colleagues the people who surround them if there's some individual problem that is related to a person who's incapable of making a solid choice for example if they're of likely to be of harm to themselves or others our legislation allows a base commander on a case-by-case basis to say you can't carry a firearm but we want that to be the exception one of the problems here is an abroad solution in legislation that requires the to carry a firearm your intruded on on chain of command I understand that but in this case the commander-in-chief is the president and the president is not going to be very favorably inclined to allowing soldiers to protect themselves and others so we've made the decision that broadly speaking a member of the military ought to be able to carry a firearm okay sir Jerry Moran Republican Kansas thanks very much for joining us so we appreciate you being here thank you Thank You Stuart the press

back to chinese communist party holding them accountable for the egregious human rights atrocities and unfair trade practices i believe we can do that while ensuring that american workers and small businesses don't pay that price are you planning to offer a new 301 exclusion process that will allow a broader range of companies to apply for meaningful relief congressman walorski i'm in full agreement with you that morally outrageous and also economically disadvantageous disadvantageous uh practices we absolutely need to hold governments that perpetrate those accountable on an exclusions process as you know last october i gave a speech outlining the biden administration strategy on trade the first steps that we were prepared to take we started an exclusions process that we just concluded last week by announcing this one set of exclusions i announced at the time that we are considering and will continue to consider additional processes as they are warranted and that continues to be true today let me ask you this why did ustr leave the retroactive date for the exclusion reinstatements frozen at october 12 2021. we looked at the entire process for the exclusions that we just ran and wanted to above all else create a process in terms of its administration that had integrity that was fair and transparent and that was the outcome of our deliberation if you'd like more detail and i'd be happy to talk to you about that more sure i just had one follow-up the exclusions that were reinstated have now been certified by ustr as not available outside china at least three times and that the importer should not pay tariffs on the product what's the policy for for subjecting these products to tariffs for 10 months because i'll tell you here's the issue for me this has real consequences in my district which you know is a manufacturing powerhouse what would you say to a small business that's been told at least three times by ustr that its product cannot be sourced outside china but still is on the hook for 10 months worth of tariffs well congressman willis bleuersky what i would say is we have tried to bring um integrity and transparency to the process and uh if there are continued concerns um we're happy to continue to talk to you and others about it i appreciate it mr chairman i yield back

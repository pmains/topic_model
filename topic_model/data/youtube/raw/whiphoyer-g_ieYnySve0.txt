Mr Speaker we should not shut down the government of the United States Democrats do not want government to shut down it is however not in our hands it takes a majority to pass any bill in this house 218 votes our Republican colleagues have over 240 votes we have 193 so it's not in our hands Mr Speaker the Republican has been given the responsibility and the duty to enact legislation to ensure the proper functioning of government as the governing party they can pass whatever they want to pass on this floor indeed as the governing party they have a responsibility to use their votes to keep government running they control the house they control the Senate and they control the White House all the levers of power of legislating are in their hands but we are here mr. speaker on the verge of a shutdown because of familiar pattern where Republicans cannot unite as a party they cannot agree among themselves spending priorities and this has happened again and again and again in fact each time the Congress has successfully enacted a funding bill since the Republicans took the majority in 2011 they had to have Democratic votes to pass that legislation every single time when we passed the continuing resolution in September just about three months ago we did so because Republican leaders asked for more time to work on the priorities that confront this country and responsibly keeping government working they had three months to do so yet here we are and day remaining and nothing to show for it instead they spent the past three months on priorities that I'll outline in just a minute working on our tax bill that is reckless deeply unpopular and harmful to the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans and the economic well-being of our country and that I call a debt tax because it will explode the debt of the United States a bill that would raise taxes on 78 million middle-class households and kick 13 million Americans off their health insurance coverage a bill that would increase as I've said the deficits by 1.5 trillion dollars indeed much more than that because we have to pay interest on the money that we're going to borrow to do the tax cut while we fail to pay our bills a bill that would trigger an automatic cut of Medicare by 25 billion dollars next year a bill promised on a falsehood that tax cuts magically pay for themselves that's what the past three months have been wasted on mr. speaker not a single appropriation bill has been enacted by this Congress not a single one there are 12 and they control the house they control the Senate and they control the presidency and now our Republican colleagues ladies and gentlemen are asking for two more weeks two more weeks two more weeks they say Republicans are asking us for two more weeks because they claim they have had time to write a funding bill they can pass 90 days every Democrat voted for what I call the no drama CR in September 90 Republicans voted no on an agreement we had to use the next 90 days to address the priorities of America but 90 Republicans voted no and they've had time to write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite again a tax bill that advantaged the wealthiest in America at the expense of the majority of Americans that mr. speaker is how they've spent their time these past three months write a funding bill to avert shutdown No reach an agreement that is responsible to fund the priorities of America No write a tax bill that's what they've done for 90 days that kicks millions off their health coverage and raises taxes on millions more that's what they chose to do two more weeks if they want two more weeks they have 240 votes to give themselves more time but I'm certainly not going to vote to give them two more weeks simply to work on the tax bill which they have pledged to pass by Christmas however if they passed it a year from now it would have the same impact on America's taxes the critical to have ignored and delayed the political has been their sole focus I say to my Republican friends mr. speaker you won control of the government govern govern be responsible focus on that which is critically important to the American people don't say you haven't had time to do the most important job you had you had time we voted every one of us to give you 90 days to work either in a partisan sense as you've done so much of the year or in a bipartisan sense which was much more positive and would have been much more productive there's a to-do list mr. speaker of critical legislation Williams that this houses has to complete before the end of the year it's long and it's a compelling list six of them have hard deadlines and must be done before we leave for the end of the year 90 days we didn't do them none of the six is a surprise either neither or any of the other others that the American people expect us to do by the end of the year as well the majority has had months to work on bringing legislation the floor on each one of them months yet here we are in December pushed up against the wall of a funding deadline and Republicans want two more weeks so they can focus on passing their tax bill before Christmas not the priorities of America but a tax bill a deeply unpopular appropriately so speaker let me list what we need to do and what we ought to do and what we should have done over the last 90 days let me just share with the American people who sent us here what the Republican majority has not gotten done in all the months they've had complete control of the government 1 keep the government open and functioning by passing funding bills and sending to the president for signature second reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program so that millions of our children will not lose health care insurance provide funding for VA choice to help care for our veterans that must be done reauthorize the Flood Insurance Program so critical to so many millions of Americans extend and expiring health programs such as community health centers on which so many other millions rely reauthorize portions of the Intelligence Act to protect America's security that will end before the end the year ninety days we've had to consider all those items and the American people also expect us to provide necessary resources to address the opioid addiction crisis had 90 days to do that reach an agreement on spending levels for critical priorities of the American people would call it dealing with sequester which is somewhat jargon but we haven't done that past funding to keep government effectively serving our people 90 days to do that and here we are passed the DREAM Act to provide certainty for those young people who were brought here as children and have grown up as Americans take action to stabilize our health insurance markets we're having done that had 90 days extend the expired Perkins loan program so college students where the most need can complete their degrees we haven't done that in the last 90 days reauthorize fire grants so that our domestic defenders our first responders can have the resources they need for training for personnel for equipment to keep our communities safe we had 90 days to do that prevent nearly a million people from losing access to Medicaid in Puerto Rico and I will end with making sure that the people of Texas the people of Florida and the people who put the Ricoh and the people of the Virgin Islands had resources to rebuild and restore their communities devastated by Harvey and Irma and Maria all of this we need to do by December 31st what do we focus on a tax bill when will that tax bill take effect for taxes in 2018 when will you pay those and by April 15th 2019 yes that's what we spend all our time on that's what we spent all our time on not the priorities that I've just read but a tax bill that will hurt America hurt its financial status and hurt its middle income workers and most of all hurt the children who will pay back the money we will borrow to give the wealthiest in America a tax cut those people making over nine thousand dollars a year that crowd will get 62% of the resources yet the speaker says that we need to help the struggling Americans there is not a person I will tell you mr. speaker at any one of my town meetings came up to me and was worried about the people making nine hundred thousand dollars or more not one maybe it's happened to you mr. speaker that hadn't happened to me why are we at this point because we have a governing party that refuses to govern because we have a majority that has failed to do the business of the American people even for something as fundamental as providing for the operations of government Mr Speaker we Democrats welcome the opportunity to sit down with our Republican colleagues and reach a compromise agreement to meet our responsibilities and address the many of the pressing issues I've outlined earlier in this address my time is about up had we utilized the 90 days that we all voted we on our side of the aisle the Democrats voted with our Republican friends although 90 Republicans voted no but we all voted yes to take 90 days to meet our responsibilities to the American people it hasn't been done we have no confidence that giving two more weeks will make it happen let's get to work right now not on the tax bill that could be passed some point in time I'm against it I'll vote against it I hope it fails it's a bad bill but let's address these priorities but that's not what the intent of this two weeks is it's to give two weeks so we can pass a bed axe bill that will hurt America or hurt our children and will hurt the middle class Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

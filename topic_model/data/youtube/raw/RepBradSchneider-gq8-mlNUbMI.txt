hello everyone well I can't join you tonight in Chicago for the North American professionals and entrepreneurs council conference I want to share a few thoughts about the roles innovation and entrepreneurs will play in the 21st century we live and work in an increasingly competitive and increasingly connected global marketplace success in this 21st century market requires greater skill and imagination than in previous generations to achieve the success we need in the 21st century we'll need a vibrant manufacturing base powered by a skilled capable and inspired workforce benefiting from continuous innovation and productivity enhancements supported by a modern infrastructure an innovation will be absolutely key to everything else if we can innovate then we will succeed these days so much of that innovation is being done by young promising entrepreneurs and in exciting new startups startups represent one of the most important segments for accelerating our economy but lacking the necessary support and funding too many of our brightest entrepreneurs ideas and innovations never get off the ground that's why i introduced the accelerator startups act to provide critical support to startups and expand the role that business growth accelerators can play in their development I've also been pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission to promptly improperly implement crowdfunding rules so that entrepreneurs can more often use sites like Kickstarter to access the capital they need access to capital is perhaps the most important most critical issue for entrepreneurs and startups and we must work together to connect entrepreneurs with investors with the right support and proper funding we can help more companies go from start-up to step out to success organizations like yours play a key role in building and maintaining the infrastructure networks that these startups and entrepreneurs need I'm incredibly grateful for your commitment to supporting and working together with these innovators whether it's an advanced manufacturing STEM education courses small businesses or the latest startup our economy depends on constant innovation and the ability to dream up and build the industry's products and services of tomorrow thank you for your commitment in innovation an entrepreneurship I look forward to working with all of you to secure our economic success in the 21st century thanks and have a good night

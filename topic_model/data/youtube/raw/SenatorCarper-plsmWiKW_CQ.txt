thank you for joining us on on what has turned out to be a pretty dramatic day here let's talk about first should the u.s and should the state department pull this funding from countries like libya that are doing very inhumane things to their own people i'm going to leave that to a high pay grade and lead to the president the secretary of state and and those folks and let them they're a lot closer to this and let them tell us what they believe what they'd recommend that we do i would say this as a nation that's the beacon of hope and freedom and liberty for a lot of the rest of the world i think we need to be true to our principles and try to use what pressure what influence we have to support people who are trying to overthrow a tyranny as they are in libya and other places in that part of the world well let me ask specifically about another suggestion which is to create a no-fly zone there are reports that uh gaddafi used his jets to strafe the protesters a lot of folks are suggesting that we as a nation should call whether in the u.n or some other body for a no-fly zone over libya so we could prevent him from doing that again this is a guy after all who has killed american citizens directly so we should whether you're a senator or a congressman or a state department official you should have a position on the future of this guy the i'm an old naval flight officer served in three tours in southeast asia i've certainly supported the uh the idea of a no-fly zone in iraq when saddam hussein was a leader there this sounds like a pretty reasonable approach let me just say though i think there's plenty of adversity right here there's a guy named albert einstein who probably never thought much about these issues but he used to say in adversity lies opportunity and there's plenty of diversity here what we have to do is to be smart enough set aside the no-fly zones and all that stuff we have to be thinking about the long-term we have to be thinking how do we move ourselves away from this dependence on foreign oil how do we uh make sure that uh that the the cars trucks fans that we're making are more energy efficient that the the fuel that we fuel them with can come from nuclear power it can come from electricity generated by offshore wind uh that's that's the kind of thing that's what we really ought to be focused on and it's all well and good that we're and it's tumult and uproar today but we have to keep our eye on the ball for the long run and we don't always do that we we get through one of these uh dilemmas and we forget about the national security consequences we can't continue to forget that well the arab oil shock in the 70s is a perfect example of a blown opportunity senator you're probably right on that issue you know the u.s has had this long-standing harry truman what did harry truman used to say liz yeah harry truman used to say the only thing that's new in the world is the history whether we forgot or never learned and we need to start learning our lesson and move away from our dependence on this point we take all of our all this money from the us we send it to places overseas we give it to people who don't have our interest in mind and sometimes use our money to hurt us how foolish can we be exactly which brings what brings me to my next point and that is that the u.s has had this long-standing policy of supporting authoritarian regimes in the mideast in the name of stability which clearly for a long time worked for egypt but uh you know do we get rid of that now how are these democratic uprisings changing that equation and u.s foreign policy in general well i actually met uh president mubarak i think two years into his presidency and the uh the person he was there uh then uh compared to the person he became over 30 years a lot of change and sometimes we see it in our own country where people who are elected to be the servant they forget who the servant is it's supposed to be us and sometimes we've forgotten believe that we're the one to be served and clearly that's happened in egypt and has happened in a bunch of these other countries as well we we need to use our influence whatever it might be that bully pulpit to the extent that that military sales foreign aid is appropriate can be used as a tool we need to use all those tools in our toolbox the other thing that we need to have is a strong fully fully supported full up strategic oil reserve so that when petroleum reserves so that when we have a bump like this if opec can't respond the saudis can't respond quickly enough and pump up production we have our own reserves and senator let me just we're running short on time but i have to get you on the question of domestic drilling and domestic whether it's offshore or in anwar or anywhere else or whether it's coal trying to get what we need from coal fatal gate who's one of the best oil analysts in the world said we could be 100 percent independent in 10 years if we totally released our coal oil and gas reserves what do you think i for the time being we need uh we need oil for the time being we need clothes we need clean coal much cleaner coal we also need nuclear we need to move as fast as we can toward offshore wind and toward more energy efficient cars trucks and vans the cleanest most affordable form of energy is the energy we never use and we have to keep that in mind good to see you senator thank you for joining us senator tom carpenter thank you democrat of delaware

welcome back if you haven't figured it out Democrats in the house are clearly not happy with the Attorney General Bill Bar question now is what are they gonna do about it joining me now is one of those Democrats will be deciding what to do about the Attorney General it's California Democratic congresswoman and House Judiciary Committee member Karen bass congresswoman bass good to see you thank you well the speaker said he lied to Congress first of all I'm curious if you believe bill bard has indeed lied to Congress in second if this is worth a criminal or even civil referral well I do think we have a lot of steps before we get there but from what I heard in his testimony in the Senate absolutely I mean he said that there had been no communication when it's clear that Muller had sent him the letter they had talked by phone he even talked about notes he said he would refuse to give them to the Senate but you know he had said that there had been no communication so he contradicted himself so absolutely but I do think that we have a long way to go before we get to that point well what is that long way to go I mean I tell you there's there certainly I heard from plenty of people to say why did why did the House Judiciary Democrats you know why didn't they call bars Bluff and just say all right fine well we won't let committee staff question just members let's see you up here bluff well that wasn't the only issue and so you know we have issued we'll give him a while he has a couple of days but it's really about the documents it's about the complete unredacted report and all the underlying evidence so him coming and testifying before our committee is something that we wanted him to do but far more significant than that especially given the way he appears before committees far more significant than that is him giving the documents that he should give and even Muller agreed that he should give the documents we also want to have Muller come before the committee we want to have them again coming before the committee we don't want to be completely distracted by Barr well let me look the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee has an idea of how to help you get more of these records I want to play what he said morning at the hearing first and get you to react number 6 guys well they they wanted to play out this way because they want it to look like an impeachment hearing but they don't have the fortitude to bring impeachment hearings in fact if he would bring the impeachment hearing then he would have access to all kinds of documents irregardless of what the Attorney General's accommodations have already made for him here if you formalize the impeachment inquiry you become like a grand jury you get access to all of these it is a month then then basically that's that's your way of Trump and Trump in this case yeah exactly but that's the bait that we're not going to take and so it to me it is very clear there's many steps that we need to go through in this process now I can't say that we won't do that for sure but I am certainly hoping that at some point in time this administration decides to abide by the rule of law and so if the court says you must give the documents over then I'm hoping that they would be willing to do that but at this point in time you know we don't know the verdict is why do you call it bait why do you call it bait and what more information you need you think it's politically a bad idea for the Democrats then well absolutely especially right now I mean I think that the ranking member would love for us to jump into impeachment and you know the chaos that would pursue her that would pursue from that and so you know to me the idea of us pursuing impeachment when we know it is a two-step process makes no sense at all but what we need to do is take it a step at a time we need to be disciplined in that process and that's the way we're going to proceed so you're gonna try the courts and see if they agree to what the courts say how does this how does this work where do you think this goes hi if he refuses to turn over these underlying documents where do you go next right so refusing to comply with the subpoena then the next step would be you know we would definitely proceed with taking it through the courts and seeing what happens you know whether we issue citation temp but we have several steps to take if the court orders them to give us the documents which we believe would happen and then they still say no you know it's possible for us to hold them in contempt we can do that in the house we can do it on the floor of Congress but I am hoping that they don't force us to go along that way but we do know that this is a president that has essentially you keep your very you keep saying I hope they'll go down a different road what evidence makes you think they're going to suddenly choose compliance a voluntary compliance here I don't mean it I don't mean to be that cynical but I've become that cynical well you know I mean at a certain point in time I think when public opinion begins to be impacted that if his poll numbers and you know this you know that as soon as the report was released his poll numbers began to drop I think he is all about his poll numbers and I think the Senators are as well and you and I know that there's over 20 of them that will be up for reelection next year and at some point they're gonna have to say that they did something other than carry the president's water and so if they feel that they're beginning to be compromised then maybe we could we could talk if he was seriously threatened with impeachment I think he'd love to see impeachment happen right now because he knows that we would not be able to carry it through all the way and he will simply begin the campaign on that we don't want to see that happening I mean go back to the idea of Muller testifying yes do you think it's going to happen if it is up to the it sounds like the Justice Department gets to decide whether he comes or not the Senate Republicans don't want to see him so it seems as if that you guys are going to be alone and asking and it sounds like justice is going to feel comfortable denying it what do you do see I mean you know he said Barr said he was okay with him testifying but there's also McCann and you know what at some point I am wondering will they step up and essentially say you know what we're going to tell the truth to the American public period I will impressed to read Muller's letter to bar basically saying what are you doing you're creating confusion released the report I would love to see if he was told he couldn't testify that he would come and testify anyway I'm also thinking that all of those people that put all of those hours and days and months to years developing the Muller report that they might break rank and come forward as well at some point in time this is about our democracy this is about our country and I am hoping that people's jobs are less important than fighting on behalf of our democracy in our country congresswoman Karen bass Democrat from California much appreciate it good to have you on to share your views thank you

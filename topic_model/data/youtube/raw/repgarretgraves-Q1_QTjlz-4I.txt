you and i have spoken in the past about strong concerns we have related to how the administration is prioritizing the allocation of grants and you have large programs like infra and raise nearly a billion dollars each i mentioned to you that i had actually written much of the amendment had negotiated with other members the amendment that puts in law the right criteria for prioritization so when the administration came out and said that racial equity climate change environmental justice and enhancing union opportunities were going to be the driving factors i had strong concerns because those are those are things that y'all are just deciding your priorities they're not things that are actually in the law um and so then i said okay well we'll wait and see how the the grants are actually allocated and decide if this is a problem or not um mr secretary remind you i represent south louisiana we have one of the most at risk states for sea rise we have one of the highest african-american populations in the nation we're at the bottom of the largest watershed taking in runoff from montana new york canada and everything that's in that water and so i think if you go through and look at your criteria we should be number one two and three really up there at the top yet when you allocated funds under the um the infra program um i think it was 15 of the money 15 went to the state of california uh you had about 555 million went to blue states only 350 million went to red states under the raise program 162 million dollars went to bike and pedestrian paths so i want to ask you a question if you look at tom tom the navigation company's assessment of congestion most congested areas in america they said that new york was number one they said that los angeles was number two they said that miami was number three do you have any idea what number four was or is i don't so that would be the metropolis of baton rouge louisiana which puts it ahead of chicago and san francisco and a number of other significantly larger places 62 hours 62 hours a year time lost just sitting in traffic no one would have expected that that that be the case so if you took if you look at the two grant programs a billion dollars each you would think that with us being the state that should be performing atop under your criteria top under the criteria that i wrote because i'm incredibly biased um yet we got one grant and this is what it was 18.5 million dollars to improve fare collection for new orleans transit it's kind of hard to to to understand really hard to reconcile i tried to get him to find a better snapshot on google map map traffic but um it's normally dark red this is the bridge it's the only place in america where the interstate funnels down to a single lane and it's not because we were innovative and came up with a great idea that nobody else could think of it was idiotic and proof is that we have 62 hours we sit around in waste and traffic and here's the last slide is just a picture here showing the bridge that looks like a parking lot because people are just sitting there this is i-10 connecting california to florida so i want to ask how are you prioritizing and how can projects like this not get funded when you're putting money toward bike trails putting money toward let's see transit systems got 263 million dollars under one of the programs over a quarter of the funds whenever we gave transit tens of billions of dollars during the coveted relief packages the highways didn't get anything so i guess i'm just trying to understand what are we doing and why aren't we putting money toward true national priorities that will relieve congestion reduce emissions improve time saved in traffic and other things that i think we would share well our shared priorities i think are very well served by the things that we funded in the infra program and in the raise program but i'll acknowledge that for every dollar we were able to give out there were probably about 10 that applied so we had a lot of worthy projects many i'm sure from your district or your state and from all around the country which qualified but we had to we're only able to work with the funding that we had of course thanks to the infrastructure investment jobs act we have more funding than before which means we'll be able to say yes more often and we love nothing more than saying yes to a good project or a good program i think if we start ranking you know how much is going to highways we need to include the highway formula funds in that right which is the the the bulk of the dollars that go to those purposes and you have of course certain things like cmac that are you know specifically by the very core of the program directed toward congestion mitigation although there's no reason why that can't be a benefit coming off something like a raise grant or or another piece of legislation i will say you know one of the things we tried to do is really make sure that uh these dollars in infra for example got around the country regardless of uh uh certainly regardless of politics and and one thing we were proud of is i think there was a 25 floor for for rural projects we did almost double that we were in the in the 40s on supporting rural communities uh i know that that for every project we were able to say yes to there's there's several more that uh would be uh folks would be disappointed we couldn't get right but again thanks to this secretary amount of time and i appreciate you being here and answering the questions i look forward to following up with you on this and i would like to ask mr chairman okay if you could please provide the committee with the metrics for how you have measured those four criteria that i i mentioned i would appreciate it

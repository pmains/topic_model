  FORWARD, AND WE'LL GET TO THE  TRUTH. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, DEM  DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA, IS A  MEMBER OF THAT COMMITTEE. CONGRESSMAN, WHY IS IT SO  IMPORTANT TO TALK TO CONGRESSMAN McCARTHY? >> WELL, McCARTHY, BY HIS OWN  ADMISSION, WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE PRESIDENT ON JANUARY 6. AND AS LIZ CHENEY SAID, TRYING  TO GET THE PRESIDENT TO  INTERVENE AND STOP THE VIOLENCE, AND YET THE PRESIDENT DID  NOTHING FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. McCARTHY HAS SAID, SOMETIMES IN  A SELF-SERVING WAY, WHAT HE SAID IN THAT CONVERSATION THAT HE'S  TOLD OTHERS. HE HASN'T REALLY SAID WHAT THE  PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE WAS, AND OF COURSE, THAT'S VITAL TO KNOW  WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS  WERE. WHAT HIS ACTIONS WERE, WHAT HIS  STATE OF MIND WERE. THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE THAT  COULD SPEAK TO THAT BETTER THAN  McCARTHY OR TRUMP. THAT'S WHY HE'S A KEY WITNESS. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF, WHAT IS  YOUR RESPONSE TO ANNOUNCING HE  WON'T COOPERATE? >> LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT  SURPRISING. EVEN THOUGH HE PLEDGED THAT HE  WOULD COOPERATE, THAT HE WOULD  TESTIFY, BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN  ENGAGED IN TRYING TO COVER FOR  PRESIDENT TRUMP PRACTICALLY  SINCE THE INSURRECTION. THERE WERE A FEW DAYS  IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ATTACK ON  THE CAPITOL WHERE HE WAS LAYING  BLAME ON TRUMP, BUT VERY SOON HE WAS DOWN AT MAR-A-LAGO BEGGING  FORGIVENESS. EVER SINCE HE HAS BEEN PART OF  THAT EFFORT TO SWEEP THIS ENTIRE ATTACK UNDER THE RUG. SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING. I'M HOPING AND WISHING HE WERE  AN HONORABLE AND COURAGEOUS  PERSON. THERE'S LITTLE CHANCE OF THAT  HAPPENING. THAT'S JUST NOT WHO HE IS. NONETHELESS, HE IS A KEY  WITNESS. WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT NOW  WHAT TO DO ABOUT HIM. >> I GUESS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO  GET OUT AHEAD OF THE COMMITTEE,  BUT WE ARE IN INTERESTING LEGAL  AND SORT OF CONSTITUTIONAL  FRONTIER HERE ABOUT COMPELLING  TESTIMONY FROM A FELLOW MEMBER  OF CONGRESS FOR CONGRESSIONAL  INQUIRY. AS FAR AS I KNOW, THAT HASN'T  HAPPENED. WE HAVEN'T SEEN SUBPOENAS FOR  THAT KIND OF THING. HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT? >> WELL, THIS CAME UP DURING THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WHEN IT WAS CHAIRED BY DEVIN NUNEZ. THERE WERE TWO DEMOCRATS AND TWO REPUBLICANS. WE ASKED THEM TO COME IN AND  THEY SAID YES. NOW WE HAVE THEM FAILING TO DO  THEIR DUTY. WE HAVE CERTAIN REMEDIES  POTENTIALLY WITH McCARTHY, WITH  PERRY, WITH JORDAN, WITH OTHER  HOUSE MEMBERS THAT WE DON'T HAVE WITH A STEVE BANNON, FOR  EXAMPLE, OR MARK MEADOWS. THAT IS BECAUSE THE HOUSE CAN  CONTROL AND DISCIPLINE ITS OWN  MEMBERS. THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS THAN THE CRIMINAL CONTEMPT ROUTE. WE HAVEN'T DECIDED ON WHAT  OPTIONS TO USE, BUT THERE IS AN  ABILITY OF THE HOUSE TO  ESSENTIALLY POLICE ITS OWN THAT  WE'LL HAVE TO CONSIDER. >> THAT IS INTERESTING. I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT, BUT  THAT'S A GOOD POINT. YOU DO HAVE SUBPOENAS THAT HAVE  BEEN ISSUED NOW FOR A FEW OF THE BIG TECH FIRMS WHICH IS  INTERESTING. I THINK THERE HAD BEEN CHANNELS  OF COMMUNICATION FOR PRODUCTION. I GUESS THOSE HAVE BROKEN DOWN. I THINK IT'S GOOGLE, TWITTER AND REDDIT. WHY DO YOU THINK THOSE SUBPOENAS ARE NECESSARY? WHAT DO YOU LOOK TO GET FROM  THESE TECH COMPANIES? >> THEY WERE NECESSARY. WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR WEEKS AND  MONTHS TO GET INFORMATION FROM  THESE COMPANIES ABOUT THE USE OF THOSE PLATFORMS TO ORGANIZE THE  ATTACK, THE USE OF THOSE  PLATFORMS TO SPREAD THE BIG LIE  AND OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE VERY  PERTINENT TO OUR INVESTIGATION. FRANKLY, IT'S BEEN PULLING TEETH TO GET ANY DOCUMENTS FROM THESE  COMPANIES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE'VE BEEN TRYING  TO GET INFORMATION OF THE  SHUTTING DOWN OF THE COMMITTEE  THEY MADE ABOUT INTEGRITY. DID THEY GIVE US WHAT THEY THINK WE ALREADY HAVE AND WE'VE LOST  PATIENCE AND WE'RE GOING TO  REQUIRE THEM TO PROVIDE IT. >> CONGRESSMAN ADAM SC

the House Republican policy committee will come to order the committee's meeting today is from Sanna testimony regarding the hike regarding hyper power and the workforce I now recognize myself for an opening statement I want to thank everyone for being here today as we post our fifth millennial task force hearing to focus on the unique challenges and opportunities millenials face in the hydropower industry millenials are the largest most educated and most diverse generation in American history and because of that Millennials are shaping the future of America's economy we have learned in previous hearings that millenials are making the American workplace more dynamic but this is not the only change they are bringing to our economy Millennials are changing the way Americans consume and experts have identified four major trends exhibited by consumers they want products that are relevant to their lifestyle lifestyle that are immediately accessible that can be consumed collectively and most importantly they want want tops that align with their moral or political ideals most of us have seen this destruction demonstrated with companies such as uber Airbnb and Amazon but Millennials are pulling energy consumption into this conversation over 80% of Millennials would like to have in-home digital assistance and monitoring of energy consumption and there are increased demands on utility providers to provide more renewable energy the American energy sector is an exciting place is it an exciting place just last year renewable energy reached its highest ever production levels with hydropower accounting for 25% of this more than solar and wind combined what makes these totals even more promising is the potential for massive growth within the hydropower sector to make this expansion in reality a hydropower industry needs a robust workforce in fact some reports indicate there could be over 1 million jobs in the hydropower sector if the industry meets its domestic potential these jobs rate for postgraduate professions such as attorneys managers and engineers to skilled and unskilled craftsmen and clerical workers high school graduates and those with PhDs can find employment in the hydropower industry in almost every state across the country unfortunately a hydropower industry is facing an aging workforce and has not been able to attract as many Millennials as solar and wind sectors have as we have heard from previous witnesses a large concern for many employers is this loss of human experience that comes when an employee retires without having been able to impart this knowledge on a new incoming worker we must act for then stagnation in a critical component of our renewable energy portfolio and while there is no cure-all solution we do know that policies and programs that encourage job ready training and education will greatly assist more millenials to find work in the renewable energy industry today we have three witnesses who will discuss the challenges and opportunities in the hydropower workforce and their professional experiences I look forward to hearing from them and discussing ways we can further assist in growing this essential workforce for those of you in the audience or watching online you may have questions for our witnesses and you can tweet your question using a hashtag hashtag GOP future and we may ask your question time permitting we are fortunate to have a distinguished panel of witnesses before us today I'll start with my left mr. mr.

Adam wint who is a higher power systems research engineer at Oak Ridge National Lab the largest US Department of Energy Science and Energy Laboratory conducted basic and fide research on compelling problems in energy and security his research focuses on the valuing developing and deploying innovative software and technology to advance environmentally responsible cost competitive hydropower generation in 2006 he received his undergraduate degree in physics from Carleton College in Northfield Minnesota and spent four years working in the insurance industry before starting a graduate program at the University of Minnesota he received a PhD in civil engineering in 2014 and joined the energy water resource systems group at Oak British in that time his work to improve water quality in the largest hydro power system in the country optimize hydropower assets in the Lower Mekong River of Southeast Asia advanced novel applications of pumped storage hydropower and facilitate a collaborative effort for innovation and environmental design of small hydropower systems Adam lives in Knoxville Tennessee with his wife and two boys thank you to each of them for being here today I will now recognize mr. Vernon for his opening statements thank you and good afternoon madam chairwoman I appreciate the opportunity to be here and talk about the future of hydropower and the wall of course as you mentioned my name is Charles Carnac and I'm the director of policy and advocacy at Citizens for Responsible energy solutions forum or a nonpartisan nonprofit organization committed to educating the public and influencing the national conversation about common-sense clean energy my remarks are informed by years of experience working as a consultant to US Environmental Protection Agency on workforce issues for public utilities specifically in the water sector and over a decade working in the energy and environmental sector across the United States and broad and as millennia myself when it comes to Millennials in hydropower I'd like you to keep three things in mind first hydropower has a long proven track record in the United States we're building off of a legacy of stable renewable power recent technological innovation makes it one of the most dynamic sources of power today second over the next decade generation of workers will retire and require the hydropower sector to fill openings for well tane managerial supervisory and highly skilled craft worker positions millenials will be among the strongest candidates to take these jobs and finally it's in our national interest to take advantage of such an abundant domestic natural resource and paired with a new generation of human capital to build resilient local economies across the United States especially in rural America thoughtful effective public policy will help hydropower is a uniquely American clean energy source the first hydropower plant open 135 years ago in a small town in Wisconsin in the century since hydropower has become critical to our energy infrastructure in fact it provides four states with more than half of their power in another four states with at least a quarter of their power at the same time it fulfills essential needs like water management flow and flood regulation and land protection for areas that provide important go system services such as recreation and critical habitat hydropower covers a live range of technologies we're very familiar with the iconic conventional hydropower technologies dams they store water behind a generating facility in hire and harness that power as it runs through the turbines this type of conventional hydropower project represents the clear majority of u.s. hydropower generation at the frontier of hydropower looks quite different and leaves behind many of the environmental and social challenges that building dams creates the future of hydropower includes ocean wave tidal and hydrokinetic power it also includes run-of-the-river approaches that maximize power generation and minimize disruptions to the river that affect local economies and often affect fishery dependent economies miles away one of the biggest opportunities from the hydropower industries comes from the hydropower industry's increased focus on projects that maximize the benefits of our existing infrastructure dams canals water systems even abandoned coal mines we can add new more efficient generating equipment to existing facilities and add generating capacity to infrastructure that has none today other areas of growth include closed-loop pump storage systems which can help solve the intermittency and pricing problems as additional solar and wind technologies are added to the grid we can do a better job capturing energy and water all around us these new technologies are the answer that we've been looking for a key step in assuring that what we have in Natural Resources is matched with human capital ingenuity and the enthusiasm of a new generation of workers the hydropower sector is about to turn over workers in the hydropower sector are older than the US average concentrated between the ages of 46 and 55 with large numbers planning to retire by 2030 fortunately hydropower jobs are good jobs the sector will need millennial the Millennial forced to take well-paying managerial supervisory and highly skilled craft worker and technical positions the right people for these jobs won't be ready overnight it will take education and training to position Millennials to research new technologies it will take a new generation of engineers of all types geologists hydrologists biologists ecologists to design systems that maximize power and minimize negative impacts it will take construction firms managers and skilled operators this is an exciting field because it requires expertise from so many professionals these jobs are well distributed across the country too much of our existing dams are in rural America and with emerging technologies those canals drinking water systems wastewater systems and water fronts urban infrastructure in need of repair replacement can be retrofitted across America the bright lines must be put to the test of drawing out more power from the sleeping assets that we already have I'm confident that millenials are up to the challenge but it's also up to the men and women in the industry and our leaders including our elected officials like yourself to help articulate and build awareness of the opportunity at hand energy policy that truly supports an all-of-the-above approach ensures that a level playing field is available as part of that policy Congress should provide funding for critical programs that will make the future of hydropower cleaner it's worth investing in and making the newest environmentally and fish fresh friendly technologies actually operational we also need infrastructure policy that looks at revitalizing old assets as an opportunity for public-private partnerships and multiple uses that include energy generation we also need to encourage innovation options and competition in the education system that will ensure that students can get a job after high school pursue a trade or technical that will align with these highly skilled craft worker positions in hydropower or pursue higher education for engineering and managerial positions we need to start now by working with colleges and educational institutions so that the workforce is skilled and in time for the turnover of the old guard capitalizing on these opportunities will assure that we captured the economic and social benefits of both existing and potential new hydropower entire communities supported by hydropower generation and economic development are not a thing of the past done right it can help preserve the character of our communities especially those in rural America hydropower can support long-lasting careers that keep families together boost local small businesses stimulate overall economic growth and generate tax revenue for key services such as first responders libraries parks and unit-less and air water pollution compared to other sources of energy production and avoid greenhouse gas emissions it's my hope that Congress will make opportunities for millenials in the hydropower sector a top priority over the next few years hydropower is an American comparative advantage let's keep it that way thank you for your time and consideration I'm happy to answer any questions Thank You mr. Burnett I have a revised mr. Trudell for his opening statement good afternoon I thank you for providing a book filled Renewable an opportunity to discuss millennials in the hydro workforce my name is justin trudeau director of operations I've been with the company a little over eight years in various roles from our control center in Woburn Massachusetts up to our West Coast operating region in Los Angeles and now in our Northeast region in mass New Hampshire and Maine before joining book villa served five years in the Navy and I so I'll be it on the cusp roadkill is one of the largest publicly-traded pure-play of noble energy providers in the world we have over a hundred years of experience in power generation and full operations development and power marketing capabilities worldwide the company has twenty six billion dollars of assets under management with over ten thousand six hundred megawatts of installed capacity 88% of our power generation comes from hydroelectric generators situated on 82 rivers in the u.s. we operate 137 stations and seven wind farms capable of providing for the energy needs of approximately 1.3 million homes and in your district we operate 55 hydro facilities with 136 local employees roughly thirty of whom are Millennials across North America brookfield renewable employs eleven hundred people in preparation of this meeting we perform a review of our employee database and found that roughly 54% of our full-time workforce belongs to the Millennial Generation according to the several internet sources sometime around 2016 Millennials surpassed Gen X and baby boomers to become the largest cohort in the North American workforce something you alluded to earlier making up somewhere around 36% this would suggest that brookfield renewable is ahead of the curve looking at the data a bit further however I wasn't surprised to find disparities across our various job classifications most of our Brookville Millennials are working in the support services groups HR finance energy marketing and trading legal and Community Relations millenials only make up 23% of our operations employees and even in our operations group we tend to find our Millennials working in environmental and regulatory compliance project management or as remote operators working at computer stations controlling our assets from walbro Massachusetts ya know Quebec the percentage of Millennials and more blue-collar jobs such as mechanical maintenance technicians and electricians is well below 23% many of my crews are without a single millennial in other words there appears to be a real gap when it comes to the average portion of Millennials in the overall workforce compared with those in the skilled trades or other blue-collar jobs one of the things we do at Brookfield renewable to address this gap in Millennials in our technical skills trades to use internships to introduce college students to the hybrid industry we also attend college and university career days in the communities where we have assets and we host school field trips to our facilities these efforts are aimed at keeping hydropower in the forefront of soon-to-be college grads as well as the next generation of the workforce unfortunately hydro is too often seen as an old technology that doesn't get its fair share of the clean power spotlight we have several assets for example that have been generating clean renewable energy for over 100 years and across the u.s. hydro has been part of the energy mix of most states for many decades making up some portion of their face flowed power and although I don't have statistics from Millennials working in solar and wind hydro is relatively low profile and comparative lack of media attention may account for a lack of younger workers I can find our blue-collar jobs interestingly however hydropower is importance to the electric grid is increasing as it rapidly evolved Cindy compromises piper power enables the increasing penetration of intermittent renewables by balancing these resources with clean and oval electricity rather than relying on the so-called brown grid hydropower also provides robust energy storage capabilities and flexibility that Hans's grid reliability and resilience maximizing benefits to consumers all of this happens without visibility or fanfare and as a result many Millennials may not recognize the importance of hydropower as a base load flexible and nominating resource that is actively enabling the grid of the future as the US increasingly shifts to renewable energy future that Millennials in particular are demanding Brookfield will continue to partner with government representatives at the state local and federal levels to underscore the importance of hydropower these efforts will help ensure that hydropower is not only valued for its many environmentally and reliability attributes but is also seen by Millennials as an integral part of the country's rapidly decarbonizing electricity supply thank you for your time this afternoon thank you and happy NIH's doctor wait where do you let me see thank you for giving me the opportunity to reflect the high experience in hydropower industry especially like to thank you representatives to ponic for convening this dialogue on issues that matter to millennials my name is Adam width and I'm a hydropower research engineer at Oak Ridge National Lab I'd like to describe my path into the industry and then focus on two areas that motivate me as millennial support for education and mentorship and creating an environment for scientific and technological innovation I should begin by verifying my millennial credentials while I was surprised to hear I technically fit the criteria for the label like most college life and career path in many ways typifies the Millennial stereotype I'd moved ten times in ten years since graduating college and recently bought my first house to age 32 I got married at 29 I had my first kid at 31 I'm still repaying undergraduate student loans it will be for many years I read the Morning News on my phone I listen to podcasts and I said videos of my kids to my friends and family on snapchat and I left the what we need job in my mid-20s to get a graduate degree in something I was passionate about so pretty pretty millennial there yes the last one is what eventually led me to hydropower but it took a while like many young full of the fresh college diploma I didn't know what to do with my life I graduated with a degree in physics with the thought pursue the field further didn't interest me I was drawn to business jobs that require healthy mix of analytical people skills they need to start making large toodle-oo payments wait on me and I want to make good money with strong prospects for making more so a week after graduation I started a career as an underwriter for an insurance company after a year I transferred to San Francisco and double down on a job in corporate America while I loved every minute of living in the area it was generally satisfied with my job I caught myself drifting further from the career in science and engineering I dream about as when once contemplating the type of career that would be most of filling to me several broadly on water and renewable energy to complex topics that were sure to be relevant throughout my life after four years in insurance I took the plunge and applied to graduate school for Water Resources engineering I was accepted to the University of Minnesota began conversations with my advisor he mentioned the Department of Energy had recently developed graduate fellowships for those interested in studying hydropower the fellowship would support three years of graduate tuition while providing a living stipend and a healthcare allowance as a graduate student securing a firm funding commitment is a huge advantage and stress reliever I assure you it's been time focused on research rather than proposal writing I jumped at the opportunity to study water and energy applied and was awarded a fellowship after four years of grad school artists people used to get civil engineering and then double down on a career in hydro by accepting a job at Oak Ridge my ramadhan interviewed of the hydropower workforce was not by design here's a direct result of federal funding that supported my pursuit of higher education the fellowship gave me the confidence to make a career change the opportunity to learn and grow my understanding of water issues and renewable energy and the financial security to take a risk leave an excellent job and invest in myself as evidenced by my own personal journey continued support for this type of educational funding is critical to attract Millennials your knowledge any young people in the industry quite hydropower by chance because they weren't aware of career opportunities or were never exposed to hydropower girl job to me this reflects two factors one hydropower experienced periods of large growth in the best compared alternate forms renewable energy that are now very quickly so the industry has a dedicated but aging workforce with few million people and to has just alluded to Hydra policy and reliable the hydropower plants are found in 48 states if you don't live by one you likely don't hear much about them doctor what can you possibly say you must make sure you make sure off they are maybe you share Justin's thank you alright so in my opinion support for education and mentorship is crucial to overcome these barriers and attract new talent into the industry one nonprofit the hydro Research Foundation has been insect exceptional and growing the hydropower workforce hydro Research Foundation or HRF Awards graduate fellowships as soon as researching anything hydropower from dam safety fish passage and materials engineering to sediment transport climate change and public policy full disclosure in chair I've managed my graduate fellowship so I'm admittedly biased but the fact that I'm here today is a testament to their success with Millennials to supplement educational support HRM air is a fellow with an industry mentor who offers career and research guides there's often a daunting gap to me what is taught in the classroom I want to gun millennial professional needs to know to get things and Industry HRF homes bridge that gap by facilitating knowledge transfer from industry leaders to the next generation of hydro subject-matter experts professors utility executives and policy makers I believe another immediate opportunity to grow the hydropower workforce is to offer educational support to millennial veterans transitioning to civilian civilian life veterans understand Team Dynamics and our civic minded men you have a high technical aptitude with mechanical electrical maintenance experience and most are doers with tremendous discipline they're uncommon attributes may translate extremely well to hydropower much of our largest and oldest River infrastructure was constructed to enhance the u.s. World War two effort dams and reservoirs of critical infrastructure and energy sectors central to the economy and our national defense and hydropower turbine generators are some of the largest and complex turbo machines in the world the promise of a stable and challenging job supporting critical real energy infrastructure is a compelling proposition that needs to be made to our veterans in a more coordinated way I believe the federal government has a unique responsibility to support hydropower education and training for two reasons most of the hydropower capacity in this country is owned by the American people through federal agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers of your reclamation in Tennessee Valley Authority initiated Water Resources are a national treasure a true commitment to renewable electricity from water must be matched with a commitment to educate and mentor the next generation of hydropower stewards I'd like to finish by talking about innovation and hydropower I hear the same story for many young Millennials looking for work and renewable energy they're eager to channel their passion to change the world they don't know where to start they want to innovate and be creative but they neither bush right direction I see two specific hydropower opportunities that ain't creative innovation and compassion to this energy low environmental impact technologies some are data structure though hydroelectricity is carbon free and fueled by self-replenishing rivers hydropower facilities have well-documented environmental impacts many of these are mitigated through structural and operational adjustments some are serious and threaten the stability of entire of water ecosystems the industry needs for thinking solutions to move towards goal-oriented environmental improvements that also maintain the important energy and multi-purpose benefits of dams and reservoirs for example an and sediment connectivity and the establishment of disruptive fish migration corridors would provide benefits that cascade throughout entire watershed systems healthy rivers leader resilient watersheds clean water attracts outdoor enthusiasts and investment dollars and abundant stocks efficient biota are indicators of high quality river systems more efficient handling of sediment and fist fish also ensures turbines are operating as designed with minimal wear interior most existing solutions to these issues reduce the energy output of the plant generally generally leading to higher cost and more generation from non-renewable resources for your investment and low impact technologies and solutions to common environmental issues would be a win-win for the industry that would also spark the interest to fund mr. Engles finally I believe we have a real opportunity to prepare infrastructure upgrades with advances in water resource science to catalyze a new wave of innovation and smart hydro systems the river networks and power systems that surround our dams are evolving climate and hydrologic variability are changing the character of entire watersheds making us rethink how we operate reservoirs hydro plants are being called out more and more to balance intermittent generation from a girl fleet of women solar resources the hydro industry has a low appetite for risk unnecessary requirement when the safety of life health and property is the number one priority the industry is adept at adopting innovative technologies as they are proven reliable to foster innovation of reliable solutions infrastructure investment investments should come hand-in-hand with the pledge to invest in a full continuum of site we can engineer an understanding from sensing and monitoring the world around us to innovative design to testing and deployment we need better information about the surrounding natural environment to ensure dams built 80 years ago will last another 80 years investments in data collection analysis scientific interpretation to create robust forecasting and support tools that enable smarter cost-effective short-term actions and sustainable war inform long-term decision making design and testing support for pioneering but I believe in new structures generation equipment and repair methods that must perform well for decades development of inventive software sensors and analytic tools they use better data to predict failures before they happen with support for innovation from water to water we could spark a renewed creative creative effort capable of advancing the legacy of hydro is safe reliable renewable energy resource technological innovation is unleashed through scientific discovery this is the message for hydropower that many Millennials can and will latch onto in closing I'd like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts on how hydropower can be a healthy discrete for Malaya's River systems and water Matic water infrastructure matters for everyone and not just millenials is our shared responsibility as a nation to protect them for future generations thank you thank you very much all of the opening statements were very welcome together and hopes to cover as part of this conversation both traumas in Justin you reference the aging workforce and how that's a challenge when it comes to hydro I'm particularly interested in what we can do to make sure that we develop a pipeline and I'll give you an example of an experience I had this past week I was in my district during our district work period and I visited the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing which is a part of a community college in Plattsburgh in my district and they have a very effective waste energy program that is a pipeline for wood projects throughout my district and frankly across the country to my knowledge they do not have a program specifically focused on hydro what can we do to further encourage workforce development and pipelines for those operational jobs that you referenced Justin that are currently not being filled by millenials when I started Charles then I'll go down why sure thank you for the question and there's a to be able to increase we're talking about increasing awareness generally over all and trying to find opportunities for folks were pursuing technical degrees to be able to move into the hydro sector there needs to be demand for those jobs and and part of it can come from an appropriate understanding of what the assets that we have I'm a pretty big fan of the to reinvest in in our existing infrastructure it's a priority of the president and the administration to revamp America's infrastructure and a key part of the decision when we're looking at upgrading that infrastructure is whether we want to outsource the technologies or insource when you look at a hundred years of hydropower that we already have in place many of that infrastructure was built those turbines have been work built by companies that don't exist anymore to revamp those hydropower systems you have two options either you can take down the whole dam rebuild the whole thing from scratch so that's an expensive proposition and then you may be selecting turbine if you choose to buy American or not an option that a company that I'm very familiar with gravity hydropower based out of Boulder Colorado they're pursuing an interesting approach which is they're choosing to rehabilitate existing infrastructure and one at a time find the parts that can be replaced by a highly skilled American craftsmen and by choosing that in half they save money in terms of what the overall infrastructure investment is in the cost and they create demand for jobs that fit the exact mold that you're talking about in terms of jobs that do require some education but don't require a master's degree in engineering or whatever so there's an opportunity but but it needs to we need to have it be a matter of public priority to look at our existing infrastructure look at those assets that exist look at rehabilitating those those projects that they're at when we look at a lot of the concerns that some of them the doctor would run up in terms of dealing with you know upgrading infrastructure because it is if that does create some risk if there is flooding and we're looking at dams breaking in California there's too much water in other places where that infrastructure needs to be redesigned that's a great opportunity to focus on how we can increase how we can rehabilitate and increase energy from these assets that we already have great Justin you mentioned how we filled this positive story in fact that 54% I believe was the statistic you reference that they were courses made of Millennials but upon further research those are operational jobs as you referenced why has Brookfield been successful broadly at recruiting millennial C's because that's ahead of the curve for hydro if you look at it holistically and then where do you think you can improve in terms of recruiting those operational positions so I think we we do have a couple programs targeted at the millenials specifically but they are going for the the skilled labor our SUV the the management management side so we have a program called the emerging Leaders program where we we go find folks that have recently graduated college we bring them in and we give them a well-rounded some well-rounded experience throughout the company that those folks tend to stick to those support services like you're saying so it's difficult to do the same thing with a college graduate for the skilled service than a skilled job so you alluded to local community colleges or tech programs right we're even at the high school level on getting in with the folks that that may not desire to go to college and find a different path than these skilled professions and as an aside my wife is in heavy industrial manufacturing and it's the same story in her industry and no we're talking about hydro here but Millennials just don't seem to be as drawn to the skill the skilled labor so we need to we need to find ways to partner if you're talking about one of the things that I think Brookfield agrees all heartedly with is getting hydropower and the same breath that's wind and solar when we talk about the renewable energy and they know that we've partnered several programs at all the levels of the government to do that but just keeping it relevant in a conversation is helpful but I think also finding those opportunities locally to partner with the tech schools and vocational schools would be beneficial certainly it would be for us and I think we've talked about it everyone I think hit on is we operate in some rural areas where these are some of the best jobs or anybody they that they can get we have a son who was working at the plant his father built and one of our stations so they're there does tend to be some deep roots there as well but we can't rely on that to to fill the next generation and Adam you referenced the solar program for Eric I believe solar ready vets and that program is operational actually they might district at Fort Drum but there is not an existing program specifically focused on hydro and encouraging veterans as they leave military service to look at opportunities in the hydro sector how first of all should we be investing in program like that and second of all I want to ask you how we should structure that program and then I think your suggestion since you have served in the military what do you think that would be useful idea yes number one I think absolutely you should invest in this kind of program as as my panel members here have alluded to there's a gap and the workforce there's an aging workforce is a knowledge gap there's a skills gap that needs to be filled immediately and I think our veterans have a lot of that have a background that will allow them to step into a training program medially with the kind of hard skills they need and be able to apply those in either by our specific context so the structure of a program like that is a little outside of my background as to how that could work but obviously we have a lot of hydro capacity that's owned big federal agencies a lot of capacity is also by entities like Berg field and so a coordinated effort between these agencies possibility public-private partnership sort of structure that would invest in a training program for our initiatives for internships or different levels of training to help transition people that are coming out of the military into civilian life I think if you could promise a stable job and a facility that's been around for 80 years and we're making investments to make sure it will be around another 80 years if you can show that hydro it has been a stable part of our energy banks of the United States and it continues to be a stable base Hydra is an integrator of these growing solar and wind resources so it's being used more strategically areas where other renewables are growing as well I think if we can message all of those into a training program that will attract people and then use the training to learn their skills and make them hydro specific and Justin is from your perspective rather than a company certainly maybe whatever we think developing that pipeline would help fulfill some of the needs of the hydro workforce absolutely and I think you know even more and then that's being able to step into those training programs I would contend that there are a lot of jobs in the military MLS's and one in the military that are actually analogous to day one work right within the workforce electricians maintenance mechanics German taxi they all exist already in the military so it's more about getting that that frame of mind into the veterans from from day one you do before they separate right so a lot of the tap classes and some of the other programs that or that says they're leaving active duty is to see we can get some of these concept ingrained in those courses so that when a veteran electrician asks you know what can I do after I get out it's not just wind and solar it's hydro and we spend a lot of time as well bringing veterans back to the states where they grew up not everybody wants to live in the Northeast you know where where we have our operations right now but we have been successful at bringing veterans to the Northeast who had roots there previously so you know aside from the training as well I think it's even even about making it a priority yet at separation over for all three of you mentioned the lack of awareness and we keep Millennials there every day of Lincoln's over and opportunities in those sectors and you talked about discovering the fellowship program later quite late not when you first started your undergraduate career it was later long after you had graduated and decided to go back and pursue graduate and a ph.d program would be exposed to the HRF earlier you think have made you made that switch to hydro in your career at a younger age and as a follow up how can we further promote that type of mentorship and exposure in higher ed of hydropower opportunities thank you for the question I think it was probably a matter of timing on my part to want to return to graduate school I think the timing was right when the fellowship came out with HRM if I would have had had been exposed to that earlier I'm not sure I would have committed to it but I I can see for sure if I was not it's supposed to and all I can only would not have gone in Tigard or I was I was looking to get into you Renewable Energy broadly and was passionate about that and I think it's really important to capture that energy for young people today I've talked to a lot of undergraduates who are in my position who are graduating and they want to be careers in renewable energy but they don't know what looks like so I think early exposure to these kinds of programs it's really beneficial I think the mentorship aspect of it is huge if you can see that somebody else is really invested in this engine in this industry they've made a career out of it they're very satisfied with what they do and it's a fulfilling career I think that's a big motivator for anybody not just a millennial but to hear somebody that has a passion for it with somebody who has a lot of energy I think it creates a really strong relationship so supporting hydro research programs that have that kind of mirroring and aspect that I think is really important thank you I'm going to do one question from Twitter this is from Matthew velu what can college students do on campus to highlight the positive impacts of hydropower in their communities and I think that's a I'm just gonna add question because again it gets to the awareness issue I'll start with Charles and then move down there panel well I think that the thing that we need to realize about hydrants is it's all around us and so that's where if you're going to school in a rural and converted America if you go out fishing for the weekend or hunting for the weekend there's a good chance that you're benefiting from some land or water that's protected because of a hydropower project and that's so taking some pictures and sharing a month where would be a good thing to do the other thing that I think we need to do a better job of is for the folks that are in university campuses in big cities I also went to the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and so you know to look nearby there at the University of Minnesota on the Mississippi River there are plenty of of dams and lock features and understanding how those existing often-overlooked assets have made a meaningful contribution to the local economy and and still do is going to be a critical thing for folks to do so I think look closer to home than you expect is it worth my Hydra we own compatible products right in downtown Minneapolis and st. Paul is your ours the other thing I would say there are you know there are existing programs right there are sustainable energy programs and and degrees already so I would say get involved in in those groups as well and if you're close to the assets reach out to the owners we love to give tours safely you know but we do love to give tours there is a lot of recreation to your point CHUM's a lot of recreation on a lot of our facilities so get the word out bring your friends out enjoy the water responsibly but you know we can also just look at the engine curriculums and I don't know how much oversight the federal government has on that on college curriculum but certainly name recognition and and just the brains of hydro as well whatever we can do that said well I studied that saying in Falls laboratory which took in water for a day long Mississippi event always sent it through overfilled and hydropower facility and so it was quite a three-day period here in Minneapolis but one term that you've noticed is that some colleges are looking at micro grids as a way to generate energy to get students involved with hands-on experience there's one that's actually going in in the state of New York with a small innovative hydropower turbine that we're helping a developer to develop using advanced manufacturing techniques at Oak Ridge National Lab so just asking the question what does our electricity mix look like on campus wherever you know the electricity is there an opportunity to possibly you know invest in more local infrastructure more local energy mix see if hydropower can play a role on Ronald you talk about truly lovely policy in this country what are these barriers for a hydro to be considered on that Omega field compared to where that solar well I think that when you look at hydro it's an industry that's that's already standing on its own two feet and doesn't benefit from the extra subsidies that many fossil fuel industries that has been from an solar and with so I think that the argument is that hydropower is ahead of the game when you're looking at a lot of you know the technologies having said that there are early technologies that are hydro power and you know something like like wait technology is an important one where we do need to provide some tax credit or some incentive to to get that fully deployable and there's a reason for that and it's it's not looking for handouts but it's creating its continuing comparative advantage that I've talked about when you look at around the world 80% of the new hydro that's going to be coming online is going to be coming online not in the US and Europe but in Africa Latin America Asia I've worked in a lot of these countries and we're going to need to compete with folks all around the world when it comes to hydropower and we're going to want to be able to sell our emerging technologies to those countries something like wave technology while the oceans are all around us there's plenty of opportunity there and so that if that is a technology that we can master we can export it I want to ask further about wave technology and tidal power generation what regions can benefit from those new technologies and can you specifically sort of look towards what that looks like in the future I think that's helpful for the viewers to hear more specifically about sure I might defer to the naval expert in terms of where the where the biggest tides are but I know that there are some early adopters in Oregon and Washington and right now in Hawaii actually Hawaii's making a big push towards solar but also making a big push in and implementing some of the new wave technologies that are out there being piloted by the Department of Energy so what Brooklyn does intend to be a first mover in new technologies I can certainly speak to the you know the benefits of hydropower in the all in energy grid I talked a little bit in my opening remarks about the you know the role that hydropower can play and increasing penetration for intermittent resources like solar and wind so high power that could could be paired very easily and Brookfield is trying to do that to pair it with new-build wind and solar and provide a firm price at our firm energy bed right so that when your weight drops off for at night you can ramp the hydro power off and you can keep a stable energy supply so qualifying hydro power as renewable and in the grand federal language is helpful I think there's a federal bill that's already up for consideration that changes the definition of renewable to include existing hydro renewable energy tax credits there are tiered in most places and existing high it doesn't qualify for the more lucrative higher-tier subsidies and credits so finding a way to level that playing field as well and and spoke about you know the the fisheries and maintaining the aquatic habitat and that's expensive to do Brookfield recently completed a 14 million dollar fish passage and a 14 megawatt facility on a Kennebec River in me and it's something that that were we're happy to do and proud of but that type of investment in the assets could be greatly benefited you know by some some offset with tax credits or you know or further qualifying a hydro as there's low impact type of associations well so there are other program but I think we can maybe do a better job at highlighting the benefits that existing hydro can still bring to the resource and still the waters of watersheds that they manage let me guess you want to follow specific about growth you you mentioned the number of facilities in my district and just probably been northeast have you started partnerships with Canada in terms of the huge hydro resource that you could have economically in Canada it's something that I hear about people II my guess delegation visits two years ago to Montreal we visited a community of Hydra facility and it's just so much untapped potential has field invested across the border have a be partnered with Canadian Idol companies or so our corporate headquarters actually in Gatineau Quebec and and then even further than that Brookfield Asset Management our parent company is headquartered in Toronto so we have a lot of we have a lot of Canadian assets as well so when I talk about Brookfield North America it truly is North America we would tend to view the major players in the Canadian hydro industry as competitors but certainly finding ways to increase exposure and nestling we can all agree on or or finding ways to better allow electricity back and forth across the border is certainly something that that we could get behind as well what are the biggest barriers we talked about modernizing the regulatory process to whether it's a hydro facility or various energy products it's something that we work in my office a lot with local communities local elected officials when our lent teeth barriers that they run into one of those biggest areas for hydro living 21st century I have a start of you what word Allah look again new small hydro and so one of the things that were looking at is how do we lower the cost how do we lower the impacts and hopefully increase acceptance of small hydro canola mentality and so I think there are a lot of challenges within that we did a review of the FERC license in the process as one of our projects for Department of Energy and found that successful projects takes about five years to go from when they apply for a preliminary permit until when they receive a license to operate that's before they can begin any construction project and so working towards a way to understand what are the energy benefits of the project and what are the environmental benefits and how can we move towards goal oriented approaches to both of them and a development framework would be helpful to the health streets three one eternity the third process what that process takes a longest time it your study go into that as well and where is the biggest like five years is a long time specially considering Millennials who are moving around and within five years the barbacoa changed jobs parts right in that time period so what specifically is the biggest lag time in a park improvement process so there were three steps that we looked at it was from when he filed a preliminary permit but when you were granted a preliminary permit for when you were granted a permit - what do you apply for a license and then for 20 were applied for the license till when you were granted a license and for successful projects it was usually those last two phases when you're granted a preliminary permit it's relatively straightforward but the two phases were a lot of time has taken is in preparation of an operational license original license application and then reviewing that license application so those two steps tend to have a lot of back and forth between the resource agencies and developers there's so no she a ssin going on there so necessary studies that go in there there there's obviously room for improvement and moving towards specific criterion metrics that can be used within that process Justin going back to my initial question of this portion one of the babies really challenges that as you buy on projects or starting projects well I think we can we can continue talking about the perk licensing process five years is our plan as well even for relicensing existing facilities case it's five years from the notice of application to to final application and you said studies we generally spent three years doing various studies and depends on how many stakeholders there are how many other interested parties are are involved in that as well so I'm not I'm not saying by any means we should we should cut that out it's important to understand the impact these licenses within the last anywhere from thirty to fifty years depending on you know how much reinvestment there is any asset so quite a bit of negotiations with with stakeholders and a lot of environmental studies so maybe I'll find some efficiencies on the on those studies work we do a little bit more pre-planning and get everybody on the same page in terms of what what studies are are gonna be proposed and then agreed to sometimes what slows us down is will agree to a study approach and all the stakeholders will perform the study will provide the results and then somebody wants us to restate or study it in a way or a different methodology so I think by getting some clarity early on on exactly what the study plan and program would look to and then stick with it what would help cut some of that suggestion Charles I think that in my mind for permitting is the biggest period of regulatory barrier to bringing hydropower into the 21st so stepping aside for the permitting issue the money is really the major thing I mean we need money and demand that's what's going to drive projects and what's going to drive interest and it's not going to be easy for the hydropower sector because we're in an age where energy prices are low natural gas is brought prices way down Solar is more cost competitive than ever and when prices are coming down - so we're talking about new generation and even retrofitting there's a serious you know cost curve that folks are going to need to look at and understand the opportunity with hydro isn't just the profit end of it there's a huge opportunity on cost savings for some industries that are energy intensive already and I'll use an example that I'm quite familiar with which is the drinking water wastewater utility sectors these are public utilities or private utilities overall the water sector drinking water and wastewater uses about 3% of our nation's energy that doesn't sound like a lot but when you look at what their costs are 80% of their cost comes from moving water around pumping pumping water around so if they can generate their own electricity they can reduce their own costs and use that money for something else I sort of doubt that it's going to trickle down to reduce water rates and I don't know that that's actually necessary but if it provides them with the financial with the finance where they can use money that they save from investing in hydropower in a water industry and use that to rehabilitate their you know deteriorating place plants that we can avoid situations like we saw in Michigan and other cases that are well understood in this country I think that that would be a big meant and so we need to look in places where that I think that's the beauty of hydropower is that it's not just about generation for increasing overall capacity grid it can also be looking within industries within businesses within utilities to see how we can reduce costs it just be more efficient overall my last question Justin and Charles you reference the opportunity in rural America and in my district I represent a third geographically in New York State's business well art it is the largest district colonies post and there was a book that was published this weekend broken down by tell me that highlighted the lack of Economic Opportunity in parts of rural America when compared to suburban and urban parts of the country what do you have metrics or potential stats on what an investment in higher could look like for rural America that has been left behind in so many in so many ways by so many ways that we measure economic you know what way I can ask the question is what percentage of your projects are in rural communities versus urban suburban a lot other than Minneapolis and st. Paul disgusting no so anecdotally I think I don't have hard numbers in front of me but I'm just I'm flashing through all the sites that I'm responsible for we've got a couple in Lewiston Auburn Maine which you know it's not huge but and some in the Bangor area but the majority of our assets are are an hour's travel from those large cities are wind farms in Berlin you manager you're not gonna find much down there so quite a bit of our hydro is in is in the rural areas and suburban areas perhaps we can follow up with some more specific metrics for your business as you are working on new projects what percentage are in rural regions versus suburban areas I don't have part numbers and we don't have specific projects that would work on what we have there was some technology developers I would say there some of them are looking in some more rural areas where you had our dams tends to be the opportunity and one of those assets they're aging their holders opportunity that I do wrong but there's not not a lot of town about that know some of the structures they don't get know who wants to dance so you have to go through this process of identifying who's the dad who's responsible who's the stakeholder but I think that opportunity exists identify where those opportunities and rural areas for this opportunity to dance there are over 80,000 danced in the country only roughly 2,400 of them and hydropower on them so this could be an opportunity to look at you know where the girl lands and where's that energy opportunity internet yeah I don't have any specific numbers and but I could contact a few folks that I know that would be happy to follow up with your office you know on that but I think that that the anecdotal evidence is strong and I think that the case for Millennials that we hear over and over in the news is that the education folks are under a lot of pressure to keep getting more education and the opportunity just isn't materialized come I think that looks important it's important to use a hydro sector as an example of an industry where at every point in the education system there's an engine ramp and there's an exit ramp that can lead you to a Hydra job folks are coming straight out of high school can find jobs in construction folks with a two-year degree can find skilled technical degrees and this is what we needed were America because not all the jobs are in big cities and I've got a lot of friends don't want to finish or didn't want to finish degrees and are now leading with that that they're struggling to repay because the the jobs that they were able to find didn't match with the dead load that they need to carry so I think that it's part of what we need to do is is change the dialogue and reopen the eyes of America to what are the the wide range of jobs that are available there and that's where with a two-year degree that that focuses and emphasizes biology might be a good degree to have to be able to help with one of the studies and reduce some of the costs that that we're talking about that really Drive hydro powers and other projects to be very expensive to meet the permit requirements so I think that's a key takeaway about the sectors that it should be used as an example of something that has an opportunity for everyone along that education cycle well that's a great place to wrap this up the purpose of the Millennium task force is to educate other members of Congress on issues and opportunities facing the millennial generation so while you know many of my colleagues are coming back from their districts at this time I'm pleased that we have some staffers from other congressional offices and the fact that this is an official hearing to highlight this issue as part of this purpose today and most of you know that that part of the challenges Hydra faces is an awareness challenge hopefully this is one small step in coming up with policy solutions to help bridge that gap I think the themes that we touched on in terms of Workforce Development how you build that pipeline at each step whether it's graduated from high school graduating with or Technical Program graduating as an undergrad or in graduate school that there are opportunities out there in hydro and those opportunities are only going to grow as the forty five to fifty six year old hydro employees and nephrons hiring you highlighted regulatory modernization ideas in terms of addressing the FERC process which i think is even updating so that it reflects the opportunity within hydro so thank you to three of you for such thoughtful responses for making the trip to Capitol Hill to advocate on this important issue and I look forward to working with you and continuing forward to try to work with other congressional offices on expanding opportunities when it comes to hire and this committee meeting is adjourned

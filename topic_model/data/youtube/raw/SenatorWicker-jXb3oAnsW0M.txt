we've got Senator Roger wicker he's the ranking member of the Senate armed services committee uh Senator wicker let me just uh test you are we hearing your sound sir uh I'm hearing you fine all right one two three four that's great I appreciate it uh very much uh maybe we can turn the sound up here on the floor we had some um some technical problems anyway Senator welcome back to the show thank you for doing this look glad to be here I'll tell you what I want to talk about what you just talked about when you and I were helping Donald Trump cut taxes and cut regulations we we took the burden off of job creators well I gave them more freedom and you know what we did we created a a ton of more new jobs and brought a lot of money back to the United States so before you ask about balloons let me stand up and cheer uh your monologue it was a hundred percent well you're awful nice sir actually you're awful nice I appreciate it now you're the ranking Republican on the uh on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the armed services armed services Community armed services okay even better to some extent can you is it possible to tell us what is going on here we've got one balloon three metallic aerial objects that maybe balloons carrying payloads all of a sudden we've discovered this we let the big balloon run through the country and probably radioing back to Beijing all manner of Intel I mean Center wicker what's your take on this what's happening here why is this happening well what my take is that the first balloon was in fact the major issue still it was without question a Chinese surveillance balloon it was capable of a big guided uh from from a base and basically it went over the Pacific around the equator and then turned North deliberately to Alaska and and traversed several of our states over the most uh some of our most sensitive bases uh no doubt gathering information and sending it back to China every nuclear facility that we have in terms of our strategic capability uh was visited by this balloon and it really is uh it's not something for the administration to be proud about and be patting themselves on the back about as they were uh in in the briefing last week this was this was a shame it should have been shot down over Alaska or in the territorial waters before it got to Alaska and uh so that's that's the major one that we don't know much about the others as as a as the ranking Republican the the top Republican owned the Senate armed services committee we have not received much information about these other objects it could they just could be uh near space junk for that matter but it does but it does point out that our NORAD capabilities need to include these types of things as well as satellites and missiles and slower moving things at anything from forty thousand feet up to eighty thousand senator wicker I just the thing I'd understand um so the bite Administration defense department did not want to shoot down the first balloon which was an obvious balloon I mean we could all see it people from the ground were looking up at it in Montana for heaven's sakes they didn't want to shoot it down there's nobody in Montana to hit I mean I don't know why they let that thing drift sits over our nuclear uh anti-ballistic missile systems and then drifts through to the east coast where they finally shoot it down so they wouldn't touch that Center but then now they're shooting everything up there it just seems like these other things sometimes with Canada sometimes on our own it looks a little trigger happy but I don't understand this what is it that we're shooting at and why are we shooting if we don't know what they are somebody said today in the Press proofing briefing it's ruled out aliens it's not UFOs it's not extraterrestrial but we don't know if it's from China we don't know if it's really what a metallic balloon is with a payload etc etc you follow me we're like trigger happy now I do follow you uh well and and part of it is uh we just don't know and shouldn't that be of concern to us Larry yes uh absolutely if this is near space junk and at 40 000 feet it interferes with the Positive possible interferes with air traffic um shouldn't we have a better capability so General van hurk of NORAD uh has has been calling for upgraded capability I think he's going to get it but yes you do make a you do make a point they were very proud of themselves for the way they handled letting the assured space surveillance balloon go from west to east across the United States and uh and then they were mighty mighty quick to do the other things we'll find out what they are but uh if if we're going to have this sort of thing in commercial airspace in civilian airspace we need to know about it we need to be able to identify it earlier than the yes well I think I'm just gonna guess but I'm gonna guess that a whole lot of Americans want to know is this a Chinese Invasion basically I mean they're in our airspace and we didn't seem to want to do anything about it I'm speaking of the big balloon but now all these other things are popping up are we being invaded is our Sovereign territory being invaded or is it being broken you know we talk about that in the southern border with the immigration problem now it's like a whole Countrywide Nationwide thing again what is up with this who is doing this to us well I have to interject the southern Invasion again a totally self-inflicted wound by the Biden campaign by the Biden transition and by the Biden Administration uh in the first days if if anybody didn't hear that as as an open invitation to come to the southern border they misunderstood I don't know if we're being invaded and if we are the American people need to know know that about these other objects in the sky but what we do know is that China is not our friend they are our adversary we trade with them and they sell a lot of stuff to us and we're glad to sell them uh some items that we manufacture too but they are our military adversary and we are not ready to be strong enough in the Pacific to keep them from doing something foolish and so uh you know I'm I'm a Reagan piece through strength guy and we need a lot more strength in all of this whether it's the capabilities General van hurk has asked for or what our Marines and navy need in the Western Pacific we're not ready yet so okay having worked for Reagan as a child I'm the same way I'm a Reagan piece of strength guy same story as you as you well know Center but here's the thing um I think everybody wants to know something definitive about this now on the armed services committee I presume you're going to get briefings uh either will or you have already but I think people just want to know all of a sudden you know we've gone from zero to 100 miles an hour nothing in the skies now everything in the skies um half in and half out and what exactly the Wall Street Journal editorial today ended by saying what the hell's going on up there I mean I just think people want to know what the hell is going on up there where does this answer I mean you've got to have the Wall Street Journal so do I it's what I start with I mean it was it was it look it's a great question I could ask that question more crudely but I won't out of respect for you and all the viewers for this show but really all right here we are day eight or something what happens next Senator wicker maybe I'll ask that well these uh these last few objects the four objects that they're not yet calling balloons uh they happened pretty much over the weekend I was flying um I was in the air when the second one uh was uh was shot down and and uh again the National Security advisor did not even choose to begin his briefing about that he waited till a question was asked the American people deserve an answer to your very questions Larry uh we're going to get them and unless uh it is stamped as classified by the commander-in-chief or uh or his chain of command we're going to get that information back to the American people the the long and short of it is we're not quite where we need to be or we're not near where we need to be in terms of of capability and not only surveillance and interception but but also defending our friends and our way of life and our economy as as a in our our right as part of the International Community to move about the Open Seas just last one Senator are the bidens telling the truth about this stuff because I watched this the first big balloon over Montana and so forth and I don't think they told anybody the truth I don't know why it took them a week to let this you know get this thing down we should have either shot it down or captured it and brought it down I mean last question in your judgment Senator Roger wicker are the bidens telling the truth probably not the whole truth uh but but we will in a setting where we can ask the penetrating questions we'll do our best to get to the whole truth and to the extent it's not classified uh we'll let you know also got to say this Larry uh I love the people of Montana there are a lot of good folks there and I know you wouldn't want us to be careless with their lives there are places in the Rockies this could have been shot down yes without endangering anybody but I do love montanans I want you Senator Senator my saintly wife is from Montana we were married in Montana her kiss and kid have been in Montana over a century and a half I love Montana but they could have shot it down you know it I know it Senator Danes know it we all know it and to this day I don't know why it wasn't done anyway I got a job Senator Roger wicker great friend thank you sir thank you to come back soon all right

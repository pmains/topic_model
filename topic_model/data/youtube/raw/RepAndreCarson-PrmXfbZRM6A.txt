you know the the NCAA which is hosting the final for this weekend in Indiana has already talked about canceling future events in the state NCAA is in fact headquartered in Indiana and Indianapolis in my district so it's disappointing Reverend because this bill gives justification to individuals and even businesses to discriminate on the basis of religion so we'll see discrimination against brothers and sisters from the LGBT community women and minorities and we know it's a slippery slope and and this really congressman is not about religion is really not even just about gays and lesbians though they're the focal truth it's about non-discrimination I mean I've been to your town you've been there where I preach the church's we believe in religion but we don't believe in a theocracy that's right that's right and what we're seeing on the ground is that the people are pushing back we're seeing members of the faith community one of the pastor's our friend David Hampton a member of the National Action Network has pushed back other politicians are pushing back celebrities are speaking out sports figures are speaking out and what we're going to see in the next few weeks Reverend Sharpton is a movement on the ground and we know the national ethnic Action Network will be at the forefront of that movement because enough is enough and Indiana is a great state the people make the state grade but this is so embarrassing I don't even think that what state legislators are trying to do right now is to is is to push a bill through the Statehouse to clarify the language but I think it's insufficient a repeal is certainly in order well one that has really been on the fair front is you mr. mayor mayor boo the judge you've been speaking out against this law why is it some you well when you're a mayor you spend so much time and energy trying to attract businesses trying to attract people to your community part of how you do that is you try to demonstrate that it's a 21st century community that it's open to all look we're all for religious freedom I am everybody in South Bend is but that doesn't mean it's okay to harm others in the name of religion this is a bill that sends the exact wrong message about our communities and about our state and I wanted to get out there it's let everybody know that this doesn't speak for all Hoosiers this certainly doesn't speak for South Bend we pride ourselves on being open to all man the governor says he's standing by the Lord despite the backlash listen to this we're not going to change the law okay we're not going to change this law it has been tested in courts for more than two decades on the federal loan from that position I think the governor needs to listen to Hoosiers I think he needs to listen to the business community you know the interests of our state in our communities are not being well served when you refuse to budge on a very divisive social issue like this look all it would take to reverse the damage would be to fix the law a repeal would do that so would including LGBT non-discrimination in our state civil rights law if he would just at least be willing to add that kind of language to say it shouldn't be legal to discriminate against anybody in this state then the argument that this isn't about discrimination would become a lot more convincing congressman here's what the gay rights group glad one of the prominent groups in the civil rights community they report attending the governor's private signing ceremony governor pence that is is a man who equates homosexuality with bestiality one who says homosexuality is a mental disorder and another who stoked fear by claiming pastors could be for preaching against homosexuality doesn't this show what's really behind this so-called religious freedom bill congressman Carson you know it's very disappointing I served with governor pence in Congress we've had months several times I found him to be a man very committed to his principles but we've seen this before we've seen religion be used to justify slavery we've seen religion used to justify discrimination in all forms whether sexual or even religious and we've seen religion used as a tool to divide people so it seems as if there were members of the state legislature who were throwing a bone to social conservatives who were very disappointed that gay marriage had been legalized in Indiana mr. mayor today Indiana's Republican House Speaker admitted discriminating against gays and lesbians is already legal in much of the state listen to this if you just ignore the existence of this law can't we already do that now can't so install enrichment put a sign up and say no gays allowed that's not against the law correct it would depend on if you were in a community that had a human rights ordinance that wouldn't be the case that's correct ma'am would a judge your City South Bend does have an ordinance against this discrimination but that's right most of Indiana need more protections not fewer that's right and I wish more communities in Indiana would follow South Bend's lead I was proud two years ago to sign the Human Rights Ordinance and it's something that protects by the way it also protects freedom of religion but at the same time it protects GLBT residents from discrimination we need more of that and what's really troubling about this bill is it is aimed squarely at that local decision the decision our community made you know I would expect conservative legislators in a conservative governor to be for local control something that their support for on both sides of the aisle this is doing just the reverse and I just can't understand why anybody especially when we're competing for people we're competing for jobs we're competing for conventions why would anybody want to send the message that we're turning back the clock on equality and and congressmen constant at a time the Republicans are saying they want to reach out and as as you talked about with the NCAA here's what the CEO of Apple Tim Cook wrote today quote this isn't a political issue it isn't a religious issue this is about how we treat each other as human beings opposing discrimination takes courage is time for all of us to be courageous congressman this is Tim Cook this is Apple you don't get much bigger than that today in America absolutely I think mr. Cook is right on the mark what we're saying to mr. cooks point is that we're seeing a national trend where there are elected officials who are attempting tour to promote the rights of corporations over the rights of individuals Americans and even Hoosiers to life liberty in the pursuit of happiness Reverend do you think mr. man that the average loser wants to be looked upon in a way that their state represents the anti civil rights of position in the 21st century because the discontinues is going to be on the fast track toward that exactly and I don't think that most Hoosiers are on board with that look when people think of a city like South bandar when they think of the state of Indiana we want them to think about what's best about us they want them to think of our our scenery we want them to think about the Indy 500 or basketball or football we want them to think of our economic growth we don't want people to be thinking about discrimination against any group as the thing that comes to mind when they think about our state and when they think about communities like South Bend that's why we're stepping up to say this does not speak for all of us I don't think this speaks for most of us and we've got to take a stand and do what's right congressman Andre Carson and mayor Pete moody judge thank you both for your time tonight thank you Thank You Reverend

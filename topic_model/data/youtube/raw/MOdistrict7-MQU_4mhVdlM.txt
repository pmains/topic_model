howdy folks in November of 2014 I will hurt on the radio where Eric Berry the star defensive back of the Kansas City Chiefs had just been diagnosed with a large mass in his chest they said he had cancer Hodgkin's lymphoma I thought that was probably going to be the end of the road for Eric Berry three short months later our own daughter Kelly was diagnosed with exactly the same thing Hodgkin's lymphoma large mass in her chest cancerous we thought we were going to lose her we didn't know why because the prognosis for Hodgkin's lymphoma has improved over the years so much that they were able to save both Eric Berry where he's back playing with the kansas city chiefs and my daughter Kelly has all her hair growing back after chemotherapy treatments she's back at work playing tennis once again so it's diseases like this that they used to not have cures for that they do now there's 10,000 diseases and only 500 cures that's why this 21st century cures bill was so important so we can find cures to all these diseases like hygiene lymphoma that didn't used to exist they didn't have a cure for it before now they do that's why I was excited to help get this bill passed it on to the President's desk

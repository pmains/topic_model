demoni I thought you know we did that we tried to help you out with the resilient federal forest act a lot of the things that you mentioned you needed to make life better with the Forest Service we have that in the resilient federal Forest Act I wish we could get the administration to get behind that and help get it out of the Senate because I think it would make a tremendous positive impact on our national forest I hope we've learned from our history you know we did such dramatic cuts are reductions in the amount of cuts on the national force that we lost billions of dollars of infrastructure in our country and I understand what you're saying about even if you could go in and and cut all this timber there's really not the markets for it that we need and it's going to take time to build back that infrastructure and build back those markets but we even had something in the resilient federal for sac to do a pilot program on that it's a complicated issue a healthy forests are are the answer it gives us cleaner water cleaner air and you can't have the healthy forest unless you manage them to be healthy it's better for recreation better for wildlife when we manage our force properly everybody wins we even store more carbon instead of releasing about a hundred million tons a year of carbon through forest fires so we've got to work together somehow to make this this happened to see it come into reality or it's just going to get worse and worse as we go on I feel fortunate in my district I've still got a an active timber industry that gets materials off of the National Forest on the Washington the Ozark forest with even some desires to maybe expand that but one concern that I hear is that and we know that the real work happens out in the forest out on the ground and the people that are there in place to make that happen but as as you have more people retire and I know that in your you're projecting another hundred and twelve employees this next year I think up from about 30 930 and then another 30 on top of that in 2017 are you can you tell me about these employees are they people who will be able to do timber sales are they more focused on recreation and conservation which brillig recreation and conversate conservation go right along with timber sales and marking timber and understanding how that works congressman I to share your concern about not only the lack of our staffing the reduction but and also to be able to hire you know the people that we need to have to be able to take care for these lands and provide the public service so when it comes to recreation if we don't have healthy forests people will go someplace else and they won't be able to enjoy their national forest so there's a direct connection and we are of course being able to recruit folks that want to come to work for us I mean we um last year i think we for the jobs that we hired we had over like a hundred and twenty thousand applications for the jobs that we hired so there are folks that want to come work so that's we do have the they qualified people wanting to come to work for us our challenge is just to be able to you'll find ways to be able to continue to build on our efficiencies and but to do it with a lot fewer people than what we used to have and we've I think we have a good track record and as we move forward with using the farm bill authorities and also expanding capacity with a good neighbor authority that I think we have twelve states that have signed agreements with us on that and we already have projects that were being implemented that's to go is going to allow us to do some additional work but to get at the problem that you're fully aware of and that the Chairman is fully aware of we need to significantly increase the pace and scale because when I look at the 65 million acres to 83 million acres that need some form of restoration and of that there's 11 million that we have no choice but to use mechanical treatment timber sales on because of the location around etc for us to be able to deal with that backlog of forest health concerns we got to significantly increase the number of acres we're treating every year so the efficiencies we've implemented the new authorities that we have are all helping but we also need to be able to expand our capacity I'm very very proud of the work that our folks are doing in conjunction with our communities and with the states but we're kind of maxed out we can continue to make you know slight increases but to really address it so that 10 years from now when we're in this room again we'd have a different conversation we're going to have to find a way to be able to increase the capacity we have a lot of NEPA ready projects that are out there but we don't have the staff that can even put the project together and we're using different ways doing spending less time to mark trees using a description or a designation by prescription to find more efficient ways to be able to do that but it still takes the staff and whether it's the archaeologists to go out there and and survey the area whether it's the botanist to be able to go out and survey the area whether it takes the engineer to lay out the roads to be able to get that that's the staffing that we need and that's why we spend so much time talking about the cost of fire suppression its eroded the agency's ability to be able to do the work if I look back on what is impacted this agency more than anything over the last ten plus years if we hadn't had that significant increase in fire suppression and we were to maintain our budget we would have a different conversation today I know where / Tamaki procurement but we did try to fix that with the resilient federal forest and yes we did and that the Senate would act this wouldn't we wouldn't be needing to have this discussion mr. Newhouse Thank You mr. chairman

thank you mr chairman thank you ranking remember to me i appreciate your holding this hearing today to make certain that the funds that we allocate to put this pandemic behind us are targeted to those who most need it i also want to applaud my colleague from georgia for calling on a bipartisan approach to do this the congress has proven its ability to approach this pandemic on a bipartisan basis on a number of occasions before and i think we've done a very good job i'd like to share one example of my mind in december of 2020 the senate passed an additional 900 billion dollars in covert relief on a vote of 92 to 6. one of the things that this package did was to set up the emergency capital investment program and under this program treasury will provide up to nine billion dollars in leveragable tier one capital directly to community development financial institutions and to minority depository institutions so that they can provide loans grants and forbearance for small businesses for minority owned businesses and for consumers this program was specifically targeted to those that may be disproportionately affected by the pandemic especially those low income and underserved communities however as of this hearing treasury has not even had a chance to put this capital to work this could make a significant difference i raised this example because i believe we've got to continue to work to ensure that the trillions of dollars that congress has approved on a bipartisan basis are being spent appropriately expeditiously and with the intended effect to help the american people and we must ensure that any additional taxpayer funds are not duplicative of existing unused funds and that they're targeted to programs that are necessary to end the pandemic and to get our economy going again

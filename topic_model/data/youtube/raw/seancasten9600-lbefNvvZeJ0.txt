i know i speak for all this all of us this morning when i woke up this morning i went to bed last night angry and frustrated disoriented you're saying what year is this am i going back to the stone ages my goodness how do i how do i look at my daughters and tell them that they live in a country but the supreme court of the united states values their life and if you think i'm being hyperbolic that is the consequence of this decision if it goes forward if you don't know a woman who has had an abortion that means that you have female friends who do not feel comfortable talking to you about this one in four women while this country will have an abortion before they turn 45 whether in red states or blue states every faith tradition that's out there before roe was passed and signed into law rush university hospital just down the road for mayor had an entire win dedicated to sepsis that is the stone ages that the supreme court wants to take us back to you mentioned this right to privacy that is the bedrock of that our friends in the lgbt community will protect us the right to have contraception is protected by that right to prophecy your right to not be forcibly sterilized by your government is baked into that right to prophecy that is what they would take us back to now let's be very clear i'm going to absolutely fight as long as i'm in congress to absolutely protect everyone's right to make every choice for their own bodily autonomy it is the right thing to do and not just because i have dollars because i don't want people to die if you want to protect if you if you're concerned about abortions in this country if you want to slow that down give people autistic contraception period that's it full stop now i'll leave you with a little bit of hope we have a pro-choice majority accomplishment in a house we have that pro-choice because a whole lot of people saw this coming in 2016. they mobilized they marched for women they made sure that we flipped the house they made sure that i could come in and flip a seat that was republican for 50 years and not just any republican the seat once held by henry hyde is the seat that i hope the man who put a budgetary ruling that already effectively killed rome for the women who don't have the means that those of us who are fortunate more fortunate to do jan i remember when i first got elected i said i want to be the person giving the seat to make sure that i can cast the deciding vote to cause them to end in the height amendment i'm proud to co-sponsor the each woman act to do that i'm delighted that we passed the women's health protection act which would take which would give every woman the right to full abortion service but would also more importantly take the rights away from the supreme court because it's clear they don't have the responsibility right now we've got 48 senators so we're on board with somebody um we've got 52 which i think it's more important because of the bill of posture and there's our government's rights um and so we just need y'all to get look we're going to be able to vote we got to get out there we've got to pass these laws and we've got to do it because we are kind and decent people i know the majority of us are even if we got some problems with some of our colleagues across the island so thank you for being here

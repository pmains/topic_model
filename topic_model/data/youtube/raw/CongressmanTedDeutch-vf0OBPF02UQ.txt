Thank You ranking member angle and chairman Royce for your support of this legislation and special thanks to my colleague chairman McCaul for your leadership and recognising the need to take action we must work together to stop the brutal Iranian regime's human rights abuses and demand the release of American hostages that Iran is using as pawns for political leverage I'm proud to partner with you mr. McCall on this effort the Iran Human Rights and hostage-taking Accountability Act sends a clear message to the Iranian regime and to the rest of the world this Congress this country will not tolerate the flagrant disregard of the most basic of Human Rights my colleagues have explained the merits of this bill and I know it is difficult for many Americans to imagine but we are here today to show our resolve in the face of really unbelievable circumstances for my constituents the family of Robert Levinson this is a nightmare that they have lived for 11 years Bob Levinson is the longest held American hostage in history he disappeared in Iran on March 9 2007 imagine 11 years without your husband or your father imagine having grandchildren who have never had the chance to meet their grandfather imagine 11 anniversaries dozens of family birthdays and holidays that pass by without Bob just an empty place where Bob should be sitting Bob's wife Christine and his seven children Susan Stephanie Sarah Dan David Samantha and Doug have been tireless advocates for their father they've traveled to Iran themselves looking for answers they have made the trip to Washington DC countless times to meet with government officials members of Congress they have fought for action all the way to the oval office directly appealing to President Bush President Obama and President Trump they have watched as others have returned home to their families they have listened with hope as Iran's leaders have promised operation and they have been disappointed more times than they can count as promises go unfulfilled year after year after year Iran has become adept at this cruel game because that is what it is to this rogue Iranian regime they say that hostages are not hostages but these these people are not detained under illegal order they have lost their freedom they have been separated from their families and they have been held under the shamelessly trumped up and false charges any attempt to show due process or trials has been a sham to the Levinson's to the namazi family the czaka family the Lange family and the other families whose loved ones are being held we stand with you today we speak clearly and loudly with one bipartisan voice to send the message that no country no rogue regime will use American lives as leverage to further a dangerous agenda this bill isn't about the nuclear deal nothing in this bill precludes our continued participation in the jcpoa but this bill makes clear the importance of closely coordinating with our allies and partners whose citizens have also been held hostage by Iran to apply pressure on the regime if we are going to counter Iran's abuses Iran's terrorism Iran's threats to our troops and our national security interests we must work in tandem with our partners around the globe we will stand together against repression and the violation of human rights we will stand together against religious persecution we will stand together for the rule of law and democratic values and taking hostages and violating the most fundamental values that cut to the core of our dignity as human beings is unacceptable to this Congress and to members of the international community I urge all of my colleagues to stand up to Iran's rogue regime to stand up for human rights and for the people of Iran to stand with 11 sands and the other families whose loved ones are missing from their lives and to fight for their return home by supporting this bill please support HR 47:44 and together we will stand for basic human rights I yield back

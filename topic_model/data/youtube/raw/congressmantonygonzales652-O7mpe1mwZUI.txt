congressman tony gonzalez from district 23 is joining me here on the stevens roofing newsmaker hotline congressman great to meet you here on the air and thank you for coming on the show appreciate it very much yeah i know this is my first time on the show trey thanks for having me i'm excited about it it's good to have you me too um so let's talk about the border real quick here because that's the that's the big story uh obviously that is the big story there's not a bigger crisis or a bigger story that is affecting not only us here in south texas but i i believe the entire country right now so uh just a general overall view from from your point of view ten thousand feet in the air looking down at this thing yeah so you know my district's uh 42 percent of the southern borders i'm literally on the border every single week and everybody from ranchers the farmers the elected officials the border patrol agents tariffs everybody says the exact same thing which is this is as bad as it's ever been worse and sadly it's getting worse exactly every month that goes by it gets worse meanwhile the biden administration is saying everything is okay everything is not okay and uh you know they have they have done specific policy decisions that have made things worse and above all that people are dying i mean there's these migrants that are dying horrible deaths it's all terrible although people don't feel safe in their homes it's all just a chaotic situation all the way around so now we uh and this is something we've been talking about we're seeing a spike in covet and uh i've been saying since joe biden became president you open the border sir and you're going to be importing covet and now we have a report out of uh uh rio grande that 40 agents tested positive in the rio grande this week alone 40 of our border patrol agents don't tell me kobe's not coming into the southern border it sure is that's exactly now you're spot on and look i visited all these facilities i visited the facility at jbsa in san antonio the one in fort bliss out in pecos um out in um eagle pass all every single one of them and it's the story is the same about 10 percent of the population has coveted well what i'm seeing now is the spike is happening i got a call yesterday from the facility out in pecos uh the unaccompanied minor facility out there that they're having an outbreak so to your point i mean it is a dangerous situation and our border patrol agents our sheriffs they're on the front lines of this hall i mean they're the ones that are kind of the last uh strand keeping the the uh the floodgates from from boston wide open so i i have a report now that the fentanyl that's coming into the country now is up to levels that would kill over 70 percent of the united states that was caught just this month coming across the border 78 percent higher this fiscal year than last year 8507 pounds of fentanyl compared to 4 000 pounds that came in last year 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and just a tiny amount kills people but more than 70 percent of the people in our country could be killed by the amount of fentanyl that came in last month across the southern border absolutely i mean the fentanyl it highlights the dangers of it all what really scares me and you're you're spot on i mean the numbers are historic numbers and we should all be terrified of it but the the the part that really scares me is what about all the stuff that we aren't catching what about of course you know if you go if we were able to catch this which we know that's only a a sliver of it what about all the other stuff that's coming in i go back to it fighting caused this crisis biden has to fix it i mean there it's a leadership it's a failure of leadership on that uh on the on the white house but meanwhile it really feels like texans are alone like we're alone to go about this battle it's very frustrating um but uh but things are only getting worse uh by the day okay so uh have you heard from the vice president she's the board of person the board you know and your your district is 40 percent of the border have you heard from her i have not and that was one of the things too is like i reached out and i early on and honestly to this day too is ago look every president has had to deal with border security immigration every single one of them and and biden is no different sometimes you handle it better than others and clearly y'all haven't been handling it well i want to work with you i want you to know what's happening on the ground but they are so um like their head in the sand that they know best uh this this 30 000 foot we're gonna do what's best for you i mean it's it's really unfortunate um they have no interest bottom line is this they have zero interest in solving this problem these are these are future voters these are voters that are going to vote against you uh these are voters are going to vote for democrats and and and this is uh this is the plan it's been the plan from the very beginning i have an exclusive report from them right now uh from the democrats i'm talking about tearing down ice piece by piece demolishing ice getting rid of ice cutting 331 million dollars below the 2021 enacted level from their their funding and much more that they're doing to tear apart ice before run out of time congressman i do have to ask you about laughlin air force base however um it came to me that you were the one who encouraged that our military be flying people out of laughlin air force base all across the country illegal aliens so i wanted to give you a chance to explain if that's so why why would that be a smart thing to do yeah no this is this is my take on it is um i am 100 uh against catch and release and uh this crisis started kind of in the rio grande valley and uh and that was the the hot uh hot topic area for the longest time well now the hot button area is in del rio yep so in the rio grande valley they had excess amount of migrants so what they were doing they were releasing them in the streets at the beginning and then they started flying them to other detention centers so in del rio the same thing was happening they were getting over a thousand migrants and they were releasing 300 migrants a day at the stripes imagine being at valero down the street and 300 migrants are there not only today but tomorrow the next day like it wouldn't there was no end in sight so all i did was this is to go look catch and release is unacceptable these these people need to be processed whether they get processed in del rio whether they get processed in el paso i don't care where they get processed but they have to get processed they cannot be released into our streets uh without that and that's what's happening there um i reached out to laughlin i'm gonna visit them here in the next couple weeks just to make sure everything uh is happening the way uh the way that it was intended but uh i'm told there are no military planes that are being used that this is ice and dhs the only thing they're using at loftland is the airfield and and for me the reason i pushed on that was i go what do you need in order to not release migrants in the streets but where are they they're releasing them somewhere though tony where are they releasing them yeah they send them to these processing centers and then they get processed and then from there honestly they go all over the country literally all 50 states i mean everybody everybody's in on i mean every every state every city is a border city the chaos is through the roof i mean the bottom line is the only way this gets solved is if the biden administration you know pulls its head out of its ass and honestly reinstates some of the the trump policies that work well look uh the the only one they need to do is stay in mexico that's the only policy they put back in place stay in mexico that's it you you have to stay there uh and that was the first thing that joe biden took down and anybody could have seen what was going to happen he promised them health care he said you don't have to stay in mexico come on in and now they're shoving over fences to get in here and i've got rancher friends are having their property completely destroyed they're having to sleep with guns in the bed next to them because they've been threatened their wives and children have been threatened by these people and the main thing that they will say over and over again is that this is a different type of migrant who's coming in here now they're more aggressive now than they were 10 20 30 40 50 years ago back in the cesar champions days different world back then today they're very aggressive and they're coming after folks i just when i heard about the laughlin thing i went off because the way it was presented to me is that the military with military aircraft and members of the military were taking these people and flying them all over and just cutting them loose in the streets wherever they they you know took them to they were just cutting them loose and and letting them go and i had a hissy fit right here on the i don't know that's not even a cool term anymore i lost my ass right here on the radio station because that that is not the place of our military no way i i agree i agree a thousand percent i mean they shouldn't be focused on this at all sadly everybody is sucked into this chaos yeah you look at fort bliss they're sucked into the chaos as well you look at jbsa like at lachlan like everybody has been sucked into this but uh no i'm being told no military planes are used the only thing they use at laughlin is the airfield to fly these instead of catching instead of releasing them in the streets in del rio which is a major problem oh i know it is flying them they're flying them to other detention centers to get processed i've got friends in del rio who tell me that it's just a huge mess and and seeing the people walking all over the street uh one quick phone call here chris you're on ktsa with congressman tony gonzalez go ahead chris yeah i'm just wondering uh congressman gonzalez why were you one of the 35 that voted to establish a what is i guarantee you a partisan commission to uh investigate one six and i'll hang up and listen hey go ahead crystal listen he'll listen go ahead tony okay hey chris thanks for that thanks for that question so i had two choices and and we're seeing what happened i had a choice number one is a partisan commission which is exactly what nancy pelosi wants this commission that she would control and you're seeing it unfold and option two was a bipartisan commission where republicans actually had a seat at the table we would determine uh who was going to be subpoenaed look it's all going to be a circus but that was going to be less of a circus um i also say i voted against the january 6th commission led by nancy pelosi so we're seeing that right now the bottom line is this i mean pelosi has one thing one goal and that is uh everything's about trump i mean trump's not even in office anymore and they wake up and they they go to bed thinking about trump bottom line she is a lame duck she is a lame duck speaker and her time is going to be up in 22. so they uh yeah uh so i thought it was a smart move that that mr mccarthy did yesterday and i thought it was a a good way of proving once again that this is nothing more than msnbc with subpoena power that's all nancy pelosi is going to do with this it's going to be like the impeachment process she says she wants something with legitimacy then why is adam schiff on that committee you know it just makes no sense at all as to why uh they're doing this other than two things they're trying to do out of this tony number one is they're going after donald trump you're a million percent correct they are scared of him in 2024 so they're going after him and number two they're going to use it to take civil liberties away from ordinary citizens like you and me that's exactly what they're gonna do yeah and you know what they don't talk about blm they don't talk about the riots in uh in portland none of that this is this is all a political circus um i saw this coming a mile away i you know i'd rather have uh uh republicans on there with a say in on it than what we're gonna have now but i mean i think it's very evident uh you know her saying you can't have jim jordan and jim banks which is ridiculous you don't get to choose what members we put on this commission but i i do like mccarthy's approach to go you know what we're not going to play at all and it's going to be evident that this that your whole commission has nothing to do with with making sure another january 6 never happened sir we're out of time i hope we do it again yeah appreciate it thanks thank you for your time

mr. speaker to someone who's lived his entire life in the state of Mississippi and had to endure a symbol that represented bigotry hatred and everything this country is not I'm convinced that an effort to remove this flag from the hallowed halls at House of Representatives is the right thing to do we all know the history of the south we know the secessionist motivations behind the Civil War and and my ancestors were those individuals who are held in bondage against their will we are a nation of laws we should not identify with symbols of hatred and bigotry that flag those symbols should be put in a museum they should not be flown on the inner circumstance where there is freedom and dignity in this great institution of ours I know it's a hard choice for members to do but I saw what happened in Charleston South Carolina last Wednesday the whole world sword and they did not like it and so this is one step toward getting us healed as a nation so I take it they're personal I've had churches burned in my district I've had men and women killed for trying to do the right thing and yet when I see people trying to defend that way of life under which that flag represents this is not who we are as an institution and because of that i offered the privileged resolution i understand where we are with it but I have issues with it I appreciate the gentleman yielding the two minutes and I urge my colleagues to oppose the referral of this resolution to committee

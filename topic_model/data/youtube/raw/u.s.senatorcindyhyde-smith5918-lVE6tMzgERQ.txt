and i too thank you for being here and i wish that i could say that canceling these latest oil leases came as a surprise but it is no surprise at all the day joe biden put his hand on the bible and he was sworn in as president of the united states he began this to destroy american energy and it's just par for the course that he continues this war on american energy it's also par for the course for them to blame everybody except the white house and the president they blame democrats they blame i mean they blame republicans they blame putin they blame all companies but americans that has been said here before at this podium they know better you know as senator kennedy said this is just the basic fundamentals of economics a ninth grader can figure this out and so many of us has we've introduced legislation with real solutions that um to address this it's fallen on deaf ears so it is purposely done and uh the biden administration and the democrats need to take this crisis seriously and stop finding every excuse in the book to shrink energy production and until this happens every family and business in mississippi and around this country will continue to pay the price of biden's failed energy policies

you senator hi i'm angie walsh a caseworker in senator manchin's martinsburg office as you just heard senator manchin's main priority is to represent west virginia and that is why he values hearing

his staff to be there when he has to be in washington dc our staff motto is how may we help you because the senator expects us to give excellent customer service to all west virginians who contact him i'd like to begin by introducing another member of the senator's staff jordan brossey jordan is the senator's legislative correspondent for issues involving the social security administration jordan will be providing a legislative update thank you angie protecting vital programs like social security is one of the senator's top priorities especially if social security is projected to face insolvency and beneficiaries may see their benefits reduced as soon as 2033 if congress does not act that is why senator manchin introduced the time to rescue united states's trusts or trust act a bipartisan bicameral bill that would create a process to rescue the endangered federal trust funds and rein in the national debt the trust act would provide a vehicle to address the key structural issues behind the debt and allow congress to put our major federal programs on a stronger footing in addition the senator remains focused on addressing the benefits cliff that forces individuals to choose between accepting additional hours of work or perhaps a promotion or losing the benefits they rely on such as medicaid supplemental nutritional assistance and more senator manchin will continue to work with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take common-sense steps that can address these issues keep social security solvent and support beneficiaries in west virginia as a nation we have made solemn promises to our seniors and we must keep them senator manchin will continue to prioritize our seniors in west virginia and others across the country thank you thank you jordan also

ssa.gov can provide survey services and many more in closing i want to remind the public that your safety and security are at the forefront of our services at social security we want the public to be cautious of social security scams and to protect personal information we may reach out to you by telephone if you have ongoing business with social security however our representatives will never threaten you or threaten to take legal action against you if you do not provide information in these cases please do not provide personal information just hang up the phone and that is what a social security scam i want to thank you senator manchin for allowing me to provide these important updates thank you kim at least 18 percent of the calls senator manchin ask his staff to assist with every day deal with the constituent questions regarding benefits the overpayment of benefits even something as simple as how to obtain a replacement social security card through our conversations with constituents we've asked west virginians to share their stories and questions with us after each question kim will provide the most up-to-date information to resolve the constituents concern our first question today is from delegate daniel linville of capitol county so i found myself helping my father after he filed for social security disability benefits after a medical injury and he really wasn't receiving a timely response he'd been told that his claim was in medical review but we had no way of knowing how long that that might take or what to expect and so after several months i reached out to senator manchin's office and i just really like to know you know what recommendations uh can you give constituents um whose case is under a medical review and is there any way to expedite that processing um of that case if the constituent or their family has a significant financial hardship social security strives to pay the right person the right amount at the right time when making a disability decision we want to ensure that we made the proper decision we recognize this can cause delay in payment but ensuring a proper decision will prevent overpayments and undue hardship in the future although there's no specific period we can provide as to when a decision will be completed we can provide the examiner with updates regarding the applicant's financial dire needs status and hopes to escalate that decision process communication and documentation is key to providing accurate service results our next question is from rose snead of kanawha county i had applied for benefits and found it to be a lengthy process can you explain the delay between getting an approval receiving back pay thank you for that question we understand that applying for disability benefits is an in-depth process upon approval of a disability application social security often needs to update the information in order to complete the application and ensure the proper benefit amount is paid as soon as you receive your decision notice call social security to schedule an appointment to update your application if we need additional documentation it's important to provide that information to us as quickly as possible our representatives will explain in detail what documentation and the best way to send us that information our next question is from monique odin of kanawha county recently i lost um two loved ones within a very short period of time i was very overwhelmed with all that was expected of me um i had trouble contacting the social security office the probate office i reached out to the senator's office to get some help and support my question is how can the social security office notify people if there are additional benefits or assistance that is available for them after the loss of a loved one i appreciate this question the loss of a loved one is a very difficult time and in the event of a death it's important for a family member or a friend to call the social security to inquire about potential survivor benefits currently an individual cannot apply for survivor benefits through our website so if benefits are due with survivor we'll need to set up an appointment to take that application oftentimes funeral directors will notify us of a death and our representatives will use this information to look for potential survivor benefits and we'll send a letter to the potential applicant to contact us for an appointment our last question is from miss carr corner of putnam county my father recently lost his social security card and he was asked by a social security representative to mail in his driver's license recently as proof of his identity to get a replacement my dad doesn't feel comfortable sending his driver's license in the mail and also he needs his driver's license for driving so is there a better way that he can obtain a social security card because he's not real tech savvy as well as you are aware during the height of the pandemic our offices suspended these types of in-person services and requested customers to submit a complete and signed social security replacement card application along with a form of valid identification we understood that many could not mail in their driver's license state identification card or passport so we recommended these individuals submit secondary forms of identification such as certified medical records this is still a valid option for requesting a replacement social security card by mail but the good news is as of april 7th a resident of west virginia can visit a local social security office during our normal business hours and request that replacement social security card in person these were some great questions and i know there are so many people around the state with the same questions i hope this information will be helpful and i'll turn it back over to senator manchin thank you to everyone for joining us today i hope you will join me next time for the next installment of this video series follow my facebook page or subscribe to my newsletter on my website www.mansion.senate.gov stay up to date on upcoming events and again if you need assistance with the state or federal agency please contact my office at my staff and i 304-342-5855 always ready to help every west virginian thank you [Music]

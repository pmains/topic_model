but it seems that for every step forward we take on policy we're taking two steps backwards on projects um perfect example of that is the ambler access road just kind of stunning that the administration has openly conflicted its commitment to supply chain security and deliberately set back one of its best options to improve it ambler has a guaranteed right-of-way under a 1980 law under anilca that the federal government has to has to abide by i do understand of course the need for tribal consultation i strongly support it but that can occur even as access project continues so telling ambler to stop all work and lose a field season i think is is a ridiculous approach that undermines any credibility the administration may be seeking on mineral security we what we need here is a strategic focus to reduce our dependence on china and russia other adversarial nations but not not an incoherent approach on minerals

A SENATOR: MADAM PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA. MR. KAINE: MADAM PRESIDENT, I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN A COLLOQUY WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM VIRGINIA, SENATOR WARNER. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. KAINE: MADAM PRESIDENT, I AM TRYING TO MAKE SENATE HISTORY AS THE FIRST SENATOR TO GIVE A SPEECH WITH A VISUAL AID THAT IS A PICTURE OF A T-SHIRT. SO WE'LL SEE IF THE SENATE HISTORIAN WILL BACK ME UP ON THIS. THIS IS A T-SHIRT THAT IS 21 YEARS OLD, AND IT'S A WARNER WARNER-KAINE-McEACHIN T-SHIRT. I HAVE MOVED RECENTLY FROM MY HOUSE OF 30 YEARS INTO A CONDO AND THERE'S WHOLE BOXES OF STUFF THAT STILL MONTHS LATER I'M TRYING TO UNPACK. OVER THE WEEKEND I GOT INTO ONE OF THESE BOXES WITH A LITTLE FREE TIME AT THE END OF THANKSGIVING WEEKEND, AND THE GOAL WAS TO GO THROUGH IT AND THROW AWAY AS MUCH AS I COULD. I WAS GOING THROUGH THESE T-SHIRTS, AND I CAME ACROSS THIS ONE. THIS IS A T-SHIRT FROM A 2001 CAMPAIGN IN VIRGINIA WHERE THREE LONG-TERM FRIENDS, SHARED A TICKET RUNNING FOR VIRGINIA GOVERNOR, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL. WHEN I CAME ACROSS THE T-SHIRT THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS I'M A LITTLE BIGGER THAN I WAS 21 YEARS AGO AND IT DOESN'T REALLY FIT, SO I PUT IT IN THE GOODWILL PILE. AS I GOT THROUGH THE BOX AND I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE THAT DECISION, THOUGHT I SHOULD PICK THIS ONE OUT OF THE GOODWILL PILE AND SAVE IT, AND I DID, WASHED IT AND PUT IT IN THE DRAWER. OBVIOUSLY MARK AND I ARE ON THE FLOOR TODAY BECAUSE OUR DEAR FRIEND DONALD McEACHIN, 61 YEARS OLD, WE GOT THE SURPRISING NEWS LAST NIGHT -- AND I HEARD ABOUT IT FIRST FROM MARK -- THAT DONALD PASSED AWAY IN HIS SLEEP AT HOME IN L RICHMOND AND FOUND BY HIS WIFE WHO IS ALSO A DEAR FRIEND. MARK AND I WANTED TO COME TO THE FLOOR AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DONALD. I'LL TALK FOR A BIT AND ASK MARK TO OFFER HIS REFLEXES. I MET -- HIS REFLECTIONS. WE ARE THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER BASICALLY FOR 40 YEARS. I MOVED TO RICHMOND WHERE I ONLY KNEW ONE PERSON IN VIRGINIA, MY SOON TO BE WIFE, I HAD TAKEN A JOB AT A LAW FIRM AND I WAS GIVEN THE LAST OFFICE DOWN THE HALL. A FEW MONTHS AFTER I JOINED THE FIRM IN SEPTEMBER OF 1984, A VERY PERSONABLE GUY CAME IN AND SAID WHO'S IN MY OFFICE, AND IT WAS DONALD McEACHIN. DONALD WORKED AT THE FIRM AS A SUMMER ASSOCIATE THE SUMMER BEFORE, WAS NOW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA LAW SCHOOL AND CAME TO FIND ME OCCUPYING THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD WORKED THE PREVIOUS SUMMER. HIS CHALLENGE TO ME BEGAN A WONDERFUL FRIENDSHIP. DONALD SOON GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CAME TO RICHMOND, THE CITY OF HIS BIRTH AND UPBRINGING, TO PRACTICE LAW AT A DIFFERENT FIRM. WE HAD CASES TOGETHER. SOON AFTER HE CAME, HE BECAME ENGAGED TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS NOW THE COMMONWEALTH'S ATTORNEY, THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR IN RICHMOND, COLETTE WALL -- McEACHIN. THEY HAD A BIG WEDDING PARTY THAT MY WIFE AND I WERE PROUD TO BE INVITED TO AND WE BEGAN THIS WONDERFUL FRIENDSHIP, THESE TWO COUPLES. DONALD WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TRIAL ATTORNEYS IN RICHMOND, STARTED A FIRM AFTER HE PRACTICED AT A LARGER FIRM. DONALD AND L.G. STARTED A LAW FIRM AND HE WON HISTORY MAKING VERDICTS IN VIRGINIA. BUT HE WAS ALWAYS PASSIONATE ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE. HE HAD GONE TO THE UNIVERSITY AND HAD BEEN PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT BODY THERE. THEN WHEN HE WENT BACK HE ALWAYS HAD IN HIS MIND THAT HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE REALM. ABOUT THE TIME I WAS RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL IN RICHMOND, DONALD RAN AND SUCCESSFULLY BECAME A MEMBER OF THE VIRGINIA GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES AND HE SERVED THERE WITH DISTINCTION ESPECIALLY IN LEADERSHIP ROLES ON THE COURTS OF JUSTICE COMMITTEE WHERE HE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THE VIRGINIA JUDICIARY IN VIRGINIA CRIMINAL AND CIVIL PROCEDURE. UNTIL HE, A LEGISLATOR, MARK WARNER, A PROMINENT PHILANTHROPIST IN VIRGINIA, ENTREPRENEUR, AND TIM KAINE, AT THAT TIME THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF RICHMOND, LANDED ON A TICKET TOGETHER IN 2001. WE RAN STATEWIDE IN AN AMAZING CASE AT THAT TIME IN VIRGINIA, GETTING ELECTED AS A DEMOCRAT IN VIRGINIA WAS LIKE BEING HARRY HUDINI AND TRYING TO WORK YOUR WAY OUT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE ESCAPE SITUATION. IT WAS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT. MARK REALLY SET TREMENDOUS HISTORY BY WINNING THE FIRST BIG STATEWIDE RACE IN A NUMBER OF YEARS AS A DEMOCRAT, AND I HAD TO WIN MY OWN RACE. I WASN'T ON THE TICKET WITH MARK, BUT HIS STRONG PERFORMANCE HELPED ME WIN THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S RACE. DONALD McEACHIN DID NOT WIN HIS RACE. HE WAS NOT ELECTED TO ATTORNEY GENERAL. NO SHAME IN THAT. WE ALL KNOW THIS, WE'RE IN A LINE OF WORK WHERE WINS ARE COMMON AND LOSSES ARE COMMON. MARK DOESN'T LIKE TO BE REMINDED THAT HE LOST A RACE FOR THE U.S. SENATE IN 1996 ALTHOUGH I OFTEN HEARD HIM SAY WITH MAAING NI ANYMORETY THAT -- SAY MAAING UNANIMOUSLY THAT THE RIGHT WARNER WON. THE WONDERFUL  -- HE WENT BACK TO PRACTICING LAW, REPRESENTING PEOPLE OFTEN WHO HAD NO ONE ELSE TO REPRESENT THEM AND A FEW YEARS LATER SUCCESSFULLY RAN AND BECAME A MEMBER OF THE VIRGINIA SENATE AND STARTED CHAPTER TWO IN HIS POLITICAL LIFE. HE WAS A FANTASTIC MEMBER OF THE SENATE BECAUSE HE HAD EXPERIENCE IN THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES. HE ACHIEVED LEADERSHIP QUICKLY AND LOOKED UP AS ONE OF THE LIONS OF THE VIRGINIA SENATE. HERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT DONALD THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING AND I WILL QUICKLY HAND IT OVER TO MARK. HE HAD ALREADY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN POLITICS AND HAD BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL AS A LAWYER FOR PEOPLE WHO NEEDED REPRESENTATION. HE BUILT A WONDERFUL MARRIAGE WITH COLETTE AND A CARING AN UNDERSTANDING FATHER TO THREE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN. BUT DONALD DECIDED HE NEEDED SOMETHING MORE IN HIS LIFE, EVEN WITH ALL OF THAT. WHEN HE WAS IN HIS 40'S, HE DECIDED TO GO TO VIRGINIA UNION, WHICH IS AN HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE IN VIRGINIA, THAT WAS FOUNDED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE CIVIL WAR TO EDUCATE NEWLY FREED SLAVES AND HE DECIDED TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE IN HIS 40'S AND GET A DIVINITY DEGREE. HE WANTED TO GROUND HIS PUBLIC SERVICE IN SOMETHING MORE THAN CAMPAIGNS AND POLLS. HE WANTED TO REALLY GROUND IT DEEPLY IN VALUES. THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON THAT DONALD McEACHIN WAS. 2016 WASN'T A GREAT YEAR FOR ME BEING ON A NATIONAL TICKET AND LOSING, BUT THERE WAS ONE GREAT THING THAT HAPPENED IN 2016. DONALD McEACHIN, DECIDED TO LEAVE THE STATE SENATE AND RUN FOR CONGRESS IN A FOURTH DISTRICT THAT HAD BEEN NEWLY RECONFIGURED FOLLOWING A VOTING RIGHTS LAWSUIT IN VIRGINIA. MARK AND I WERE SO HAPPY WHEN HE GOT INTO THAT RACE AND WE HELPED HARD TO HELP HIM SUCCEED AND IN 2016, WE GOT THE BAND BACK TOGETHER AND WITH THAT, I WANT TO YIELD TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM VIRGINIA, SENATOR WARNER. MR. WARNER: THANK YOU, SENATOR KAINE. I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE THAT DONALD AND I HAD BEEN FRIENDS FOR YEARS. WE MET AT LAW SCHOOL. WE DIDN'T MEET IN THE LIBRARY, BUT THIS WAS A FRIENDSHIP THAT LASTED FOR YEARS. DONALD AN TIM GO BACK TO THE MID-1908'S. I FIRST MET DONALD McEACHIN IN 1989, WHICH I WON'T BORE THE FLOOR WITH, I BECAME CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR DOUG WILDER, WITH AN HISTORIC RUN FOR GOVERNOR, FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN GOVERNOR IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY AND ELECTED IN HIS OWN RIGHT. I MET THIS YOUNG MAN, DONALD McEACHIN. YOU COULDN'T HELP, BECAUSE THIS DONALD WAS IN A LAW FIRM AT THAT POINT, McEACHIN AND GEE, IT HAD THE BILLBOARDS AND COMMERCIAL AND WE STARTED A FRIENDSHIP SIMILAR TO WHAT TIM TALKED ABOUT WITH DONALD. AND MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY, 33-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, AND SHE REMEMBERS DURING THE DECADE OF THE 1990'S AND THROUGH THE EARLY 2000'S WHEN WE WERE CAMPAIGNING TOGETHER, TIM'S FAMILY, OUR -- MY FAMILY AND DONALD AND COLETTE'S FAMILY, WHETHER THEY LIKED IT OR NOT, ALL THESE KIDS WERE THROWN TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WERE ALL ENGAGINGED IN POLITICS. AND WE REMEMBERED DONALD AS A -- AND TIM MENTIONED THIS IN HIS COMMENTS RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION -- OR RIGHT AFTER HIS PASSING TWO NIGHTS AGO, THAT HE WAS A GENTLE GIANT. DONALD WAS A BIG GUY, 6 GOT 5, AND -- 6-FOOT FIVE AND LOOKED LIKE A FOOTBALL PLAYER. HE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY CARING, LISTENING, COMPASSIONATE HUMAN BEING. I WILL TAKE A MOMENT AND TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT MY CAMPAIGN IN 2001, AND WE DIDN'T ALWAYS AGREE ON THINGS. HE WASN'T TOTALLY KEEN ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS DOING TO SOLICIT HUNTERS AND OTHER THINGS, BUT WE SPENT TIME CAMPAIGNING IN RURAL VIRGINIA, IN THE PART OF APPALACHIAN, THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY, AND DONALD HAD GROWN UP IN MOSTLY YOUR BAN AREAS -- URBAN AREAS AROUND RICHMOND, TAKING A GUY WITH HIS PRESENCE, BUT ALSO, FRANKLY, SOMEBODY WHO WAS A -- HAD BEEN A LEADER FROM RICHMOND, AFRICAN AMERICAN, BUT HE HAD AN AMAZING ABILITY TO RELATE TO PEOPLE. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT, GREAT ATTORNEY GENERAL. BUT I WANT TO ECHO WHAT TIM SAID, AND THAT WAS HE DIDN'T TAKE THE DEFEAT AND SAID, I'M GOING TO TAKE MY MARBLES AND GO AWAY, HE SAID, NO, I STILL HAVE PUBLIC SERVICE IN HIM. AND WENT BACK AND AS SENATOR KAINE INDICATED, PLAYING AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE VIRGINIA STATE SENATE. THE DEMOCRATS WERE TRYING TO RECLAIM THE MAJORITY AND HE WAS THE LEADER. AND HE CAME TO THE CONGRESS AND TIM AND I WERE TOGETHER FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT AT ABOUT 7:30 AND THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE, SAID, OH, MY GOSH, THIS IS SUCH A LOSS. DONALD WAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE FIGURE. THERE WERE SO MANY ISSUES, I WILL MENGES TWO AND TALK ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT DONALD AND TURN IT BACK OVER TO TIM. BUT DONALD HAD ALWAYS BEEN AN ENVIRONMENTALIST, BUT HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE CANDIDLY THAT I -- THAT CAME ON A REGULAR BASIS LINKING ENVIRONMENTALISM AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND POINTING OUT NOT JUST FOR THE LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS BUT FOR THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS IN THE COUNTRY, WHENEVER YOU HAD A PROJECT OR RUN-OFF OR WHENEVER YOU HAD BAD WATER OR BAD AIR, THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE WAY DISPROPORTIONATELY TOOK PLACE IN POOR COMMUNITIES. HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT THE NEED FOR US TO CLEAN UP OUR PLANET, BUT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE DISADVANTAGES THAT HAVE COME WITH POLLUTION AND ABUSE OFTEN FELL TOO MUCH ON POOR COMMUNITIES. HE ALSO SHALL -- HE ALSO, IT WAS A -- IN VIRGINIA, AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL KNOW, WE HAD A TROUBLED HISTORY WITH RACE, AND UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN YOU TELL VIRGINIA'S HISTORY, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, VIRGINIA HAD SOME OF THE REALLY UGLY. AND ALL THREE OF US WERE ADOPTED VIRGINIAN, BUT VIRGINIA'S HISTORY IN TERMS OF RESISTANCE TO IMMIGRATION, AND IF YOU LOOK AT ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THERE WAS A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF STATUES AND MEMORIALS TO CONFEDERATE FIGURES, VIRGINIA FAR AND AWAY TOPPED THE LIST. A LOT OF TALK, AND PROBABLY MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING, RECALL SOME OF THE CONTROVERSY AROUND SOME OF THE CONFEDERATE WAR STATUTES IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND. WHAT DONALD TOOK ON WAS THE QUESTION OF FORT LEE IN THE HEART OF HIS DISTRICT. TERRIBLY IMPORTANT TRAINING FACILITY AND MAKE SURE THAT AS FORT LEE WENT THROUGH THE RENAMING PROCESS, HE HAD IT RENAMED FOR THE HIGHEST RANKING AFRICAN AMERICAN SERVICE PESH HE KNEW -- PERSON HE KNEW OF WHO SERVED AT FORT LEE. WHO NEEDS THAT FIGHT? DONALD McEACHIN TOOK ON THAT FIGHT AND DID IN THE RIGHT WAY. SOCIAL JUSTICE, ENVIRONMENTALIST. WHO NEEDS THAT. YOU TALK ABOUT PUSHING THE ROCK UP THE HILL TIME AND AGAIN, MAKING THAT CONNECTION, THAT WAS THE KIND OF PERSON DONALD Mc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cEACHIN. WITH THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, I'LL TURN IT BACK. MR. KAINE: I THANK SENATOR WARNER FOR HIS GRACIOUS COMMENTS. I'M GETTING EMOTIONAL RECOUNTING THESE STORIES. I REMEMBER AS YOU SAID WHEN DONALD WOULD NEVER COMPLAIN. HE CHANGED SEEMINGLY OVERNIGHT HIS PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, HIS HAIR TURNED GRAY AND HE SEEMED TO STOOP OR SHUFFLE. AND I REMEMBER WALKING THROUGH THE HALLS OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND I WONDERED WHO IS THAT OLD GUY IN FRONT OF ME. WE DID SO MUCH BY ZOOM, I DIDN'T SEE HIM PHYSICALLY, WHEN I CAUGHT UP WITH HIM, I REALIZED IT WAS DONALD. AS MARK SAID, IF YOU ASKED DOMED, HOW ARE YOU -- DONALD, HOW ARE YOU DOING, HE WOULD SAY, I'M ON THE MEND. I'M GETTING BETTER. DONALD WAS NOT ONLY DECIDING TO KEEP THINGS PRIVATE. HE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT HIMSELF. SOMEBODY TOLD ME A GREAT DEFINITION OF HUMILITY IS NOT TO THINK LESS OF YOURSELF, IT'S TO THINK OF YOURSELF LESS, AND DONALD WAS A PERSON WHO REALLY EXEMPLIFIED THAT. WHEN WE WERE ON THE HOUSE FLOOR LAST NIGHT, THE VIRGINIA DELEGATION GATHERED TO DO A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR DONALD AND THE DEANS OF EACH SIDE OF OUR DELEGATION, CONGRESSMAN SCOTT, AND CONGRESSMAN WHITMAN, THERE WAS A WHITE ROSE DISPLAY SITTING ON DONALD'S CHAIR, WHICH IS THE TRADITION WHEN SOMEONE DIES -- WHILE IN OFFICE. AND I SPOKE TO G.K., AND HE TOLD ME WHEN THEY WOULD BE ON THE HOUSE FLOOR DONALD WOULD BE DOUBLED OVER BECAUSE HE WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN, BUT HE WOULD NEVER COMPLAIN. WE HAVE LOST A GREAT FRIEND AND I HAVE SAID ABOUT DONALD, HE WILL HAVE A SUCCESSOR, BUT HE WON'T HAVE A REPLACEMENT. IT'S JUST AN HONOR TO COME AN SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU THE RECOLLECTIONS ABOUT OUR FRIEND, A GREAT VIRGINIA PUBLIC SERVANT, A HISTORY MAKER. AND I'LL JUST SAY, WE GOT THE BAND BACK TOGETHER IN 2016,ERN I LOOK FOR THE DAY WHEN WE'LL GET THE BAND BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

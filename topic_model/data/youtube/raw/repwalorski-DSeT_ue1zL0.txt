uh thank you mr chairman and thank you secretary basara for joining us today right now i'm very concerned with president biden's border crisis in the surge of unaccompanied minors that we've heard about today unaccompanied migrant children and it has overwhelmed the border patrol and other federal agencies the current humanitarian crisis that our southern border could have been avoided if the biden administration hadn't got undone years of work on the trump administration to establish robust enforcement mechanisms close regulatory loopholes secure agreements with mexico and central american countries and constructed vital security infrastructure like the border wall the previous administration's approach was an innovative and well-coordinated effort between federal and foreign agencies and foreign governments mr chairman i'd like to ask unanimous consent to enter into the record an article from the national review entitled how trump got control of the border in contrast the current administration has rejected these common sense policies which were clearly working not surprisingly the result is a crisis that far surpasses anything we ever saw under president obama and trump the bite administration has a responsibility to acknowledge that what we are seeing at the southern border is indeed a crisis and that its misguided policies are to blame the bite administration also has a duty to address the downstream effects of the current border crisis we've seen local news reports from washington and texas about foster youth being displaced and forced to to vacate their residence in order to make room for unaccompanied migrant children this is extremely alarming especially given the already limited available more permanent placements for foster children mr secretary what's the extent to which the surge of unaccompanied minors at the border has impacted or burdened the capacity of state child welfare agencies to place foster children and then as a follow-up has any child in foster care and a not-for-profit or community-based organization been displaced by hhs contracts to house on accounting designers congresswoman thank you for the question and let me as i uh said to congress and brady assure you that we are we take every step necessary at hhs to make sure that the work we do with the unaccompanied migrant children does not impact the ability of the domestic foster care system to care for our children who need that foster care service and we have done a tremendous amount of work to try to make sure that at the same time at the border we are relieving the customs and border protection service from the uh the need to try to care in what are essentially adult detention facilities uh for children and so we've been able to uh place those kids into our custody and keep them safe and healthy the way the law requires us to thanks and mr secretary would you agree that it's important for hhs and fda to require rigorous reporting on drugs developed specifically for women so we can clearly understand potential risks or complications to women we certainly want to make sure that we follow the science and i think fda tries to do that as best it can and we are always going to try to make sure that we put out the type of medicine that we have has been proven to be safe and effective and that includes whether it's for women or for men we want to make sure that what we can do is make sure that americans can trust our health care system thanks and i think we should prioritize better data collection on the chemical abortion pill pryphamestone then in addition to killing an unborn child this drug can cause heavy bleeding and serious infections in women and yet as of 2016 providers of mifa prestone are only required to report patient deaths but not to report hospitalization transfusion or any other serious events will you commit to prioritizing better data collection for this drug so we'll have a clear picture of the potential risks it poses to women and congresswoman as you know when the fda acts when hhs takes action uh medication we follow the science and certainly we'll make sure that everyone is accountable because we have to ensure that the public has confidence in the system

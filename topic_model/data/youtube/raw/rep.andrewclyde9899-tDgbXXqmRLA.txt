I rise today in honor and celebration of national Bible week for multiple millenniums the Bible has served as God's revelation to his creation providing an account of his divine plan the future hope of glory through the gospel of the word of God renders guidance to us so that we have the hope of eternal life offered by his grace through faith the Bible is also the very reason we can live freely in the United States of America for more than 400 years settlers bound together in search of the new world to escape religious persecution and establish a free government our founding fathers wove the word of God into the very fabric of our nation with the Bible playing a critical role in the unity and success of these wise men as they forged a future that is free as John Adams once said and I quote the Bible contains the most profound philosophy the most perfect morality and the most refined policy that ever was conceived upon Earth it is because of these men that our Lord and savior's guidance has been key to the preservation of our Republic now more than two centuries later I pray this body uses God's word as our Guiding Light because a government whose Foundation is built on God and His word is a government that will have peace freedom and liberty

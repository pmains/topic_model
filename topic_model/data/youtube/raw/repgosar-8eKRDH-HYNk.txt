chair now recognizes mr gosar for five minutes thank you mr chairman and thanks for holding this important hearing the water on the colorado river has been the source of ongoing challenges near shooting battles between states and generations of legal wrangling the past in many ways is the future we will see these fights continue state versus the state federal government versus states urban versus rural agriculture versus household species versus everyone in this mix are real people communities tribes and others who are working on eeking out a living from their water rights i have a question for mr o'toole and mr davis by the way good to see you tom water in the west has been a blood support battle between layers and layers of different players unfortunately water battles have been reached a zero-sum game meaning there are winners and losers but the future appears increasingly a negative sum gain meaning there are only losers and worst losers while urban water agencies talk about efforts to reduce per capita consumption of water use the fact is the regions are still growing we heard that earlier as a result we see demand continue to rise meanwhile drought species conservation and increased demand all result in agency supports and water masters looking to cut water allotment isn't the real solution new supply things like creative desalinization potential advances in atmospheric water generation and other options like resettling like the lower santa cruz water system with mexico to grow our water resources instead of finding ways to do with less mr davis first yes obviously augmentation methods such as desal cloud seeding all those should be considered long term and there's begin to be some discussion there needs to be probably some imported water from other watersheds we've just outgrown the supply in the colorado river basin and this growth continues to occur here it puts more pressure on tape taking ag water to other uses and that as you've heard in impairs our food production and our food supply so i think we need to look long-term into other sources uh that we just mentioned yes and i think collaboration with mexico i think is a is a golden opportunity to win win win and then the second part is this creative desalinization when you look at subsurface water particularly in southern arizona we've got heavy metals and a lot of arsenic so why can't we clean water as we're utilizing water in creativity and and if sea ride sea levels rising why would we take advantage of the desalinization yeah i certainly agree with that desal from the from the sea of cortez exchanging that water with mexico for their meat water is certainly something that's being considered and looked into uh reclaiming and and cleaning uh uh what underground water supplies that are somewhat contaminated some of that's located in the western part of maricopa county that can be done uh we we have a groundwater mound here in yuma that can be considered uh as a resource for the yuma area so we we need to look at all sources uh obviously and and i think the thinking has come around to do that although that takes time and planning and this drought bites a little harder every year and uh so immediate results are needed and sometimes those solutions are more long-term mr o'toole thank you representative gosar you know it's curious you asked the question i had people in this room at my house two days ago who are looking at in the upper colorado river we're taking coal bed methane water that is developed in the upper colorado and injecting it to 7 000 feet tens of thousands of acre feet that's good water without a tremendous amount of intervention there's opportunities everywhere we just have to become more um more aggressive and you know as i told you i'm humbled to be here but i can only tell you we have to have an accelerated process to be able to get things done it's you know so thank you for the question well and i think if we can do two things at the same time i think that's what the advantage is we've got to be creative about this i worked with the nature conservancy over and over again you know looking at the southwest forest particularly in arizona there's a win-win situation with replenishing of our aquifers looking at creative solutions that you know help us not divide us so from that standpoint you know uh mr chairman i i would like to submit for the record a letter on behalf of uh stephen lewis of the governor of the gila river tribe they wanted to make sure that everyone knew that they've been participating they're they're looking at solutions to trying to help out and so i'd like to submit that for the record without objection that will be submitted and mr gosar your time has expired but thank you and the chair now recognizes

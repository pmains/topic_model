yeah I've said in here room for 18 years and I've always looked for and I think what my colleagues about for the most part of that is as well I look for win-win situations eyes look for situations where you can have more gonna have do good things for our air or water public health and you so in a way that is not impinge or degrade economic opportunity economic growth I am raised in conversations with with you mister wheeler and here today of three instances where I believe we can do good things for our planet those of us who live here and actually provide economic opportunity for American businesses I've just come like four or three two days ago he said earlier with the cross-section of auto companies from all over the world we talked about the fuel efficiency standard tailpipe emission standards and they are pleading for certainty they have said to me repeatedly we don't want to spend the next four or five years in a court battle with California and 13 other states including Delaware on what these standards should be made certainly we need predictability we need near-term relief and in the out of the out years we can with a lot of electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles we can describe for and meet much more rigorous standards for cafe I'm troubled by something you said I think you said you have talked to the woman who runs a carb out in California Mary Mary maybe three Mary nickels three times and I think nine months about this we're talking about the greatest source of carbon emissions on our planet is our mobile sources our cars trucks and vans California is critical to getting a deal so are the other thirteen states including Delaware and the idea that you've spoke whether it's her fault your fault three times in three quarters a year it's just deeply troubling and one of the thoughts that keeps coming back to me in in this in this conversation today this hearing today is the I don't feel a sense of urgency we do in Delaware we live in a lowest lying state in the country our state is sinking the oceans are rising we love tiered lots not too far away from a place called Ellicott City they've had two five hundred year floods in a year in a year I live in a not a very big state but their fire fire fire fire wildfires you know bigger the size of my state in Oregon in Montana and Washington in California than just in the last year we used to measure rainfall by the internet we measured by the flood and one of the things I I just don't sense here is a sense of urgency to do something about this we had 13 agencies that came together and said this is a huge issue it's getting worse not better and they didn't do that so because of something that a Obama law would compel them to do I think that was legislation aside by George Herbert Walker Bush many many years ago though I I'm looking for some passion here and and I just don't I don't feel it and it's that's deeply troubling and also looking for win wins and we talked about hydrofluorocarbons and threat to take place opposed to our our atmosphere and it's American technology that has a follow-on to HF seas and there's a great interest in being able to adopt a kigali treaty that actually allows for the phase down of HFCS and the introduction of replacements from american-made companies with american-made technologies and it's not some wild-eyed no liberal tree-hugging idea I mean this is US Chamber of Commerce this is the American Chemical Council there's all these American businesses and EPA's rather than being a good partner in helping X but I just make it happen if anything else I think your honor the agency's an impediment and the other thing that I would say I'll never forget my colleagues let me say this before I begged their indulgence I'll never forget when Lamar Alexander night senator Alexander and I were working on a four p legislation to deal with you may recall this to deal with sulfur dioxide nitrous oxide carbon and mercury and the issue that Luka were kind of hung up on was mercury and the idea could we've actually reduced our emissions by as much as 80 percent Lamar Alexander said no no we can reduce it by 90 percent we had a hearing right here and a guy said right at the end of the table everybody was it from a utility at this table and said oh we can't even get to 80 percent much less 90 percent the guy was from the representing the association that said no matter who can do better they can do 90 percent he said you know they could do better than that and you know what they did they reach 90 percent reduction and if you look at the the mats will the reason why the utilities are essentially sanguine about this is they made the investments it costs a third as much money to make the investments it's actually working and not only do we do I think a beneficial thing for for children infants for those of the having been born but we actually do a lot of us not collateral damage but collateral good things and we do some other particular matter and all kinds of stuff to save lives and it's somehow say that that just doesn't add up enough and in terms of cost-benefit analysis to first just to say all right they got it right they actually got something right in the Obama administration and that's on mats and you know all these other folks all this plate other stakeholders are for it when maybe we should be as well and what we're afraid of is you're gonna do something your agent is gonna do something that gives some of us not that not a PA but somebody else the ability to come in and have standing in court in undo mats under the mercury and air toxic substantive that is what we're afraid of and so those are three instances well I think we can have I think a lot of us think we can cleaner cleaner air cleaner water better public health more jobs and why we don't take that ball and run it right down and fill I don't know I don't know and that's what frustrates me and I sure it's what frustrates me others in on this paneling and frankly a lot of people in this audience in mind might be watching

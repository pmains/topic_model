hi 9 11 of 2001. i woke up around 5 15. i was in tucson arizona you know ate breakfast shower shaved i had a cup of coffee turned on the tv i see one of the towers on fire and smoking we were wondering what could that be about and as i watched the second tower exploded and we were yelling at my wife angie's saying hey we're under attack likely terrorism attack and i got my pickup truck drove to the base which is about five miles away when i went through the gate the whole base uh right away shut down for any incoming traffic and the base went quickly in a war wartime type footing i served for it with a three-star general think i was his aide lieutenant general tom hobbins a great mentor and a great commander he commanded all the combat air force base bases west of the mississippi i got to watch him as he put aircraft on alert to prepare for the worst case scenario because we didn't know how bad it was going to be then i got to watch him work with those units to deploy many of them out to the middle east preparing for operation enduring freedom in afghanistan the things i remember is we weren't really prepared for the counterinsurgency counter-terror fight that we were going to have and that we're still under today and now we're out we're having to reorient our military once again towards china and russia and prepare for near competitor type fights but what i remember the most is that almost 3 000 americans and innocent people were killed that day with those terrorism attacks i also remember the fact that we have deployed to iraq and afghanistan ever since and we've lost many wonderful young men and women defending our country so today i remember the victims on 9 11 but i also remember all those who served in the combat zone and their families and those who didn't make it home alive thank you

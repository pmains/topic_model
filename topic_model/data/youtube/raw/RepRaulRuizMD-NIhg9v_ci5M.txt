thank you for holding this hearing today i wish it wasn't necessary it is hard to believe that we are here to talk about a right that my mother's generation had but my daughter's generation will not ultimately this is about the power for a woman to have control over her own decisions about her own body this is not a decision to be made by a bunch of politicians the chaos that this is causing for patients and doctors is widespread and it has ripple effects that go well beyond abortion access the ramifications for patient care and the trust relationship between a patient and her doctor are not limited to abortion care alone putting providers and patients at risk the relationship between a patient and doctor is a sacred one and this decision erodes that relationship in ways that i am sure we don't even fully understand yet this chaos and criminalization of patients and doctors is very concerning for me as a doctor and terrifying for patients since they are ultimately the ones who will suffer most from this chaos of course there is the criminal aspect of this providers in impossible situations where they must determine whether to do what they know is right for the patient based on the patient's wishes or what is legal but the effects go far beyond the criminality of providers following the taking away of the constitutional right to abortion some providers will be put in a position where their legal requirements conflict with their moral ethical and medical responsibilities to their patients dr resnick medical providers like you and me abide by ethical codes to put our patients well-being above all else now politicians in some states are forcing providers to abandon this code in service of an anti-abortion anti-science anti-woman agenda how do state abortion bans interfere with a provider's ethical obligation dr congressman uh thank you for that for that question um that is one of the worst among many bad consequences that we're in that is one that really troubles our profession really putting doctors in a position where they are forced to violate their medical ethics in order to follow a law that doesn't make sense and that doesn't have the flexibility or recognize health care as being health care is untenable we're going to see physicians moving across states in some cases again as you said the consequences we've only begun to see can a woman truly trust their physician under these legal implications well we will continue to build trust with our patients by being honest with them about their options about what's going on with their health about informed consent but at the end of that conversation there may be difficult parts of the conversation that involve telling them we're in a place where we can't provide the care that we're recommending so numerous media reports have shown that dobb's decision is affecting providers across several specialties including those working in fields outside of reproductive care such as in hematology rheumatology and dermatology what kind of ripple effects is the dob's decision having on patient care across the medical field beyond ob gyn it's a good question as you said many specialties there are so many diseases that are treated with drugs that affect pregnancy and we use those drugs responsibly and have again informed conversations with patients about using them if you have rheumatoid arthritis for example this drug that we were talking about a little while ago methotrexate is sometimes used to treat that disease and now all of a sudden you have pharmacies refusing to fill prescriptions for methotrexate so whether it's dermatology rheumatology so for patients who happen to be watching today who think well this doesn't affect me because i might be somebody who doesn't think i would choose to have an abortion in addition to the fact that nobody knows if they're gonna end up being somebody with a miscarriage or an ectopic um also nobody knows who's gonna end up having rheumatoid arthritis or crohn's disease or several other things that are treated with these medications where access is being affected now yeah dr guerrero the clients you speak to every day are seeking pregnancy option counseling and referral to care moving forward do you think this political control will affect your ability to link women to clinicians who will be able to provide the health care they need yes it will and it will also disproportionately affect communities that are most marginalized 77 77 percent of our clients already experience some kind of burden related to abortion restrictions and out of that 77 59 of those people are people of color so the the odds of getting things getting better for communities that are the most marginalized are pretty slim thank you in my remaining few seconds abortion care is part of reproductive care it is healthcare thank you you

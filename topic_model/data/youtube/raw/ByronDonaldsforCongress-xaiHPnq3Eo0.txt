and cox mcdonald's is here as my guest welcome thanks for doing this it's good to be with you thanks for having me on uh absolutely let's start with this national debate over gun violence a very serious issue we saw those moving hearings we showed some of that at the top of the show tonight when you look at something that doesn't necessarily take guns out of circulation but might help make sure the wrong dangerous people don't get them like background checks we looked you voted against background checks last year um why not have some sort of check on who can get guns if that might save lives well a couple things number one i think the misconception is we already have a very large and wide background check system in the united states if you look at the people that acquired these guns before these tragedies they actually went through the fbi background check system and so that's one of the things that we have to make sure that's clear the the the agenda from the democrats the policy position from them is to go to this quote unquote universal background check system which actually has private people individually if i'm selling to you or you're selling to your sister or whoever that they have to go through a federal background check system in an intra-state transaction that's the only addition and so the reality is it's an interesting transaction there's no real real ability for an individual to go and go to go to the fbi to get that background check done so are we going to criminalize citizens who pass a gun from one citizen to another that typically is a transaction that does not take place and if you look at these these mass shootings that have occurred the the perpetrators typically go get their firearms either through a federal federally firearms dealer and pass the background check or like in the case of sandy hook that that shooter killed his mother and took her guns well when you walk through it that way congressman isn't that what proponents are saying that if it is this easy to get a gun under the current system that's why you have to strengthen it i mean if people are getting murder weapons from as you say interstate why wouldn't you want to help make sure the wrong people criminals etc don't get them well see that's that's that's the key thing there if you look at the data that's actually not how these perpetrators are getting their guns uh straw purchases are actually banned under federal law that is illegal you're not allowed to go buy a firearm and pass it to another individual that's illegal again if you look at the mass shooting events that have occurred especially the ones in our schools the perpetrators went through the federal the federal firearms background check system now if you want to talk about things like red flag laws new york state has a red flag law but the shooter in new york that pain is that heinous person uh that person there were actually flags that were there but nobody ever reported on that person these things are trafficking but we have to look at the facts let me jump in i appreciate and we're talking policy and there's more than one way to look at it so i appreciate us getting into it because that's an important issue but we can put on the screen i mean the flag laws uh when you were in florida you voted against the red flag law you're mentioning red flag laws don't stop all shootings i'll say to you congressman fact check true um that there there has not been policies that we've seen that stop everything um but 20 states that do require the expanded background checks i'll put this on the screen you said let's deal in facts um have these background checks they've been ruled constitutional they've been ruled to be effective and so i guess the question becomes and then i want to move on to one of the topic well i have you but given that it can work sometimes let's stipulate that you said sometimes it doesn't work true but if it can work sometimes why not try it i mean help us balance that against these kids who are getting murdered if it does work sometimes well here's the difference if you're talking about a state that has decided to do expanded checks that's an intra-state transaction that is directly within the confines of state powers and state law but the federal government does not have the ability to regulate intra-state transactions that's okay but you voted that's actually hold on but that's a power that i feel you state that the way you voted against it at the state we'll put it back on the screen i think we have it you voted against it at the state level how about actually in flor in florida there was not a provision in the school safety law with respect to intra-state background checks what it was about was red flag laws risk protection orders and raising the age from 18 to 21 there are serious fifth amendment constitutional issues with red flag laws because essentially you will be giving your your property can be taken from you by a court of law without you being able to defend yourself in said court of law those are the constitutional issues that exist with red flag laws and i understand that concern i mean justice scalia who went farther than anyone on the federal level of backing an individual right to bear arms he said those rights even in doing so um are not without limitation not a right to keep and carry a weapon whatsoever in any manner for whatever purpose um so i just want to get that in there on the law but i appreciate the back and forth turning to these hearings tomorrow night which as you know are big deal there was this insurrection this violent attack on the capitol by trump fans i want to play just a little bit of what we saw that day as we go into these hearings here's what it looked like [Applause] was it wrong uh for those trump fans to do all that was it an insurrection and knowing what we know now if the purpose is to go forward um should trump and those other people who sent them down at the capitol have acted differently well first things first i was on the floor that day uh it was a tragedy for the nation nobody is allowed to breach a federal building and i mean nobody doesn't matter what side of politics you you're on and i've been crystal clear on that uh from day one from that very day number two and more importantly is this one of the things that this january 6 committee uh whether they are founded out or they've leaked it to the media i don't know what we found out in the oversight committee was that donald trump authorized 10 000 national guard troops to be at the capitol on january 6th he authorized those troops on january 4th the real question is what did nancy pelosi know about these troops and what did muriel bowser the mayor of dc do with the national guard troops that were in dc on the sixth i can tell you right now they weren't at the capitol that's still a question that house republicans have with respect to the january 6 investigation was it an insurrection was it an insurrection no because look the reality is people came into the capitol they tried to stop an official proceeding we continued our business four hours later that day and then this peaceful transition of power continued i think if you're going to go towards the level of of insurrection or sedition that's actually a finding the department of justice needs to have through a thorough investigation what i see coming from the january 6 committee just seems to be more politics more leaking because to be frank the democrat agenda has failed americans all across the country and they know it well the sedition part as you say that is federal law we could put that up the leaders that donald trump name checked including the proud boys are currently awaiting trial they're legally presumed innocent um but that's the conspiracy to overthrow the government there's a sedition set of trials there and there is evidence on that as for the insurrection i mean mitch mcconnell himself declared an insurrection that night other people that i know are leaders in your party have done so and so before i lose you because we it feels like this is moved and i appreciate you coming on the show to talk about it feels like the party has sort of changed its position here's what we were hearing around the sixth about how bad this was tension is too high the country is too crazy i do not want to look back and think we caused something or we missed something and someone got hurt this is hurting all of us he is destroying his legacy laura ingram wrote he's got to condemn this asap donald trump jr texted chaos anarchy the violence today was wrong and un-american we will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs mobs or threats so congressman i don't mean to make the last question uh the potentially the hardest but really when it's all out in the open like that who do you agree with you agree with mcconnell and rand paul and some of those fox people and the president's son what they said then or do you agree with them now um because you said let's deal in facts they've obviously completely reversed themselves listen with the audio you just played everybody condemned the violence on that day when it happened and we still condemn it today like i said you are not allowed to breach a federal building if you do you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law many people are being prosecuted there are some questions about the the detainees and their constitutional rights with respect to speedy trial but the reality is is that it was heinous for our country and it should never be tolerated the only thing i would say is that if we're going to discuss the facts surrounding january 6 let's discuss them all in place including what happened to the national guard troops that were authorized by president trump on january 4th uh and now our viewers have had the benefit of hearing your views in the back and forth so we appreciate that congressman donald's your first time on the beat i hope you'll come back oh any time it was fun

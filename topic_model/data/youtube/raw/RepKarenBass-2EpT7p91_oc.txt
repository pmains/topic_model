Fitzpatrick the gentleman from Pennsylvania several other members have supported this effort and we're inadvertently left off the sponsor list due to a clerical error to remedy that I will furnish a separate statement for the record that includes those names respectively I ask for unanimous consent to submit that statement general man's request will be covered under general leave HR 1585 will reauthorize the valla of 1994 a landmark piece of legislation first enacted and signed into law by President Clinton in 1994 this was a direct response to the epidemic violence against women that plagues our country at that time while we have made significant progress we still have much to do it is estimated that more than two million adults and more than 15 million children are exposed to domestic violence annually these alarming figures make it imperative that we reauthorize VAWA now we concluded our celebration of Women's History Month in March but our project to protect women is not complete movements like me to across this country demand Congress's attention to better deal with the gaping holes left unfilled in current law around the issues of domestic violence dating violence sexual assault harassment and stalking the VAWA efforts will have the same profound effect on a victim survivor and on their families no matter one's party affiliation hence these are human problems period this is our opportunity to respond to the basic needs of victims and survivors everywhere absent discrimination based on their race sex religion or nationality that is why this law has been reauthorized three times in 2005 and 2013 since enactment with strong bipartisan approval and overwhelming support from Congress states and local communities HR 1585 can't that should continues that tradition which reflects a reasonable and compromised approach to reauthorize grant programs under wah wah for example this bill includes various pieces of bipartisan legislation Republican amendments from our committee markup and Republican amendments through the rules process HR 1585 is intended to make modifications as Congress has done in the past to all previous reauthorizations avala for example in south los angeles part of my district the Genesee center helps hundreds of people every year violent funding has supported the growth of Genesis legal department which provides direct legal services that not only assist survivors in securing immediate safety but also help them achieve long-term goals of stability and self-sufficiency VAWA funding is integral to Genesis traditional or bridge housing program for survivors after overcoming the initial crisis phase people need space and time to rebuild family bonds secure education and vocational training and receive the mental health counseling needed to heal from trauma HR 1585 is inclusive sensible and responsive this bill is about preventing responding to domestic violence gentleman's time has expired I yield the gentlelady an additional 30 seconds without preventing and responding to domestic violence sexual assault dating violence and stalking that is why I urge my colleagues to exert courage and stand with victims by supporting this bill thank you Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

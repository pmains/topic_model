well Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of HR 1005 a bill which would provide no-cost medical model adult day healthcare at state veterans homes to veterans who are 70% of more service-connected disabled this bill is an extension to the Veterans Benefits health care and information technology Act of 2006 which currently provides no-cost nursing home care at any State Veterans Home to veterans who are 70% or more service-connected disabled medical model adult day healthcare provides comprehensive medical nursing and personal care services combined with engaging social activities for physically or cognitively impaired adults medical model Delta healthcare offers a complete array of rehabilitative therapies including physical occupational and speech therapy hospice and palliative care Social Work spiritual nutritional counseling and therapeutic recreation the program is designed to promote socialization stimulation and maximize the participants independence while enhancing their quality of life the program is staffed by a team of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals who evaluate each participant customized an individualized plan of care specific to their health and social needs adult day healthcare is an alternative care setting that can allow some veterans who require long-term care services to remain in their homes rather than be institutionalized in nursing home such veterans typically require support for some but not all activities of daily living ADL such as bathing dressing or feeding in many cases a spouse or other family member may provide the veteran with much of their care but they require additional support for some of the veteran ADL's by filling these gaps adult day healthcare can allow these veterans to remain in their homes and communities for additional months or even years and thereby lower the financial cost of caring for these heroes adult day healthcare also provides family caregivers support and relief adult day healthcare programs can help caregivers to meet their other professional and family obligations or provide a well-deserved rest bite while their loved ones are participating in the program I like to thank chairman Roe ranking member walls for their leadership and supporting this issue I also like to thank the House Veterans Affairs Committee the great staff for recognizing need for this critical legislation mr. speaker this is a piece of legislation I would encourage all of our colleagues to support and I yield back the balance of my time

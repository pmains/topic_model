and I want to thank you for the way you've conducted the hearing this has been the best markup I've ever participated in and I've done three so I hope this is the last one I participate in to you have really handled this tough issue will your passion is known but I want to just let you know there's a lot of passion out there and but people who disagree with your marriage and will have this debate and I'm not going to accept for one moment that if you believe traditional marriage is the way America ought to be that you're somehow some inferior person we will have this debate the catholic church van Jellicle christians people who believe deeply in traditional marriage will have their say but it should be done outside this bill because to get immigration reform done you've got to get people who disagree on marriage to agree on immigration and there are people in the house believe it or not that wanted to stand up for the unborn in their immigration bill there were people in the house who believe that there's nothing more precious in life and life begins at conception and that we as a nation shouldn't sit on the sideline and watch millions of babies aborted each year including millions of babies to people for in the illegal immigration system and they wanted to take a federal definition of abortion that I don't think would have helped the cause in the Senate at all and what would you be saying if the house had put language in a bill that they're deeply committed to about preserving the life of the unborn I told them when it got to the Senate you're destroying the best chance i've ever seen for immigration reform and i'm glad they did not interject abortion in this debate and i know many of you are passionately pro-life but when it comes time to debate what America should be like and what kind of systems we should have and who should create them you will have people who disagree with you on marriage and will hold their head up high and not shrink one bit but having said that your decision today mr. Chairman I think represents the best opportunity I have seen to get this bill passed because there are people on our side passionate about a lot of things that we've talked out of so you sit an exam Apple for the rest of us to follow and when the marriage debate comes up you'll be a leader and i'll be out there telling the other side of the story

today's oversight and investigation subcommittee hearing will examine the department of veterans affairs medical supply chain today is our first oversight and investigation subcommittee hearing of the 117th session so i'd like to welcome all the members who have joined remotely many of whom are new to this subcommittee during the coming months we will examine many important issues at the department of veterans affairs i think it's fair to say that ranking member man and i share the goal of a strong nonpartisan oversight our veterans deserve nothing less than that today's hearing comes nearly six months following the subcommittee's last hearing on the same subject i hope to hear how va has evolved its pandemic response and move forward on key modernization efforts va's medical supply chain buys and distributes billions of dollars of vital life-saving medical supplies needed for veteran medical care in the nation's largest integrated health care system unfortunately va's supply chain has long faced many serious problems the gao added va to its high risk list for acquisition in 2019 largely due to medical supply chain problems during september's hearing we heard testimony that the weaknesses in va's purchasing and inventory management systems were magnified by the pandemic gao testified then that va's old systems could not provide daily supply inventory data so va had to create an ad hoc reporting process to understand how many supplies such as masks and gloves it had on hand fast forward six months to today here we are 12 months into this pandemic and va is still largely using this manual spreadsheet based system it is important to acknowledge that the va hospital staff and employees who have worked tirelessly over the last year to serve our veterans and procure needed supplies they've done a terrific job while heroic efforts have allowed va to build its overall inventory of critical supplies in the last few months i remain concerned about the uneven unevenness of supply inventories and the continued rationing at va medical centers so for example the va inspector general issued three reports in the last three months that found examples of va medical facilities around the country that either ran out of personal protective equipment or were running low and had to ration these supplies further a march 2021 report found that up to 40 percent of staff at va medical centers reported not having access to appropriate personal protective equipment necessary to ensure their own safety at work unquote i've personally witnessed pandemic supply challenges in my new hampshire district a state veterans home ran out of bleach cleaning wipes and reported trouble finding masks for its employees our manchester va medical center has continuously run low on nitrile gloves and n95 masks my office even donated dozens of boxes to our local va to help ease the supply shortage but clearly more needs to be done here to deal with this at a macro level so while we've made progress since the beginning of the pandemic we still have a ways to go to properly protect va employees and veterans we're going to also examine va's progress in implementing solutions for example va has set up eight interim warehouses to store and distribute stockpiles of masks gloves and other critical supplies to va hospitals va originally told us that they planned to turn some of those supply warehouses into permanent readiness centers to hold six-month stockpiles of critical items by july of 2021 now this has been delayed until 2023. i recently introduced a bill to allow va to participate in the pentagon's war stopper program which is an additional solution for acquiring critically needed supplies i look forward to discussing how war stopper can improve supply chain resilience and be complementary to other efforts that are ongoing at va as i stressed six months ago the department needs modern and effective acquisition and inventory systems to provide a permanent solution to supply chain challenges va has previously planned to roll out a new medical surgical prime vendor program called mspv 2.0 in january of 2021. however va has since delayed this program another nine months this follows a long series of prior delays for modernizing va's procurement systems going back many years at the same time va is trying to accelerate its seven-year rollout of dod's integrated supply inventory tool called demos by two years va now plans to complete the transition to demos by 2025 but va has installed the system at only one facility and plans to add just three facilities in fiscal year 2021 that looks to be quite a time crunch in the coming years so i look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses during today's proceedings and doing our part to give veterans and va employees a medical supply chain that is reliable effective and efficient i think we can all agree on that with that i'd like to turn things over to ranking member man for five minutes for any opening remarks that he may wish to make i certainly welcome him to the subcommittee really look forward to the work ahead and i know we're going to be working hand in hand to make sure that our end veterans get the best possible care and services that they deserve so ranking member man i'll turn it over to you

yeah thank you madam chair my first question for both of you for for many many people part of their american dream is to own their own business and a franchise is one model that's enabled that and i think the the franchise model is just another example of american exceptionalism and i want to just ask you both about the joint employer standards and how you would define it and and i would assume based upon your records you would probably more loosely define the what what a joint employer standard looks like and what would that impact be on the franchises and i'll start with ms nanda first thank you senator for that question um so i'll start by saying that small businesses are so much the engine of our economy um people don't often realize that it's something in the nature of 50 of all workers work for small businesses so they're also important job creators with regards to joint employment and the standard this is an issue that is presently subject to litigation at the labor department there was a standard there was a rule an interpretive rule issued by the prior administration that had an adverse decision my understanding is that litigation is presently pending in the circuit court so it is under active consideration at the department i'm not presently in the building and i haven't been privy to discussions and deep legal analysis and the benefit of uh conversations with uh the secretary and career attorneys oh okay so you don't know much about it or don't have an opinion on it mr bruzo how do you think that a more loosely defined joint employer standard uh is beneficial and how would it impact the frame thank you for the question senator i um uh well under the nlra and uh uh there's a language uh statutory language uh defining uh who an employer is uh the current nlrb has also implemented a rule uh recently uh regarding a joint employer that defines uh the joint employer as a an entity with a substantial direct and immediate control over essential terms and conditions of employment uh and so if i'm fortunate enough to be confirmed i would ensure that the board agents are applying the statutory language and the board's rule and extend board law regarding the joint employer relationship yeah i guess my question is if it's more loosely applied how would it impact the the franchise industry so i uh thank you senator i i really can't speak in hypotheticals we can't give advisory opinions i would have to review a case that comes before me after a fact intensive investigation and apply the appropriate language the rule the extent board law to the facts of the case okay thank you my next question for miss nand i want to talk a little bit about emergency temporary standard according to osha's authorization there's two requirements that must be met for osha to promulgate an emergency temporary standard first that workers are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substance or agents toxic or physically harmful and second that an emergency temporary standard is necessary to protect workers from that danger i i think that we all can agree that we've got covet on the run thanks to to the the trump vaccine that's out there now that that we should be approaching herd immunity uh that the incidence is going down that every american by now uh adult has had the chance to have the the vaccine so do you still think that there's a grave danger and that we should be applying this emergency temporary standard or not thank you for your question senator my understanding is that the department just senten proposed emergency temporary standard rule to omb it's what's called rocust it is not publicly available i'm not at the department and i haven't seen what is in that standard certainly we have some half a million americans who've lost their lives and we want to ensure that they're protected including being protected at the workplace i certainly hope you're right that we're through the worst of this but it's difficult for me to comment on the standard because i haven't seen it and i'm not at the department yet so the the vaccine is 90 95 effective preventing you getting the virus probably 100 preventing you from being hospitalized or from dying from it so i don't see that there's any type of grave danger wouldn't you agree i i would say that thinking about what is happening in the world right now with variants and having a child who is still not vaccinated um i again certainly hope that you are right that that we are through the worst of this but it's difficult for me to comment on the propriety of an emergency temporary standard not having seen it

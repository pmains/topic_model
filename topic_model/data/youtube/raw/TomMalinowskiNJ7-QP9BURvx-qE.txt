international press they were even dubbed the faces of marriage equality marcia and louise were also one of the lead plaintiffs in the new jersey supreme court case which ultimately granted marriage equality on october 21st 2013 and a few moments after midnight they were the first same-sex couple in new jersey to marry the wedding was held at the home of senator ray lesniak and his since deceased

from historically marginalized and underserved communities she joined us tonight from central jersey and finally we have congressman tom malinowski who has spent most of his adult life fighting for human rights here and abroad in fact he was the assistant secretary of state for democracy human rights and labor and in that role he helped create the role of the special envoy envoy for the human rights of lgbt persons so welcome everyone and thank you so much for being here um to start things off i'm going to ask you alfonso how important is it that lgbtq folks make themselves hurt in this election well thank you um first is my pleasure to be here tonight to support uh the re-election uh of congressman melinowski and as we think about this election and how important it is i think at its core for lgbtq people this is about our survival this is about whether or not lgbtq people will be recognized as human beings this is about whether or not we would be afforded with the dignity that we deserve under law and for the past 12 or within the next i should say 12 days we face an opportunity where it will culminate in election day where we have the opportunity to remove the current president who has unfortunately for the past four years attacked the lgbtq community we also have an opportunity to seize back the u.s senate which has now been under the thumb of mitch mcconnell there are progressive bills that are sitting collecting dust in the senate and importantly we have to hold on to the house of representatives we have to make sure that a house of representatives remains democratic and uh without that we are not going to be able to protect the lives of lgbtq people we cannot leave anything up for chance we have to fight harder than we've ever fought before and there are forces in this country all of us know who they are their forces who are going to try to stop us they're going to try to make it harder for us to vote they're going to try to exploit the pandemic and use fear and division to try to win this election but lgbtq people know this there is an undeniable fact that we are a community that does not quit when we face obstacles we jump over them when we get knocked down we get back up when we're told that it cannot be done and there are many people who told us there will never be a day where same-sex couples will have the ability to marry there will never be a day where homosexuality quote unquote is not decriminalized but we overcame those obstacles and we have to make sure that we overcome the current obstacle which is donald trump and mike pence because they have been attacking our community non-stop and we also have to make sure that we remove anti-equality forces from the congress and from the senate and we also have to make sure that we support all of our local officials who are running for office who are pro-equality because at its core we know laws policies regulations yes they're made at the federal level but in some cases they're also made at the state level so we're hoping people vote up and down the ballot pro equality because our lives really do depend on it this election absolutely so states like new jersey already have laws that protect lgbtq folks from discrimination so congressman why are you waiting why are you fighting for the passage of federal bills like the equality act what's going on i think we can all see what's going on um beginning with just to point to the elephant in the room no partisan pun intended the impending elevation of uh judge coney barrett to the supreme court which will change the balance on the court that we have depended on maybe over relied on to protect our rights there will without a doubt be a majority on the supreme court with with justice ginsburg gone and and barrett elevated uh to overturn the the obergfeld decision uh that doesn't mean it's gonna happen um there may be uh there may be a moment of of caution and wisdom that uh that prevents that uh from happening uh but i think we have to assume that that is a very very strong possibility and what that means in practice is not that we are going to lose marriage equality or any of the other rights that have been uh fought for and uh and gained at great uh expense over over many years what it does mean is that we're going to be more reliant on the congress to make sure that we protect the ground we've won and continue to make progress so um you know one of the things that i was proudest of that we did in the house of representatives in my first term was to pass the equality act and uh of course we only passed it in the house because it got blocked in the senate so it just means all the more reason now to elect re-elect a house that will re-enact uh or re-pass that piece of legislation along with the senate that will actually help us uh enacted into uh into law um you know in in a way as much as i hate uh seeing what's happening to the supreme court i do think it's good discipline for us not to be over reliant on the courts and to put more of our energy more of our resources into electing lawmakers at the state level and at the federal level who will be committed to moving this agenda forward and i think we're on the verge of doing that if we spend the next 11 days doing the work that we know is necessary absolutely marcia that's actually a perfect segue for you i spoke with louise when we were planning this a little bit and i know you both have some stories about the fight and actually has some stories about the congressman's opponent do you want to share some with us now that you mentioned it yes i'll start out by saying that senator tom keane is not a worthy opponent for you senator malinowski when did marriage equality bill uh was in front of the senate for a vote what did senator mal um what else excuse me senator kane do he voted against it that was in 2010 it came back for a vote in 2012 and it actually passed in the legislature without tom king's vote again however it it went to uh then governor christie who vetoed it once again tom keane voted against the override of chris christie's veto um and he actually in he was one out of nine to vote against domestic partnership in 2004 and that only gave lgbtq persons who work for the state a couple of rights this was not a big bill what it did was it it offered lgbtq persons to visit each other in the hospital a human right i think so um and it also allowed for state employees uh who uh whose partner died to receive their pension he could not even vote for that um and and all of a sudden he claims before an election that he has evolved um that's quite coincidental i'm not sure i'm buying that and i know my wife isn't buying that um you know i'm going to talk about senator malinowski now um he was one of the co-sponsors of the global act of 1964 i'm sure you remember that um which included the i'm sorry um it covered the rights for the first time uh of lgbtq persons um and and tom malinowski was for that way back in 1964. so it's it's really good to take note of that marcia yeah he's going to stop you for a moment because you're being uh amazingly kind but i wasn't even born in 1964. when you were very he was a co-sponsor so 1964 this is this is so important that was the civil rights act right remember the the great the civil rights act and what we've done what i voted for is and you're absolutely right to go back to 1964 because that was the year in which we passed this amazingly important civil rights legislation that that that banned discrimination based on race based on the color of people's skin and what we're doing now what we voted on in the house is to make sure that that that sexual identity and orientation is added to the list of categories that are protected 100 by the civil rights act of 1964. but i promise you had i been alive in 1964 i would have been for it then oh i i hear you i guess i'm dating myself um you were you were part of the the re-establishment of the special envoy in the state department yeah uh that's that's what it was dedicated to the lgbtq community and then you know their issues interestingly enough uh trump has not filled that position so um our country needs to keep you uh as as a congressman especially in light of what you already mentioned the senate trying to accelerate the appointment of judge coney barrett to the supreme court so we need you you're here thank you so so much marcia thank you and victoria i want to bring you into the conversation i know that you've been an outspoken leader on trans rights especially access to health care um can you explain what gender affirming healthcare means and why it's important yeah so gender affirming health care is um healthcare that includes hormone replacement surgery and surgeries that affirm one's gender identity and these surgeries are very important to allow transgender people to live authentic lives and are life-saving and essential surgeries and in the state of new jersey um some of these surgeries are covered by insurance but you have to fight for it and these barriers to access are real and significant um the wait lists that exist for transgender healthcare including hormone replacement therapy are months long and so even though it is in some cases affordable um it is still inaccessible because of a lack of providers thank you thanks so um i'll throw this out to all of you so if amy coney or elena tony barrett's confirmed what's at stake for the lgbtq community congressman congressman do you want to go first well um i i certainly can although i i imagine many of you guys can um can bring this to life better than i can sure but i know that you know that that look i'll i'll tell you this when i was at the state department and under the obama administration when we first decided affirmatively definitively that promoting the human rights of lgbtq people would be a goal of american foreign policy and and we started doing this all over the world in countries where people were not allowed to live their authentic selves as victorian to use the phrase that victorian just just suggested and and suffered punishment and discrimination and violence just because of who they were the the assumption that we made when we started on that path was that the united states was firmly on that path we had not achieved full equality full respect for human rights in the united states but the trajectory was was clear and almost inevitable um and that we had a solid foundation therefore we were setting a good enough example at home that we could go out to the rest of the world and say we all need to do better and i don't have that absolute certainty anymore that i did say five or six years ago because we could very well see a setback in in in the supreme court and we don't know the outcome of this election yet right so we don't yet know whether we will elect a congress that that can make up for that and so you know the way i see it it's not just an individual right that may be eroded say marriage equality it's the the confidence that comes with knowing that the country is steadily making progress um so you know it's not just the legal progress but the psychological progress that that comes with it and and what i desperately want to avoid is not just a legal setback but a a blow to our spirits um which is certainly what i think all of us would feel if um if that decision or any of the other uh you know elements of legal progress we've made are reversed that's from my perspective what's at stake but but but i think many of you can provide a a more a more personal perspective than i can sure i'll i'll try to provide some some context in terms of policy and also the practical implications so for context amy coney barrett as some people may know was voted out of committee today and that means that she is scheduled to be confirmed absent uh some you know god uh driven act uh to be confirmed on monday um that's disturbing for a number of reasons first amy coney barrett has refused to say that the landmark court decision lawrence versus texas was correctly decided lawrence versus texas effectively decriminalized same-sex intimate conduct prior to lawrence versus texas states were passing laws that criminalize same-sex intimate conduct so that's a landmark case that goes to whether or not lgbtq people are considered free in this country and amy coney barrett refused to state that that decision was correctly decided in addition she's publicly said that the landmark case or burgerfeld versus hodges which brought marriage equality uh to everyone in this country she refused to say that that was correctly decided she went a step further and she had previously said that she agreed with the dissenters in that case so she does not believe that there is a fundamental right to marry and that fundamental right includes same-sex couples which is a huge problem she's also accepted um a speaking role and she's been paid by an organization called alliance defending freedom some of you may have heard of that organization that's the organization that we have fought for years they fought against marriage equality laws but they have also taken a public position that they support the criminalization of gay people in their words homosexuality should be criminalized around the world and in addition to that they called for the for sterilization of transgender people and she spoke at their conferences and was paid by them and shares their views so we have some deep concerns about the collateral implications of having someone who affiliates with organizations like alliance defending freedom sitting on the high court and refusing to say that those seminal cases were correctly decided and this is not only marriage and whether or not we can be free as lgbtq people it also affects employment we just had a recent court decision that says you can't discriminate against lgbtq people in employment that could be affected in some way foster care could be affected housing related services could be affected so what the congressman said is exactly right we have to focus our energies on making sure we elect pro-equality candidates into office like congressman malinowski because if we do they will be able to take affirmative steps whether it be passing legislation and mending legislation to ensure that our rights are protected i can just add on to what alfonso has talked about um so uh our political opponents on on this they they they understand that they've lost the public opinion battle on gay marriage and that over the past 30 years the percentage of americans that approve of gay marriage has continually gone up the public opinion on transgender issues is not quite at the same level as gay marriage um overturning um oberfeld would severely delegitimize the eye the court in the eyes of the american people but if they can continue to chip chip away at cases around housing and employment and try to use transgender rights as a wedge issue that is a real concern of mine um so there there's uh this issue where the uh lgbt community as a whole needs to be unified and defend the rights of the most marginalized in our communities um even though some of those positions aren't quite as popular or well accepted in our country as as gay marriage right now um i i would say victorian actually i i think you're right that some of those positions are not quite as well accepted but my sense at least from my vantage point which is not necessarily the same as yours but i think we've we've also made very considerable progress politically in mainstream america in in terms of um the the the legitimacy uh accepting the legitimacy and basic humanity of of transgender people and and for me this is symbolized by um but by what's happened in the military uh which is not necessarily the first institution you would think of that would uh lead uh in in in this area and you know i remember vividly because it was not long ago when there was tremendous resistance within the military including from um the leadership uh senior most generals in the military too uh to any rule that would allow uh uh openly lgbt people uh from serving and you know we had the whole don't ask don't tell fiasco which lasted for more than 20 years we've made enough progress there that when president trump tried to ban transgender people from serving in the military there was almost unanimous resistance to that from our uniformed military leadership and the the secretary secretary of defense jim mattis you know who's this tough old marine um in in just a matter of a few years we gotten to the point where people were like wait somebody wants to risk their life to defend our country and you're telling them they can't what the hell are you talking about and so europe said we're not quite at the same level with some of these issues but but even there i think the you know the the majority of the american people are are with us and with it and that's why we've made this this progress and and why it would be just such a stunning tragic setback if if a group of people who really represent a minority view a dwindling minority view we're able to prevail um and that gives me hope that you know we are actually going to elect good people and we're going to continue to do that uh so long as we also fix our democracy so that the majority can actually rule in this country uh that's the larger problem we're having on many issues so i'm going to open it up to i've got a lot of folks writing in questions so it's okay with everybody i'm going to um and lori woog has a question oh am i am i supposed to ask it lisa or do you want no no you can ask go ask away okay hi everybody hi again tom and thank you so much all of you for participating in this panel and putting it together um i my question you've sort of answered the question was i'm familiar with the work of evan wolfson of course pioneering work on marriage equality and the panelists work in this area and it's so important i was wondering how congress would aim to protect lgbtq rights in light of the imminent supreme court decision in fulton and the possible revisiting of obergefell and i i think you have tried to address that um in terms of the need obviously to keep the house and flip the senate and have people who will enact legislation that would continue to amend the civil rights act etc so now if lisa if it would be okay i want to amend my question a little bit you may i will allow a counselor thank you um not my area of expertise but i'll i'll ask the question i i guess i'm really scared for everyone that i many people that i know and people i care about and for the country that a revisiting of a burga fell would and hope i'm pronouncing it correctly could impair the right to marriage or the existence of marriages that are same-sex marriages that are already in place is there a world in which that could actually happen or what do you see as the potential result of a revisiting of that case yeah so i'll i'll start by saying i think the answer is no in any state that has established marriage equality as a matter of state law or interpretation of our state constitution as in new jersey but potentially elsewhere you know in jurisdictions that where the right is solely derived from the supreme court's decision then i think the answer would likely be yes alfonzo would you agree i would agree so we we have to sort of take a step back and what the congressman saying is exactly right if you live in a state and your right to marry is based in staff i mean it's been passed by the legislature what the federal government does or does not do as it relates to federal protections is irrelevant to your marriage being recognized in new jersey or new york similar if your marriage is been recognized as a result of a court decision in your home state based on your state's constitution your marriages will not be invalidated in your state however the bergafeld case effectively said there is a fundamental right to marry under the federal constitution right and that federal right extends to everyone so you can imagine in places where there is no court decision there is no state law in fact there were laws that effectively limited marriage to different sex couples in those states i don't see that we will get to the point where marriages are no longer recognized under federal law although that arguably could happen i think what's more likely is that there will be limitations to marriage so that um if you are running a bodega and uh you are of a certain religious faith and you want to deny services to a same-sex couple uh the argument should would be that you should be able to or if you're looking to rent a hall and you are a same-sex couple and you want to have your ceremony at that hall you may be denied or if you walk into a religious affiliated hospital and your spouse is sick would you could they could you be denied access to your spouse um under all of those circumstances it is possible that someone would make the argument that if there is no state law protections and there is no federal protection that those same-sex couples would face discrimination and and the way it generally works is the federal law is the floor and the states can provide greater protections uh and if those protections are based on the state's constitution then you don't run into a problem remember years ago we had this patchwork where people could get married in new york but not get married in certain places you get married in new jersey but not in other places and that is the risk that we run with amy coney barrett uh philosophy being advanced through the supreme court got it thank you so much david i'm sorry alfonso um do you think i mean again sort of building off of that question would passage of the equality act be enough uh given the likely reasoning of a court striking down marriage equality would it be enough for us to say to the court well look it's now part of the civil rights act and therefore that that should apply to the right to get married as well as the right to accommodations employment non-discrimination and everything else yes and no the equality act provides significant support i think for the lgbtq community it is the most important legislative priority that we have it would provide comprehensive protections to lgbtq people in employment housing public accommodation credit education jury service and in some cases as you know that doesn't exist there is no federal law that prohibits discrimination in retail stores right or if you were to get into a lyft or into an uber you could face discrimination as an lgbtq person and there is no federal law that protects you the equality act would change that the equality act would say you can't discriminate against lgbtq people in all of these ways right so yes it would provide support if the court wanted to expand the religious exemptions uh it would have to they would either have to look at how that would interface with the equality act or they would attempt to water down the equality act as it relates to how it interfaces with the first amendment of the constitution but since it doesn't mention marriage explicitly i presume you would say that we would need to pass basically a marriage equality statute well we can't it's that's a challenging question to answer because family law has always been within the confines of the states uh who you marry whether you divorce what the rules are that are associated with parenting and distribution of you know uh financial assets all of those decisions are really determined under state law so one of the questions that i think we are all grappling with is if we're confronted with that what is the federal fix um which would allow the federal government for the second time to sort of engage in a discussion on domestic relations that was the as you know the defense of marriage act many people were very upset because the federal government was for the first time getting involved and defining our legal relationships so that is um that's a challenge that we're going to have to manage good i assume you will be in touch i will be it sounds like there's quite a lot of tension between what you just described alfonso and um so sort of the need for a federal fix and yet that the tension of marriage typically being defined family law being defined by the states and yet kind of that difficult underpinning of relying on the ninth amendment and fundamental rights which we're seeing is getting us into trouble yes indeed thank you but but again i think these are very very good questions but without the congressman in the house of representatives we don't have any protection and and as we think about the next steps of what we're going to do as a community we need to make sure that we have representatives in office who will protect our interests because if we don't then we will have the judiciary interpreting the constitution not to include us and we will also have a legislature that won't be in a position to actually provide those protections thank you for that um thanks laurie our next question is from lucy let's see hi it sounds like a bit of a silly question now because it's not super serious but i just wanted to know like who were everyone's like favorite historical lgbt icons oh that's a fantastic question um so for me uh it's not really that super historical um because it's only a couple years ago but when danica rome uh became the first elected transgender person in a united states legislature it was really like it really basically told me that i could be involved in politics and also live my authentic self um i know like pete buddha judge said something similar um when he was talking about this how he felt like he could finally be a proud gay man and also be in politics um so like danica rome really was someone who showed me that there is a path for me and that i can be included in in this area um and like now we have sarah mcbride uh who is going to be a state senator in delaware um next year and um so yeah danica rome and all these other great transgender uh leaders so i think justin i think you told me that's the one of the silver linings in post 2016 is that we are there are a dozen um transgender folks that have been elected that's right that's right and it's all within the last four years so if there is a silver lining it could be that my hero would be uh james baldwin uh james baldwin is a was a writer uh grew up in harlan spent a fair amount of time abroad and principally in paris and uh was a civil rights icon and his writings are so illuminating about the human condition and about our challenges with race and sexuality and gender identity in this country and around the globe in fact and he provides pathways and uh guideposts for us to use in this current environment that we're grappling with some of unfortunately the same issues in different ways of course but we're still grappling with race we're still grappling with sexual orientation we're still grappling with gender identity and the human condition of allowing people um to be who they are and receive the dignity and respect that they deserve so that would be mine marsha do you have a hero i have several famous heroes but the one i'd like to mention is not so famous but just as fierce uh an advocate for the lgbt community um she happened to have been uh transgender name is bab sipperstein she was a very good friend and unfortunately she passed away a couple years ago but um i have such great admiration for her what she did for our community in new jersey was tremendous so that's my answer yeah see lucy not a silly question um thanks catherine you have a question for the congressman or oh no you went for alfonso i do have a question for alfonso um and this actually uh is motivated a little bit by a serendipitous event that happened today which my friends laura choi is on here and uh was in a presbyterian meeting with my mother and we have a very distinctive last name so she was like you guys related and so my question is um you know as someone who is raised in the presbyterian church it is deeply frustrating to me to see christianity used so hatefully against lgbtq people and so i'm wondering what we can do to mobilize the religious left to push back on that that's a great question um and we are actually doing uh some of that work now when i took over the human rights campaign last year one of my priorities was to create a religion and faith program and prior to covet 19 sort of travel around the country and engage with faith communities about lgbtq issues and why it's important for them to see us as a part of them we started in philadelphia we then went to a few other cities and then we were hit with covert 19. since then we've been doing a lot of this work virtually and making sure that people understand the history of religion and how it's been used to marginalize communities so when you tell someone that religion was used as a tool to legitimize colonization or a tool to justify slavery or a tool to advance miscegenation statutes or tools to suppress women they then appreciate how religion can be misused to oppress uh marginalized communities and we're getting more and more people to understand that history and appreciate that history not rejecting religion it is just having religion used in the way that it should be used which is not as a tool of oppression and we have more and more people that are now engaging in those conversations and we're collecting uh cohorts of people that will be having a much more robust conversation about that in the future i think this election is so critical for our survival but also in terms of creating a path forward because if we don't address this question of how religion is being misused it'll come back to bite us in two years when there's another election or bite us in four years when there's another another election it is really being used as a tool to attack uh marginalized groups and we have to make sure we have a cohesive approach to fight back thanks catherine so i'm going to call on laura you teed her up laura troy oops there i am thank you thank you catherine and thank you alfonso for that response um uh i am um married to a presbyterian minister i am um on the ordination track myself and um i'm on the school board and i also have a transgender daughter um that i fight for every day so you know i i my question was that if federal protections are are reversed or being shipped away for lgbtq people especially for transgender people um how do we continue to protect lgbtq students and and their rights in the schools um i i i feel blessed to be in in new jersey where where there are lots of protection for our students um but i'm you know afraid at the slowly chipping away of of the rights for for for them um even in a in in new jersey when um my my kid is graduated high school already but um it took me um well although transgender student rights are in in the students in the school's policies um it took me me nine months to advocate for a new gender-neutral bathroom for them in in in their high school so you know that's nine months you know that my kids didn't go to the bathroom at school um so you know it's it's um yeah so i'm just wondering um you know what what kind of protections there are and i would love to continue the to to um continue the conversation um between faith and justice that is where my heart is at so um yeah so thank you um bill i mean that's the question that we have been asking all evening to which we do not have a definitive answer right sometimes we have to acknowledge that there's something that could happen that would be very bad and that would would result in a united states where there's a patchwork some states fully guaranteeing human rights and others not so much and we would become a less united states of america as a result in addition to being a country where some people suffer a great deal because they have to go through all of that um so you know it brings us back to the basic work that we've been talking about the need to number one avoid bad court decisions number two if we get them to elect legislators at the state and federal level who will enact these protections into law where they're not yet enacted um i think you know in for the issues that you're talking about the the equality echo would be very very helpful and potentially definitive um and then whatever you know judge coney barrett can theorize all she wants it will still be the law of the land and and and will be okay and maybe even more secure because actually relying on law enacted law is more stable and more secure i think than um than just re you know hoping that we that we continue to win five to four decisions on a divided supreme court um that was never a a a a stable foundation for protecting human rights in our country so i you know there are reasons for anxiety but there are also good reasons for confidence and we know what work we have to do uh to uh to make sure that our confidence is rewarded thanks congressman thank you thank you for that question uh next up we have ally ali are you there hey ali can you press the unmute button on your zoom i am um yeah i didn't realize you were going to ask for a reciting of the question but basically um [Music] i'm i'm interested in just knowing specifics about the anti-lgbtq laws policies and regulations that trump admin has pursued and or implemented because we're talking about the chipping away of rights i just wanted to get a little context what exactly are they doing and if we're successful in um retaking the presidency the senate what could be done to remedy the damage yeah alfonso do you want to take that we already mentioned the transgender troops in the military decision which was yeah very dramatic um but what what else so to to provide you with greater context and this once again highlights why it's so important to have pro-equality candidates because of the congressman's work in the house of representatives donald trump is not able to pass legislation that actually hurts lgbtq people because we have the majority in the house of representatives so knowing that what he did is use the executive branch to try to usurp uh the legislative role and serve as legislature we talked about the transgender troops in the military what they've also done is they have issued regulations that would allow medical providers hospitals doctors to deny services to lgbtq people and how they do that they basically reinterpreted the affordable care act the affordable care act says you can't discriminate based on sex and by extension sexual orientation gender identity sex stereotyping that has been the interpretation for years the trump administration issued a regulation to effectively say that hospital doctor medical provider you could deny services to an lgbtq person and it was really focused on members of the transgender community we fought back and we sued the trump administration and we won a preliminary injunction in court and that case is still pending through but they actually advance those regulations another example is the trump administration issued a regulation that would allow homeless services to deny shelter to transgender people and we know that 41 percent of transgender people unfortunately are homeless in this country and we know that the unemployment rate for the transgender community is double and in some cases triple that of the national average so under this environment in this climate with covet 19 they issued a regulation that would allow housing providers homeless shelters i should say to deny services to trans people and i'll just give you the last example there many more there are more than a hundred uh the last example that's worth highlighting i think is because it's emblematic emblematic of where i think the trump administration's is and how they see lgbtq people they removed references to lgbtq content of off the websites of federal agencies think about that they instructed federal agencies to remove lgbtq content from their websites and we know has completely been had a horrible record on lgbtq issues globally so those are just a few examples of things that they've actually implemented what do we do when we get into office is roll those back he didn't have a basis for doing those we've sued him many of the other organizations have sued them in court and we need to just be vigilant as we hopefully knock on wood glass whatever it is uh seize back the white house seize back the senate and hold on to the house yes we're learning more and more every single minute how important it is to hold the house because you guys have been the stop gap against some of these the most horrendous bills the work that trump's trying to do i think we have time for one more question we have from mark uh hi i'm mark from hungary and i'm volunteering in several campaigns including for congressman marino malinowski and i just wanted to ask it's a bit more generic but what could be the next legislative steps for trans rights i understand that it mostly depends on the result of the election but could the congressional bill be possible right now or what support would it have thank you well we did try um we did try to reverse the ban on transgender troops um and i believe that if we were to have a free and open vote in the house and senate on that issue today we would win i don't know if you would agree on tonso but i think even in the senate we would have 51 votes we would have a majority but the republican leadership in both houses particularly senator mcconnell i don't think would have the guts to um allow a vote on that issue well we could have a vote in the house any day but mcconnell controls the agenda in the senate and i think he just would not he would not put that in front of his republican senators and force them to take a vote against president trump even though some of them if if you know gun to their heads you have to vote yes or no they would vote yes to uh protect transgender rights at least in that in that respect so that's that's what we're we're up against um i think if it were you know if we won the white house um if joe biden were to win the white house and we didn't win the senate that dynamic might change i want to win the senate too but if there was no longer a president trump in the white house to defy uh i think it would be easier for mitch mcconnell to say yeah fine just let let the democrats do this and biden's going to do it by executive order anyway let's let's take the step of enshrining it in law which we would certainly i think want to do i would want to do um and perhaps on other issues regarding transgender rights and i imagine alfonzo you have a a list for us um but i think as long as trump is there it like these republicans are just too afraid even the ones who agree with us they're just too afraid of having the fight with him yeah and at the state level um in the fall of 2019 the mercy administration issued their transgender equality report which had a lot of recommendations in terms of policy actions that can be taken to reduce inequities in employment in housing and education for the transgender community here in new jersey um there is some legislation currently in the new jersey state house based on recommendations in that report um one of the bills that i'm i'm really passionate about is a bill that would require a member of the state employment and training commission to specialize in serving the transgender community um the numbers are pretty clear that the transgender community has an unemployment rate higher than the general population so it makes sense to me that um it should be a focused group by the state employment commission unfortunately uh virtually all of the bills in the state legislature based on the transgender equality report have stalled because of covet and the public health crisis that we're in so the anti-discrimination laws are an essential policy step but uh that can't be uh the end of the fight and uh that the next step after those those laws are enacted at the federal level is to have legislation to you know reduce the transgender and lgbt homeless population and make health care more accessible and to provide resources to lower the unemployment rate for transgender people and even people who don't necessarily agree with us on the issues there are ways to to frame these questions in ways that you know some chamber of commerce type republicans can understand and if a transgender person uh can't get a job because of uh employment discrimination then they're not paying taxes um and expanding the employment base to include uh transgender people who have been pushed out of the legal marketplace is a way to increase the tax base and um you know make our economy better so there are some ways of tying these issues into revenue which some you know chamber of commerce republicans can can get behind thanks victorian for the insight yes sometimes it's money that talks right so rapid round what can everyone at home do today to help make sure we hold the house flip the senate and take the white house [Laughter] uh well i'm gonna i'm biased here but um i am running for congress again and if you live in new jersey look it it's it's actually the case that we're not going to decide who wins the presidential election i mean we can financially support candidates right but we're not our votes are not going to decide that um we're not going to decide who controls the senate cory booker's on the ballot he's wonderful but i don't think there's any doubt that he's going to win the race but new jersey could very well be the state once again just as we were in 2018 that that really helps to decide who controls the house of representatives because we've got um you know we flipped several seats in 2018 and of all those seats right now mine seems to be the one that's got the the biggest uh most contentious race i kind of like that i like a fight i like a challenge we're gonna we're gonna meet this challenge but we can only do it with your help so the easy thing is vote and i know i don't need to ask anybody on this call to do that who's eligible to vote um to to to do that make sure everybody you know does the same thing encourage them to vote early not often but early we've made it easy this time around get that ballot to a dropbox or put it in the mail um and then if you have any time to help out without our campaign lisa will take your name and number and email and we will put you to work uh this is a get out the vote um [Music] task and we need to make sure that all of our folks know how to vote uh and that uh they know who to vote for uh when they cast that ballot and and you can help and then finally spread the word you know marcia uh pointed out there is a very big difference between me and state senator kane on this issue and on a lot of other issues and elections should be about differences on issues both candidates should say what they're for and they should run on their records and voters should make judgments based on that and so the more you can get the word out on any issue that you care about that there is a difference the more uh you'll be helping our campaign and also just helping this be a serious campaign that is decided by serious issues thank you congressman alfonso i know you need to run any last thoughts for us you did oh there it is i was muted for a second um uh the congressman said it all my apologies i have to run i'm running late for another um appointment but um he's at it all we have to vote we have to volunteer we have to participate and this is a competitive race and i i want to just thank everyone who came on to support the congressman's bid in getting reelected we need him in the house of representatives we need him in the house of representatives and that means that we all should engage in our own little way to support his race and even if you're going to vote i want to make sure that you contact all of your friends and family

MR. MENENDEZ: THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY. MR. MENENDEZ: I WAS HAPPY TO LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM COLORADO AND HIS ERUDITE OBSERVATIONS AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. MR. PRESIDENT, I COME TO THE FLOOR FOR A VERY IMPORTANT REASON. I RISE NOT TO INTRODUCE A BILL, NOR TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES FOR UNANIMOUS CONSENT. NO. I AM HERE FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON, AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE C-SPAN CAMERAS ARE CAPTURING THIS MOMENT FOR POSTERITY. I COME TO THE FLOOR TODAY TO HONOR KEITH ROACHFORD, A MEMBER OF MY STAFF WHO FAITHFULLY SERVED THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY, THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS. NOW, MR. PRESIDENT, AS YOU CAN SEE FROM KEITH'S FACE, IT'S CLEAR THAT HE HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS HAPPENING. WE TOLD HIM HE WAS COMING FOR ANOTHER REASON, AND I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN HIM OTHERWISE. BUT NONETHELESS, I RISE TODAY BECAUSE AFTER 35 YEARS AND 18 CONGRESSES, KEITH IS RETIRING FROM THE SENATE. AS A RESULT, I WANTED TO COME TO THE FLOOR TO SEND HIM OFF WITH A TRIBUTE BEFITTING HIS LEGENDARY CAREER. A NATIVE SON OF WILLINGBOROUGH, NEW JERSEY, KEITH SERVED NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT FOUR UNITED STATES SENATORS FOR THE GARDEN STATE. HE IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE. IN COUNTLESS FELLOW STAFF MEMBERS CAN ATTEST TO HIS EXPERIENCE, WHICH HAS SAVED THE DAY ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. KEITH HAS SOMETIMES SAID HE'S BEEN HERE SO LONG HE CAME WITH THE FURNITURE. IT'S A CLASSIC KEITH LINE, A GLIMPSE NOT EVENLY INTO HIS SENSE OF HUMOR BUT ALSO HIS VIEW OF HOW STAFF WORK BEHIND THE SCENES GETS STUFF DONE. THAT MAY BE THE CASE, YOU TOOTH, I RISE TO SHINE A SPOTLIGHT ON YOUR ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER. TO START, I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THE STORIES HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE SENT ME. KEITH HAS NOT ONLY BEEN A MENTOR TO ME, THEY SAY, HE'S ALSO BEEN A FRIEND TO ANYONE LUCKY ENOUGH TO COME INTO CONTACT WITH HIM. WHEN I THINK OF KEITH THE WORDS THAT COME TO MIND ARE HELPFUL, GENEROUS, THOUGHTFUL, PATIENT, AND UNDERSTANDING TEAM PLAYERS. ANOTHER ONE SAID HE'S SO KIND TO EVERYONE, FROM INTERNS TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF, AND IS ALWAYS, ALWAYS WILLING TO SHARE HIS KNOWLEDGE WITH OTHERS. MR. PRESIDENT, IT BRINGS ME IMMENSE JOY TO SPEAK THESE WORDS INTO THE "CONGRESSIONAL RECORD" SO THAT, LIKE KEITH'S LEGACY, THIS HE MAY STAND THE TEST OF TIME. BEYOND HIS TRACK RECORD AND STERLING REPUTATION, KEITH AT HEART IS A HUMBLE MAN. I KNOW IT ISN'T EASY FOR HIM TO SIT HERE, LISTEN TO ME SHOWER PRAISE ON HIM, TO THAT, I SAY, WELL, YOU'RE STILL ON THE PAYROLL, SO YOU HAVE TO BEAR WITH IT. ABOVE ALL, KEITH'S A FAMILY MAN. A DEVOTED HUSBAND TO HIS WIFE, SANDY, AND INCREDIBLE FATHER TO HIS BELOVED CHILDREN RICK, DANIELLE AND LAUREN. HE'S A MAN THAT EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST 36 YEARS HAS BRAVED THE BRUTAL BELTWAY TRAFFIC TO COME INTO WORK IN THE HART SENATE OFFICE BUILDING. HE'S A MAN THAT EVERY WEEKEND MADE A SIMILAR TRIP WITH HIS FAMILY TO ATTEND SERVICES AT ST. GEORGE'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN D.C. KEITH CREDITS HIS FAITH FOR GUIDING HIM THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. HE WILL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU IT'S BEEN A MORAL COMPASS FOR HIM, SEASON AFTER POLITICAL SEASON. AS THE BOOK OF JAMES ASKS, WHAT GOOD IS SOMEONE WHO SAYS THEY HAVE FAITH BUT DOES NOT HAVE WORKS? FRET NOT. IN ADDITION TO HIS DUTIES AS SENIOR WARDEN OF THE VESTRY AT ST. GEORGE'S, KEITH GIVES BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. HE'S A MEMBER OF THE BROTHERHOOD THE ST. AN CREW, SERVES AS -- ST. ANDREW, HE'S A BOY SCOUT LEADER. AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY, HE GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO GIVE BACK. IT'S A TRAIT HE LEARNED GROWING UP. AS THE SON AND GRANDSON OF PUBLIC SERVANTS, KEITH WAS TAUGHT FROM AN EARLY AGE SERVICE TO OTHERS IS THE HIGHEST CALLING. HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A TRANSIT OPERATOR FOR THE CITY OF IN THE NATIONAL GUARD WORKED FOR THE SANITATION DEPARTMENT FOR 37 YEARS. NO SURPRISE KEITH HAS FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS. HE'S A THROWBACK TO A PREVIOUS ERA, ONE WHERE INDIVIDUALS SPENT YEARS, IF NOT DECADES, WORKING FOR THE SAME ORGANIZATION. I KNOW KEITH NEVER INTENDED TO SPEND 36 YEARS WORKING IN THE SENATE. HE USED TO JOKE WITH COLLEAGUES THAT HE CAME TO WASHINGTON FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE JUST TO TRY IT OUT. BUT IN THE PROCESS HE'S GONE FROM WORKING AS A CONSTITUENT LIAISON TO MAIL DIRECTOR, TO DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF AND SO MUCH MORE. TODAY KEITH IS AN INDISPENSABLE RESOURCE, A GO-TO PERSON FOR APPROPRIATIONS, DEFENSE, VETERANS ISSUES, HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE BUDGET. HE'S HAD A HAND IN PASSING COUNTLESS INITIATES FOR OUR OFFICE, FROM SUPPORTING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SHORING UP SUPPLY CHAINS AND EXPANDING SENIOR HOUSING TO INSERTING PRO VIGS IN PACT ACT, THAT'S HOW WE GOT HIM HERE, TELLING HIM THAT'S WHAT WE'D TALK ABOUT, THAT ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF VETERANS SUFFERING FROM GULF WAR ILLNESS. KEITH HAS HAD A HAND IN FAR TOO MANY WINS TO COUNT. IS YOURIFIES TO SAY, THE LEDGE -- SUFFICE TO SAY HIS LEGEND LED TO WHAT WE CALL THE ROACHFORD RULE, WHICH IS SIMPLE -- WITH EVERY APPROPRIATIONS LETTER I SIGN ON TO, EVERY BILL I COSPONSOR, TO PASS THE RULE IT NEEDS A TANGIBLE BENEFIT FOR NEW JERSEY FAMILIES. MUCH LIKE THE MAN IT'S NAMED AFTER, THE ROACHFORD RULE IS ABOUT CONNECTING WHAT WE DO HERE IN D.C. TO THE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES IT AFFECTS BACK HOME. LONG AFTER KEITH HAS LEFT THE SENATE, HIS RULE WILL LIVE ON AS TESTAMENT TO HIS RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF GOOD GOVERNMENT. A TRADEMARK FOR A PUBLIC SERVANT DEVOTED TO THE COMMON GOOD, A NAMESAKE ALL OF US IN THIS CHAMBER WOULD DO WELL TO EMULATE. I'LL END WITH THIS, LAST MARCH I CAME TO THIS FLOOR TO REBUKE THE WORDS THAT A COLLEAGUE USED IN REFERENCE TO THE JANUARY 6 ATTACK. I WON'T USE THE TIME TO REHASH WHAT I SAID. INSTEAD, I'LL ONCE AGAIN LIFT UP THE BRAVERY AND COURAGE OF THE MAN WHO COMPELLED ME TO ACT. LATE ONE NIGHT KEITH E-MAILED ME OUTLINING THE PAIN AND OUTRAGE HE FELT AFTER READING OUR COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS. IN PERSONAL TERMS, HE RELAYED HOW HIS ENTIRE LIFE HE HAD TO ENDURE, IN OVERT AND COVERT WAYS, THE HARMFUL LEGACY OF RACISM AND STAIN OF WHITE SUPREMACY. KNOWING KEITH, IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN EASY TO KEEP THAT MESSAGE TO HIS BOSS, A SITTING UNITED STATES SENATOR. BUT AS I SAID IN THAT SPEECH, THERE COMES A TIME WHEN YOU EITHER RUFFLE SOME FEATHERS AND SPEAK THE TRUTH OR FAIL TO DO JUSTICE TO THE VALUES YOU HOLD DEAR. MR. PRESIDENT, THE UNITED STATES SENATE IS A BETTER INSTITUTION, AND I AM CERTAINLY A BETTER SENATOR, FOR HAVING KEITH ROACHFORD WORK IN THESE HALLS. HE'S A MAN OF PRINCIPLE, A MAN OF GOD, A MAN WHO HAS PUT EVERY OUNCE OF HIS BEING INTO THE WORK THAT NEW JERSEYANS HAVE SENT US HERE TO DO. HE'S THE FIRST PERSON TO TELL YOU THAT HE'S NOT PERFECT, THE FIRST TO SAY HE'S CERTAINLY SEEN IT ALL OVER 36 LONG YEARS OF SERVICE, BUT BY GOD, I CANNOT HELP BUT FEEL SO THANKFUL AND GRATEFUL WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH HIS PRESENCE. HE IS A CALM AND STEADY HAENED THAT HELPED GUIDE OUR -- STEADY HAND THAT HELPED GUIDE OUR OFFICE SINCE 2006, THE QUIET ONE, WHO KEEPS HIS POWDER GUY DRIE AND PLAYS THE LONG TIME, WHO NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE ULTIMATE GOAL TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF HARD WORKING AMERICAN FAMILIES. JOHN MADISON ONCE SAID, IF MEN WERE ANGELS, NO GOVERNMENT WOULD BE NEEDED. I'VE NEVER MET AN ANGEL, BUT I'VE WORKED ALONGSIDE KEITH ROACHFORD FOR 16 OF THOSE 36 YEARS. HE'S SERVED WITH ME LONGER THAN ANY OTHER OF THE U.S. SENATORS HE'S WORKED WITH, AND IT'S WHY I CAN TRUTHFULLY SAY WITHOUT PAUSE THAT KEITH IS TRULY DOING GOD'S WORK HERE ON EARTH. WHEN KEITH FIRST MENTIONED THAT HE WAS THINKING OF LEAVING, HE SAID THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING. HE SAID YOU KNOW, SENATOR, IT'S JUST THAT WITH THE PANDEMIC AND WORK FROM HOME, I'VE JUST GOTTEN TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH SANDY AND THE KIDS. WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANY LONGER TO GET STARTED. WE MAKE BREAKFAST AND TAKE WALKS. I JUST DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANY LONGER TO DO THAT. THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, IS KEITH IN A NUTSHELL. THAT'S WHO HE IS. SO I WANT TO CONGRATULATE KEITH ON AN INCREDIBLE 36 YEARS OF SENATE SERVICE. WE'RE GOING TO MISS YOU, CERTAINLY SO. BUT TO YOU, TO SANDY, TO YOUR THREE CHILDREN, WE WISH YOU ALL THE BEST ON A WELL-DESERVED RETIRENT. THANK YOU, KEITH.

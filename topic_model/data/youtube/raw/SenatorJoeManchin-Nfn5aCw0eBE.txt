[Music] west virginia has a rich african-american history and so many of these stories have never been told or preserved for future generations so in 2020 i secured more than 146 thousand dollars from the national park service for the carter g woodson memorial foundation to repair the garrison house and transform it into an african-american and civil rights museum and i'm proud to share that the restoration work is now underway just last month the foundation was able to host a bus tour of important black history sites across huntington including frederick douglass high school the carter g woodson statue and of course the garrison house as part of black history month carter do what's in came and at the time he was not a doctor he was he had his degree from douglas and he came and became the principal of douglas and uh as a result ended up going to harvard he is regarded as the father of black history he has written more definitive books about african american life in these united states than anybody else and he is solely responsible for us celebrating black history month i'm grateful for the senator and others taking interest in us and we really appreciate all the efforts that have been given to us here in huntington so i want to thank you mr harris for preserving this important part of our state and nation's history if you or someone you know is in need of assistance with a state or federal agency please contact my office at 304-342-5855 [Music] you

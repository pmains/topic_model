Thank You mr. chairman for allowing me to introduce judge Walker I'm very pleased that President Trump reached outside the Beltway to New York bubble to elevate a judge who is committed to our Constitution and to be elevated now to the nation's second most important Court Judge Walker will be the first judge confirmed to the DC Circuit from outside the bubble since Thomas Griffith the judge he's replacing was confirmed 15 years ago I was honored to recommend judge Walker for the district court and I was honored to recommend judge Walker now to the elevation to the DC Circuit Court I was unable to be here for judge Walker's hearing last year because I had to have urgent lung surgery if I had been here I would have told you how I met Judge Walker through my friend Mike lame and how I was immediately impressed by his legal knowledge and critical thinking about the law in Judge Walker short time as a district judge he has shown an unwavering fidelity to the Constitution in early April our nation was in the middle of a health crisis politicians around the country began clamoring and claiming tremendous power over parts of our everyday life while many in the public cheered them all and governors and mayor's were seemingly in a race to see who could restrict their citizens movements the most eventually governments began to enact restrictions that prevented even the free exercise of religion on the Friday before Easter our governor ordered the state police to record the license plates of churchgoers on Easter so they could be forcibly quarantined the mayor of our largest city banned churches from holding Easter services including a drive-through service where the worshipers would stay in their car with the weekend looming one church went to court and Judge Walker was assigned the case the easy thing to do would have been to wait into the following week to hear the case with Easter having already passed instead Judge Walker saw such a clear violation of the First Amendment that he issued a rare saturday order blocking the city from criminalizing Eastern I'm sure each of you have read this opinion in preparation for this hearing if not I commend it to you as it demonstrates the depth of his knowledge of the law and history more importantly it demonstrates his fidelity to our Constitution even when it is hard and even in times of crisis Judge Walker is just the kind of person we need on the bench I proudly support him and urge you to swiftly send his nomination to the floor

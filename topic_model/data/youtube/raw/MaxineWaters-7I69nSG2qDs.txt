back to the west news in the morning 25 minutes past the hour right now your top stories five minutes away first though an AM original something you'll see only on American morning it's an emotional story that we've been following for more than a year of a homeless teen named kenneth chan see his dream of going to college becoming a neurosurgeon was just that only a dream but things started to turn around when we hooked him up with an NFL star our Thelma Gutierrez live in Los Angeles this morning to show us just how much his fortunes have changed good mourning Thelma good morning John well it's hard to imagine that it's already been a year it's been an incredible journey to witness and to be a part of that Kenneth has dealt with so many hardships in his life but because he believes in himself he's got other people to believe in him too I'm Kenneth Chan see about five years ago I was beaten neglected three years ago in a foster home last year just last year in a homeless shelter I've been at the bottom of the pits now I'm on top I first met Kenneth last year while working on a story about homeless children in Los Angeles Kenneth wasn't your average 17 year old he was junior class president a starting running back on the football team and an honor student who dreamed of going to Harvey so it was hard to imagine this is where he and his sister lived on Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles I mean I do it it personally what I do I just like to put a smile good morning kind of got to you don't want that negative vibe on your show with already you have the hardship of being homeless and broken we aired Kenneth story my mom used Ives my said that you saved me then we received a surprise call from someone who wanted to meet him so we set it up the US one he's with the Oakland Raiders yes I need it nandi awesome wat is the highest paid defensive back in the NFL now the football player with a 5 million dollar contract was inviting Kenny homeless high school football player on the awesome a college tour for scholars which is all expense paid trip that nominees foundation sponsors every year I wanted to invite you along for the tour oh my god for DC my determination stuff we met up with Kenneth and 15 other students as they arrived in Washington they're all from at-risk neighborhoods in Los Angeles and Oakland and all were hand-picked by awesome wat to be on the tour welcome to the X 2010 tour where Washington DC here the NFL star and the teenagers are about to experience a whole new world those theories there's a 9 million pound rotunda in the United States Capitol I'm in the place where bills good sign so what comes next for you i believe miss miss Walters representative Walters she is a state leader which is awesome hey I think it's happening now so we're gonna go to Maxine Waters office okay as a professional athlete you could be doing a lot of other things with your time but obviously you want to get back no matter where I've been or where I go I think every year that I do the tour is a new adventure after the capital they told the White House oh nothing like knocking down a few kids at the president's very own bone most people who know Nnamdi Asomugha in the sports world who know you as a great football star a lot of how do you wanted these kids to know you that's a good question I want them to come away with a different type of hope like look this is possible many of the students including Kenneth will be the first in their families to go to night awesome was toward gives them a chance to see top schools like Georgetown University of clothes so your darkest time you didn't think that you would probably go to college yeah I didn't even think I was gonna graduate let alone go to college and now your aspirations I'm going to be someone in life and that's my biggest inspiration I'm gonna be the one changing changing the world after getting to know some of the students I can say Kenneth won't be alone and I want to be a pediatrician for now I wanna be an astronaut I like to become a theoretical physicist good friends we've lost along the way that's why I say no woman no cry no no that is such a great story i love the fact that Kenneth says but he wants to change the world i mean what great dolls to have but you're suggesting though that there's a possibility he might become homeless again how well John after one of our initial stories aired a CNN viewer came through and she said I have a home an apartment where Kenneth his sister and father can live for a short amount of time and that time runs out in July and so come July Kenneth and his family may be homeless again Wow and it's such a tough situation he is definitely going to college though right come in the fall so perhaps hopefully there's you know some other people out there who may be able to help them and they may be able to get back on their feet to bridge that gap in the meantime do we know where Kenneth has decided he's going to go to college adherence so far you know when we talk to Kenneth he said that looks like at this point he's probably going to go to college here in California now he did apply to go to Harvard after all this is his dream ever since he was a little boy but unfortunately he was not accepted for the coming year now Kenneth says that's because he was competing against kids who had 4.3 GPA s and his GPA um though he was an honor student really wasn't great until his junior and senior years but his freshman and sophomore years when he was homeless and also in foster care he only had a C average so he said he feels that that's why he wasn't accepted but after all he says he's because I still proud of myself because I'm not disappointed he goes because I'm the first person in my family to go to college and I will get to Harvard so he believes in himself he continues all right well if not undergrad maybe he'll go to Harvard Medical School and they will become that neurosurgeon but I was any college with you

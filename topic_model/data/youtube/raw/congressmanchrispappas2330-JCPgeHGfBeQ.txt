representative Pappas of the great state of New Hampshire the gentleman is recognized thank you very much Mr speaker thank you to representative takano for yielding for your leadership along with chairman Boston getting this legislation to the floor and I want to thank Representatives McMorris Rogers and representative Bergman uh for uh co-sponsoring this bill which covers an important issue this is emergency care coverage for veterans under the Community Care Program this would close a glaring Gap in emergency care for veterans who are transitioning from DOD to VA care now right now va's failure to cover Emergency Care during this transitional period can result in a crippling amount of debt for veterans who need this kind of care and these coverage gaps are all too common for our veterans I've heard about it from my own constituents in my first month in office I was contacted by a veteran in Danville New Hampshire who put off seeking care for a medical emergency because he was unsure that VA would cover this care no veteran should ever think twice about seeking care during a medical emergency or be faced with exorbitant medical bills as a result of this care so let's eliminate this gap for veterans who are recently enrolled in VA care this is an important step forward represented by this legislation there are certainly more work to do but I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation today and I yield back my time

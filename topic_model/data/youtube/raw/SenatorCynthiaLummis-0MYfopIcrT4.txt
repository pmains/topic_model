we'll do the national anthem stuff [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] yeah everybody have one everybody it's all good okay very good all right um in addition to the flow of the events you'll also find a short bio on Louisa Swain on the back there's a full transcript of the law designating the official changing of the name of the building [Music] however how we got to this point and some history of Louisa swing however before I do invite our speakers up I would like to give just a little bit of background on the building itself so you know excuse me I'm going to I'm just going to read through this the Federal Building in Cheyenne was a product of the National Building act construction program enacted by Congress in 1928 which later helped alleviate unemployment caused by the depression the massive building program authorized the construction of federal buildings throughout the nation this Federal Building that you see here before us was designed in the neoplasical style thank you very much this building was designed by William Du Bois a regional prominent architect he was educated at The Chicago School of Architecture and Du Bois moved to Cheyenne in 1901 and established a very successful firm here in the city Dubois Blended his Mastery of the neoclassical architectural style with elements of the book Arts Romanesque Revival and Art Deco Styles in his many designs he also designed other prominent buildings throughout Wyoming including the East and West Winds of our state capitol the Carnegie Library that used to be in Cheyenne the historic Plains hotel and the Heinz building to name a few while many of these buildings still exist and it's significant that this is the only Federal Building that he does the original three-story portion of this building was completed in 1933. it's a one-story addition was added in 1937. other improvements over the years include a stair Tower to the East end of the building built in 1947 as well as accessible ramp on the back side of the building the building entrance Lobby retains much of the original finishes including the marble and Terrazzo flooring marble Wayne's goat and some plaster wall surfaces and ceiling trim the upper floors were remodeled in 1999 for continued office Shoes by building tennis in October of 2000 the Cheyenne Federal Building was listed on the national register of historic places so after the ceremony if you get a chance to walk into the building you can feel free to do so so now at this time I would like to introduce our first speaker for today Senator Cynthia Lumis sponsored the bill to rename this Federal Building and it's her strong efforts that guide us to today's ceremony and the naming of this building so if you please welcome Senator Knox [Applause] this is a happy day for me you know on September 6th of 1870 Louise said Swain became the first woman in the world uh to cast a ballot in an election uh because Wyoming was the first government in the world to grant women continuously the right to vote that happened 50 years before the 19th Amendment to the U.S Constitution granted all women in this country the right to vote Wyoming had so many firsts the first woman voter first woman Grand juror first woman bailiff first women to serve as delegates to the Republican and Democratic national conventions first woman to hold Statewide office and first woman governor it is because of Louisa Swain's vote that those efforts and those accomplishments were kicked off and so I think it's fitting that this building be dedicated to honor Wyoming and its first woman voter Louisa Swain you have a little history of Louisa Swain in your brochure and she was an orphan she was a member of the Friends Church the Quakers and she came out here with her husband having married him after being raised as an orphan her father went out to see never to return uh and so when she and her husband came out here and settled in Laramie uh the time the timing was perfect for her to become the first one in photo and we understand that she was specifically chosen in Laramie because she was an upstanding woman and The Other Women in Laramie knew that this was a historic event and they wanted someone from their community who was a gentle woman of stature and good graces and so she was chosen and she I was carrying her tail to head for the store on her way and cast her ballot in route to do her other daily duties so while it was perhaps a humble event at the time it was a historic event that we honored today I am grateful to all of you who have played a role in honoring that history I want to point out a couple of people one is Adam Stewart Adam would you stand Adam Stewart is a member of our staff in Washington DC Adam is the person who's really most responsible for getting this bill passed uh he bird dogged it through the U.S Senate and the U.S house we I also want to thank our co-sponsors of course my dear prospected colleague John barrasso joined me in sponsoring this bill as did the Maryland Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben carton Luisa Swain is buried in the Baltimore area in a Quaker Cemetery the friends cemetery and so we thought it appropriate to ask our colleagues from Maryland to co-sponsor our bill so that's why you have Wyoming and Maryland's delegations joining in this effort Adam's the one who identified that this would be an appropriate building because it was had been previously unnamed and because of this historic event uh and Wyoming's role in this historic event uh we wanted everyone who passes by this building as well as our co-sponsors in Washington to realize the significance of this history I want to acknowledge the presence of the mayor of Cheyenne thank you Pat Collins for coming today I want to acknowledge the board of the foundation in Laramie that has nurtured the history house that was built in Laramie to honor this historic occasion it has been something that punch Williamson who's here today and I have been involved in since day one uh with our dear friend uh welded tuck Weldon is not here today he is currently uh in Virginia with his family but Weldon tuck brought to our attention uh this historic event and that we needed to honor it and that was in oh that was more than 20 years ago much and it took a Virginia who's used to uh the history of our country to remind us uh that we have important history in this state that we need to celebrate honor and recognize uh so I want to acknowledge Melvin's particular role in that today and most importantly I want to thank uh our our dear governor for attending today uh Governor Mark Gordon has been nothing but supportive of all of these efforts and I get to speak on his behalf today how often does that happen he has a bit of laryngitis today and I just want you to know Governor that your office in the historic Wyoming state capitol is truly wonderful and the reason our state capitol building is on the National Trust for historic preservation list is because of the event that took place there and that was the Wyoming territorial legislature uh passive legislation uh to acknowledge women's roles in in this territory and later this state uh as voters uh withhold legal rights with a plan so uh to those of you here today who have been so important to this effort uh if I have neglected to mention you my apologies but I want to tell you I'm very proud of this I want to thank GSA for your efforts uh I want to acknowledge that John barrasso has staff here today thank you for joining us uh with my dear dear friend and colleague and Kathy Conley who is here representing the Wyoming state legislature on a day that we are so proud to acknowledge Louisa Swain the first woman voter in the world from Wyoming Laramie and uh our beloved equality State thank you so our next speaker will be representative from Senator Grasso's office please I think he was kind enough to prepare a state resources good afternoon thank you it's a pleasure to be here to represent Senator barrasso on this special occasion I do have a brief letter of congratulations that I'll share dear friends it is a wonderful day to celebrate the naming of the Louisa Swain federal office building Louise's training was the first woman in the United States has to vote in a general election on September 6 1890 she changed American history and paved the way for women not only in Wyoming but all over the nation in 2021 Wyoming's first female U.S senator Cynthia Lamas introduced us 2126 legislation naming this building after Louis's Swain it was an honor to co-sponsor the bill it is a wonderful way to recognize the important role women in Wyoming played in women's suffrage and equality the equality state is proud to be home to strong female strong female leaders to continue to shape our state and Country their courage leadership and dedication will be remembered for generations to come Bobby and I send our best wishes and congratulations for this historic event we are truly proud to call Wyoming home with warm regards Senator John Barossa foreign Foundation which is based in Laramie and we are very appreciative of the effort the foundation makes to keep the significance of Louise's Swain alive so that generations to come know her significance and impact in history amen [Applause] it is my honor to follow Cynthia Lewis Senator Lamas has been with us from the very beginning in Laramie standing alongside Weldon tuck and punch Williamson to celebrate this humble woman and the women who stepped up because Wyoming territory in the men of Wyoming decided to give this remarkable suffrage Act these remarkable powers to women in those days to keep their land to keep their money to earn money on equal terms with men to be able to vote hold public office we are so excited in Laramie that we have a place to tell that history literally a stone's throw you can stand at the history house across from where those women sat on that first jury where Louisa walked with her yeast pail on her way to the store uh and cast her back on that way um you can land a rock near where she did that how exciting is that and how exciting that Weldon and punch thought they would take an empty lot that was right across from there and do something productive to tell that story like Senator Thomas said it took a Virginian to remind us that this is pretty remarkable that we do this in Wyoming you can't go to any other state that did this that not only gave women these rights 50 years before but they held on to them as they fought to become a state that's another part of our teaching at the history house over there we talk about how Wyoming held firm because when they went to Washington DC replying to become a state um they said yeah but you can but you you've got the numbers now but you're going to have to rescind that act no one else is giving women those rights and Wyoming the The Legend is that Wyoming the legislature legislators said will remain out of the Union a hundred years before we come without the women part of it was population they had to have the women for their population so if that was indeed a quote um which we're still finding out where who said that it's a pretty remarkable thing that we hunt tight that our men said we need the women and they did they needed to settle the West with those women and um and so what a smart move give women their rights give them exactly what they're do just like the men so we love to tell that story I was honored to follow Senator lamis but but then I had to change my whole Little Theater here because she told all the good facts very much no it's great she's been with us a very long time and and she's followed this with a passion that I I want to carry on it's her passion and weldon's uh what he began there I want to continue that and we have such a great board and so many great docents who are with us

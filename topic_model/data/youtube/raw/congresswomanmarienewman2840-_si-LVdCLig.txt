over to your congresswoman representative maureen newman please take it away well thank you so much ian for opening us up tonight i want to thank my wonderful expert guests we have just an all-star panel tonight we have uh commissioner biaggi from chicago mike connolly from cta and sis killen that is going to talk about some of our individual projects uh that we have throughout the third district so i'm going to lean on them occasionally to give you more granular information but i thought i would kick it off and say how excited i am because uh we're talking about one of my very favorite things today is uh transportation infrastructure i i have to tell you my work um as a member of the transportation and infrastructure committee is uh really one of my favorite things in congress and in the district and i think that's why i like it because it is so personal to our district we are a transportation hub as many of you know uh about one out of every four trains in our nation goes right through illinois three um in our belts uh so we are uh we're thrilled to um have this uh expertise right in our district but also to have these amazing projects going on and there's a lot of them so i thought what i would do is talk about this infrastructure bill so it's known as the iija which is the bipartisan infrastructure act that we just passed and uh was lucky enough to work on in committee and then saw this law passed and signed into law by uh president biden so let me tell you a little bit about what the law is um broadly so um what we tried to do is think about it in a very pragmatic way and and we put a fix it first mentality to this bill so those bridges roads transit agencies waterways broadband that were particularly broken those get first priority on in getting things up and running vis-a-vis projects in our nation so all of those projects will go first and then from there those things that uh reduce pollution and um reduce congestion and create greater greater uh safety throughout our nation are the things that will be addressed uh shortly thereafter those fix it first projects so we're going to talk about some specific projects to the district because you all have given us great questions about specific projects but we're also going to talk broadly about some things now i want to tell you about two very exciting things inside this 1.2 trillion dollar bill first of all um through the great work of the entire illinois delegation of members of congress and our two senators we've brought about 17 billion to the state of illinois to work on things like roads bridges highways and the like and waterways um and what that means is that many of our uh bridges that are in the worst repair are going to get addressed first so we're very excited but there's two uh laws that actually were rolled into the greater um infrastructure act that i'm very excited about and i i'm telling you about them now because uh we were able to pass them out of my office so let me tell you about the first one is the um the asap act which is uh creates greater accessibility throughout our nation it's a four billion dollar fund that effectively shores up all of those transit stations that do not that are not ada compliant interestingly enough about 20 of transit agencies in our nation are not ada compliant even though that law is 30 years old so this will make all of those transit agencies um compliant and allow uh people that have uh disabilities are differently abled uh blind death or otherwise will be able to um access these stations and get where they need needing to go so uh very exciting second thing very exciting we have created a law that is now rolled into the infrastructure act and will be rolled out where we have here in illinois at uic we will have a rail center of excellence and what the center of excellence will do we'll study things like how can we make our future greener and have greener transit systems high-speed rail looking at um electrification and renewables but it will also um short-term look at how we can make things safer in our current infrastructure and reduce pollution and congestion so um that both of those uh laws were rolled into the greater act from our office here in illinois three um so thank you for all of my partners in the district that were helpful in getting those passed and i really appreciate it so um a couple of things before i introduce our or allow our panelists to introduce themselves um i want to talk a minute about um how that affects our district specifically and the state of illinois there are certain projects that will be um be able to be moved along because they're what that you call shovel ready and that means that they're through their uh first phase and their analysis phase and now they are ready to go with construction or enhancement or whatever it might require so we're going to talk about a few of those today and with that is my great pleasure to introduce three of three experts in transportation in this area i'll allow them to introduce yourselves but it they are first we'll go to uh commissioner biager then to mike connolly from cta and then sis killen so uh commissioner biaggi if you want to take it away introduce yourself sure thing uh and thank you uh congressman it's it's it's pleasure to be here and i think it's really a wonderful opportunity to get the word out on what's happening with the infrastructure bill that everyone's been talking about and a special thanks to you particularly in your work and getting this bill passed i'm happy to talk more later about what that means to us here in chicago but just for folks on the line so i'm commissioner of the department of transportation so that's chicago city limits that's 4 000 miles of streets 400 bridge and viaduct structures um we have we've managed the city's bike share program we're part of developing that ev framework um and we're you know a big part of delivering on the infrastructure for chicago but we also work hand in glove with the cta who you hear from and the county we're sort of we're the tabletop the cta runs on top of us in terms of the trains and the buses but we all have to work together we do a ton of work with the county on rail and as the congressman was talking about um we talked more about that too and what this bill means for for rail um but you know we're all in together delighted to be here and thank you for the opportunity um to talk a little bit more deeply about it i'll pass it on to uh i think mike conley from the cta sure thank you um thank you commissioner um i'm mike connolly i'm the chief planning officer for cta um so so i handle the the long-term strategic planning and the day-to-day service planning writing the bus schedules as well as figuring out what what's the next capital improvement project that we're going to be working on um and uh cta i've been there 20 years it's it's a it's a wonderful organization with uh 1800 buses and 1400 trains out there running every day even in the snow today they were out there pushing snow this morning to to make sure we could get service out um and and we served not only the city of chicago with with the rail lines and the bus service extensively but also 35 suburbs that surround the city in cook county and so we work very very closely with the commissioner uh and and work as well closely with uh the county folks and and and with uh with uh superintendent killen and her and her staff so i i would be remiss if i didn't take the opportunity to call out again the congresswoman for her sponsorship of the asap legislation that she's the one who introduced it in the house and carried it forward uh and it really will be a um a game changer for accessibility uh for for all the transit systems with that i'll i'll pass it on to to uh sis killing hi good evening everyone thanks again for joining us on the line and thank you congresswoman newman for inviting commissioner biaggi and mike and i to be here to talk about the infrastructure bill i am the superintendent of transportation for cook county and in that role i oversee the planning design construction and maintenance of over 1600 miles of roadway within the county 100 bridges 365 traffic signals but more importantly it's how you know commissioner and you know planning chief connolly we all come together to balance this delicate ecosystem that we need to have for transportation mobility we're thinking about bicyclists and pedestrians we're thinking about those that get aboard transit we're thinking about freight activity within our communities how it's the economic engine for our region but also can carry a burden when it comes to mobility for residents and very pleased to be here today today to speak more about the federal infrastructure bill um you know thanks again to the congresswoman for advocating so hard to bring forth these money this this is a once in a career you know opportunity that we have to fix it first and really make meaningful impact in our communities with this funding so thank you again happy to be here well thank you all for being here uh it is a pleasure and it is a pleasure to work with you on our on treasured uh transit transportation and infrastructure um systems here in the chicago area it looks like we have our first uh question so i'm going to go ahead and give a shot at it first but i might call on my experts to give a little bit more editorial around it so we'll start with can you and the panelists speak to the uh implementation of this new funding how long will it take for residents to start seeing projects break ground and real improvement on our roads and bridges so here's what i'll tell you as a starting point that it will be very soon um we what's great is that we knew that this bill would pass because it was a bipartisan bill so we've actually been working on this since last summer here in our state but actually every state has been working on it so with our transportation uh partners the illinois department of transportation uh chicago department of transportation and then specific partners like um cta metra um and pace and the like um so in the in the next few months we should see things breaking down you know it is chicago and we have what 12 feet of uh snow on the ground right now so it's not going to happen tomorrow folks and i think we all know why we live in the midwest but um but those are all slated um projects to um start and a few of them are actually in uh right in illinois three so i'm going to kick it over to my friend sis killen to talk about illinois three projects that will benefit um in some way from the uh federal funding well that's great thank you congresswoman and the excitement of what we're able to bring into the district and you said it very well you know we've been spending our time really moving projects through what we call the project pipeline we knew this day was coming we need to make sure projects were in various states of readiness so we could take advantage of the vast opportunities that this infrastructure bill provides it could be for design you know as we get projects ready for construction or to actually fund construction um so we're we actually have several projects in illinois three that will be ready to utilize these funds and eligible for these funds i'm really looking to start them in in years 2023 and 2024 so really on the near term horizon in the infrastructure space that is very soon we're not looking on a 5-10 year horizon so we get very excited about that one exciting project that we have is actually in the village of justice this is an amazing collaborative that cook county has with the illinois department of transportation the illinois tollway and the village of justice where we are actually partnering to provide two new ramps onto i-294 and that is a large regional project that can complement the work that the tollway is doing and that's a 4.2 billion dollar investment all up and down the central tri-state but we've partnered with them to say what else needs to be done if we're spending that kind of money in communities how can we ensure that all community needs are met how can we ensure that our infrastructure can support business operations and for this project in particular it is a near nearly 30 million dollar project with the construction of two new ramps we're going to be rebuilding sections along 79th street along 88th avenue also known as cork avenue and then also along archer avenue illinois 171 and this is a very unique project where it takes each agency to come together multi-jurisdictional projects can be the stickiest the messiest and the longest to come together but what i can say for transportation agencies here in this region you know and specifically for moving projects in illinois three everyone comes to the table collaboratively to reconstruct these roadways to partner with local communities and everyone bringing i always say their their quarter to the table to make a dollar and move these projects forward and the agencies you know cook county we spend a lot of time looking to see how how can we work with communities that might bear the burden of freight mobility they have a lot of trucks it's critical to our economy but it should never rest solely on the shoulders of local municipalities that is what this money does it allows cook county to come to the table with the state with the tollway with funding coming out of the iija and moving these projects into construction now the important piece of having this funding available today is that we can also look at opportunities to reprogram some monies that we might have as this federal money now hits our projects which we are eternally grateful for you know we're able to do more in the community and that's what we're really excited by it promotes pedestrian accessibility local mobility and really being regionally significant so that's one project that'll move forward and the second one is the rebuilding of a major bridge structure so i know that the congresswoman is very excited about fix it first how can we fix those aging bridges that can be a national issue we're actually going to be rebuilding central avenue over the sanitarian ship canal that is another 35 million dollar project that we're going to be beginning design on this year so it's about an 18-month to 24-month process as we prepare sets of bid plans for contractors to bid on but we're very excited to see this project eligible for the federal iija funding for construction to begin in well sis thank you so much what i will add to that 88th avenue and uh cork intersection um and all of the work going wrong i was just over there and met with um the the staff from the illinois department of transportation and we really walk through what is cool about these projects is not just reducing conduct congestion which is amazing when we need that but it will also create greater access to all of those small businesses in that area there are about 50 small businesses within a half a mile there that will receive um greater accessibility because it's one of those cookie uh cookie places in our district that where it was kind of cobbled together over time and a bunch of streets come together in a crazy way this will kind of flatten it out make it make more sense make it a lot safer at intersections too but we will also allow traffic to go above and beyond on those ramps so that you can get off the expressway and onto the other thoroughfares more easily so i'm excited about that i'm going to hand it back to ian for our next question or possibly poll it looks like yup yeah thank you congresswoman thank you for organizing our panel today i'm going to take a quick moment to remind our participants out there and our phone audience how they can participate if you'd like to submit a question many of you already have you can press xero on your phone give your question to an operator we're going to continue reading those and getting them answered we have terry and lagrange and joshing countryside up next we're going to run a survey question here next and also remind you if you'd like to give us your email address for email updates from the congresswoman's office press seven give your email address to an operator and i will keep you updated on the issues that affect you moving forward first poll question for you is this what type of infrastructure projects and investments are most important to you and your community press one if it's water infrastructure press two if it's roads and highways press three if it's public transit four for broadband and five for electric vehicles so let me read through those again and give you a little more detail on each option again what type of infrastructure projects and investments are most important to you and your community one for water infrastructure like addressing flood issues removing lead pipes etc two for roads and highways repairing reconstructing broken roads and bridges three for public transit that's again expanding and improving public transit options improving accessibility ending transportation deserts number four is for broadband expanding access to high speed high-speed internet in rural areas and number five for electric vehicles investing in electric vehicles to create good-paying jobs and a greener economy go ahead and vote now appreciate that feedback and we are going to get back to polls in just a bit here but we've got some really great questions here congresswoman terry in lagrange has this one i'm concerned about the water system in lagrange the storm systems aren't working they're overflowing and has been going on for 10 years will the infrastructure deal with this problem and again that's terry and lagrange for you well thank you for your question uh terry and yes it will so um some of the monies are allotted for um two very special waterway projects um some of the waterway projects will affect uh our flooding that is going on not just in lagrange i know it's heavy in lagrange and countryside and brookfield and those areas but it's also oakland has a huge problem uh and on and on and on we there are many floodplains throughout the district so um we will have money to address those projects it will filter down into them i'm going to flip it to uh commissioner biager if she has any comment on how that relates to the deep tunnel project or any of those items because one of the issues is that not all of our communities are connected to the deep tunnel project and um so what we have to do is either we have options right we can create satellite systems that will and storm sewer projects that will repair the issue at hand or we can connect to the deep tunnel so with that i'm going to turn it over to commissioner biaggi to talk a little bit about waterway systems in the chicago area yeah happy too um and i think you know i think we had the word uh transportation ecosystem uh came out earlier yeah and really the whole are all of our water infrastructure really how we approach resilience it has to be done in that kind of with that ecosystem mindset if you push water somewhere it ends up in somebody else's front yard backyard or basement and so you know we've been working on the deep tunnel project for a number of years really trying to create capacity in the system um to separate the combined sewers overflows where we can and really also work so that's like big systemic level but we also need to work at that one foot level the small things we do in neighborhoods like green alleys where we create permeability in the alleys and that enables water to percolate and not go directly into the storm sewer system the federal infrastructure bill will allow us to massively expand that kind of you know it's it's it's less lesser noticed infrastructure but you know it when it's not there and that you know when your alley is flooded or you have parts of the the roadway that aren't managing the water well and so this funding will enable us to do that and integrate it into our streetscape projects for example where we can create opportunities for stormwater uh retention detention and allow it to percolate um that's good for the whole system and really part of you know it i'm hearing transportation talk about water but it's a fundamental piece of that infrastructure we all touch it you know one of our charges at the park transportation is actually addressing uh lake michigan and the whole um you know 25 miles of shoreline that is really uh with the climate change water levels are up people's basements are flooded cars are floating down the street in chicago and the federal bill in fact we just had a big announcement where the army corps of engineers will work with us to look at the entire shoreline uh a second time right we did nine miles we'd have another nine miles to go and look at how we can make sure that we're doing everything we can at that large systems level i think the other um work that we're doing thanks to the infrastructure bill is working on the south and southwest side of the city on piloting additional storm water measures so where we have all of these technical ideas how do we put those together and so an entire neighborhood is benefiting um when we're routing water to the right places i think the other piece if you don't mind wrap it up in a second um but lead line service replacement right that's a fundamental part of what we need to deliver in chicago we have 400 000 lead lines um that's a lot they go right into people's homes it's going to be one of the biggest infrastructure projects that we've ever done in the city but replacing those lead lines we would not be able to take a step forward in the way that we're going to but for the federal dollars so you know this resilience bucket uh is no small lens i would say that we're looking at all of our projects through um and i think you know to the point made earlier you know when when is this money going to really hit the ground and i think as superintendent keelum talked about you know we've been cueing up projects waiting for the day you know we've done design work we've you know we have things positioned and this is a huge injection moving something from all that design work and engineering work into progress and so i think you'll see things happen even throughout you know this year um and then certainly a lot in 2023 and 2024. well thank you um so much commissioner and um i what i will add to that is is that the the beauty of the uh bipartisan infrastructure funding model is that um it all gets distributed through the department of transportation but most of it is pre-designated to the most important issues among them lead pipes and flooding issues so they actually are prioritized so as an example in lagrange you asked about specifically lagrange will be part of that prioritization because it needs it the most given the um you know the that what we call a 100 year rain and 25-year reign which now happen every year by the way so um they will be prioritized um with that funding model and i will hand it back to ian to go to our next question sure thing thank you again and uh a quick moment to go over the results of our last poll uh let's like looks like 37 percent of you voted for rhodes and highway as the type of infrastructure projects you'd like to see as being most important to your community 33 for water infrastructure 13 for public transit 11 for electric vehicles and 7 for broadband thanks again for voting in those polls let's go to mary in beverly next who asks is the infrastructure bill going to help chicago public schools become ada compliant she continues that there are over 100 cps schools that are not accessible right now will all the cta stops be wheelchair accessible the metro station stop right outside the metro station does not have vehicle wheelchair accessibility now she says she has a daughter in a wheelchair and she has to go three blocks out of her way to get anywhere downtown on public transportation that's from marion beverly congresswoman well thank you so much and it's a great question because i hear this all the time mary if you're listening and and uh yet the answer the short answer is yes is that this uh four billion dollar fund is designed to create those enhancements in um our cta structures um to in fact improve accessibility for wheelchairs and and the like and greater too um so i'm gonna um throw it back to um mike connolly who's gonna talk more specifically about our our cta stops and some of our uh transit agencies within the cta uh ecosphere of transportation sure thank you it's a great question and and as has been referred to already this evening this um this asap me which is really as soon as possible uh is a bill uh that's intended to do things more quickly uh and and cta's got a a plan that we've written that is our own asap plan that will will put all of our rail stations into accessibility within 20 years uh according to our senator uh senator duckworth that's not soon enough and that's why she sponsored on the senate side uh what what the congresswoman sponsored on the house side to to speed that up and that's the intention of this is to put some money in the pipeline to speed uh accessibility improvements throughout the system that will help not only cta but will also help metra in its work as well and i think what you're talking about there in in beverly is is going to be a metro station uh that that will will be on the list for metra to try to help reach accessibility i know they've got a couple underway right now within the city of chicago and they're doing some in the suburbs and in cook county as well um so those those stations are are tough to to approach some of these rail lines have been in existence for 100 or 110 years um and so the stations were built when horses and buggies would pull up to the stations uh they didn't anticipate people in wheelchairs getting in and out of these stations um that is a a challenge for for everybody but but i think you'll see some some steps made and some some achievement uh in the early years of accessibility for for all of the transportation options if i could add to that since you know in addition to the train stations themselves what you're doing partnering with the cta is really looking at how you get to that train station making sure that the sidewalks are are in good shape that we have ada compliant ramps so we've been doing a lot of work making all of our polling places ada compliant we've done over 500 locations across the city that's schools it's libraries those are the you know public places that you go so we're really again working i think eventually hand in glove here so as the cta is making stations accessible we're looking at all the ways that we can make the area in and around it accessible easy to get to and so it will be a much bigger footprint of accessibility uh than we've seen before well thank you both for um uh giving us some extra information around that and um to be clear that the uh the fund for the um the asap act which would create uh greater accessibility and make it it requires that every transit station that is currently not accessible uh be accessible within the next four years with this four uh four billion dollar fund so i i just want to be clear on that that it is happening and um i know that um it is by need so these are um high need areas with high traffic areas so mary i i would say um that we'll know more about how quickly your specific station is going to be affected um within the next um three to six months um so we're going to keep an eye on that for you and mark that um but right now it it is um it is a high priority for those stations that are lacking it right now and i'll hand it back to ian for our next question thank you congresswoman and i'll remind folks that we are going to do some more survey questions we'll have another one after josh in countryside up next and josh is asking who is going to be doing the work as far as will these be state federal jobs union jobs or any contractor and a second question where on the priority list is the public transit updates for south and west side chicago a couple of questions from josh and countryside sure um we thank you for asking that and so the the first part of your question to address that very directly in the bill in the infrastructure act it requires that city uh state state and federal organizations that are putting the projects together use union certified folks on the job so i just want to be clear on that there is also a prevailing wage requirement that everybody gets paid competitively on any of these iija projects so just to be clear the second part of your question um where is the priority list of public transit updates for um south and west side of chicago um that will be available soon what we do know is that um we are a little bit lucky and that we need things a little bit more than the north side does sorry north side but um so ours are in more of in the priority zone we will publish that list on josh in the coming months as soon as i get my hot little hands on it we will publish that on my website and then i'm going to hand it right back to ian again to ask the next question perfect appreciate you taking on both those questions from josh uh we will go to another survey question real quick here then we've got sheila up next uh our next question is going to go like this we want to know do you support the bipartisan infrastructure law and the investments it will bring to the southwest side and suburbs press one for yes two for no three if you're undecided again do you support the bipartisan infrastructure law and the investments it will bring to the southwest side and suburbs press one for yes two for no and three if you're still undecided let's get back to some questions lots of great questions still in line here sheila in chicago asked what is your vision for correcting the trains that disturbed the traffic on the southwest side that one's from sheila right um i'm going to start with that but i might call on my experts as well so let me tell you what we did as early as last um about a year ago i got together with our colleagues um uh alderman shea and um and state rep hurley and uh state senator uh bill cunningham um and a few other folks um that are in the footprint of the southwest side electeds as well as some county folks and we sat down with um csx uh train carrier um as well as some of the beltway folks and talked through what the problem was because sheila what you're referring to is likely that we were seeing two hour delays um on the southwest side which was um astronomical um and it was doing two things it was a safety hazard right is that you couldn't get to a hospital so first responders couldn't get to the hospital uh fire police couldn't get to emergencies it was uh it was very scary there for a while we got together um with what they call cyroc which is our safety organization um coalition here in the chicago area as well as the train carrier on our electeds uh as well as some of uh the create folks and what we did is we developed a new uh traffic traffic prioritization model for the train systems how they signal and how they inform emergency management so on the southwest side already we've seen a 50 reduction in the amount of train delays it is not over and i want to be clear on that i know that there are still some areas that are clogged up and see sitting what we have required the various carriers to do is to not idle in an intersection and we do know that is happening now now we do have um overly long trains right now which is another issue that we're working on with the carriers but we have seen a reduction um in times in terms of um the um traffic intersections being clogged up by about 50 percent um and then if if um mike if you have any other um cta train um or um bus uh intersection issues that you want to speak to go right ahead well i was just going to mention it it's a difficult situation as well for our bus operations uh and we have procedures in place you know where the detours would go and if you're blocked by a train what do you do and kind of thing but but i will say that that uh commissioner biagi is also well versed in in solutions uh for train uh automobile traffic with the create program and i don't know if you want to speak to that yeah please do yeah i'd be happy to and when we say create you know this is this very unusual partnership that we have across all of the rail lines in this that runs through the city of chicago and the region no other region in the country has this level of partnership where it's all of the major rails plus your amtrak's and your metro that all get in the room with uh super tank kiln and myself and secretary osmond and we bring in the cta if we need to but really sorting through how do we make sure that we have two things happen one that we got we got to get goods and services in and through the city but we have to have a great quality of life in our city right and so our job is to help balance those two things so are a huge part of our prioritization in this create program which i should say it's a 4.6 billion dollar program they're about 70 plus projects in queue we've done about 30 of those projects uh we are continuing to move along and really the infrastructure bill helps us take great leaps forward again to continuous program so what's in it there is a lot that's in it that's great for neighborhoods and something we call grade separation that's what we're getting at which is how can we lower the road raise the rail figure out a way so there's no impact really that the trains can go through and the vehicles and bikes and pedestrians and neighborhoods get reconnected that those are all going through and so we have a number of projects in queue and you know and superintendent kill it also is extremely well versed in this too um but you know we have projects on the southwest side you know i know we've got a grade separation project um with a couple with belt railroad we've got one on archer we've got another uh columbus we've got another one with the upp the up union pacific railroad we've got a giant project uh that we're all fans of on 75th street which is you know it's it's the corridor improvement project it's the most congested um point for rail in in the entire region and that means it's in the entire united states we're that important um and so we're taking that on uh and so these are projects that are front of mind they are you know they take a little while because it's a lot of work when you're trying to figure out how to move things like a rail line um and moving roads through elevation but it's also making sure that we hear from communities and get it right so what we're building back uh is a community that that is it's doing more than just moving but that is a great place and so that that does take a little bit of time um but we're actually hustling we just had it you know i'm looking at uh superintendent kill and we just had a lot of calls right around the holidays um to work with our real partners and hustle after grant we're already putting requests into the pipeline and because we've been doing the design working community conversations we're going to see things pop out very fast on that so thank you in advance for your patience we hear you and we're working on it we're definitely working on we we should say that um and i like to be a hundred uh percent transparent about these projects is that um they will take time and you're gonna see a lot of activity so actually temporarily in some spots it's going to be a little bit rough for periods of time when we're doing these things but no one of the things and i think uh commissioner biaggi said it really well is that when we're developing these huge projects where we're creating an overpass so that traffic can flow better under and the train can get across without creating congestion or blockages those are huge projects because what happens is that imagine you're telling um about 700 homes in one area that hey we're going to be you know doing these this type of situation for the next two years tell a bunch of businesses that and then reroute traffic it is a huge undertaking so um please be patient because your world's going to be a lot better but there's going to be you know periods of a couple months at a time where it's going to be a little bit rough uh with traffic rerouting i'll i'll kick it back to ian for the next question thank you i appreciate that question from sheila excellent question thanks so much let's jump right to our next one coming from mike who's asking uh he asked how much will taxes be raised to pay for this bill and mike just gave us his zip code as 64. 60458 can you take that one on police congresswoman sure happy to do that not one penny that's the good news is that we did a a lot of analysis on the transportation infrastructure committee and realized that we had some unused funds from the last rescue package um as well as our five-year package which is called invest in america um and then some additional funding which all came to 1.2 trillion so we we took um money from existing packages so therefore it allowed us allowed us to not use any additional tax money to implement this it's money that is existing and we can just go to the next question if you'd like everything all right appreciate it and i'm gonna run a quick poll here then we've got jackie up in melrose park after that our third survey question for you is this how do you typically travel to work press one if you own your own vehicle press two if you use public trains cta metra et cetera press three if you use the public bus cta pace etc press four if you use a bicycle press five if you walk again how do you typically travel to work press one if you own a vehicle press two if it's public trains three for public bus for if you bike and five if you walk thanks again really appreciate that feedback folks let's go to jackie and melrose park as promised asking will any of the funds be allocate will any of the funds allocated be used for putting in new rails or just to improve the existing lines great question jackie congresswoman who can we go to for that one um you know what i think i'll start it and then i might kick it to sis and someone else so um so the new rail lines interestingly enough um wherever again we have a fix at first mentality so we're gonna fix the rail lines that are in the greatest jeopardy um so that they're safe and and they create um a smoother flow of traffic there will be some new uh rail lines put in as a part of this overall improvement process so i'm going to send it to over to my friend sis for any projects she knows specifically where there is new or existing in the district yes so thank you very much for that for that question congresswoman so i want to refer back to the program we were speaking of earlier create so this is that large you know private public partnership and you hear you know the gates are down too long you know what's happening this program in addition to creating great separation so taking that you know the roadway over or under the rail you know we are also looking at project locations where we can add you know a third line a second line adding in new switches and signals so a big part of the create product the crate program is also building in those efficiencies so trains can travel not at 15 miles an hour but at 30 miles an hour so that's going to reduce that gained gate downtime we are looking at those on project by project basis and the large project that commissioner biaggi referred to the 75th street corridor improvement project we have a lot of new rails going in on that line we refer to it as is the spaghetti bowl of the rail network and that is for the nation so we're straightening out we're adding in new rail lines so that we don't have you know that crisscross and intersection and things operating like a stoplight so we're creating those efficiencies you know with this program but i think to answer that question specifically jackie you know we are looking at each of the problematic locations determining what is the appropriate solution to address the problem at hand and we're looking not only at the problem at that location but really stepping back and looking at that thirty thousand foot elevation that what do we need for the region because chicago is the freight hub of not just this region the state but for the entire nation that's exactly right i mean we it's very interesting here in illinois three we have the unusual um situation where literally about uh 25 of all trains go through our specific uh district every single day and what that that means is that we are literally the aorta of trains in the nation so um it it is very complex i i will go ahead and hand it back over to ian for the next question yeah thank you congresswoman thank you superintendent and another great question thank you to jackie let's get this one in here a quick reminder folks if you wanted to get email updates from the congresswoman's office i'll do a last call here you can press seven on your phone give your email to an operator and we'll make sure we keep you updated on the issues that affect you in the third congressional district moving forward so again seven if you have any email addresses you'd like to give us for updates next one is this can the cook county rep speak to any projects that will affect our highways this one's from alice good so i'm going to start out and then i am going to hand it over to my three colleagues here um so um we do do know in the line of fix it first that um the eisenhower will receive some funding and some project prioritization um but it doesn't mean that the stevenson um the tri-state and the kennedy are not going to receive money as well because the the monies are distributed in a very specific way there's the fix it first um group and then they're prioritized and then there are competitive grants attached to on the monies attached to the iija and so um the short answer is is the probably the first one out of the gate is going to be the eisenhower but that doesn't mean that the other expressways will not receive money i i think i'll i'll give it to uh commissioner biaggi to take a shot at that and our other two colleagues want to as well now thank you for that and i think that that is right you know in the uh the trillion plus bill um there are some new programs and there are some programs that have existed and so we know how to go after them um but in terms of sort of these signature projects like like the eisenhower that's one that as the congressman mentioned that we're looking very closely at i think part of the challenge with these products is we want to make sure that we're doing things like investing in the blue line right that runs along it and that's something that we'll work with cta on and that we're also connecting neighborhoods you know historically of course the expressway systems were put in and maybe there wasn't a ton of thought about what happened to the neighborhoods in and around them and so this is a really a significant opportunity to think about that how do we connect across the expressways how do we make these edges next to communities um really work it's kind of like the great separation projects i was talking about right this is an opportunity to make those corrections and make the quality of life uh quite a bit better um and so you know we're looking at that we're also we work closely um with idot you know we actually maintain all of the bridges over the expressway system in the city of chicago um and i mentioned those are part of those 400 bridge and viaduct structures that we manage and so part of the investment will be in in the bridge structures um that are needed and those are also those can be giant projects if anyone experienced the montrose bridge replacement project which was just massive um those are the kinds of projects that take a lot of planning a lot of design but the funding is there to help make it happen we look at what happened in pittsburgh right uh when president biden went uh in advance to talk about infrastructure and the bridge in pittsburgh collapsed um that was ranked i think a four which is not good we have bridges in the same condition that we need to get at and so as part of that expressway investment we'll be investing in these bridges to shore them up and the state will be doing a lot to do expressway improvements and so i'll pass to my colleagues who may want to weigh in as well sister mike jump in if you have some uh comments around our highways yeah i would echo everything that you had said congresswoman and what commissioner biaggi has said is that we are looking for those opportunities repairing bridges and i think as we're thinking about improvements to the the um highway system or expressway system you know we're also cognizant to make sure that we're taking care of those local street connections in addition to that so i think that's the great partnership that you do see time and time again with the agencies in this region it's not just what we need to do but what we should be doing to make sure that these are comprehensive solutions to transportation challenges in the region and all i would add to that is something that the congresswoman has already said the rules the rule making for most of this additional funding hasn't been written yet or is being written right now and so we all have lists of which bridges uh need to work the first and we all have bridges that we know want to be we want to have addressed and be done we don't know exactly what the the direction of the of the funding will be and and the congresswoman mentioned we'll know very shortly here four to six months we'll have a detailed list of all of the projects lined up because we'll know what the rules are for the distribution of the funding right now it's been mentioned worst first but there's a lot of worst in the in here a lot of worst in in your district as well as in the city of chicago and within county so we have a lot of things that we need to pay attention to until we get that final detailed rule making that's going to come out we really can't line up the specifics of any projects yet so agree ian if you want to take the next question sure thing we'll do all right we've got catherine up next i wanted to read the results of our last polling question though we asked you how do you typically travel to work 69 said their own vehicle 22 public trains six percent public bus and two percent of peeps a peace to bicycling and walking not as popular in the winter of course thanks everybody for voting let's go to catherine in beverly who asks can you and the cta representative uh talk about expanding the red line on the south side that's again catherine in beverly well thank you for your question before i answer that catherine i do want to make a pitch for uh our transit agencies so um as as many of you know i am a huge fan of our transit agencies because it actually helps reduce our emission footprint our goal as a country is to reduce emissions in this country by 50 percent our very best shot at doing that is if more people get on trains and use mass transit it automatically um brings our emissions down in a very significant way um exponentially so i'm asking everybody to really think about that by the way you can read on the train you can read on the bus there's lots of good things you can do and you can be very time effective which is why i like using them whenever possible uh but i encourage everybody to get on mass transit and use our wonderful uh transit agencies because they're gonna get better because we're gonna give them some money to make it better so um i'll answer catherine's question though about the red line um that is being looked at i'm going to send that right over to mike to give you a little bit of more color on that sure enough congresswoman and and the the red lion extension on the south side um is is in its uh pre-engineering phase uh we're hoping to actually enter the engineering phase late in 2022 so later on this calendar year um that that is a uh almost a six mile 5.8 mile extension of the red line south from 95th street all the way down to 130th street it actually is just south of 130th street right in 132nd 133rd street um that will add four stations uh to to that line uh and connect it to the rest of the red line the rest of our system there it's an area uh the really the only area in the city of chicago where the rail lines don't go to the edge of the city is that far south side and so that is in the works and we're looking forward to uh the money coming in this bill to help fill out the the very large budget that will be needed to to make that project happen uh and and it's it's it's in the works uh and it's something that we've probably made more progress on in the last three years uh than we have made in in the 15 years before that so we've actually taken this project out shaking the dust off of it said it's on its feet and and moved it forward it'll be walking on its own we hope fairly soon um and and we're we're excited about this opportunity to use this funding from this bill to fill in the federal portion that's needed to build this rail line extension great i'll throw it back to ian it looks like we have maybe a couple of final poll results yep we've got the results of our second poll we ask do you support the bipartisan infrastructure law and the investments it will bring to the south side in the suburbs 74 percent of you said yes 16 no and 10 percent were undecided again really appreciate everybody voting in those surveys and uh congresswoman we're just about out of time here so i'd like to turn it back over to you to offer any final thoughts and then for anybody who needs additional assistance from your office i'll take care of that at the very end here so back to you well thank you so much well thank you everybody for attending great questions tonight i think that um we achieved our goal is to make this specific to the district and to the region so that you can understand in a very tangible way how this infrastructure bill which actually is transformative to our nation it is the single largest investment our country has made ever in transit agencies across this nation so it is really significant and it's it's uh historical in nature so uh thank you all for joining tonight and thank you to my great guests gia biaggi mike connolly and sis killen always enjoyed working with you and so good to see you um and i just want to tell everybody again um our transportation and infrastructure structure competitiveness competitiveness say that uh three times fast is how this country is known uh we are going to be a global leader again in that area so um i appreciate everybody in our district uh being a good user of transportation but also being a believer in transportation so with that um i will thank everybody for attending tonight and then ian if you have any uh closing uh details you need to share yeah and thank you congresswoman for organizing our panel tonight and for putting together this form we appreciate you and uh for folks who still need assistance from the congresswoman's office you can find more information on the work she does at newman.house.gov if you need to

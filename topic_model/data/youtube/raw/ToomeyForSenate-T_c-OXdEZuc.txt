minus T plasmid welcome back were joined this morning by Republican candidate for Senate Pat Toomey hung up Ben Bernanke the Senate reconfirmed him is right that chair this past week you didn't like that meeting think it was a good idea you know it was a tough call for me but no I thought that the Senate should have voted no and here's why I think it's very clear that the Fed made a big policy error earlier in this decade specifically in 2003 and 2004 when they kept interest rates extremely low for an extended period of time despite the bank doing a strong economic growth they created the credit bubble which led to the real estate bubble which famously collapse if it basically they should have sent a signal that if you mess up like that you shouldn't be rewarded well now so so the next question is right is that an unforgivable sin in and of itself and I would say not necessarily but here's the problem Chairman Bernanke refuses to acknowledge that the Fed played any meaningful role at all in creating this credit bubble I think that's wouldn't it well I'm not sure I think there are a lot of qualifying capable people that we ought to consider but wider anybody I yeah nobody that that that part that the flip side of the coin people were saying well what kind of know we have issues with a guy it could be worse if we put someone in there that the Wall Street doesn't like well you know the criteria shouldn't be who does Wall Street like the criteria should be who understands the role of the Fed the importance of preserving the value of the dollar and my concern with the Chairman Bernanke is despite he's a very capable very intelligent man but if you're not willing to acknowledge a very profound mistake that was made earlier in this decade how should we be confident that he wouldn't make the same mistake again did you vote to repeal quest Steagall yes yes you've just been in for your first year I think we're somewhere around there when that came up some people look at this crisis and they say yes to what you just said that the interest rates were kept too low but they also think that it was a mistake to let banks get further into investing and it could that created a lot of these issues yeah the problem is with that theory is that there's nothing at all about the repeal of glass-steagall that allowed banks to do any the activities that caused his problem that the problems were clearly very heavily concentrated in residential real estate specifically subprime was the the big driving problem banks were doing that long before we repealed glass-steagall and it had nothing repealing glass-steagall during family had not agreed that Fannie and Freddie were big big culprits and Congress played a big role Congress deserves a lot of blame here because Congress was passing laws and forcing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make subprime loans to make loans with with lacks credit standards because they had an understandable and admirable goal of helping more people become homeowners but they pushed it so hard that they ended up forcing institutions like fannie and freddie to make billions of loans to people who really were not able to pay them back right so let me just get back to the electorate then that looks at everything you just said and you look at 2006 2008 and now the brown victory and you say the public is trying to send signals that they want they're narrowing the parameters here and if you don't go there don't go there do this do that and some people will say hey Arlen Specter might be the right guy for that and for example the National Journal says that his voting record no way he was conservative 57% at the time on the economy sixty percent of the time on foreign policy forty-seven percent of the time on social issues sounds like he's doggone down the middle until he discovered that he had a democratic primary challenge and now he's become one of the most left-wing senators and the body the problem with Senator Specter is I think he's made it pretty clear especially in recent years the only principle that's really important to him as his own reelection he left the Republican Party because he couldn't win a primary he pretty much admitted that and then he insisted he would be independent and he wouldn't just be an automatic 60th vote for the Democrats until he got a primary challenge and then he said in a democratic caucus I came here to be the 60th vote the problem the other problem for Senator Specter is is just on the wrong side of so many of the important issues he supported all the bailouts he supported the big stimulus bill he supports cap-and-trade he supports tonight denying workers a secret ballot when they vote on elections this is he supported a big government takeover of health care this isn't where most pennsylvanians are what was your take on the flap that he had with a republican michele bachmann the congresswoman for telling her to act like a lady in a recent therapy you know a jesse apologize for yeah i know he did apologize and that that's fair enough he made his apology but i have to say it did sound like somebody who's a little bit out of touch I mean that's it strikes it struck me as a patronizing attitude towards towards congressman would like of this statement state Democratic Party Chairman TJ brunet said of Arlen Specter the spectra would have a better chance of winning in November than Joe Sestak the cuz Specter would be quote this is TJ Rooney's words more true to our base in hope it sounds like you think TJ really doesn't know what his basic well you know you'd think he's what the chairman of the state party he ought to know his base better than I know his base but it's hard to see how senator Specter who's been on both sides of so many issues and was a Republican for 40 years what has he been truer to the base event as of late he's been voting the same way as Joe Sestak would you when it comes to spending you know we're entitlement is about twenty eight percent of the budget in the early 90s it's about thirty eight percent now would you cut entitlements would you go in there and say we're going to or just slow down you can't just go in and cut entitlements because entitlements are the big ones or social security and medicare and they constitute a you know an intergenerational promise you have people who paid into a system their whole working life with the promise that they get certain benefits so you can't pull the rug out from anybody who's currently in the program or close to it but i do think we need to reform it for younger people i want to follow up on how the moment NBC titted issue continues with that too late right at this

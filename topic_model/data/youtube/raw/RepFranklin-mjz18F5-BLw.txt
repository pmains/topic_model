thank you mr chairman and to follow up on a little on the undersea warfare and and seabed warfare question and also along with um ranking member kelly's uh questions before regarding the budget i see um you know in the unfunded priorities there are some of those that touch into that area um and i'd love to hear some more probably in a different forum about some of the uh the capabilities that you're working on from the r d side but uh you know in looking at the cut that you received this year we could fund all of those unfunded priorities with less than what the cuts have been to your budget which and i understand we can we can maintain the op tempo we can get the job done and that's that's what you all are called to do and we'll always do but do you have concern that if this persists will you be able to fund going forward the r d necessary to shift from the ct mission in the middle east towards a great power competition i'll i'll take a stab at it and turn over mr mcmenamin i i do believe with this year that we were able to adjust accordingly and prioritize and and for that unfunded requirement list if we had more money that's where we would go to uh and that's their priorities that prioritize in that manner but i but for future years we've got to continue to look at what those priorities are mr mcmahon yeah i would say as we all know technology moves a lot faster many times than than the budgets in the budget planning process does um you know general clark made the choices to prioritize i think as we go forward working within the president's budget we look at some of these requirements and continue to to identify those investments that have the greatest promise to the socom enterprise whether that's in isr human performance uh ai machine learning to prioritize those that can increase the effectiveness of socom and the soft operators more than others that that may be on the list sometimes okay general regarding softworks you've mentioned that in your testimony and again kind of piggybacking on the thought of um you know the responsiveness that technology's changing quickly this is a program i think other services are envious of the special operations ability to act on technology quickly and get them fielded out there the the work the ability to interact with the the small business innovation research pilot program i think has been helpful i've gotten very good feedback from small businesses that have wanted to to be more involved in the acquisition process seems like it's been a great success that's uh that authorization is expiring this year we're looking to not only continue that but expand it could you elaborate or comment some on what that means from your end and what you'd like to see from it going forward yes sir a couple points you you highlighted softworks you know which is our off-campus uh what i call incubator of ideas where folks without security clearances to come in work with our operators and it is it is a magnificent capability for us it's enabled by the small business initiative and we really appreciate congress's support to that and would look would ask for your support and continue to grow that small business capability because it is giving us ideas because a lot of the good ideas a lot of the great ideas are really coming from those small businesses that we can tap into very quickly because we we very you know what i think we do better than anyone else is ty our operator who knows what the the specific requirements and right to the industry partners and work that together so we come up with the best product thank you that's really all the questions i had i did want to take the opportunity though to thank you general on behalf of the subcommittee here for your and your staff's hospitality a few months back down at mcdill i haven't spent a lot of time on the base i still learned a lot and there's nothing like the firsthand opportunity to see it but thank you all for that and mr chairman i yield back

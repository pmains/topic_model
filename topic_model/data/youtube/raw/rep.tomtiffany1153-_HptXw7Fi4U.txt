the reality is the cartels control the border sheriff mark lamb of penal county arizona knows this he sees it firsthand every day he just gave republican congressman from wisconsin tom tiffany a guided tour of the border chaos the both of them join me now live from the border in stanfield arizona sheriff congressman great to have you both on the program congressman let me start with you first here um you surprised at what you saw down there mark lam's a pretty good tour guide i've seen him in action before um you surprised nobody better to see southern arizona on the border than sheriff lamb i was down here two years ago and there was progress that was being made on the southern border it is all gone now we were just touring out in the desert here in arizona this afternoon and it is a mess the what i believe is the biggest human trafficking operation in the history of the modern world is going on right now all right so um sheriff it's good to see you my friend um you heard the story about the cartels do the cartels control the border right now the 70 million number we're hearing is that legit 100 percent it's probably even more than that you've got to figure they're charging here in arizona five to six thousand dollars for everybody that comes across the border and last month alone they apprehended over 217 000 people plus they had 66 000 got aways those are the ones we know about and that's cash that the cartels are making so absolutely those numbers are probably uh that legit if not more legit than that and this is why it's such an issue to us grant and that's why every chance i get i talk about this i saw a poll the other day that talked about joe biden's disapproval ratings and it had a whole different a bunch of different things like inflation and all this stuff one of them was immigration what i don't like about that is that misleads the american public because this is not about immigration anymore what they should be asking is if you approve of human trafficking and drug trafficking into america yeah yeah we know that the victims in all of this really are those people that are being trafficked across the border and those risking their lives to get here it's not an easy it's not an easy trek but with an open border uh it certainly is drawing them in i'm congressman i want to play a sound bite from beth o'rourke he's running for governor as a democrat in texas this is him talking about ending title 42. i think it's time to end title 42 i don't think we should have ever implemented it it's a very cynical reading of u.s law congressman is it a cynical reading of u.s law thing that is preventing a completely open border january 20th 2021 joe biden opened up our border to anybody that wants to come from throughout the world title 42 was the only thing holding people's people back at this point o'rourke then talk about alternative he says let's have it go away let's talk about alternatives because that's what we're doing those of us republicans on the house judiciary committee we want solutions to this he obviously does not yeah um you know sheriff you talk about the victims being many of those being trafficked across the border the other victims of this the american people you and i have talked about the fentanyl problem here um what is the common scene or the common call you get when you get a call for someone that has overdosed well graham first of all i like to think of it as poisonings because when a 15 year old takes one pill and dies from it that's not an overdose that's a poisoning when a cocaine addict dies because the cartel put fentanyl in that cocaine that's a poisoning when a baby dies because the parents were using fentanyl got the poison we need to start calling it for what it is here in america these are poisonings in the cartel are poisoning american civilian lives to the tune of over 100 000 people a year when are americans going to wake up to what the real reality of this situation here is on the southern border we know where these drugs are coming from yet our federal government and the media continue to turn a blind eye to it well not you grant i appreciate you talking about it but you know the mainstream media they don't want to talk about that i know exactly who you're talking about sheriff and uh we'll be holding them accountable too congressman last question for you do you wish kamala harris your other fellow democrats in congress would come down and take a tour i know sheriff mark lamb would give them a tour as well what's your message to them congressman mayor klamath that has offered tours they can come down anytime it is a failure of the biden administration why don't they come down here because they know what they will see the disaster that is the biggest human trafficking operation in the history of the modern world with the drugs the sex trafficking and all the rest they don't want to see it and confront zero democrat showed up it's it's unbelievable to me that she's supposed to be our borders are and she still hasn't made a trip down there sheriff mark lam thank you it's always great to see you congressman tom tiffany i appreciate you making time for us and even headed down to the border from wisconsin this is uh every state and every city in america is now a border town and a border state unfortunately thanks to joe biden gentlemen thank you every state is a border state absolutely see you guys

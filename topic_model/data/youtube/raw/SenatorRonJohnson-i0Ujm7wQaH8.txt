ron johnson senator johnson thanks uh it's good to see you this morning so i just want to specifically understand uh what your objection is is to this it could be that it's just such a big number to saddle our children with that you don't want to do it or it could be that it's going to people that you know haven't been as impacted it's not targeted enough to the right people let's say there was a way to get that 2000 just to the people that were really in need would you be for it at that point or you just are going to be against it because of adding to the deficit no matter what no you just explained the reasons it's not targeted it's add another 464 billion dollars onto our already enormous debt that's out of control and unsustainable and so the fact that we've had nine months to take a look at what happened with the last stimulus checks by the way about 18 percent of that was spent on on essential items the rest was spent on either non-essential item items or paying off debt or additional savings so it certainly wasn't stimulative i certainly want to help people that are in that are financially struggling through no follow their own because of kovid it's one of the reasons i voted for the 2.2 trillion dollar cares act um we've we've now appropriated we've authorized about four trillion dollars of aid but we did a shotgun approach and we don't have unlimited checking account we're 27.5 trillion dollars in debt by the end of this fiscal year will be over 29 trillion dollars and i keep hearing two thousand dollar checks if you have a family of four it'll be an eight thousand dollar check family five ten thousand dollar check and many many many of those individuals have been working they're getting a paycheck they're not financially struggling why would we be giving checks to people that truly don't need it so again we should have gone back to the drawing board we should have really targeted this relief by the way people are already going to get a family four is going to get 2 400 in the in the relief bill that was just passed was a 900 billion dollar relief package so it's again it's just the the lack of targeting the lack of thoughtful consideration given to mortgaging our children's future by another 464 billion dollars i know it sounds good it feels good to give away money everybody loves benefits somebody's got to be thinking about how you know the effect of this on our future generations yeah the the case has been made that we need to leave the fed uh politicians policy makers need to do more and not necessarily worry as much about whether it gets exactly where it needs to go but just sort of as you said use the shotgun approach is it better to err on the side of frugality when some people will not be helped or would it be better to maybe worry about this you know we're hearing a lot of that let's worry about this later we can run deficits well again people already will get six hundred dollar checks individually twenty four hundred dollars for a family for if you're unemployed you get a three hundred dollar plus up to your state unemployment benefits so there's a lot of targeted relief we're throwing 300 billion dollars into ppp loans so those businesses can keep people employed so we're throwing a lot of money at the problem and not paying any attention whatsoever to the mounting debt that is simply unsustainable um the journal's been really sort of uh angry at i don't know whether you can call op-ed people angry but they don't like the president's move here they think that it might be sabotaging what happens down in in georgia with uh with the way that it's played out what are your feelings on on you know whether the president has actually hurt hurt the republican senator's reelection chances down there or what what exactly is going on and i've heard rumors that you've you've said some things that you feel like you're in a tough spot both defending the president but but maybe when when there's times where you don't think it's necessarily the right thing to be doing i don't know whether those reports were true but just give me a they weren't they weren't true no it was a phone call i made to somebody there's an anti-trumper and had a 30-minute argument and then the guy writes an article about it i wouldn't believe a word he said so anyway the bottom line is the politics this is kind of hard to sort out uh from my standpoint we absolutely have to win those two georgia senate seats or what democrats would do with the united states senate they'll change it forever they'll get rid of the filibuster which means they'll pass every bill on bernie sanders and aoc's wish list they'll they'll pack the supreme court uh they'll pack the circuit courts they'll pack the u.s senate they'll turn dc and puerto rico into states pretty well assuring four more democrat senators i mean they will change every rule they will violate every norm every precedent to make sure they'll always maintain power i think it's a very dangerous step that we would be taking if we lose those senate seats and chuck schumer becomes a next majority leader you work with joe manchin right yes i do when he says he's not going to go for those some of those uh more radical ideas do you take him at his word or do you think he's you think if he had enough pressure from his party that because a lot of people some people even say the stock market is taking solace in some of his comments because they think the worst case scenario is taken off the table the pressure would be enormous i don't think people can even begin to understand the pressure on joe manchin if he were the holdout at eliminating the filibuster and preventing the green new deal being passed so you know he may mean it i'm not sure he could withstand the pressure quite honestly i don't think that's for example it's it's it's not it's not worth taking the chance let's put it that way trump won west virginia by like 800 points how could manchin after making that promise how could he go back to his constituents at that point well it's not just about getting reelected it's just the viciousness that it's just it's about the viciousness that and the threats that come in our in in modern day politics it's incredibly unfortunate it's one of the problems that uh i've certainly perceived one of the reasons i held a a hearing on election irregularities it's an unsustainable state of affairs where you have such a large majority of the american population for first for the last four years not agreeing that the 2016 result was legitimate now you've got on the other side tens of millions of people not believing this election result was legitimate our our politics are poisonous today it's in it's just an unsustainable state of affairs hey senator um senator halley has said that he is going to object to the certification of the electoral college votes next week at least in some states at that point you as a senator will be required to go through the debate for a couple of hours and and then vote on whether you think all 50 states electoral college votes should be certified how will you vote well first of all this is done on a state-by-state basis as i keep trying to tell people you know there's a lot of misinformation on both sides that some people on our side think that if just one house member one senator ejects it immediately goes to a vote of the states and then because we have more states in in the house of representatives trump can get reelected that's not what happens what happens is every member the senate every member of the house votes to to either accept or reject that state's slate of electors i i can't imagine any scenario in which any house democrats will vote to reject joe biden electors so i think the result is inevitable but i don't have a problem as i demonstrated in holding a hearing on the irregularities of the 2020 election of examining those discussing them i actually support what leader mcconnell suggested as a commission set up to examine this this issue is not going away there are irregularities that have not been explained i i don't i don't fear information i know a lot of people say oh this is dangerous it's not dangerous to take a look at problems that did occur the lack of transparency in too many places the lack of an audit trail we need to examine this and hopefully set new rules or pass new laws to correct this for the next election this is an unsustainable state of affairs in the body politic looking at things and deciding to change it for the next election is one thing but my question was would you vote no on any state to not certify their electoral college results for this election well one of the things i've been trying to do since i announced my hearing three weeks ago is we've been looking at all these irregularities we've we've explained many uh we haven't explained others and so i don't know what new evidence is going to be uh you know coming up between now and the sixth i have a hard time believing that there's going to be something earth-shattering people have been looking at this but you know it completely depends on which states and what the issues are in in terms of what is being objected to senator if um go ahead back you want to get him to say something go ahead i i was going to say well i just i i guess it's it's a maybe i mean you'll you'll see if there's anything that comes up between now and then and then you'll decide if you vote to certify the electoral college on a state-by-state basis again on a state-by-state basis in terms of what the issues and there are some real serious issues in states like pennsylvania uh where you know apparently the voter rolls are not being reported by the counties ten ten weeks later a lack of transparency there are there are other issues that i simply can't get to the bottom of and we've been looking into this very you know you know we've really been looking into this it's hard to get to the bottom of it there's a lack of transparency and that's what's so frustrating to people at least on the conservative side trump supporters they're not getting the answers they've completely lost confidence in the mainstream media the social media the the incredible bias and so there's this feeling that this election was stolen that it's not fair that there's all kinds of fraud and by the way kris krebs testified in our hearing you know said his most secure election but admitted in our hearing he was only talking about cyber attacks he wasn't talking about fraud and of course that was all that his comments were taken as this is a clean election it wasn't a totally clean election let's be honest about this and let's not be afraid of gathering information and and making things right so senator if it is uh just just as a uh uh as just to posit this if if it were to be a divided government uh would you at that point expect republicans and democrats to to start horse trading maybe get republicans want to extend the tax cuts democrats want infrastructure do you think it could work at that point or it sounds like you don't want to spend any more money on anything if if you don't have to what about infrastructure well we've just witnessed four trillion dollars of bipartisan cooperation i i don't think we had to allocate and authorize four trillion dollars to to address the covert crisis uh we need to spend some which is why i supported 2.2 trillion dollars that we did fast we did it massively so that markets wouldn't collapse i mean we had to do that i don't think even at that point time it had to be 2.2 trillion dollars but we just had to lard out another 900 billion dollars now people are talking about another 464 billion dollars like this monopoly money it's not this this this is a mortgaging of our children's future there is going to be a point in time when we had it have a debt crisis and it is not going to be pretty but here in washington dc it's like nobody cares you know i came here in 2011 our debt was 14 trillion dollars now it's it's basically doubled and there's no end in sight somebody has to be concerned about this we ought to be worried about it we ought to be husbanding our resources and when we do spend money and we when we deficit spend we better do that quite carefully and nobody is right now it's a very sad state of affairs we're going to talk to section 230 a little bit later just switching topics again do you what do you think we we should do that's part of this obviously leader mcconnell put it into the calculus of this latest negotiation for the two thousand dollars but do you think next year something happens with that will that be bipartisan yeah the social media companies have masked way too much power and the section 230 really my mind has two parts one needs to be retained and that's you know giving them liability protection from people that upload data onto their platforms by the way i think they do a pretty good job of of censoring like isis uh snuff videos and those types of things and we should let them do that but the other part of that is their social or their moderation policies and basically their censorship that they need to be complete completely transparent in terms of what their policies are on censorship and if they don't follow those policies they ought to be sued so that's the section 230 liability protection that i would remove on their censorship on their moderation policies but you need to separate in two things and retain the the liability protection for people uploading on their platforms senator thanks for the all the time this morning um happy new year yeah happy new year let's let's hope 2021's a lot better than 2020 yes yes we do and we hope we see you uh maybe uh in in january um we'll keep you don't make a lot of outgoing calls take care all right thanks see ya

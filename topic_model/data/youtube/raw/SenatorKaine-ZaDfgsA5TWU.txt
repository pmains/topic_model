mr. president I rise to object in the strongest possible terms to president Trump's continued raid on the budget of the United States military the president promised the American public as a candidate that he would build a border wall with Mexico and that Mexico would pay for any wall that he would build the president has broken his promise and it shocks me that as commander-in-chief he now insists that it's got to be our troops and our military families and our nation's security that have to be sacrificed for his foolishness frankly it shocks me even more that Republican colleagues in this body seem perfectly willing to let him do that if you won't stand up for the men and women in our military who we stand up for if you won't stand up for important projects in your own state who will you stand up for if you won't stand up to protect your defense authorization bill or your defense appropriations bill from being cannibalized when will you stand up we will have a vote soon to block the president's destructive efforts to weaken our military and trample on the power of Congress to set the nation's budget and appropriations levels and I'm hoping that my colleagues Democratic and Republican will stand up letti first address the need for a secure border I've called the president's insistence on using military monies to build the wall foolishness what do I mean by this I don't challenge the need for border security I strongly supported a comprehensive immigration reform package in 2013 that included vast amounts for border security much more than the president has asked for the bill had strong bipartisan support in the Senate but the Republican majority house refused to even take the bill up in committee much less on the floor of the house had we passed that bill in 2013 it would have been a powerful step forward for immigrants dreamers employers TPS recipients the American economy and the security of America's borders in February of 2018 I worked with a bipartisan group of 16 senators eight Democrats and eight Republicans and we put a proposal on the table a permanent fix for dreamers and a major investment in border security in fact we put an investment in border security into that bipartisan bill that was every penny that the president had asked for for the next ten years twenty five billion dollars but president a Trump attacked that deal and killed the bill even though he had earlier indicated that he would sign it twenty five billion dollars for border security over ten years with basic guidelines to ensure that the monies were spent wisely and not foolishly mr. president I learned something from that experience what I learned is I don't believe the president cares about solving the border security issue the substance of it means nothing to him or he would have embraced a deal that gave him every penny he asked for in February of 2018 he could have had a deal a long time ago if this mattered to him what the president cares about is big campaign rallies with people chanting build a wall so he can continue to stoke his political machine that's what I call foolishness but it gets worse a foolish insistence on political sloganeering over problem-solving is one thing but taking money out of the military budget from key priorities affecting our troops the lives of our troops and their families and safety is something much worse it is disrespectful and it's dangerous the president proposes to raid the military construction budget to the tune of 3.6 billion dollars to build 173 miles of border fencing that's an average cost of 4,000 dollars per linear foot offense for reference a standard six foot fence costs $25 a foot and a standard 6 foot brick wall costs $90 a foot the proposal is to spend $4,000 a foot on fencing let me give you examples of projects in Virginia and elsewhere that are being slashed to build this $4,000 a foot fence in Virginia we will lose 77 million dollars in MILCON projects that the Department of Defense has told the Senate they need 26 million dollars being is being taken away from improvements to a Navy ship maintenance facility in Portsmouth and here is what the DoD said about the importance of that work on the ship maintenance facility and I quote the building has been cited for a number of life safety violations these violations include no sprinkler protection inadequate fire alarm placement lack of a mass notification system and inadequate egress impact if not provided approximately 330 personnel working more than two hundred and fifty six thousand man-hours annually will remain in a high-risk environment with continuing significant rework higher stress and additional operating costs due to inadequate working environment that is what this cut will mean to that facility forty-one million dollars is being taken away from improvements to a hazardous chemical storage facilities in Portsmouth and Norfolk and here's how the DoD describes the impact of that cut and what and why the dollars were needed if this project is not provided Norfolk will continue storing hazardous materials in non-conforming storage facilities that do not meet current life safety and fire code requirements there are non-compliant firewalls inadequate fire suppression system fire alarms and inadequate ventilation 75 point I'm sorry 10 million dollars is being taken away from a cyber facility that was recently announced to be located at Joint Base langley-eustis needless to say cyber protection of our nation is a higher and higher priority every day here's what happens if those funds are not provided we will be unable to reach operating capability without a facility that includes the required skiff classified facility space from which to operate having the required skiff space is necessary for the team to receive the intelligence and perform the training required to perform in the cyber mission space continued use of lease space is costly and represents an enhanced security risk those funds are being cut 75 point 4 million to go outside of Virginia just give a few examples seventy five point four million dollars is being taken away from heating plant improvements at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska here's what that means according to the Department of Defense failure of the boiler boiler is expected within the next three to four years that was stated in 2017 loss of heat and power during Eielson subarctic winners with temperatures as low as sixty five degrees below zero Fahrenheit would be devastating to facilities and the missions housed in those facilities if the situation were deemed critical enough the base would be forced to consider evacuating facilities due to a lack of human power once closed the facilities would freeze and require many millions of dollars of repair to return to usable condition completing the plan jury placement of all boilers will guarantee continued steam and power generation to support the flying mission that money is being taken to fund the wall 62 million dollars is being taken away from improvements to a school on the base at Fort Campbell Kentucky here's what that means according to the Department of Defense the existing school structures do not comply with current building codes anti-terrorism and force protection standards and sustainability standards heating ventilation and air conditioning and electrical systems are in sufficient impact if not provided the substandard environment will continue to hamper the educational process and the middle school will not be able to support the DoD curriculum and provide for a safe facility the continued use of a deficient inadequate and undersized facilities that do not accommodate the current student population will continue to impair the overall educational program for these students thirteen million dollars is being taken away from improvements to a childcare center at Joint Base Andrews here in the DC area here's what that means according to the DoD the current facility a childcare center has suffered from sewage backup heating ventilation and air conditioning failures and mold and pest management issues this project will accommodate a hundred and sixty five children and staff as of February 2018 a hundred and fifteen children are on a priority-one waiting list why would we do this to these military families and their kids when they are sacrificing to volunteer and serve the country take the program away take the funding away for the child care Development Center they need to spend it on a wall that the president promised Mexico would pay for we're making these families now pay for it we're making their children now pay for it we're making the troops now pay for it fifteen million dollars is being taken away from a space control I'm sorry from a Health Care Center at Camp Lejeune a health care center for military members and their families and here's what that means according to the DoD this project solves the problem of providing primary care services to the active-duty operational forces located in substandard infrastructure throughout the installation the current capacity is insufficient and cannot accommodate more than half of the population resulting in a dispersion of paisans patients in personnel existing facilities in some cases basic requirements such as sinks proper ventilation and exam rooms with doors impact if not provided required medical and dental services for marine in garrison care will continue to be provided in substandard inefficient decentralized and uncontrolled facilities my son was based at Lejeune for a number of years that one stings why would we take money out of the health care facility for Marines that are living on the garrison and finally eight million dollars is being taken away from the space control center of Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado this is interesting because the defense the Armed Services Committee just worked together with the administration to enhance a space force a space command because it's a higher priority and needs to be we we all agree that it needs to be because of advances that are being made in space capacities by China Russia and other nations and yet the proposal is to take 8 million dollars away from the space control facility here's what the DoD says that would mean there are no adequate facilities located at either Peterson or Buckley Air Force Base for this space control squadron the only solution that meets the mission requirements is to construct a new facility on Peterson Air Force Base if this facility isn't constructed the military will be unable to stand up the space control mission and equipment with operational and strategic mission impacts due to inadequate facilities we just have reached the deal with the administration to elevate the space force to meet the challenges of our principle nation state competitors and yet these monies are being taken away will we really do this will we really do this to the safety of this country to our security to our troops and their families well we allow the President to unilateral hurt these patriotic people when he has long been able to find a fair and comprehensive immigration deal with Congress that includes border security funding well the Senate majority say a word raised an objection show support for the military show that Congress sets the budgets and appropriations not the executive make clear that no president not this president or any president should be able to move money around at will to support a blatantly political agenda at the expense of critical defense priorities that is what we will be voting on soon and I urge my colleagues to reject the president's foolish and dangerous raid on our military and with that mr. president I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum

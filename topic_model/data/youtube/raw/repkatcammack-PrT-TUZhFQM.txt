joining me right now is Florida congresswoman Kat camack she's a member of the Energy and Commerce and agricultural committees Congressman it's good to see you thanks very much for being here I know you travel to the border for a hearing last week how was it what did you say I'll tell you Maria it was one of the most ludicrous uh pieces of testimony I have ever heard in my congressional career the Democrat witness Rochelle Garza she stated on multiple occasions that there was no connection between the open border policies and Fentanyl pouring into our communities even went so far as to say that she didn't understand why we were at the border and even at points alluded to defending the cartels it was some of the most unacceptable and insane testimony I've ever heard which of course my colleagues and I we were quick to shut that down that's incredible we know that the drug cartels are taking in billions of dollars on their human smuggling and their trafficking of drugs and they are the ones who are deciding who gets in and who doesn't get into America right now so are these hearings at the border going to do anything to to help this situation because I know that your colleagues on the left the Democrats are boycotting the actual hearing they're not going to show up well you and I know Maria that if you care about an issue you show up that's the first step and it's clear that they either want to play politics with people's lives and our national security or they just want to sit at home and collect a paycheck but neither is except so that's why we're taking the fight to where it is actually happening at the border you know you hit on it in my own districts here in North Central Florida I presented uh Miss Garza with evidence photos of bricks of fentanyl that had the stamp of Border cartels that have been found in my community it is impacting every single Community but when you think about these hearings and what it's doing it's shining the light on the problem and the best disinfecting is sunlight so that is where we're going to start the process but then think of all the other issues that are play here HHS for example which is uh energy commerce's jurisdiction you have all those unaccompanied children that have gone through the HHS system that have no accounting for so there's a lot that has got gets covered but first step is we've got to secure that dang border five million plus people apprehended at the border Mike Baker this is on Joe Biden's watch these are just the numbers we know of just the numbers we know of and and then you you talk about the uh amount of money that the cartels have been making uh just over the past year and a half or so congresswoman I I applaud the the the the the hearings I think it is important as you noted to shine a light on this problem to increase awareness but in terms of action aside from the individual states and what steps they're taking particularly Governor Abbott in Texas do you envision any real action coming out of Washington to improve the security at the border during the course of this year absolutely you know I know that people get frustrated they see hearings but then they say what comes next what's the point you know we in Congress we have to do our due diligence and we have a constitutional mandate for oversight so a lot of this is getting to the bottom of it putting it on record all of the witnesses that appear before our committees they're under oath so you're laying the groundwork in Ultimate for ultimately impeachment for folks like Alejandro my orcas the Secretary of Homeland Security you're laying the groundwork for referrals to the doj for investigations and legal action to be taken we don't have arrest Authority in Congress uh so we can't you know go out and arrest people and do that but we can lay the groundwork really paint the picture and then the biggest tool in our toolbox is the purse strings we can actually stand there and say you know we're going to fence this money we're going to do this we're going to withhold funding here if you do not allow the people's house to do its work so this is all very important I know it's a kind of a labyrinth to get to the end game game here but it is a very necessary process for our national security our public health and to address the humanitarian crisis it's playing now I'm really glad you mentioned the purse because that's among the few levers you've got you've got 12 Appropriations bills you've got to use those Appropriations bills to either go with funding or not go with funding to make the point or to actually divert the money because that's certainly one lever that the house can do John Levine jump in you know one of the under sung issues here is the issue of Fentanyl and I know I've spoken to border sheriffs who have used the term tsunami of death to describe what's happening at the border and enough fentanyl has been seized at the border to kill every single American in this country everybody knows somebody who has been poisoned by fentanyl right and you see it here in New York City people are people are taking fentanyl test strips to the clubs now to make sure you know that they're not going to accidentally die and it's it's a it's a very tragic situation uh what do you say about that cat comic can you do anything about this fentanyl it's coming from China because the underlying chemicals are there and then they send it to Mexico to produce and traffic it into America yeah you know when you think about where the the raw materials for this product are coming from it is China like you said there's a hundred and sixty factories that we have identified in China that their sole purpose is to manufacture the precursors for fentanyl we've been able to track that supply chain all the way back to Mainland China we know the the shipping routes we know where they're sending it in Mexico we know how it's getting across and keep in mind that people keep saying on the other side oh 95 of all this is coming through legal ports it doesn't deal with illegal immigration that's absolutely insane we are only catching five to ten percent of all the fentanyl that is being trafficked across the border and this witness first hearing at the border she stated that the operation Lone Star from Texas DPS was a waste of money keep in mind that operation Lone Star has confiscated 361 million lethal doses of Fentanyl and she couldn't State unequivocally that that was was worthwhile she said that was a waste of money oh my God clearly that's value life that's like the only thing that's being done operation Lone Star all right and now she's saying it's a waste of money Congressman thank you we'll be watching the hearing and see what comes out of it thanks very much for joining us this morning

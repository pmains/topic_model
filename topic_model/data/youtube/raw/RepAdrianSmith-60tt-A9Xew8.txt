i want to thank everyone for participating here today i certainly especially want to thank our our panelists who i know bring a a great deal of insight and expertise to to our gathering here today of course i wish that we could do this in person doesn't seem seem to be the option right now and looking at the snow outside it might be a little safer to to engage this way as well at least on this day but uh i want to first introduce leslie marsh leslie is the ceo of lexington regional health center right there in central nebraska lexington nebraska leslie although she heads the hospital and she's done that for about 10 years i believe leslie has been a nurse master's in nursing as well also joining is the ceo of the york general hospital jim ulrich jim is a 28-year veteran of healthcare and has been leaving the hospital there in york since 2016. then also we have michelle weininger michelle is a rural health coordinator with cms and she's a subject matter specialist in insurance and so again grateful to have all of you on the panel here today before the pandemic our economy as you know was at a record high and businesses small and large were prospering and obviously now due to these unforeseen circumstances our our communities are faced with significant obstacles i think congress stepped in with the paycheck protection program that has has been very effective we know that it's you know really filled in in some areas that we know needed needed some attention i think it was very efficiently laid out as well now moving forward we don't know what the next coveted relief plan looks like uh obviously even though i thought maybe the election a lot last week would give us more indefinite direction moving forward um i guess we should never put too much faith in one election right but the outcome uh obviously nationally was much closer than anticipated i think um in speaking as a house member uh speaker pelosi was predicting that she would run the table on picking up the house seats that did not happen in fact quite the opposite and so the the coveted message that she was really engaged and all in on um has fallen flat now there's some good parts to that you know i am biased i will admit uh but we we need to get things in order here so that we can do what we are responsible for doing and and that is hopefully bringing some stability to health care and and communities with the rise in cases i i know that folks you know are are shifting gears yet again here at least in our community in western here in western nebraska so leslie you want to kick it off and share with us your perspective and and then we'll go down the line on panelists and and then throw it open to uh q a after that so leslie go ahead sure well thank you so much for um allowing me to participate on this panel it's it's a pleasure and um as always and and yes you're right i think we need to to get a handle on things that are that are going on i also want to thank you for your work on the on the ppp i know we had some meetings with you early on and yes it's very helpful and and really did sort of um you know carry the day i guess um during that first search that we had leading up into the search and we were all sort of just hunkered down but um we are seeing in increasing cases um again and so of course with people having community exposure there's there's just we're not staff for that and i think we're seeing that across the state and so um but we pulled together in nebraska right we all are we're teams team based here and so that's what we're what we're doing in our communities um i do think it's an important you have to strike a balance and so you know shutting everything down is not necessarily the way to go i think you've got to like look at what are you experiencing in your community and right now of course hospitalizations and hospitalized beds that are staffed are a problem but um you know i think that's really a nice way to be able to say well hey how how much do we have to to really close shop down and just you know in the meantime practice our the things that we know work because they work for influenza they work for for copic they you know the masking social distancing all those infection control practices so we've been trying to get that message out to the community and um we have a diverse community in lexington and so it's been really um important for us to leverage our community health workers who do have trust in the community and they do uh speak we're predominantly latino in lexington um a majority uh latino and then we have about 15 percent somali refugees also as a result of the the meatpacking plant there so we we were able to work together with them as a community um we worked with the school we work with the city we work with with businesses area business leaders and the medical communities to make sure that we're doing all that we can to help keep people safe and and i'd like to you know give a shout out actually to the meatpacking plant for immediately as soon as they realize getting some some processes in place and we're able to stop that spread that's just related to working in environments where you were close to other other folks so um all great community partners and um we've you know there is food insecurity and poverty and all of those things that are occurring at a at a greater um level now i think with with covet and so we're all just pulling together and there's the delivering meals and and doing those things that that we do um but i think you know that we're not used to sustained sorts of of disaster preparedness you might say so this is this has been a little bit different in a little bit i think harder on people which is why i think that fatigue has set in and has created a little bit of community spread that we didn't see previously so um so i think it's a you know when you think about hospitals and some of the things that i think are really important to share if we wouldn't have had um a strong hospital with with really great um highly skilled providers and nurses and all the people that helped to make a hospital successful in terms of being able to care for patients i don't know what we would have done because we had back in april through the first week of may we were full we had two coveted wings you know propped up and and we are busy have a busy er anyway with really fairly critically ill patients just because we're you know of our diet just because of our diversity we're right up interstate 80. and so it's really important to um to be able to be there for the people that you serve we out we're young community and so patients aren't going to travel um to another business or or hospital they're not going to go down the road 40 miles where they actually they might just show up in your er you know and then be ready to have a baby and you better be prepared as best you can in terms of training and it's to take care of those patients and so um i think that's really important for policymakers to understand that you know nebraska and the midwest is not the same as maryland for example where maybe a critical access hospital is not very far from you know a larger um facility and maybe it is just in you know um it is possible to travel and there's maybe more public transportation but that's not our um that's not that's not what we see so uh i think it's really just important and and i think that's been really accentuated in terms of patients that have needed us through coven we've delivered um we've had moms come in that you know are covered positive we're doing testing we're working with the state to do test um nebraska um as well as as doing our own rapid tests and and there was help with that as well and and through the the funds that were um released early on in the first package we were able to secure funding for high oxygen delivery devices and that really works when when you're pretty sick and you you put a patient prone and you you put them on some high oxygen and you can you can do a lot better than than when you don't have that so appreciate that as well and our and certainly our community does but i think it does illustrate the importance of being able to continue to to deliver that high quality care to be there when we're needed and and you know and not not just for managing health care but also there are times like this and emergencies and babies and illnesses that require hospitalization and so i think that it's really important that we don't lose sight of that and i always think of us as one leg on a three-legged stool and if you get rid of that leg it's a pretty wobbly rural community then whether that's a school or or the city or whatever it is but um we really end up bringing in we have if we left you know and i often say you know we have we've recruited you know four doctors and so that's really been um nice for us as as well as having you know um 10 um non-providers non-physician providers so it's it's really been a a nice mix and and those people would also leave if if the hospital weren't there because they're employed by the hospital people want to be employed now often by hospitals and so so you know i think we're we're set up to move forward in a really nice fashion but we just have to weather through this and we have to keep our rural economy um strong and support our local businesses and and so we've really been able to do a lot of nice things and i think we've been able to help in all kinds of ways that you might not think that hospitals do help we picked up the the public health there was you know a gap in public health so we helped with contact tracing we had a virtual we leverage technology so we have hospital attack tech hospitalist program and that uses technology and we have a intensivist through technology using telehealth and and really we had you had to use this a lot for behavioral health and you'd be surprised they kind of liked it for behavioral health we the patients really enjoyed that so um when you're thinking about health overall those are things that we do to help maintain our our our community in in in the best way possible and so that they're able to be um best suited to to help prop up our our economy and also to interact with one another the way we do in rural and probably everywhere but um certainly in rural and you know assist each other and just to have the best possible life high quality life and in terms of wellness and in terms of of prosperity so uh that's my two cents i guess my my lead-in in terms of what are we what do i think we contribute way more than that but i also think that we're struggling and as you know 40 of critical access hospitals are experiencing negative operating margins and you know 340b all of the things that we've talked about before we really still are interested in in moving the needle on so and we know we can look to you um congressman smith and we know that we're going to you're going to listen to us and so i think that's in our community certainly you almost universally felt so thank you for your leadership and your in your service well thank you i appreciate that i i consider it a privilege to work with critical access hospitals and all of you guys it really especially during the pandemic i think that you all have risen to the occasion in a way that not that you needed to prove yourselves so before that so with me but uh certainly salute you and all of your staff for uh truly being uh heroes among us so jim you want to give us your perspective thanks matt leslie you bet thank you sure uh congressman uh thank you and leslie thank you for your comments i kind of uh want to make sure i don't repeat too much so i'll go i'll add on some different things as well uh congressman smith we've known each other seems like forever it was in 16 years and worked with you out there quite a long time too and i can tell you over the 33 years that i've been in health care there's been nothing and i'm sure everybody on the call can say the same thing you know nothing like this that we've seen over that period of time but um so i wanted to echo the thanks for the opportunity first off and also for all your support over the years congress congress and smith and and in particular during this time for your help in the um in all the the relief funding that we've received as as leslie has mentioned and we put it to some great use as well and i'll try to touch on at least one or two of those as well as we go i wanted to just paint a picture because i want to bring in a little more than even the critical access hospital side because york general healthcare services uh just short of 500 employees and and we have a critical access hospital and has 50 plus visiting specialists so uh that just paints a little bit of the picture of the services that we do provide along the way and local access to care which is so pivotal our westview medical campus has home health and dialysis a 12 chair unit we have provide daycare for our staff a shot clinic for immunizations and now we have drive-through outpatient testing in test nebraska which is very busy there as well so another outlet another campus for access to care that if we didn't have the home health available in york or if we didn't have dialysis there's a lot of travel that's involved for the individuals in our region for their services we have a 127 bed skilled nursing facility too in york general hearthstone so that's presented a whole different gamut of challenges too as you have residents that can barely see their loved ones over this period of time that's gone back to march really and just the challenges of staffing and the morale of employees and and you know the the lifestyle that residents were accustomed to that they just don't have today all those different uh challenges uh willowbrook is a 40 room assisted living as well so that echoes the same sort of thing as a skilled nursing facility and then we're starting some new access uh that is starting to take shape out near the interstate and building a a clinic that will have reference lab services through quest labs and then a uh and then a joint venture clinic with york medical clinic here as well so all those things are are put out to be uh great access to care for our region really in rural america and so we do promote this availability of services that we have uh by radio paper social media way more than it used to be i'm getting a lot of traction there presentations uh uh social clubs uh most of those are zoom now it seems like in radio shows and then as being as in as involved as we can in the community and in the region so we have also wellness and live well committees that that are pretty getting more and more active on lunch and learns and dietitians for the health of of our uh you know citizens of our communities so we're trying to do to reach out more and more and having those fingers out in the community gives us more of a an ear to the community overall we want to be that trusted resource for for healthcare information and we're really striving hard to do that and so communication during this pandemic has been so critical and working with our four corners health department as well as our york county development corporation and our chamber of commerce for our community sector briefings that we do uh weekly and then unified command meetings with uh four corners health department all the time too and just getting that voice out and those uh educating the public as best we can we're trying hard just like leslie mentions to do with the surge of cases even more and more about promoting and sharing some of the american hospital association messages on masking and social distancing and trying to do our own campaigns as well through social media and it's hard to be out in the public right now so you've got to use those those medias that are available to you so on covet 19 though like i mentioned tons of staff and community communication we're taking like most facilities a pretty open book on how we talk about this you know where's the hospitalization rates how many covert patients are we seeing how much testing are we doing in our community we're breaking records daily for the number of testing number of testing we're doing on an average week let's see last week we saw 152 individuals through our test nebraska site and then on top of that we're doing about 130 or drive-through testing so there's a lot of testing that's going on in amongst also testing our our our hearthstone staff that's about 130 of our 450 480 staff members twice a week we're testing according to cms regulations and then also we're testing our residents as well weekly to date we've kept out almost almost all the covet out of our nursing home we've got a couple positive cases today but we're able to the way our neighborhoods are set up in our nursing home to isolate those individuals and we've been successful so far because you've seen what can happen in communities when coba 19 runs through a nursing home it's not pretty and so we've we've been very vigilant in our efforts to keep everybody safe in that regard the one of the stories that i wanted to mention just on local access to care congressman smith was uh there's recent regulations in the last few years for pharmacy that kind of required much more big changes to everybody's pharmacy in the way of how uh iv medications and other medications are mixed and like negative pressure positive pressure hoods and things like this so multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars for investment uh to comply with those regulations and we invested in that in our region so that we could keep a very important access to care and that is chemotherapy in our area and we uh at the time presently in our surrounding counties were the we're the provider that can do that and it doesn't mean that some of our surrounding communities won't do it but they're not there yet and so we have seen more and more unfortunately chemotherapy patients that can have their chemo chemotherapy at home today than we ever have and and so that along trying to do that in a coca-19 environment with all the restrictions and all of the you know upon entry to our facility taking your temperature taking questionnaires all those things wearing masks we've uh strived really hard uh to navigate that world and uh now i will tell you through uh through the uh we do have a cobia 19 wing as as leslie mentioned you go back a couple months ago we probably wouldn't have thought we'd we'd have to keep cobit patients in our um in our rural facilities but we have the ability to shut down one of our wings and make it completely negative pressure so an isolation uh uh covered wing and just last couple days last week last week we got up to six patients in our covenant unit and giving them rem desevere convalescent plasma if needed um uh you know just the just the var dexamethasone so some of those medications and they've responded real well and but we're watching and planning for the day that brian health cannot take those patients or sainte's in lincoln or saint francis and grand island or you know the surrounding facilities because 794 patients in nebraska today uh that are in hospitals and you know a couple weeks ago honestly that was in the 400s and so we really had a big up tip in hospitalization so leslie and i both feel wholeheartedly that critical access hospitals will continue to take a uh a bigger role in what's going on in coba 19. and one of the you know in a weird strange way a blessing that we had is in york anyway is that we did not have the initial surge maybe that leslie had now that could be a blessing to her too because she's better prepared for it as well but we had everything in the surge uh planning then now we're putting into place so we had all that done i know how to shut down departments if we need to we don't want to just like leslie mentioned we think we're better at managing those things today and doing it in a safe way because of our experience through this pandemic and we're here to meet the needs you know when i give those communications to our public on what's going on recently i always end with the fact i know what i'm telling you is you know not necessarily the best news but we are here and we are treating folks and we can continue to do that staffing challenges are great the cares act funds and the ppp funds have been very beneficial in that regard so thank you again we did use some of the cares act funds to purchase some uv light robots to disinfect both rooms and apartments as well as some of our ppe and that has been a very good investment on our part we use it on surgical suites and ob sweets because we've had to do surgery on coco patients and deliver babies as leslie mentioned as well to cover positive patients so there's things that you really are proud of your team through all this because it's like you know i had faith that everybody could do this and boy they proved that's come true and so uh to be that trusted resource in our communities we're doing that and we'll continue to do that and again congressman smith i'll echo leslie you've always been there for the facilities that i've been with and all those in nebraska both and mccook for those years as well as here in new york it's someone who we can call upon very quickly and get an ear very quickly on those items so i know we go back and we've talked for years on 96-hour rule physician supervision those kind of things 340b as leslie mentioned so appreciate and it's always very very nice to know uh that we have a definite in our corner in dc so thank you i'll conclude my opening comments for that too well i thank you jim uh for your perspective there and it is interesting how you point up or point out that uh you know the numbers are different for you now than they were last spring uh they were a little bit different for leslie there in lexington so i'm glad we have got diverse perspectives here as well michelle uh would you like to share with us your your perspective uh from the federal level and and what uh what you have to offer us go ahead thank you first of all for the invitation and the uh uh bill the opportunity to participate today um i just really briefly want to first of all say thank you to jim and leslie and to all the critical access hospitals and all the healthcare providers out there um we as an agency very much appreciate what you're doing on the front line and and hopefully some of the things that we've put into place or implemented are making your jobs a little bit easier but we do recognize um what a great job you all are doing i want to first of all just kind of start off from a general level just to make sure that everyone is aware that we did announce a new list serve that you can sign up for that specifically targeted for the rural population so for providers patients anybody who's looking for information from cms from a rural specific standpoint you can sign up for a listserv on our site on the cms.gov site um if you have questions about rural health we have a team that actually can answer those questions and there's a general email box that you can answer those questions or you have you want to raise an issue to us and make us aware of it it's rural health cms.hhs.gov that's a great resource email for you uh to to look into um i want to talk a little bit about what cms has done during the phe which most of you are aware of and and and from the from the cares act from the provider relief funds that came out our job was to implement that and to get that policy in place and we did that through interim final rules we've done that by waivers and flexibilities specifically uh you know giving the hospitals the ability to have uh remote sites and to to do those temporary sites the hospitals without walls and and we tried to remove some of those regulatory burdens and and do some flexibilities to make it easier for hospitals to be able to respond um we increased telehealth flexibilities um the you know we we waived that 96 hour uh rule that we were talking about we we waived the um the 25 bed limit for the critical access hospitals for the purpose of the public health emergency uh there's just a lot of things that we've been doing along the way we also um at the very beginning made a gave critical access hospitals and providers the opportunity to ask for advanced payments or accelerated um advanced payments um so that they could have some cash inflow coming in and then we just recently um made some modifications to those repayment terms to make it easier for the provider so they didn't have this huge repayment debt or you know this repayment to cms when the cash flow is still not where it used to be for them um most recently we just released on the 28th of october the interim final rule um number our fourth one that we've put out during the public health emergency which really is starting to address how we're going to reimburse and how providers can bill for the covet 19 vaccination that was just released still open for comments so i encourage anyone on here if you haven't read through it or looked at it from a from a community standpoint to take a look at that and please give us comment on that's what that's the purpose of it is for you to make comment on it and to make sure that we're doing the things that are going to be effective for you or that you're getting the information and guidance that you need um regarding what we're going to do we're already looking beyond the public health emergency looking at some of the successful things that are being done we're looking at some of those wafers and flexibilities to see what we can continue um beyond the public health emergency some of those telehealth flexibilities and and are there things that we just need to that are working really well right now that that can go on beyond the public health emergency some of the some of the things are statutorily excluded and and that's where congressman smith you and your colleagues come into play on and making sure that um if those are successful that that those need to be changed through congress that's something that cms cannot change so um if you in the community or as a provider are seeing things that work that are statutorily excluded beyond the phd you need to work with congress to get those things changed um but we are definitely looking at that there's a lot of flexibilities out there there's a lot of resources out there and and i'm a rural health coordinator in our cms kansas city office but i have nine other colleagues so um we're here to help the rural health community so if you're looking for resources from cms so you're looking for guidance from cms and you're struggling to find that information i'm email away i'm a phone call away so i encourage um the the providers in the community and as a as a whole if you have questions regarding medicare or cms or things like that please don't hesitate to reach out to me my contact information is on google if you google the rural health coordinator for kansas city you'll find me but i also want to say um jim i've had the opportunity and and leslie i'm i'm just now kind of forming a relationship with leslie and hoping to go forward with that but um one of the things that i've been blessed to be able to do in my position is actually go out and visit the rural communities and be able to sit down with the critical access hospitals in those communities and say okay what can we do for you or what do we need to know about and i i very much appreciate the opportunity to get out into those rural communities and actually see what it's like because i am the liaison into the agency and like leslie very eloquently said rural nebraska is not rural maryland is not rural texas it's not real california so what i do is i can take what's happening here in in the midwest because i'm kansas missouri iowa nebraska and take that information and feed it back to our leadership within cms when we're writing policy when we're writing rules and let them know what's happening here on the ground so that's what i'm that's what i'm able to do in my position the other thing i'd like to say that right now where our agency is focused on is the flu shot and we're really pushing the flu immunization because we want to avoid additional impact into the healthcare community into the hospitals with an increased flu flu cases so if we can get people vaccinated for the flu we're going to hopefully reduce that burden on to the to the hospitals and the health care community as a whole going forward so we really are focused this year on pushing that flu immunization message and we have a lot of great resources available on our site um as well regarding that and with that i'll kind of close it up and that way we have plenty of time for questions or or anything else thank you again well thank you michelle for your your service and certainly your your desire to reflect the needs of rural america we know that you know like every single critical access hospital is a little bit different even with a single designation uh they reflect the needs of the community for which i'm grateful and and i think it's it's a great testament though to how communities can come together to as a as a famous nebraskan would say get her done so um we'll throw it open to questions here i do want to introduce many of you already know jared reimers from my grand island office and then joel corrales who handles healthcare and various other issues out of my washington office and so they're here to help facilitate and and listen to your concerns here today as well while uh our participants are perhaps thinking of questions i i want to pose a uh a question perhaps to jim and leslie as you've seen you know there's been an evolution of of what is advised i mean we we've seen a an evolution uh in mass usage and in that advice and that insight we now think differently than we did last spring on on mask wearing um and i don't want to look backward necessarily i'd be curious though as we look at our communities across the third district and beyond what have you as health care providers you've you've been right at the core of every you know with every community uh you've been at the core of biosecurity measures and the needs and you know scaling that up what what kind of advice could you give any anywhere from a coffee shop owner of how they can safely serve their their customers um to perhaps a larger employer um that may or may not have customers coming and going but definitely have employees coming and going what's what kind of insight could you offer there for for our communities and business community as a whole i suppose i can take a stab at that leslie unless you're ready i'll let you go and then i can chime in as as needed um congressman smith i think you hit the nail on the head this has been an evolution and it's something that without a doubt has been a challenge for us because any time there's a little ambiguity in the way things what is recommended it upset challenge and it and it it also raises that level in the community of uh what's really the right message and you know what am i supposed to believe so uh when i've talked with business owners or uh even with our health department to said how do we get out that message of um that we are learning as we go you know and that includes the cdc as well you know where this uh that information comes from so when i'm talking about different changes and people will say well how come masks weren't important before hey we're learning we're looking at when we started it was it was just spreads on on countertops or surfaces versus being airborne right and and then you mix in the fact that sometime in the middle when things slowed down a little bit it became a lot of asymptomatic positive people and now we're back to many more people that are symptomatic and community spread so uh the message we try to send is be vigilant and do your part and be smart really uh and and you know to try to just avoid those uh those situations of uh close contact and big groups and uh the social distancing aspect of it as well and mask wearing uh you got to set the example at the store and at the place that you're at and and uh because if you see a lot of people if you're trying to be mandatory or for lack of a better word you know you put the sign on there that say mask wearing encouraged or some of them do say you need a mask to enter but when half the people don't how you or your staff members don't how how is that that's not going to work and so trying to remain vigilant and just do your part and if people say well i've got this study that says masking doesn't work or so on and so forth i said you seriously think without a mask that it's going to be you tell me that's not helping at all on that end is what i tried to do a little logic with them and uh uh but it's no mistaking that the big gatherings and then from there community spreads is where it's hit our is where it's hit our region and and so trying to say that listen to your four corners health department listening to us that are working together with them on the latest and greatest message because we are learning more about this as we go there's no mistaking the fact is change i'm not going to go try to say someone messed up or whatever we're just learning as we go and so do your part and help stop the spread so that we don't run into situations where we run out of hospital beds and uh because uh you know when the vaccines come out there's going to be a challenge too on trusting of vaccines and getting the first wave that goes through healthcare frontline workers you know you need that so we can care for those patients come in but we can also be very good advocates for trust in that message too once we receive that and you know we've got the antibodies and and it's working for us it helps us to promote that message of trust because we should be that trusted source going forward and that should help our communities yeah yeah just uh just to echo um what jim said i about community and and the way that they can help you know what like right now i just pulled up some stats um from lexington's only seeing a seven-day rolling average of positive case rates as of november 6th of 8.2 but the surrounding communities that did not have that um surge in the early spring or you know one of them's 85.6 positive so and a lot of those patients are as jim said asymptomatic or not as sick so they're they're thinking they have allergies or something like that and they're feeling a lot safer because time has gone on and and so it is really important that we reinforce hey you know don't have these large gatherings because i know that that's where a lot of the at least in our area that's where a lot of this spread um there really began and and the huge impact beyond hospital beds and more accepting patients sort of the reverse way so we you know north platte and carney helped us a lot um when we were going through our surgeon now we're accepting their patients because um you know that's that's just they're really overwhelmed so i think it's it's a matter of being aware of that and of using that um community trust that that jim mentioned to be talking about you know for for example we had somebody come in and was having a heart attack and there was no but we had to ship that person you know carney couldn't take the person they were full so we had to to get that person to brian so we want to be able to always deliver high quality care and we and we do talk about the fact that we're safe we did not um you know have any transmission of infection in in our hospital during the um during that really heavy time and and and so we we do know that if you do some you know practice those sorts of techniques that it does make a difference so um and as we all know as new information becomes available we adjust and adapt to that and so um that's just the that's the way of of certainly of health care for for forever we don't practice like we used to practice you know um 30 years ago so you know as as new evidence becomes available then we adapt and and change our messaging so um so i think it's really important that you're out there that you're talking about it um we're in tyson we have a clinic in tyson and so um and they're actually doing a lot of random testing and so we're identifying people earlier on so that we can get them quarantined and and hopefully help to prevent some of the spread that way but it really is very important to for businesses to stay open and for their for their team to stay healthy by just like hand washing don't we you know not touching your your face and you know and that's just the way it's the same way that any airborne or or really it's contact with maybe some airborne um components that's the way that this disease is spread and so being mindful of that and to michelle's comments about getting the influenza vaccine we've tried to make that um readily available uh the interesting thing is that people say we're wearing masks anyway so you know we don't really you know need it as much and it was like well actually yes you do need it so so we're really trying to make sure that that's available in the school system and available working with the public health department available you know um in in any way shape or form so that people can stay healthy and business can continue and are and the people that that visit those businesses can be safe as well and and so we're we're we're sharing that message and we um have really appreciated i i was remiss and not saying this um about cms's waivers if we had not had those waivers i don't know what we would have done because you know we had 40 over three weeks we had 42 patients that required um admission to the hospital and um we had but we had a lot more of those that were needing to be tria or you know look seen and have an msc and and that ability to do that right outside our our er because the er create is still a bottleneck area for us we're not we weren't really set up for this um you know for care patients like this so it it does um it can create a bottleneck and so we appreciated that and and you know that we have broadband issues in in um you know in this area and so being able to use and plus our community it's hard to get them to download an app but it's hard for me to talk to my my mom about downloading an app so they're just not used to that so that ability to use space time to be um innovative that that's really what what it takes is being adaptive and innovative and trusting and working with your community and and so that's for my two cents that's that's really where it's at all right michelle would you want to add anything to that and i might throw in another question here while i have you is in that anecdotally i'm i'm told that uh flu vaccine is uh on the rise i guess you know more folks a greater percentage are accepting the flu vaccine is that accurate number one and perhaps can that be leveraged as we move forward once a cobit vaccine becomes available um well to your question i don't have the data of how many immunizations are like the increased rate of vaccinations i haven't seen any claims data or anything like that come through from the medicare standpoint so i i i haven't seen any of that yet so i can't answer that um i do know that there's been an increased interest in getting our resources and an increased interest in passing the messaging along so i'm going to take that as a good news that people are receptive to and and willing to partner with us and and want to work with us to help educate um their communities so i'll take that as a plus um um going forward i i hope that i hope that this helps i hope that this helps the leveraging for the covet 19 vaccine i hope that since we're already we can partner that message or we can marry that message um how important that is you know to leslie's comment i had not heard that and i could see where that would be a natural reaction i'm already wearing a mask why do i need a flu vaccine so i i can see i have not heard that one yet but um that's definitely something i want to make sure that that i send up to our leadership because when we're developing our messaging maybe that's something we need to address in our messaging as well and kind of be proactive in that messaging um as far as the um i i do want to say that i'm very pleased with the the telehealth thank you leslie for commenting on that we've been hearing that on the on the broadband issues and so glad that we can increase that um that that flexibility and it's something that we're definitely hearing that we would like that people would like to have continued beyond the phe so um definitely keep sending those comments forward and forgive me congressman smith the first comment that you asked that you asked me on i forgot because i was thinking about the flu which you were telling when you were asking me that but well just kind of applying best practices in in businesses you know whether they meet public you know with customers or definitely their their employees i know that there's a great concern uh among very thoughtful individuals that they could do everything that they think is right and still be uh held liable there's that fear at least um i don't i don't think we've seen the rash of lawsuits just yet uh but but that is that's a concern on the minds of of many and just you know perhaps what you've seen uh that you could pass along as good advice honestly um from from a from a legal standpoint i really don't have any guidance or any any feedback i can provide on that all like um you know all we're doing is is just trying to increase the the flexibilities again for the the healthcare community to make sure that they're they have the ability to treat that um and and then the other thing the other thing that we're we're working on too is is um from a from a financial standpoint and from from uh not only from the healthcare community but also for the patient who's trying to get these um vaccines or trying to get this treatment and and part of this was was through the cares act but some of it now is is again how we're proceeding with the vaccine is is making those vaccines and making that treatment available to everybody everyone regardless of their ability to pay so we don't want anybody not getting the vaccine because they can't pay um you know in the in this ifc 4 the vaccines and the treatments in the therapeutic treatments are available at should be available at no cost and not only are we issuing that guidance for medicare patients or medicaid patients but we're also issuing that guidance for private insurers so we want the private insurance regardless of whether a patient is inpatient or outpatient or in network or out of network they should still be able to get these vaccinations and these treatments at at um no cost we again we don't want people not getting treated for this so um i don't want anybody to think that they can't receive treatment because because of their financial status we we just don't want that so we're we want to we're encouraging everyone get tested get treated right right very good anyone else want to uh ask a question certainly uh feel free as we are sorting out um you know what is next in in the house at least you know i really ask for all of your input whether you're directly in the in the uh health care community itself or certainly other businesses i think it's vital to get your perspective i i work with my staff team to very diligently hear from from constituents to get get your insight moving forward but to please know that there's always always more to be heard i'm sure so please feel free to to speak up if not today certainly uh in the future as we are uh assembling a uh the next the next step i have a feeling that the next step will be a a bit different than what was dangled out there over the last few months um that you know that the heroes act um it was just chock full of politics and quite honestly those politics didn't end up getting much leverage and uh so i'm grateful for that because we owe the american people i think a a much higher level discussion and deliberation on on the issues that are important and the issues that matter rather than just looking for political leverage around every corner back last spring when there was more unity against the covid i think it was a testament to what we can get done in congress uh that that's not to say that we just duplicate exactly what what took place there in terms of policy uh just like in healthcare we learn on the science so we we learn on the economics and moving forward too of what what's good what's bad i i grow uh even more concerned all the time about our supply chains and in addition to supply chains for ppe um you know whether i talk to a car dealer who can't get the inventory that they need or an appliance store they can't get the inventory and that is under high domain in between my many zoom calls throughout the summer i worked in the yard and finding some of those materials at the lumber yard uh there became a shortage there too and when there are shortages that's lost economic opportunity and and so we we want to stay on top of that i i think that we will see uh opportunities moving forward i just want to make sure the federal government doesn't get in the way in terms of opportunities i think we will likely see a realignment in the workforce as we are i think are bound to see some manufacturing jobs come come back to the u.s let's face it the fact that ppe manufacturing left our shores some time ago and it didn't happen overnight but the fact that china was making virtually all our ppe china wouldn't even have to act maliciously for that to be a problem during a worldwide pandemic and so we we need to respond accordingly and appropriately uh with that and i think we're starting to see that already um and we'll on the ways and means committee you know we handle tax and trade policy we'll we'll take a look at that i i hope that we can um you know again not get in the way but also be effective about that and knowing that you know the marketability of domestically manufactured products that's gone up a great deal in the last several months so anyway uh joel jarrett would you like to add anything okay well like i said joel handles the legislative side of things uh out of the washington office and jared handles a constituent side of things out of the grand island office and it looks like we do have one question from michael fagler michael is michael unmuted jared do you know yes he should be available to speak okay michael maybe stepped away well we can we can come back as well or michael i would encourage you to let us know what your question is and we can certainly get you a response either from me or uh from our from our panelists as well but uh grateful to all of you for your participation here today again thank you to our panelists from kansas city lexington york assuming everyone is calling in their posted locations and just this is a we're all in this together believe me i mean uh obviously the president himself has been no stranger to to the virus um all of us in in our communities across america um there there's there's no one protected from this virus and so that's why our cooperation and and really focusing on on technology and just innovating our way out of this and being creative about it that we know that necessity as the saying goes necessity is the mother of invention so i think we could very easily see you know some reforms to the the vaccine of research and and that whole process and i you know i wouldn't wish for us to be in this in this scenario let me be very clear i will also say i think we can be stronger for it i think we can take some things from this constructively moving forward finding out that some of our you know institutions and processes very durable and appropriate moving forward other areas you know we we could perhaps change and and be more responsive and hopefully more than anything i would hope that in congress we will recognize that communities and providers need the agility to exercise their best judgments every step of the way rather than feel like the heavy hand of the federal government might be standing in the way so michelle thank you for your reflection of really listening to providers themselves and what communities what communities need so with that i again want to say thank you to our our panelists and uh to all of our participants here today uh if you have further questions or more concerns and ideas feel free to to let let me know let my staff team know as well meanwhile i'm just grateful for all of you and look forward to hopefully meeting in person one day soon so with that we'll wrap it up and wish you well take care stay healthy thank you you too much

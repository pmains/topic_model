florida congressman mike waltz of the house armed services committee part of that delegation thanks for being here yeah thanks brett what's your take away after your trip you know there were a couple of key points from president zielinski one was continued frustration with the europeans they've promised a lot but they're delivering very little and even what they promised that they're not delivering it's a fraction of what the united states is aside from britain germany especially they're delivering right now less than estonia and zielinski's fear is as we head into winter as they become even more dependent on russian oil and gas that they're going to backslide even further so that was one too i'm very concerned for the taxpayer dollars and for oversight of these billions of dollars of equipment that we're sending where's it all going how's it being used you know what's the maintenance what's the training you know what's the utilization of it all is some of it being pilfered out to the black market we just don't know we're pushing this stuff across the border in poland and we're not talking people on the front lines but we ought to have folks there out of our embassy with eyes on to understand where all this stuff is to that point financial times has this piece that the eu and nato sound alarm over risk of ukraine weapons smuggling since russia launched its war against ukraine western states have pledged more than 10 billion in military support all these weapons land in southern poland get shipped to the border and then are divvied up into vehicles to cross trucks vans sometimes private cars said one western official and from that moment we go blank on their location we have no idea where they go where they're used or even if they stay in the country yeah so if we're not blind we're legally blind it's it's pretty close and it's it's i think the the risk of pilferage pilferation uh if it going to the black market yeah sorry is is is there and we need to be aware of it but i'm more concerned about how much of its breaking house being used tactically and how we can help them i think the biggest point brett though was zielinski feels like he is losing slowly that the biden administration is basically helping him play for a tie and if it settle these lines settle as they are this winter then essentially he's cut off from the ocean minus one port uh putin will hit a pause button it won't be the end of hostilities he'll lick his wounds and come at it again and why does that matter to the american people if putin continues to chew up ukraine he will not stop he will go in eastern europe and by letting ukraine basically neuter the russian army and giving them what they need what they've been begging for we can then truly focus on china which is where we need to be focused but congressman there is a lot of pushback in the u.s about us getting more involved about us having us troops on the ground in whatever capacity and now there's even talk of you know u.s planes i mean you heard kirby saying it's long term they're not going to do it right away but it does seem a little bit like mission creep here from where we were at the beginning of this war look i think it's irresponsible to push 40 billion dollars worth of military equipment and have no idea how it's being used or where it's going it almost reminds of what we did with afghanistan or they've got 80 billion that now are in the hands of the enemy so to get eyes on that far away from far away from the front lines is what i think we need to be doing what i think the taxpayer would expect of us and and it's actually what the ukrainians need the british are doing it by the way they're doing it successfully we can't constantly have a strategy that is scared of putin and scared of what he might do let's help him win uh and not play not to lose you don't sense well let's say they do this counter-offensive you don't sense that there is a moment here where they sit down at the table with the russians anytime soon zielinski was clear that he cannot sit down with him where the lines are today that he has to have access to the black sea for his economy to run essentially he will be a neutered state either dependent on humanitarian aid from europe or eventually depended on russia he's got to re-establish at least the 2014 lines before he can sit down and negotiate he was crystal clear on that and i think he's right one more thing before you leave you wrote this op-ed about the obama administration vaccine mandates crippling the national guard uh pretty detailed here the numbers are pretty staggering yeah look the the army is already going to fall tens of thousands short because of a recruiting crisis now they're looking at pushing 20 000 plus out over this vaccine mandate i 26 years in the military i understand you law and order discipline you tell the platoon to charge the machine gun they got to do it but also as leaders we have to evaluate our orders and whether it's worth the risk and in this case you have a vaccine that has now been shown not to stop the spread that it's a personal health decision on what kind of symptoms you want to endure versus guaranteed to lose tens of thousands of soldiers you can't replace and the guard is on the front line of everything from hurricanes to going over to ukraine and overseas deployments we just can't afford it as a nation to take this kind of a blow and i i pray the administration doesn't just head long go down this route and really take a step back and say is this still the right policy congressman wallace we appreciate the time all right thanks brett

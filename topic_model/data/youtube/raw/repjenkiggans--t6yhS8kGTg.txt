it's not a Republican or Democrat issue it's an American issue I mean you just saw Congressman Jennifer kiggins one of those house members who made that trip and she joins us now congresswoman great to have you on the program what did you see what did you learn on a trip that the White House refers to as a publicity stunt good morning so it was great to be down at the southern border with speaker McCarthy and a group of Four Freshmen and we went because we are focused on problem solving we wanted to hear directly from people who work and live at the border we heard from the sheriffs we heard from law enforcement we heard from border patrol we talked to business owners and ranchers and let me tell you it is a crisis down there the border is wide open we have a president who's not doing his job this is directly a result of the Biden Administration and their weakness that they continue to show on the border and the world is watching this weakness but it is continues to be a problem we were down there having discussions learning about the cartels who are really domestic terrorists who are running the show and just the problems the border patrol is having with their Workforce you know having the people available to to do the things that they need to do to to uh you know conduct the encounters and to find the Fentanyl and to to be able to secure the Border they don't have the Manpower they don't have the resources so just that we were saying that that rear its head just with the increases in fentanyl does like you were just talking about in the cartels again who are running the show are smart they are making lots of money down there they are addressing people from head to toe in camouflage they're putting boots on their feet that are that have carpet so that they are harder to track and uh and they are they are using scapegoats that are that are then creating diversion so the border patrol who has already Workforce challenged is tied up with these diversions which leaves the cartels then to be able to find ways you know to to get the drugs like fentanyl into our country uh it's a it's a safety issue it's a community safety issue and I said not a Republican or Democrat one but it's one that this Administration needs to focus on you know we talk a lot about fentanyl you've been talking about it there the Pentagon says deaths among active duty troops from fentanyl overdoses are rising in 2017 36 percent of those deaths were related to Fentanyl and 2021 it jumped to 88 percent this just goes to show you no one is safe what can we do to stop this right it's the leading cause of death for for Americans age 18 to 45 so it's really impacting our young people and Virginia our attorney general Jason mierez has a one kid one pill can kill campaign that we've started here so really uh you know everyone needs to needs to know that it just takes such a small amount we have enough fentanyl in this country that's coming across our border to kill every American you know three times over so really that that just understanding uh the danger that's out there and it's in all of our all of our States now I represent Virginia's second congressional districts so so every state is a border state yeah no one is safe at this point that just goes to show it congresswoman Jennifer kiggins thank you so much

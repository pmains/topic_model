Thank you, Madam Speaker. I rise in support of the Women's Health Protection Act. As an original co sponsor of the bill, I think Representative Chu for her leadership on this
important bill. As a woman from Texas, I thank this body for responding with urgency to my beloved home state's cruel
law, depriving Texans of their constitutional rights by bringing this bill to the floor today. In this moment, it is
the Texas law, a law quickly being copied across the country that has brought us here. But let us remember that it was
also Texas that brought us the framework for this bill that we will pass today to protect the health, privacy, dignity,
and freedom of women and families across this country. In the case of Roe v. Wade, and it was a 26 year-old Texas
woman named Sarah Weddington, who took that case all the way to the Supreme Court. Texas women have fought and will
continue to fight for the rights that we protect here today. I am proud to be one of them and to 
vote in favor of this bill. Thank you.

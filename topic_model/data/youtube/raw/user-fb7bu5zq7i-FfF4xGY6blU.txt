i would like to thank chairman delorah ranking member cole and all the members of the labor health and human services education and related agents appropriations subcommittee for holding today's hearing my primary purpose for testifying today is to urge the subcommittee to provide 10 million dollars for the center for disease control and prevention's national center for injury prevention and control for child sexual abuse prevention research activities in fiscal year 2022 specifically the cdc estimates that one in four girls and one in 13 boys will become victims of child sexual abuse this traumatic experience is associated with long-term physical and mental health issues impacting how children think feel and act over their lifetime regrettably in 2020 reported by the interpol found that the covid19 pandemic has increased the frequency of child sexual abuse and the consumption of online child sexual abuse materials further the pandemic has provided abusers additional access to victims while inhibiting children's ability to access victim services to report their abuse and receive treatment i believe that increasing funding for child sexual abuse prevention research activities will be a crucial investment in the continued fight to protect our most vulnerable population this research will be used to clarify the risk factors that promote offending and the protective factors that prevent offending most importantly this research will be used to develop and disseminate effective preventative prevention strategies to ensure that evidence-based intervention practices make it into the hands of parents educators youth serving serving organizations and other stakeholders dedicated to keeping children safe from sexual abuse prior to becoming a member of congress i was engaged in advocating for children on a personal level my wife is a survivor her sister kelly was a survivor who turned to opiates and who's no longer with us who left three children behind my wife wanted to be able to have uncomfortable conversations and make sure that children were educated about the prevention of child sexual abuse and that parents educators and children talked about prevention we went into the schools we talked to over 12 000 students 12 through k our k-12 in a collaborative effort with the u.s district attorney's office the faith-based community child protective services and other advocates for children 73 young people came forward and were substantiated during that symposium that we did over a period of time i bring that up because we use those outcomes to change the law or to pass a law in the state of indiana having an hour of curriculum about child sexual abuse prevention internet safety and phone safety i bring this up because as we went through that exercise hundreds of survivors came forward and talked about the importance of how it impacted child trauma impacted their lives uh the inability to work uh the inability to turn to addiction or to alcohol so i bring this up to tell you that the no more secrets campaign that we put together helped to aim and better understand and report abuse that may experience uh that a child may experience and so i appreciate this opportunity to continue to be engaged in this issue and by advocating today before the subcommittee i am thankful for the demonstration of the subcommittee's commitment to investing in research to eradicate child sexual abuse in recent fiscal years and i respectfully encourage the subcommittee to appropriate 10 million dollars to this vital program for fiscal year 2022. i thank you again chairwoman delora ranking member cole and all the members of the subcommittee and the subcommittee staff for your dedicated work for holding this hearing i thank you and i yield back thank you very very much uh for what is a really powerful testimony and uh as we noted before that it's personal experiences in people's lives uh that uh on the one hand and and i guess tragically you saw the other side of that coin uh congressman um with uh with i believe your sister-in-law and you you know you know and how uh uh how people cope with these this is real tragic in a child's uh in a child's life and and and what happens uh but again you know and i've had the opportunity to meet your wife and uh uh and and uh but to to take that experience in uh for the two of you and to you know work with 12 000 students uh really is is quite extraordinary and you you know um you you so many ways you save people's lives you turn their lives around and there isn't anything more important than any of us any of us can do uh so and the whole issue of of of child sexual abuse uh is is um uh and and my sense is though i don't have any statistics you know at my fingertips is during this a period of time this you know with covid and you know that we probably have seen the increase of that of of that abuse and we try to think about how we try to prevent it but when we can't prevent it how is it that we try to address the needs of of these children and you may have said but 91 of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by someone the child or the child's family knows that is what is so egregious uh about this about this issue and i will just tell you that in 2020 um the cdc did establish that new funding line it was for a million dollars uh 2021 it's been one and a half million dollars um uh and what would the cdc was was looking to do is to research and evaluate the appro approaches uh to prevent adult perpetrated sexual child abuse uh so uh the line item uh is is there uh let us work together to see about uh how we might be able to increase uh the opportunity to be able to increase the scope of the effort and uh bring uh uh you know bring solace uh to uh you know to or to to to to youngsters uh what a well what an unbelievable effect it has on their lives uh and oftentimes their lives end in tragedy uh because of this ex because of this experience so thank you for what you and your wife have done on on your own to address this problem but i know that we want to work with you uh to see how we can engage uh with a uh with the cdc and the federal response uh to to increase uh the opportunity to uh uh to bring um uh you know uh these children to come to grips with what's happened to them and to be able to be able to move on so thank you very very much i look forward to working with you i know we both do congressman cole tom i'm you thank you thank you man although i usually perform better muted

thank you mr speaker mr speaker nearly 50 years after the voting rights act was signed into law we still see efforts to weaken voter protections and suppress votes discriminatory voting laws such as strict photo id requirements and reduced early voting disproportionately impacts minority voters in the name of preventing widespread voter fraud a problem that simply does not exist clearly since the supreme court's decision two years ago to erode some of the vra's most critical protections including pre-clearance requirements that protect against disenfranchising laws that voting right the voting rights act is still needed more now than ever before yet republicans have refused to allow renewed and strengthened voting rights act to come to the floor this should concern everyone who believes in the right to vote is one of the most fundamental to our democracy it is time we renew and strengthen the voting rights act mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time 4

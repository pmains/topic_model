news that broke just when we were getting ready to come back out of our break senator mitch mcconnell is now pro-impeachment saying this to in the new york times mitch mcconnell the republican leader has told associates he believes president trump committed impeachable offenses and is pleased that democrats are moving to impeach him believing that it will make it easier to purge him from the party that's according to people familiar with his thinking does that help you get some republicans on board that mitch mcconnell thinks it's a good idea to purge trump from the republican party shame on mitch mcconnell what mitch mcconnell should do is call the senate back to the capitol to prepare to receive the articles of impeachment that we will send over they should prepare for a speedy trial and absolutely excise this cancer from our country let alone a party this isn't about a party this isn't about politics this is about protection of our constitution of our rule of law this man is an infection deadly infection and mitch mcconnell and others shame on them congresswoman do you feel like the vote on impeachment will be bipartisan we have word that it will be you saw overwhelming numbers of democrats who are original co-sponsors i'm one two uh and we have word of at least an important handful of republicans so the measure will definitely pass but this is a moment this is a reckoning for the republican members of the house to say where was i at this time in our history when our capital was attacked when a riotous mob incited by the president incited by his lies and those around him who have lied for months and years came in in search of assassinating the speaker hanging the vice president hunting down members of congress these folks need to figure out do they believe in their sworn oath of office if not resign do you think that the calls from republicans outside of the chamber chris christie said that if insurrection isn't an impeachable offense it's hard to name one that would be mitch mcconnell saying that purging trump from the party is appropriate now i'm i'm in your camp you know where were you when he saw good people on both sides of charlottesville and when he was telling the lie that would lead to its obvious conclusion the rage that spilled into violence but are these calls at this point better than nothing are they helpful or are they meaningless other weak they're feckless they're an attempt to try to rebuild a shattered absolutely shattered set of reputations but their reputations are destroyed forever destroyed franklin said its reputations are like pottery once you break it it's hard to put it back together so they're just weak attempts at trying to restore themselves everything that they have done the lies that they promoted on behalf of this president that radicalized this group of people into attacking their own country they are responsible for that they should be held responsible for that and i know wednesday was um a day so traumatic and shocking that everyone is still processing it but if the mob didn't represent a grave enough threat republican members many of them refused to wear masks and now there is a proposal to have a fine for members that don't wear masks can you talk about i mean at some level it's shocking that that's necessary that leaders refuse to lead but is this something at this point that's that's a simple necessity to protect your members honest to god could you imagine we're coming down to fines for these clowns uh i was in that room excuse me pardon me um i was in that room we were shocked at the selfishness the political division that has nothing to do with a pandemic we were literally in a secure location for four hours a closed room and they were asked the the the house physician was in the room with us they were asked to put on masks and instead they scuffed that is such a reflection on them and of course now we have at least three members infected where this film's being shot is exactly where i was standing with susan wilde exactly where i was and these guys are so self-centered i thought being in politics and and serving others was actually about somebody other than me i this nonsense with the mask which is ultimately deadly is based in ignorance and selfishness and i don't know if a fine meets the moment i want to ask you about your state a lot of donald trump's lies which were echoed and amplified by the likes of rudy giuliani and and the folks that traveled around with him masquerading as a legal team we're focused on what happened in your state and and i just want to put you on the spot and ask you if you feel safe no i don't no so how do we protect you i was on the secure call last night the briefing last night about security and i want to really lift up we we heard from the acting uh chief of the capitol police we heard from the assistant acting chief we heard from the acting sergeant-at-arms i want to list lift them up and their members who did their duty against all odds they were outmanned and you have to know inside we didn't see that i didn't see television for hours we didn't realize how outmanned they were so i want to lift them up but do i feel safe no we have a new day i i know that people of good will and all the agencies the secret service the national guard the metropolitan police the capitol police are doing everything in their power to make sure we are safe but wednesday did not have to happen and we have to get to the bottom of why it happened number one it's the infectious lies uh as you point out donald trump is an infection an impeachment will take out that host of that infection uh the senate needs to convict so the host is fully taken out and then we have to look at who were the other hosts that spewed lies that radicalized people to attack their congress well there are some of your peers i mean do you do i mean some some of them are people that you see when you go to work is it an overstatement to say that they endanger their own colleagues it seems that that is um maybe the nicest thing you could say about them these days i i am very worried and i hope uh that and sadly think of the change you you're familiar with walking in and out of the capitol think of the changes that will take place that my grandchildren won't be able to walk in freely but now we will have metal detectors as we walk onto the house chamber that shouldn't be but now it's necessitated again by the ignorance and the selfishness of others a brand new member of congress sworn just a few days ago posting a video uh so proud of uh packing her glock as she walks into the capitol are you kidding me do you have any sense of decency and of your oath so i am worried for my safety and i hope capitol police and every other law enforcement agency that needs to be a part of this assures all who work there i think of the staff who were put at risk the journalists i was up uh in the gallery with your colleagues that was disgraceful their lives were put at risk first by a radical insurrection incited by the president and people on the floor of the house and then their lives were put at risk by selfish republican lawmakers who wouldn't put on a mask something's got to be done we're not safe i started to ask you what can be done um in the near term i mean are you convinced that steps are being taken to keep members and journalists and staff safe tomorrow and the next day and leading up to the inauguration of joe biden and kamala harris i am i am confident we had a briefing we will have more briefings i am confident they're doing everything in their power uh and i implore all my colleagues and and their staff i i won't let my staff come in i don't want them in i didn't i made sure they didn't come wednesday uh but i i implore everybody to be on the watch for your own safety ask for help i intend to ask for help to make sure that i am safe uh i don't want to endanger my kids or anybody else yeah so i'm i'm very worried but i'll do everything in my power to stay safe i have hope for the future i do want to say that we have some things in place we do have elected people in the house and i believe in the senate of goodwill who will recognize this moment this historic moment the darkest day i will remember i'm certain in a long long long line of days but i am certain with a new administration new leadership in the senate and our continued leadership in the house democratic caucus brighter days are ahead we will tackle the virus of the pandemic the economic collapse the social reckoning and most importantly we will tackle the virus of lies i can't think of a more urgent mission than decontaminating all the lies that are now been people have died in the name of those those lies congresswoman madeline dean thank you so much for your candor for stopping and talking to us today we're really grateful please stay safe i don't mean as a line please do

well good afternoon everybody and welcome it's 4 10. 55 at the airport 58 of their studios 57 in palmer and 53 in kenai some scattered showers tonight with low of 47 and rain showers tomorrow with winds gusting to 30 miles per hour with a high of 54. all right 52206.50 is our phone number joining us right at the beginning of the program is republican candidate for u.s senate dan sullivan dan how are you doing this afternoon hey mike i'm doing great how are you doing well wonderful wonderful well um one of the things that's going on certainly in the uh halls of congress and certainly um all over the nation is this whole business with the veterans administration yeah and you uh know a little bit about uh the military when you signed in what what were you promised i mean here's here's the deal to me if we promise a man or a woman who joins the military certain benefits isn't it our responsibility and our duty to come through and do what we say we're going to do absolutely it's a sacred trust of the federal government to our men and women who have fought and sacrificed for the country and i'll tell you this and you know from my campaign there's a lot of things i think the federal government should not be doing especially here in alaska they're over regulating the heck out of the entire economy and our lives but one thing they should be doing is taking care of our vets and that's why this is an issue we've been uh highlighting since day one when i launched my campaign in october now uh senator rubio has a bill in the senate i guess there was a bill it's a companion bill to a bill that passed the house and he seeks to to get some help for the secretary of veteran veterans administration uh to try to give them the power to uh to basically clean house this was opposed by the democrats and now they seem to be uh for it what what's your what's your take on it well look i think cleaning up the bureaucracy is clearly uh an important thing that the congress needs to be able to do but there's a broader bigger issue that's going on right now last week uh the american legion and i joined them called for general shinseki's resignation he's the secretary of the va a great american there's no doubt about that serve this country honorably served in vietnam but what this administration has not done is held anyone accountable or put anyone in terms of leadership to take care of a problem that has only grown dramatically in the last five and a half years under the obama administration and everybody who's focused on this knows it's been a problem it's just that certain people whether it's shinseki or president obama or mark begich who sits on the veterans affairs committee haven't given it the time attention and accountability it deserves so how does it get fixed in well i think first of all mike what you need to do is you need to make people accountable you have a secretary of veterans affairs who under his watch the backlog and wait times for veterans returning from war has increased in terms of the backlog from in 2009 about 150 000 to over 600 000 by last spring what the usa today called a national disgrace and to show that we're very serious about this what you need to start with is accountability at the top and whether it's been benghazi or the irs this administration doesn't want accountability at the top you need to start there well it's going to be interesting to see how this now moves through the halls of congress hopefully quickly you just never know what's what's going to happen in that body sometimes but what would you what would you do if you were in there now well i certainly would join right now there's a lot 11 senate democrats who have joined the american legion and a number of republicans to call for general uh shinseki's resignation the other thing that's remarkable despite the number of ig reports in other reports that have come out and shown the huge problems and by the way the president when he was campaigning to be president highlighted this is a huge problem and committed to fixing it there's only been seven oversight hearings uh with the senate veterans affairs committee during this congress on this hugely important issue so what that needs to happen is accountability and a congress is actually engaged and um when you know mark begich was quoted recently saying if there's a problem the obama administration needs to fix it well senator it's not if there clearly is a problem and it's not just the obama administration it needs to be the congress and nobody seems to be standing up and doing anything until recently then it's not just it doesn't seem to be just this people that i talk to that are in va hospitals and and uh and not here i think here people that that uh are treated by the va seem to seem to be uh happy with their with their experience but in other places it seems that the care could be a whole lot better and it just i guess you touched on this earlier takes forever and as you know if you are injured in a wartime injury that delay could cost you your life yeah and look you know um mike the other thing here it's not just this issue like i said on veterans day we put out a paper called the promises delivered project that focused on these issues and how important it was to keep the sacred trust responsibility with our vets i was training my marines in december i'm still in the reserves and one of my marines came up and asked me if he if i had seen this budget deal that the congress had passed in december i hadn't he said uh it was going to eviscerate his retirement he was 19 years in he was getting ready to retire when i got back home to alaska i looked into it he was exactly right tens of thousands of dollars taken from our veterans retirement benefits guys who were disabled guys are getting ready to retire and it didn't this budget deal didn't focus on any other federal workers it focused solely on our military veterans and mark baggett's voted for that it is even broader than the va issue and i think that we're uh we're really undermining that sacred trust or responsibility yeah we are i mean we we ask the military to do some pretty impossible things these folks volunteer they go in and they're told this is what we will give you and that you're absolutely right is a sacred trust if i promise you something i need to deliver on it and uh it's also something that as i mentioned the federal government man there's a million things we need to have them stop doing but they need to start doing this one better well yes they're this is this is where they are responsible clearly this is one of the things the constitution says they're supposed to do yes yes so we're going to continue to focus on that i've asked you know i've asked senator begets to join me join his 11 senate democrat members of the u.s senate to call on the resignation of general shinseki and shake that administration up and it looks like right now he's just taken orders from the white house and um right now they don't want to get rid of them so mark baguets is going to toe the obama administration's line on this even though uh democrats as liberal as al franken are calling on the resignation as shinseki i think mark vegas needs to join him all right dan thanks so much any uh campaign events coming up or well mike we just uh actually last night uh speaking of veterans we launched our veterans coalition uh in fairbanks we got uh leaders in the valley in anchorage we had a great coalition of veterans from all different eras different wars at our event last night in fairbanks and for the veterans who want to join sullivan2014.com i am going to continue to beat the drum and focus on these issues particularly because we have a senator right now is not doing the job on it all right dan thanks

uh thank you chairman taco uh look in my opening statement uh paul i i discuss the increase in poverty and injustice as we as the democrats do away with fossil fuels by the year 2035 but in so doing that we have to understand and i understand when we go to renewables we're going to be it is our desire long term but it means we'll be increasingly dependable dependent on renewables therefore we need to consider the battery storage to back them up so just for the sake of this conversation today let's focus on the injustices involved with the supply chain for batteries no and i would say paul no one wants to see sausage made but they all love to eat it but the same goes for batteries two of the key ingredients and batteries are lithium and cobalt but have you ever seen have you ever seen how they source that material here's in cnn i did an article let me see if i you got that this is an article that cnn posted of children in congo being forced into labor to harvest cobalt here's another picture of those of in another cobalt mine in the congo these are we're continuing to uh to have child labor because they're enabling these dictators to use child labor or what about lithium have you ever seen the ravaging effects of lithium here's here's a picture of a lithium mine look at that look at the depth in the community these are ravaging effects we're having on communities all across this world in our pursuit of having battery storage so and for those of us that have been concerned with mountaintop mining this is mountaintop mining on steroids and according to mark mills of the manhattan institute he says we're going to have then he testified it we're going to have to testify he testified that we're going to move 250 tons of earth to produce just one electric vehicle battery 250 tons and we for the in this build where there are 650 000 cars in the federal fleet so just do the math and it comes about 163 million tons of dirt we're going to have to excavate around the world now maybe maybe this idea of doing away with fossil fuels makes democrats feel good and it but but keep in mind this procurement's not going to happen in the united states it will happen in other countries kind of out of sight paul away from us we're exporting our guilt it seems like environmental justice stops at the border we don't care what's happening in other nations what we're doing as long as we get ours shame on us we're devastating these countrysides of other nations to satisfy our thirst for batteries so let's stop for a minute we're creating poverty perpetuating child labor in china and south america and destroying the environments of other countries that's justice give me a break so if i could ask a question to uh derek holly last month before the committee former secretary many said we need to do more of this mining of these critical minerals in the united states do you agree with him here callie you're muted can you hear me yeah now i can yes sir i agree with you um and everything that you said about the mining and it's an absolute travis how we as you said environmental justice stops here at the border where we go and get everything we need from other countries thank you so wouldn't it make more sense to invest in innovation here in america so that we could get fossil fuels to balance out our needs and do it in a cleaner way wouldn't that make more sense yes sir it would so oh so again with these policies we understand we've had testimony are utility bills are going to increase our neighbors are going to be unemployed will still have extreme weather conditions and all while we're alien in other nations as we ravage our countryside is it worth it mr hulley is it worth it no sir it's not um no sir it's not and and you talk about the precious minerals that we need therefore to produce this the the the stuff that we need we have one mind up in minnesota right now um what that produces cobalt and environmental groups want to shut that down and this is an awful travis it's just a shame and the president just stopped to mine a copper mine that we need in arizona i just think this is just hypocritical uh uh issue in many respects on it and and and i don't think i don't think we as a a country we're doing justice to the world by what we're trying to accomplish here so i thank all of you in a yield backbone anytime

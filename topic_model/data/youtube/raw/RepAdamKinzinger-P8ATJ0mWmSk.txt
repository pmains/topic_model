  REOPENING, AT LEAST SOME OF  THEM. >> Reporter: A FEW. A FEW. >> EVEN A FEW. THAT'S REMARKABLE. WITH ME REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KEEN ZINGER. WE ARE TRYING TO DETOUR  OURSELVES. >> LOOK, I AM NOT TOO CRITICAL  OF WHAT JOE BIDEN HAS DONE SO  FAR, I THINK IT WAS GOOD AND THE AID PACK YESTERDAY WAS GOOD, AND I SUPPOSE A NO-FLY ZONE IN AT  LEAST THE EASTERN CORRIDOR, AND  THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE  WEAPONS TO BRING THOSE AIRCRAFT  DOWN. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN WE ARE  OUT SAYING CONSTANTLY WHAT WE  WON'T DO AND WE ARE TALKING  ABOUT, IN ESSENCE, A FEAR OF  WORLD WAR III, WE'RE ALL WORRIED ABOUT WORLD WAR III, AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE DO MORE TO DETOUR  OURSELVES FROM ACTION THAN  PUTIN, BECAUSE ALL WE ARE DOING  IS SAYING WHAT WE WON'T DO. >> BY SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET INVOLVED NO MATTER WHAT, OR  DEFLECTING WHEN THE  ADMINISTRATION IS ASKED ARE WE  GETTING INVOLVED IF THEY USE  CHEMICAL WEAPONS OR IF THEY USE  A SMALL NUCLEAR WEAPON, GOD  FORBID, THAT ALLOWS VLADIMIR  PUTIN TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS? >> YEAH, IT GIVES HIM THAT LINE  HE CAN GO UP TO. WE, ACTUALLY, ARE MORE  QUESTIONING WHAT HE'LL DO. HE NEEDS TO QUESTION WHAT WE  WILL DO. I DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE ARE DEMANDING ANSWERS TO  EVERYTHING THAT CAN HAPPEN, AND  THERE'S A BENEFIT TO STRATEGIC  AMBIGUITY. AT THE SAME TIME THERE HAS BEEN  A LOT DONE. THIS DOESN'T NEED TO BE ENTIRELY CRITICAL, BUT I THINK THERE ARE  OTHER TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX WE  COULD USE. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE  UKRAINIAN FORCES AND THEIR  ABILITY TO HOLD OFF RUSSIAN  FORCES? >> IT'S INCREDIBLE. IT'S A SHORT FALL IN THE RUSSIAN MILITARY, OF COURSE, AND IT  SHOWS HOW GREAT THE U.S. WEAPONS ARE AND MORE THAN ANYTHING IT  SHOWS WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE A  FIGHTING SPIRIT, TO HAVE A  LEADER THAT IS GOING TO STAY  THERE. I DO THINK VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY  WAS THE KEY. WHEN HE SAID I'M NOT GOING  ANYWHERE, YOU SAW THE MORALE OF  THE PEOPLE INCREASE. LOOK, IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG,  HARD SLUG, AND I THINK VLADIMIR  PUTIN HAS NO INTENTION OF  LOSING, WHICH IS WHY WE ARE  WORRIED ABOUT THE ESCALATION. >> DO YOU THINK HE'S A WAR  CRIMINAL? >> 100%. I THINK HE WAS A WAR CRIMINAL  BEFORE THIS WHEN YOU LOOK AT  WHAT HE HAS DONE IN SYRIA AND  WHAT HE HAD DONE IN GROSNI. AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO SEE MORE  AND MORE OF DEAD RUSSIAN  SOLDIERS OR CAPTURED RUSSIAN  SOLDIERS, AND IT'S PURE UTTER  EVIL THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE FRANKLY AROUND WORLD WAR II. >> PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY ADDRESSED CONGRESS YESTERDAY. WHAT WAS IT LIKE IN THAT ROOM  AND WHAT WAS THE TALK AFTER  THAT? >> JUST A GREAT SENSE OF, YOU  KNOW, THIS AGREEMENT ON WHAT WE  SHOULD DO NEXT. OBVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE MAY TRY TO JUST MAKE THIS A POLITICAL ISSUE SO THERE'S SOME OF THAT TALK,  BUT CERTAIN UNITY. THE ONE THING VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS DONE THAT I DIDN'T THINK ANYBODY COULD IS UNITE CONGRESS AT LEAST ON ONE ISSUE, WITH A FEW  EXCEPTIONS, OF COURSE, THAT LIKE TO SPEW RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA. IT'S A SENSE WHERE THE OLD DAYS  WHERE AMERICA COULD DISAGREE ON  CERTAIN ISSUES, BUT WE ALL  AGREED ON THE SOVIET EMPIRE. >> DO YOU GET A SENSE THERE IS A RED LINE FOR A MAJORITY OF THE  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS? I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT SAYING THERE'S A RED LINE FOR IT AT THE MOMENT, BUT DO YOU GET A  SENSE THAT CONGRESS FEELS  THERE'S SOMETHING VLADIMIR PUTIN CAN DO THAT THERE'S JUST NO  GOING BACK FROM? >> YEAH, IN MY MIND, 100% OF A  NUCLEAR WEAPON, AND THAT'S NOT  THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD  RIGHT AWAY, IT DESTROYS CITY  BLOCKS. THAT HAS TO BE A RED LINE. VLADIMIR PUTIN COULD POSSIBLY  USE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN HOPES THAT NATO BACKS OFF. I THINK CHEMICAL WEAPONS, YOU  WILL BEGIN TO SEE PEOPLE  COALESCE AROUND THAT. LOOK, LOOK AT THE PERIOD BEFORE  WORLD WAR II, IT'S ALWAYS GREAT  TO LOOK AT LEADERS THAT MADE  TOUGH DECISIONS, BUT THEN WHEN  YOU ARE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION,  AND I AM NOT COMPARING THIS TO  APPLES TO APPLES, BUT WHEN YOU  ARE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION THOSE DECISIONS ARE HARD TO MAKE AND  WE NEED TO THINK WE COULD BE IN  A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE TO  INTERVENE. >> HOW WOULD WE INTERVENE? WHAT WOULD WE DO? >> THE POTENTIAL USE OF A  NUCLEAR WEAPON OR CHEMICAL  WEAPONS, I THINK YOU HAVE TO  DESTROY RUSSIAN FORCES AT THAT  POINT. YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT  THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE RED LINE,  AND NOT BECAUSE WE HOLD THE  STANDARDS BECAUSE THERE IS NO  WAY THIS COULD ESCALATE INTO  EUROPE IF THAT IS DONE. THERE'S NO WAY YOU BRING BACK A  SECURE WORLD ORDER. WE COULD HAVE A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND  RUSSIA, AND THE UNITED STATES  DOESN'T WANT, BUT I WILL BE  CLEAR, IF IT'S THE U.S. AND  RUSSIA, THE RUSSIAN ARMY WOULD  NOT STAND A CHANCE. >> BUT THERE ARE NUKES. >> CERTAINLY. AND THE CAREFUL THING IN ALL OF  THIS IS WE CANNOT LET VLADIMIR  PUTIN THREATEN NUKES AND CROSS  ALL THE WAY ACROSS EUROPE  BECAUSE WE ARE TOO SCARED TO DO  ANYTHING. >> IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU,

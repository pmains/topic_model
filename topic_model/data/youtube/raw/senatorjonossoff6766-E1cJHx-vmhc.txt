good morning it is my professional and personal honor to participate in this hearing i'm here today seeking accountability for the appalling situation at united states penitentiary atlanta once the flagship of the bop it is now a penitentiary in name only as a chief psychologist at usp atlanta from 2018 to 2021 i repeatedly reported ongoing uncorrected gross mismanagement of suicide prevention practices staff misconduct and general operational deficiencies unfortunately the only response i received was unlawful retaliation i was involuntarily transferred to an fci in segalville texas though i'm speaking today in my personal capacity i have been an employee of the federal bureau prisons for 15 years for the first 11 i was assigned to various psychology departments at high or maximum security male institutions from 2018 to sorry from 2015 to 2018 i was a psychologist with a supervisory role in the super max also known as the adx the facility in florence colorado the most secure institution in the country in 2018 i accepted the chief psychologist position at usp atlanta where my mission was to turn around a deficient failing psychology department i was responsible for integrating standardized procedures on inmate mental health issues the provision of sound clinical care to the inmate population developing and implementing mental health treatment and best practices and tracking and analyzing program adherence like most bop employees i am first and foremost a federal law enforcement officer in addition to providing mental health care i'm responsible for ensuring the safety and security of the community the staff and the inmate population that includes pat downs searches and other security related duties upon my arrival and for the duration of my time at usp atlanta the facility was falling apart elevators were inoperable for months at a time the walls were infested with mold whenever it rained the sewer would break would back up and overflow onto the recreation yard sometimes leaving a foot of human waste behind security wise there was little to speak of given the volume and flagrance of the contraband it was obvious that cell searches were not being properly conducted if at all for instance i confiscated a microwave that i found while searching an inmate cell two days later i found the same microwave in another cell it was the same serial number of course my assignment and primary concern was the inmate mental health and suicide prevention in the roughly four years eight inmates at usp atlanta died by suicide two prior to my arrival and six during my tenure to put this into perspective federal prisons typically see between one and three suicides over a five-year period any loss of life is tragic and unacceptable which is why it is particularly devastating to see such disregard for human life at usp atlanta bop policy requires that a suicide reconstruction team is sent to investigate circumstances of any inmate suicide the team prepares a report detailing findings and making recommendations to prevent reoccurrences this report is sent to on-site regional and national offices in the bop and the institution must provide a written response to any recommendations while at usp atlanta i reviewed seven reconstruction reports each prepared by different teams and all seven reports feature some same issues inmates suffering from ongoing substance abuse easy access to drugs unit rounds which were required to be done every half hour were routinely skipped for hours at a time i repeatedly expressed my concerns about other systematic failings to management and nothing was done despite desperate need for reform any suggestion for change was met with resistance that's not the advantage way some of the examples of the atlanta way included an employee yelling threats and obscenities aggressively approaching an executive staff member though i was five months pregnant and terrified i stepped between the two and pushed the employee away i reported the employee and nothing was done another time my husband was repeatedly hit by a staffer he required medical attention and the attacker remained at work i was warned to stay away from him in 2020 a program review team found that the staff had broken machines intended to detect traces of blood of drugs this had been going on for a year the agency's response was to move 43 mid-level supervisors across the countries it was during the midst of the covet pandemic our families had set down roots and we had done nothing wrong the agency refused to give us responses today i'm asking that you help this agency staff it at one hundred percent provide mid-level management with tools to actually make changes we have lots of responsibility and yet we have little authority when there is discipline make it fair and swift i thank you for your time thank you dr ramirez ms whitehead you may now deliver your opening statement good morning good morning chairman ossoff ranking member johnson and members of the subcommittee thank you for inviting me to testify today who am i and why am i here i am an upper management retiree after serving more than 30 years with the federal bureau of prisons i am here because of the many abuses and gross management i personally witnessed while serving at usp atlanta i was shocked and appalled by the usp atlanta big picture on a daily basis there were numerous policy violations which put the staff inmates and the local community in danger for example there were so many rats inside the facility dining hall and fruit preparation areas that staff intentionally left doors open so the many stray cats that hung around the prison could catch the rats it is never a good idea to leave prison doors open there was no professional pest control service in place because management officials could not work together and determine which department of budget was responsible for the cost i arrived at usp atlanta in august 2020 six months into the pandemic and at that time staff were not provided appropriate ppe to perform their duties within the pandemic also there were no designated covert 19 isolation or quarantine areas in the detention center unit in august 2020 it was reported half of the 300 security cameras did not operate appropriately and the other half were off by three hours this was not the first time this had been reported there were missing security controls and equipment to include keys handcuffs and pepper spray key control at other build facilities that i have worked is paramount to maintain safety and security then there is the atlanta way the atlanta way is far from norm and certainly not the bureau of prisons way most of the staff at usp atlanta are very proud that atlanta does things intentionally different the blp has a policy on staff conduct and ethics reports of unethical behavior must be investigated and if warranted discipline is imposed however at usp atlanta the atlanta way is where staff are not held accountable for misconduct inmates are not challenged for negative behavior and regular maintenance and routine repairs are non-existent staff members are actually involved in physical fights at work which cases are uninvestigated and or staff subsequently promoted within marijuana is routinely smelled inside the prison but there are no searches to determine which inmates for smoking inmates are observed in zombie state and nothing is done in an effort to determine the source of the illegal substances all blp staff members are correctional workers first to include secretaries psychologists teachers and wardens conducting searches is corrections 101 at bop facilities i never saw a pac search conducted at the usp atlanta and in august 2020 in july 2021 reports indicate area searches were not being done as the jail administrator at usp atlanta i tried to make positive changes by voluntarily training less experienced staff by correcting security violations and reporting staff misconduct my efforts were very unappreciated i was ostracized by staff i was victimized by the agency with a forced relocation to a texas facility which led to my retirement much earlier than planned in august 2021 the pseudo solution to addressing the usp atlanta problems was to move 43 management officials out of 432 staff members what i witnessed was outrageous i never expected to be here today now that i am i ask for your immediate help i truly believe the problems can be fixed with the right people and mindset please continue the kind of oversight you are doing today hopefully it will result in real accountability and stop the abuses you're hearing about thank you for your time thank you ms whitehead ms shepherd you may now deliver your opening statement and to our panelists you may hear buzzes and bells from the camera and they have nothing to do with you or your time they're just indicators of what's happening on the floor so don't be alarmed ms shepherd chairman ossoff ranking member johnson and members of the subcommittee thank you for inviting me to this hearing today i focus my testimony on the unacceptable conditions of confinement for clients who are detained pre-trial awaiting trial and presumed innocent at usp atlanta defenders see firsthand how usp atlanta subjects people to inhumane and substandard conditions and limits their access to attorneys which in turn interferes with their sixth amendment right to counsel the result is deplorable and punitive conditions which courts defenders and our clients have observed for decades i want to begin by sharing a clear picture of what life inside is like one client and i will call him jacob for the purpose of this hearing described his experience in a 2019 affidavit that i've submitted as exhibit b jacob was held in an overcrowded pod where he was locked into his cell for 24 hours a day three to four days at a time he was one of three people squeezed into a two-person cell when jacob was allowed outside of a cell it was for less than an hour every few days the pod only had six showers and three phones that were had to be shared by about 100 people making it impossible for everyone to shower and make phone calls when out of his cell jacob had to choose whether to call his family or to call his attorney but he could not do both even worse jacob sell was infested with roaches and when he asked for cleaning supplies the guards merely laughed i'm sorry to say that jacob's experience is not at all unique for atlanta pre-trial detainees during my eight years as a defender i have seen clients routinely lock down and allowed out of their cells for extremely limited periods of time such as only 15 to 30 minutes three to four times a week or only an hour each day and these lockdowns persists for months clients are treated as though they are in solitary confinement not because of their behavior but because of their misfortune in being placed at usp atlanta lockdowns mean that my clients cannot meet their basic human needs cannot communicate with their families cannot visit with clergy and cannot participate in productive programming jacob also described receiving substandard food and hygiene at usp atlanta his dinner was routinely slices of bread and packages of expired deli meat and he could not supplement his diet with commissary because it was limited to only instant coffee and potato chips again jacob's experience is not unique our clients go months at a time with only sack lunches provided for every meal served in their cells sometimes they find bugs in their food and we see the impact as our clients lose weight and become emaciated given these fundamental failures of care it should come as no surprise that usp atlanta routinely denies our clients access to mental health treatment including medication therapy and access to mental health professionals as chairman ossoff referenced earlier one pre-trial one person on pre-trial detention was held for a week on suicide watch without access to treatment or medication provided only a paper gown and paper blankets i want to turn to a different topic next which is how usp atlanta interferes with the sixth amendment guarantee of effective assistance of council usp atlanta's practices and policies do not allow us to fulfill our constitutional and ethical obligations of zealous advocacy first there are scheduling delays and difficulties as usp atlanta staff members fail to respond to requests for legal meetings often for several days and despite repeated requests it is not unusual for the date of the expected meeting to pass and for there to still be no response from staff members and scheduling a meeting does not mean that the meeting will actually happen because of the facility's chaos and disorganization when we do get to meet with our clients it is often after hours of waiting and while we wait we are on the clock along with the experts and interpreters that often come along with us so taxpayers are bearing the cost of usp atlanta's incompetence clients access to the their discovery the government's evidence against them is also limited because clients do not have access to enough access to the law library due to the lockdowns and have no ability to review electronic discovery with their attorneys even when a court has intervened and ordered usp atlanta to allow law library access the facility has failed to comply the circumstances that we detail today are inhumane and unjust but they are avoidable and they should not be the norm unfortunately the problems at usp atlanta are part of a larger story of systemic dysfunction my written statement includes several recommendations for ways this body could address this unconscionable state of affairs thank you very much for the opportunity to testify today and i welcome any questions you may have

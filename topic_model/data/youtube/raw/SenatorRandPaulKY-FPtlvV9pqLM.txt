a skinny deal senator but it still looks like a pricey one what do you think well you know anybody who wants to give money to the post office you might as well just put it into a big pile on your front lawn and burn it it's a there's no way to give any money to the post office to make the post office redeemable you cannot fix the post office unless you fix their labor problem eighty percent of the cost of the post office is labor about fifty percent of ups costs are labor and fedex is about 38 percent you can't run a business with 80 of your costs being labor when your competitors have much lower costs so really in the end just giving money to the post office is giving money to an operation that lost 8 billion last year so giving them 10 billion it'll be gone within a year's time it's a it's a foolhardy notion and when they call it skinny to me it's just democrat light and i didn't run for office to be just slightly less bad than the democrats all right um the president is for giving him some money so i'm just wondering uh if he just wants this done and you know argue over the details later what do you say the only way i'd give the post office any money would be to have a hiring freeze and they would have to gradually lower their employment significantly there's a third less overall male going through the post office in the last 14 years they need to have a third less employees a few years ago they started through attrition mainly by letting the older employees not be replaced they were getting smaller but they've actually started growing again in the last year or two if you look at the cost even though the numbers of employees haven't gone up the cost are still going through the roof because of the pension being so expensive so really without a mandate to make it a smaller organization you shouldn't give them any money so it's sort of like when you do when you do rescue a company that's failing they have to have reforms nobody comes in with venture capital and just says hey here's a bucket of money keep losing money they tell you you have to change so it's a real mistake to give the post office money unless they significantly reform their ways well whether it's 10 billion or or what i mean the fact of the matter is it's part of an overall stimulus measure that um you know republicans seem to be saying we don't need to be nearly as expensive as democrats want but democrats seem to be hitting they'll sign on to something that might be skinny or not quite as huge now to revisit later so this sounds unending to me well there is no money is the most important thing there is no rainy day fund there's no savings account you can't go over to the federal reserve and open a big safe door find a bunch of money and pass it out the money will be borrowed or the money will be printed and both of them have ramifications we if we do another trillion we'll be at about five trillion for one year we have never ever in the history united states abroad so much so rapidly and i fear the consequences i don't know how quickly the consequences come but i fear that the stock market is going to see that and the stock market is also going to worry about having you know all three branches of government and democrat hands i foresee a catastrophe for the market if the democrats win the election and we keep borrowing money and then they'll be back in december saying oh we need two trillion more so if you give people money and you make it less painful to be in a recession we can stay in a recession longer the recession is created by the government the government shut the economy so all of these governors democrat and republican will not have an incentive to open the economy if you soften the amount of suffering that they've created what we need to be doing is every day broadcasting that your governors are causing the unemployment in kentucky our governor has called 700 000 people to be out of work and he's a single soul person to be blamed for it because no one else had any say in it he's doing it all himself and until that happens and until there's a political penalty for it he'll keep doing it he's still got the restaurant closed even though kentucky doesn't even show up on the radar compared to these other states that have had a significant amount of cases well let me ask you about the president still uh with his executive actions he said we could go to them if congress can't cobble together a deal acceptable uh but there's been no movement on it the move to to cut the payroll tax um that a lot of companies say they're leery to follow up on a because it's just the president saying it doesn't have the stamp of congress it'd be uh if it's temporary at all they're gonna have to give that money back so they're not acting on that concerns as well about uh you know unemployment checks continuing for a while here the devil's in the details and getting states to pay up for a quarter of that that doesn't look likely so are these executive actions uh falling on deaf ears well you know social security's about seven trillion dollars short it's said to run out of money uh in the near future there are people now estimating that we've pushed the time or we brought the time closer to us when social security will be running an annual deficit so i think uh not paying social security taxes is probably a mistake as much as i hate taxes as much as any the rest of those in washington i would rather have lower taxes we've obligated to spend the money unless you're going to reform social security in a way in which you move the age out or you do something to compensate for letting people keep more money then you're just making the deficit in social security bigger and i think that will be a mistake you're right if congress doesn't pass a law the president defers your social security payment what happens in five months if we still can't come to an agreement we send every worker a bill for 500 bucks do you think that's going to get paid you know i i don't see really a good way out of this and also the constitution was pretty clear that the power of the purse resides with congress and you know matter no matter whether the president's a republican and a friend like this president is and i consider him a friend and i support him i also don't want any president even from my party to have so much power that they can control the power of the purse without the checks and balances of congress having to take action well it's something to take up at another time because the president wants to make that payroll tax cut permanent if he were reelected we'll see how that all goes senator it's always good having you thank you for taking the time thank you

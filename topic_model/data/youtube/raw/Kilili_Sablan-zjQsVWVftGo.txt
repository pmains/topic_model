greetings six years ago you hired me to work for you in the United States Congress this was an act of faith for you the people of the Northern Mariana Islands you could not know whether I would be able to represent your best interests in Washington and to be honest I do not know whether I would be able to do the job being a congressman six years later I think we know you have we elected me three times and you would not unless you were sure I was working hard and making life better for all of you we have more federal funding for education for our hospital for water sewer projects more for families who need food or help with see you see bills more money for training local workers this probably sounds like a campaign speech but I'm speaking to you now not to ask for another two years in office I'm speaking to you to ask for a little time off the last six years have been hard on my health flying back and forth from the Marianas to Washington month after month has been especially bad for my back I've tried to ignore the pain and keep up the pace of work but I can no longer do it a doctor still be my only choice is to have surgery to fuse some of the vertebrae in my lower back I'm scheduled for that operation on march second at George Washington Hospital in Washington DC I am afraid and I ask you for your prayers but more than that I feel I'm letting you down for at least two months I will be in recovery from the surgery with limited mobility I will not be able to keep a full schedule at the US Congress I will not be able to fly home I will not be able to work as hard for you as I always promised of course i will have email and the phone so I can stay in touch with my colleagues in Congress and you can stay in touch with me the staff here in the Northern Marianas and in Washington never stop working whether I'm there or not but for two months I will not be there at least not one hundred percent doctors say I have a good chance of full recovery I shall return fit to work but I speak to you now as an employee to the people he works for to explain my situation to ask for your patience and your understanding while I get the medic like a medical care I need most of all again I ask you for your prayers keep me in your thoughts on March second and during the days of healing you have my promise to keep you in form of my progress have to do what it takes to reach full recovery so I can return well and continue to work hard for you thank you very much

jim Himes of connecticut is joining us is a member of the Financial Service this committee on the Intelligence Committee as well your quick reaction on Cuba you support with the president joint wanting to normalize relations with Cuba I do the president laid out exactly right look at you know 50 years this policy has not only not work it is actually contributed to the resilience of the Castro brothers because they've been able to blame the United States embargo for a lot of their local problems so look I understand where that you know where the Florida Cubans are coming from but if they want to not change the policy they probably got to come up with one that actually works which of course we're not we're not here he said the current policy hasn't worked for three years but maybe as the president says try something different all of his tax increased proposals that he's putting out those are dead on arrival in this Republican majority in the House and Senate right the Republicans are not going to raise taxes on rich people or increased banking fees or whatever our financial institutions to pay for increased tax benefits let's say for the middle class they say that's a non-starter right so that's probably true but I think the point of a speech like like what the president said last night was to get people talking about the idea of making community college or just education generally more available to more people right cuz if you get enough people asking that question you can create alignment into Congress that that's actually something we ought to do at which point you eventually roll around to the question how do you pay for it Hey look there's other ways they can learn how to paper I mean I think everybody will agree high school is free why not two years of Community College you increase a little bit given the fact that people need more education to compete in the international environment right now maybe make two years of a community college free but where is that money gonna come yeah no I mean absolutely I think people could accept that look Becca when high school was made free and basically mandatory for everybody high school was kind of a big deal you know if he had a high school education that was actually more than most Americans did today the situation is very different without some post-high school education you're gonna have a hard time staying in the middle class you know where the president wants to get that money to pay for free community college well you know he talked about a couple of things as you pointed out he talked about you know raising the capital gains tax you talked about an idea that actually interestingly enough came from a Republican right can when he was chairman of ways and means proposed attacks on the big banks if the pay-fors are usually the last things you talk about look this there's there's more than one way to skin that cat right if we r you know instead of raising taxes if that's what the republicans don't want to do find programs that we can eliminate to pay for something that we all agree if we do agree that it's a good idea i think everybody's there's still a lot of waste in the government you can find some ways to cut spending in order to pay for something critically important like that yeah we'll call though that's the easy way out for people like me you know i mean what everybody likes talking about waste fraud and abuse because you know who couldn't be who would be for waste fraud and abuse the really tough stuff of course is if you're gonna meaningfully change the budget you of course are gonna eat into somebody's cheese right you know whether it's you know defense or or education or Medicare or social security there are people who care a lot about them i know you gotta cut back to the hill and vote congress but thanks very much for coming in thanks a lot well good luck to you

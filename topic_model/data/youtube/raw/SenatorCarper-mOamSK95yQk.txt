here in come toward welcome one and all especially to our our witnesses today thank you for your preparation thank you for your presence and we look forward your testimony in the opportunity have a good conversation where we joined by some of our colleagues as we get into today's a hearing but sort of a precursor to the today's hearing I was driving in that the train station this morning and the flipping back and forth between the radio stations and i happen to come across one where the Rolling Stones were singing hey you get off of my cloud I always like that I know how appropriate for and we usually don't have theme songs for hearings but if we did that actually might work we actually want to get people on the cloud as I understand it and hopefully when we leave here today I'll understand better what what all that is about but our hearing today we'll examine the the president's plan to fundamentally transform the management of our federal Information Technology assets the message of the plan is clear we need to cut what we can't afford in nurturing environment in which innovative and more cost effective technologies can be employed throughout our government as I've said time and again in in this room and other places that we need to look in every nook and cranny of our federal government domestic defense entitlements tax expenditures and ask this question is it possible to get better results for less money or as a public bus will get better results for the same amount of money the hard truth is that many programs funding levels will need to be reduced even some of the most popular and necessary programs out there will likely be asked to do more with less or more for the same amount of money many Americans believe that those of us here in Washington aren't capable of doing the hard work we are hard to do and that is to effectively manage their tax dollars they entrust us with they look at the spending decisions that we've made in recent years and in question whether the culture here is broken they question whether we're capable of making the kind of tough decisions that they and their families make with their own budgets and I don't blame them for being skeptical I'm afraid that their skepticism has proved well-founded when you look at the kind of avoidable management failures that we've incurred in federal information technology over the past decade or so the past mismanagement of our nation's eighty billion dollar annual federal information technology is not only in tolerable its unsustainable late last year then OMB director Peter Orszag said that fixing the matter the broken management our federal government's information technology was and this is a quote the single most important step we can take and creating a more efficient and productive government and say that again the single most important step we can take in creating a more efficient and productive government based on the information that OMB has released as a part of its review I believe he may be correct the failures of information technology management in federal government have in some case has been spectacular for example GAO found in january of this year those are running the national archives electronic records investment had not been able to identify potential cost and schedule problems early and as a result fill to take any action to address them jl estimates said because of these failures in one troubled project one trouble project taxpayers will lose somewhere between 205 million dollars and 405 million dollars it's real money where i come from today we'll look at the president's 25-point plan to turn this ship around the goals are ambitious and so are the timelines that's a good thing on the direction of our first federal chief information officer Vivek Kundra the plan is to be fully implemented within 18 months of its introduction that's mate 2012 you're keeping score at home but the various goals are broken down into six to 12 and 18 month increments today I'm particularly interested in hearing how we're progressing toward those six month goals the president's plan centers around three main initiatives first the plan fosters a cultural shift aim at making management information of large federal IT projects more effective more efficient second the plan pushes the federal government to adopt cheaper and faster technologies and third the plan demands that we shed or consolidate the duplicate of and wasteful federal data centers in our inventory the plan is a positive first step in tackling the institutional and systemic problems that have plagued federal information technology management for years it may not be perfect but the president mr. Kona should be commended for taking on this challenge and I commend you today I look forward to hearing from our witnesses we look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about how we're progressing toward these goals how agencies are responding and what those of us here in Congress can do to help make this a successful venture

welcome everyone and thank you for joining us i'm congressman mike levin and we're here with our irs congressional district liaison to talk about something that impacts thousands of families in our district the child tax credit throughout the coven 19 pandemic millions of families have struggled under the weight of child care expenses as a father to two young children myself i know firsthand how costly child care can be that's why i was proud to vote approximately one year ago with the expanded child tax credit as part of the historic american rescue plan which has provided much needed relief for families trying to make ends meet this legislation ensured families to get a monthly credit of 300 per child age zero to five years old and two hundred and fifty dollars per child age six to eighteen years old the american rescue plan increased the existing annual per child tax credit of two thousand dollars to three thousand six hundred dollars for each child below the age of six and three thousand dollars for each child between the ages of six and seventeen these savings have helped working families pay for education groceries and other overwhelming costs that come with raising children in all the child tax credit has been a historic achievement in our nation's families it has delivered over 166 million dollars in tax cuts to more than 77 000 hard-working families in north county san diego and south orange county it has benefited 111 000 children in our community and is helping to cut our nation's child poverty rate in half including lifting a staggering 10 300 children in our district out of poverty many families will see even more tax cuts when they file their taxes this year and today we'll learn more about the child tax credit so that families receive the full credit available to them as always my office is here to be a resource for you in this process if you have any questions about the child tax credit or about something else we discussed today please reach out to my office at 760-5 and we'll be more than happy to assist you now i'd like to introduce congressional district liaison brian wozniak who covers arizona california and nevada with the irs's legislative affairs division brian i'll turn it over to you good afternoon congressman levin and thank you for the opportunity to share this important information with your constituents the child tax credit helps families with qualifying children get a tax break and you may be able to claim the credit even if you don't normally file a tax return the american rescue plan made significant changes to the child tax credit this year and the provisions in the american rescue plan provide the largest child tax credit ever and it provides historic relief to most working families the 2021 american rescue plan made six key changes to the credit let's talk a little more about these changes and what the requirements are slide 2 qualifying age for the tax year 2021 only the american rescue plan raises the eligible age for the child tax credit to age 17. it was previously age 16 and we're looking at a child's age as of december 31st 2021 so if the child is under age 18 at the very end of the year they can qualify for the credit slide 3 the maximum credit amount again for 2021 only the american rescue plan increased the child tax credit the credit will now allow families to receive a total of three thousand dollars for qualifying children under age eighteen and up to three thousand six hundred dollars for qualifying children under age six and you can see on the slide it was previously a maximum of two thousand dollars slide four income limits and the credit phase out the child tax credit is subject to a modified adjusted gross income limit and basically the maximum credit starts to phase out once these modified adjusted gross income amounts are exceeded and to receive the full enhanced credit of three thousand dollars or three thousand six hundred dollars per child the taxpayers modified adjusted gross income needs to be equal to or less than the amount in column a so for example you can see there in the first row the amount of income a single person can have and still receive the full credit is 75 000 and if the person's income is above the limit then the credit is gradually reduced to the amount shown in column b slide five a major change the credit is refundable the american rescue plan makes the child tax credit fully refundable so even if someone has a zero tax liability they don't owe any money the taxpayer will generally receive the full credit as a refund slide six the earned income requirement again the plan provides for another major major enhancement for 2021 in that it eliminates the minimum earned income requirements for taxpayers previously in order to be eligible for the refundable additional child tax credit the taxpayer generally had to earn at least two thousand five hundred dollars during the year and earned income of course wages salaries self-employment but for the 2021 tax year even taxpayers who have zero income may be eligible to claim the fully refundable child tax credit for their qualifying children slide seven residency the taxpayer must have a principal place of residence in the united states for more than half of the year that's the basic requirement there are some exceptions for military personnel as well as residents of puerto rico and i should clarify just on this residency uh test that if the taxpayer does not meet the residency test they can still claim the full amount of the child tax credit say someone's living overseas an american national living overseas they can still get the child tax credit and they can use it to reduce the amount of tax they owe but if they didn't live in the u.s for at least half of the year then it may not be refundable to them slide eight taxpayer identification number the person or persons claiming the credit must have a social security number or individual tax identification number so you and and your spouse if married filing jointly must have a social security number or an irs individual taxpayer identification number an itin and just to clarify to receive the child tax credit you must have the ssn or itin that was issued before the due date of the return slide nine qualifying child requirements so the qualifying child must meet all of these conditions the child must be claimed as a dependent on your return the child must be under age 18 at the end of 2021 the child must meet one of the relationship tests and there's a complete list of all the qualifying relationships on irs.gov and the qualifying child must have lived with you for at least half of the year and there's some exceptions for that uh including for children of divorced or separated parents or if the child is away on a temporary absence slide 10 lists some additional requirements for qualifying children the first one their support the child can't be paying for more than half of his or her own support if the child's paying for more than half of their support you can't claim them the second item there joint return doesn't usually apply but the child if they are married and keep in mind they have to be under age 18 but if it's someone who's under age 18 and married they generally cannot file a married filing joint tax return for the year the third item the child must be a u.s citizen u.s national or u.s resident and last the child must have a valid social security number now the child themselves again we're talking a valid social security number it's issued by social security administration and is valid for employment in the us slide 11 advanced child tax credit payments some individuals received up to half of the child tax credit in advance with monthly payments that began last year between july and december if you receive some of those advanced child tax credit payments then you will need to reconcile these payments with the total amount of the child tax credit that you can properly claim on your 2021 return and it's important that you reflect the correct amount of the advanced payments you received otherwise your tax return may and most likely will be delayed now generally most individuals who receive these advanced payments receive less than they were entitled to because we only sent up to half of the amount that we could calculate they were entitled to so if you receive less than half or less than the full amount then you're eligible for you will claim a credit for the remaining amount on your 2021 return and if you didn't receive any advance child tax credit payments and you have qualifying children then you will want to file a tax return to claim the credit and for those people that received advance payments you could see the last item on the slide there we recently mailed a letter letter number 6419 6419 which shows the amount of your child tax of the advanced child tax credit payments that you received and you will want to keep that letter with your tax records refer to it when you uh file your return so slide 12 let's look at some resources in closing the child tax credit it's claimed on line 28 of the form 1040 but taxpayers must also file the schedule 8812 and that schedule is titled credits for qualifying children with other dependents and that's used to calculate both the child tax credit the additional child tax credit and report those advance payments if you look at the slide at the top you have the irs.gov website you have a keyword search and i put several keywords in quotation marks so you could go to irs.gov just type in child tax credit it will bring you to a series of links that talk about what it is what the requirements are frequently asked questions how to claim it etc you could search for the schedule 8812 and look at the schedule itself the third item down is not directly related to the child tax credit but i certainly want to mention the schedule l e p which stands for limited english proficiency if english is a second language to you or perhaps a friend family member neighbor etc we want to let you know that the irs publishes many forms and instructions in up to 21 languages if you want to start getting forms and instructions in a language other than english you simply file a schedule lep with your tax return and we'll send you those forms in that language if we have it available we have most basic forms and instructions available more complex ones a little more difficult then the fourth item right below that many irs.gov web pages are available in up to eight languages so we just don't have english we have spanish we have chinese traditional chinese simplified russian vietnamese korean haitian etc you can change the language on irs.gov in up to eight languages and the last three items on the slide talk about where you can get some help you could uh if you want to do your taxes for free online you can use the free file system just go to irs.gov type in those words free file your income generally needs to be under 73 000 to qualify to use that and you can prepare and file your return online second to last we have the vita program you could type invited that is our volunteer income tax assistance program if your income is under 58 000 you can go and schedule an in-person appointment and meet with someone who will help you prepare and file your return and they also provide tax counseling and if you need to meet with us in person you can search tac tac which stands for taxpayer assistance center or you can simply type contact my local office so with that we don't want to take up too much time let's move on to slide 13 and take some questions from the constituents well thank you very much brian for all that important information i do have some questions we've gotten from people in our community about the tax credit and i'm hoping you can answer some of them before we wrap up first does everyone in the family need to have a social security number to qualify for the child tax credit it's a great question and the answer is no everyone does not need to have a social security number there's some confusion on this point the person who is claiming the credit they and their spouse if they're married filing joint must have a social security number or an individual tax identification number an itin and they need to have it again by the due date of the return that's for the person who is claiming the credit but the qualifying child or children that they're claiming the child themselves must have a valid social security number the child cannot have an itin so person claiming it ssn or itin but the child themselves valid ssn thank you for that will receiving the 2021 child tax credit or advanced child tax credit payments affect someone's immigration status or ability to get a green card no not at all and under the current law receiving the child tax credit or any federal credits for that matter that you're eligible for does not affect your immigration status it doesn't affect the ability to get a green card it will not affect your ability for future immigration benefits they don't look at the federal tax credits it's not considered uh for purposes of u.s citizenship and immigration services and uh can the advanced child tax credit payments or tax refund affect someone's government benefits no uh advanced child tax credit payments or the child tax credit payment itself cannot be counted as income when these other agencies are trying to determine if anyone else is eligible for benefits or assistance or how much you can receive and it basically under any federal program or state or local program for that matter they're generally financed with federal funds if they're financed with federal funds no it cannot be used in any determination for government benefits and finally if someone didn't file a federal tax return and did not receive advanced child tax credit payments during 2021 can they still receive that money now yes they they can still receive the money now if you uh didn't receive the advanced child tax credit payments you can claim the full amount on of the credit on your tax return on your 2021 return assuming you meet all the eligibility requirements even if you don't normally file return you can be eligible and get it refunded i should state there is a three-year statute of limitations to claim your refund so you have three years from this april 18th to claim it but don't wait if you're eligible claim it claim the full child tax credit simply file your 2021 return include the schedule 8812 and claim it on line 28 of your 1040 and use those other resources we reference you have free tax filing you have tax counseling irs.gov website uh the congressman's office contact the aides or myself or the irs or taxpayer advocate service we're here to help you well thank you so much brian for answering all those questions and for sharing this important information and as you said we are here to help thanks so much

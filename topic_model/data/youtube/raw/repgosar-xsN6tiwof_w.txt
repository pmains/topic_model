hello my name is Congressman Paul Gosar and I proudly represent Arizona's 4th congressional district in the House of Representatives much has been said and written about the events that took place 14 years ago on this fateful day words of remembrance courage and sacrifice resonate with every single American but I often find these words failed to effectively capture the true magnitude of that day and the emotion so many of us feel within our hearts how can our words truly capture the unexplainable courage of a firefighter who knowingly sacrifices his life to save those in distress how can words describe the angst felt by the families of the innocents lives lost the heroic actions that took place 14 years ago and the Valor of ordinary citizens first responders and our men and women in uniform who protect this great nation deserves more than words they deserve our actions they deserve our complete and full devotion to upholding the cherish Liberty they gave with their last breaths to defend so today and every day I challenge you to join me in earning the blessings bestowed upon our nation from God and the countless individuals who answered the call of duty when we needed them most honoring them with our actions will speak far greater than our words ever could

Thank You mr. chairman first of all let me also join in the congratulations to you on the chairmanship and thank you for your support for those of us who are new to the committee I consider generally bad form to speak at a first meeting that you're invited to but I would be remiss if I didn't just take a moment to acknowledge the extraordinary career of Louise slaughter she was a friend of mine for nearly 40 years and encouraged many people to get into a government in politics back in in Rochester New York where we hail from but she could not have been prouder than she was of her role here on this committee and I know that she served with distinction was named its chair in 2007 served as chair for four years and then continued until we lost her as the ranking member so I know our community has a long history with this committee has great respect for it but I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge her incredible service to this country to my community and I think it will all always give me a great deal of comfort to know she's looking down upon us thank you be watching you watching over me that's great Thank You mr. chairman [Applause]

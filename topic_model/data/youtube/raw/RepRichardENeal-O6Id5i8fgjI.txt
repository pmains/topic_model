the rostrum speaker's rostrum in the House of Representatives a son of Massachusetts has quoted mr. Webster and he asks that each member of the House assess in their time did they do something worthwhile I would submit to you today after three decades in the House of Representatives but this is amongst the most important undertaking that any of us could possibly be challenged by this is a substantial issue across the country a reminder that you can outlive annuities but you can't outlive Social Security we all subscribe to the idea that retirements supposed to be a three-legged stool plan set up by the employer same time to guarantee of Social Security and some personal savings when you consider that the average Social Security benefit now is about $1,400 a month $1,400 a month and when you look at what's happening to some of these plans as proposed for the multi employers and incidentally this is not just a union issue in the bill that mr. Brown and I have put together which we've discussed I've discussed with secretary minuchin there's an understanding here ten Republicans in the House of Representatives have signed on to this legislation and I think that there would be more that will sign on based on the conversations we've had as we've courted them when you consider that somebody at the age of 65 275 or maybe 80 years old is all of a sudden being told that their to their entire pension plan is near elimination after they've planned for a lifetime it's one thing for a pension plan to fail for somebody who might be in their 20s it's quite another to have the plan fail for somebody who's in their 70s or their 80s where do they go to make it up they took a lower salary during many of those years for the purpose of guaranteeing what retirement might look like and we have a chance to put together a workable plan based on goodwill and by the way some of the good work that you've done mr. chairman over the years on this thank you and in addition I'd like to highlight something else that I think that that bears noting here I was here for the SNL's I wasn't here to help create the problem but I was here for the solution and it was pretty painful and when you look at what happened with the SNL's that came down to a bailout my plan mr. Brown's plan is not a bailout we simply ask the federal government to backstop the risk and I will say that secretary minuchin had an open mind during the almost 45 minute conversation so I was here during the Wall Street collapse when overnight we came to the aid of people on Wall Street and in the end what we're asking here to do is to undertake seriously and I think you set the right tone in your opening comments mr. chairman as did senator Brown with a suggestion that it's important here to listen as well as talk I was tasked with this responsibility I've worked closely with many of the people in the audience here and I must tell you that right now the uncertainty for people and their pensions is going to continue to roil the electoral place across the country as well so with that mr. Chairman I would yield back the balance of my time

mr. president I rise today to speak out in opposition to the nomination of Ryan bounds to sit on the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit I will be voting against his confirmation and I ask all of my colleagues to do the same my reason for this is not just the fact that that in expressing his disdain for multicultural values in a series of college writings he compared efforts to build tolerance and promote diversity to not see book burning it's not just the fact that he advocated against policies designed to make LGBTQ students feel welcome and crackdown on campus rapist it's not just the fact that when a bipartisan judicial selection committee asked him to disclose past controversies he deliberately misled the committee and said there was nothing to worry about now that his controversial writings have come to light he refuses to retract or show remorse for his statements instead he brushes them off as over broad and over heated Ryann bounds writings show he does not believe in a tolerant and diverse America where women and people of color are treated with equal respect in my eyes that alone disqualifies him from sitting on the federal bench but bounds has not received the blue slip approval of either senator from his home state of Oregon no judge in modern history has ever been confirmed without a blue slip from either home state senator and so a vote to confirm him is a direct attack on the Senate's constitutional responsibility to advise and consent the blue slip process is a critical function of the legislative branch it gives every senator a chance to have a say in the federal judges who serve in their home state the nominee to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will have a lifetime tenure if confirmed Ryan bounds will have influence over our legal system for the rest of his life don't the American people and their elected officials deserve a say in whether he should be allowed to fill that seat this debate is not just about one unqualified judge and his racist ideas it's about the duty of the legislative branch to serve as a check and balance on the president over the course of the Trump administration so far we've seen an unprecedented attempt to undermine the blue slip process and pack the courts with judges favored by corporations and special interests I urge my colleagues to stand to take a stand against President Trump's attacks on our legal system protect the integrity of the blue slip process and vote against Ryan bounds nomination the power and independence of the legislature is at stake Thank You mr. president and I yield the floor

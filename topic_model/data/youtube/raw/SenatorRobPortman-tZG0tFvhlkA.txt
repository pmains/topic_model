thank you Mr chairman and again uh Master Tracy thank you for stepping up um you just talked about the untold suffering that's occurring in Ukraine and I appreciate your views on that um how do you feel about sanctions uh sanctions on Russia based on the February 24th Invasion and the ongoing war on Ukraine since then we had some data yesterday uh a projected 7.1 percent decrease in the GDP in Russia in this quarter the fourth quarter about four percent last quarter um in Ukraine it's about 40 50 percent um I I believe our sanctions are not having the impact that we had intended can you talk about the sanctions on Russia and what we should do perhaps to make them more effective if you believe that's the right course Senator I I uh absolutely agree that the right course is uh to stay the course on sanctions to continue tightening the sanctions uh one area that I know you are very familiar with and that we we've talked about is reducing Russia's energy revenues [Music] one mechanism that that is projected to to come into places is the oil price cap I think that is already showing some signs uh um if if if realized that it could be very effective at reducing some of Russia's Revenue but at the same time maintaining some some stability in the the oil Market I think we need to continue um uh looking at who the actors are in the Russian government and and in their their wider networks uh who are a part of the um uh pernicious uh and malign influence that Russia is projecting but I am very mindful you know that as you pointed out and and as I have seen that ukrainians uh particularly now with all of these attacks on the on the civilian infrastructure on the energy infrastructure are suffering I think we want to have it these these sanctions feeling the impact uh sooner rather than later I think based on what I've been seeing of reports we are starting to see sand in the gears of the of the Russian economy we're seeing Russia turning to actors like North Korea and Iran for their their weapon supplies um uh we see that Russia has lost able-bodied workers through mobilization and through through flight and and so I think the expectation is that we are going to continue to see the impacts of our sanctions but I can't predict exactly when that point is when let me say this I hope you will should you be confirmed I think you will be once you're there that you will dig into this issue and give us advice as to how those sanctions can be effectively tightened and from our conversation you know how I feel about the energy exports and how that really is what's funding the war machine uh let me ask you more a broad question a tougher one how do you think you would be most effective in convincing Vladimir Putin his top officials perhaps some effective communication with oligarchs that the illegal brutal and totally unprovoked war is also a senseless war and one that is counterproductive for Russia how would you get Russia to the bargaining table I think by continuing to do what we're doing right now which is [Music] exacting a cost on the battlefield I think we've seen already that that that that that President Putin has had to pay attention to this issue he recently felt the pressure to meet with mothers of of soldiers even though some of the the meeting appeared staged in terms of participants the very fact that he felt the need to to do that I think showed some pressure and so I think continuing to show that that strength of support that Unity of purpose is so very important because my impression of President Putin in his mindset is that he thinks that he is more patient than we are that he can wait us out that our Unity of purpose and will will crumble before uh his does and I think that that need needs to be demonstrated to him that that is not an accurate calculation you believe that he believes that his missile Supply will last longer than our patients in the West he may although his missile Supply appears to be running running low well thank you Mr chairman I hope that you will strongly support the aid package from Congress to continue our help for all the reasons you just stated that this is a crucial time in in Ukraine and to keep pressure on Russia it's important that we maintain our support thank you Mr chairman thank you

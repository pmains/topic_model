reaction Thank You mr. speaker tonight I had a wonderful town till the town hall meeting with my constituents from across the tenth District of Western North Carolina we had a lot of discussions tonight about the government shutdown and about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare my constituents gave me great feedback they said keep fighting because we want to see a repeal of Obamacare but they said we want the President to come to the table negotiate we want Washington to work I also asked my constituents if they had seen their health insurance rates go up as a result of Obamacare fifty-eight percent said they had seen rates go up nine percent said they'd seen them go down and the balance said they'd seen no change so clearly it's harming families with increased health insurance rates and my constituents want to repeal but they want Washington to work and so I call on the president I ask our friends over in the Senate to come to the table with House Republicans and try to come to consensus so we can move our nation forward and do what's right for the people

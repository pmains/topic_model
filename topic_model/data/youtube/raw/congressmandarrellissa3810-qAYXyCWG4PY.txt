and this is congressman darrell Issa and on this Passover week on Good Friday we as Americans have a lot to be thankful for in the middle of a pandemic we're beginning to see good news we're seeing the estimated death toll ratcheted down considerably from over 200,000 to an estimated 60,000 we're seeing the spread of this disease slowed here and around the world and I think as we see the leadership from the administration it's time for leadership in Sacramento to add to that whether it's rolling back a b5 or finding other creative regulatory relief it's time for us to find ways to have Californians be able to be more productive from home or in some other way that we can do safely that's going to take teamwork and I'm committed with all of our leaders federal state and local to do just that in the meantime may you have a joyous Easter and stay safe with your family

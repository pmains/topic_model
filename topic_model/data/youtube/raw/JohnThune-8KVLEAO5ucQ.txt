well there are lots of things for not only the Germans but everybody to hate about the inflation reduction act interestingly enough the tax credits that the leader alluded to as soon as that legislation passed the price for electric vehicles went up by about the same amount as the tax credit so no big surprise there but one of the things I want to talk about with respect to the inflation reduction Act was the massive infusion of money into the IRS 80 billion dollars which is about six times their annual budget and 87 000 new employees at the IRS and many of us asked questions at the time about how those IRS employees are going to be deployed what are these people all going to be doing out there and of course the Administration has not had good answers for any of that but here we are 10 days after the deadline when the IRS was supposed to submit a detailed report about how all that money was is going to be used and we have yet to see any kind of a report to that effect and so 10 days past the deadline lack of transparency 80 billion dollars sort of out there with the IRS and and lots of questions about how it's actually being deployed I would say that anything that's not used directly for taxpayer Services any dollars that don't go into taxpayer Services ought to be frozen Frozen in place until until the IRS submits a plan that makes it very clear to the American people about how this 80 billion dollars and how these 87 000 new employees are going to be used I've got a piece of legislation along with Chuck Grassley it's an accountability act that would require that to happen and I hope that we can get as many people behind that legislation as possible and continue to try and build pressure on the IRS to fulfill its obligation to the American people that when they pass this that they would in fact tell us exactly how these dollars are going to be used they've got an IRS commissioner that is a nominee that's been it was in front of the Senate finance committee last week that they'll probably try and put on the floor for a vote I cannot in good conscience support that nominee as long as there is 80 billion dollars in unaccounted for funding out there and so that's a that's a non-starter for me and I guess I hope that the administration will come forward with that plan but I'm not holding my breath about it

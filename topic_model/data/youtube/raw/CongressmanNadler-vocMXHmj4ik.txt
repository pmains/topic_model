Democrats behind that letter joins me now congressman Jerry Nadler of New York sir it's good to have you with me and some might argue that there is as much evidence to bring a similar case against the Clinton Foundation for its ties and money that it has received so why are you and your colleagues not pursuing any type of investigation into allegations that have been made against CGI because I don't think as much there and I think the press has gone into that and the and is look at everything here you have a direct apparently a direct bride where the Florida where people in Florida who were defrauded by Trump University complained to the enforcement agency there the Florida Attorney General and asked for her to open an investigation within a few days she asks Trump for a big campaign contribution he within days gives a twenty-five-thousand-dollar campaign contribution does it illegally through the foundation but that's a separate question and within a few days later it is discovered that that the investigation is not proceeding on the investigation of Trump University so here apparently is a direct violation or a lot of evidence at least of a direct violation of several different federal statutes whose statute against bribes a statute against depriving citizens of Florida their right of representation by government officials because of money and it's it's it's it's apparently way beyond pay to play it's every evidence of a direct bribe an acceptance of the direct right and on top of that you have the fact that mr. Trump has repeatedly said publicly that he gives campaign contributions in the expectation that public officials will do what he wants and this is apparently exactly what he had what happened here so we know we're as we know that has been pretty open about kind of sprinkling money on the left and the right and in between to make sure that he could have access if necessary when a rainy day comes along but this might an iron threshold and the campaign has pushed back on this because they put out a statement about this inquiry saying that the Attorney General is a partisan hack was turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years and his endorsed Hillary Clinton for president this is nothing more than another left-wing designed to distract from crooked Hillary Clinton's disastrous well every time every listen every time anyone makes an accusation against Trump he doesn't respond to the accusation he doesn't say this is not true because this is inaccurate because despite appearances is not the case he simply makes an ad hominem attack on whoever he's talking about so Attorney General Schneiderman is a partisan hack judge curiel who was it who is in charge of the class action suit brought by people who buy victims of his fraud at Trump University he is unqualified because he's a mex of Mexican heritage it is not an answer to an allegation to say that the person bringing the allegation is is terrible a bad or badly motivated you have to answer what the charges and he never does that because I don't think he can congressman the race now just 55 days left until election day and it's tighter than ever your nominee and Hillary Clinton has made some unforced errors and is sideline now by illness kappa neta one of us human beings but sidelined by illness and losing a few days off the trail are you very concerned with Donald Trump down just five points from Hillary Clinton well I'm obviously concerned with with an election an election is never a certain thing and you never take it for granted I'm glad that she's five points ahead i wish you with ten points ahead but it's a lot better than being even or behind i I think she will win because I have confidence that the American people ultimately not going to buy a total con man and charlatan which is what he is congressman jerry nadler thank you sir I appreciate you making time for me today you're quite welcome

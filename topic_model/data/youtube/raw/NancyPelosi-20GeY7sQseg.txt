the gentleman from New York we should be recognized I move to strike the last word mr. Chairman without objection the gentleman from New York is recognized for five minutes mr. chairman you may recall I was standing here approximately two hours ago waiting to speak with several other members on the efforts of my Republican friends to eliminate Medicare as we know it and for reasons that are known only to the chair I was denied the ability to do that while I'm back and just to review the bidding here's where it was before that order was made we had the chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee a good man a guy I like stand down in the well and say oh no this by the way is someone who was elected by the Republican members to represent him and races all around the country saying that the Ryan plan wasn't a plan it was and i'm quoting here to construct a construct to develop a plan and he said that the proposal was not a voucher program and then he said it was a one-size-fits-all that medicare was draining our economy is what he said well ladies and gentlemen that might be the rationale for our Republican friends wanting to eliminate Medicare but none of those things are true it is not a construct to develop a plan it is the proposal of the Republican Party of the United States of America to eliminate Medicare as a guaranteed entitlement if you don't believe me go get the book that they wrote go get the budget that they wrote go get the bill that they wrote and if you believe that it's not a voucher program listen to their own members talk about it the Medicare program today is not I say to my friends one size fits all my good friend from Georgia mr. Gingrey was on the floor before talking about how it's one-size-fits-all how can it possibly be you can be a member of the United States House of Representatives to not understand how Medicare works each individual senior gets to go to the doctor of their choosing gets to go to the clinic of their choosing gets to decide for themselves where they go and then the doctor and the patient make decisions the only question is are we going to say to citizens who are 65 and older here's a coupon go buy private insurance at twenty-five and thirty percent overhead rather than the Medicare program which the actuaries say cost one point zero five percent and overhead we've also heard them say you're demagoguing we don't really want to get rid of it you do now there is a saying here in Washington that a gaff is when the Republicans actually say what they think so there have been plenty of opportunities to see this Gath in full play now they've been tying themselves in intellectual knots trying to get out from under the basic fact by the way I hope your insurance plan the Ryan plan covers the the twisted arms and limbs you get time yourselves and knots explaining this it is a radical departure from where we are today mr. Gingrich was right even the blind squirrel can find a nut once in a while he was right is a radical just own it show a little a little gumption show that you're prepared to own your own proposals but now that you want to do it and the American people are seeing the difference in Democrats and Republicans now you're trying to squirrel your way out of it with no disrespect to squirrels you say we don't have a plan not only do we pass a health care plan a year ago that extended ten years to life expectancy of Medicare but I'll go one better i'll give you a plan how about medicare not starting at 65 what about 55 or 45 or 35 what is it that health insurance companies do in this country now i know my Republican friends are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Republican Party but that should should of the insurance industry but that should not mean that our seniors lose their Medicare because of it so my friend mr. sessions on mr. Gingrey on for trying desperately to try to figure out how to get out from under your own beliefs we believe in Medicare we created it we believe in social security we created it we believe in the health care act we created it as a matter of fact every improvement of health care in this country Democrats proposed Republicans opposed and now they have a chance to get rid of it and they're doing it but at least if you're going to do it at least if you're going to try to do it don't try to silence people who pointed out and I think the lesson here is it might be later if you had me come back at midnight I would have said if I came back at 2am I would have said it because the American people are going to see what's going on here you have a proposal to eliminate Medicare a proposal to privatize a portion of Social Security by investing in the stock market a proposal to roll back the expansion of prescription drug coverage for seniors you have a proposal to take away the benefits of those 25 and younger to be able to get health insurance that is your proposal own it live with it embrace it because we're not going to let you get out from under it and you may delay me you may gavel me you might tell me you got to come back at two o'clock in the morning it's not going to change the fundamentals of this debate that it will leave fundamentally in Medicare at this point you got two choices tear up your Republican Party membership or give up control of Congress and frankly some of you are going to have to do both children's time is expired for what purpose does the gentleman from New Jersey we should be recognized his strike delay

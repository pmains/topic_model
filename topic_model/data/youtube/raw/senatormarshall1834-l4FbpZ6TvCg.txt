Senator it's good to see you thanks very much for being here you are an elected official your constituents put you there uh he's not an elected official what's your response for him calling you a  yeah well good morning Maria uh Dr palachi obviously visibly shaking at those particular moments why does he protest so much as a young physician myself one of my mentors an orthopedic surgeon told me once a physician loses their reputation they never get it back Dr fauci's lost his reputation he's lied to Congress again as you pointed out the highest paid federal employee in the government over four hundred thousand dollars a year but even more than that he oversees five billion dollars of Grants including significant amounts to Wuhan China via Eco Health don't you think you'd like to know if he's getting any type of funds from Wuhan China or is it from the Chinese government the Chinese Communist Party wouldn't you and your listeners like to know that that's a question I get almost every day why Dr fauci's policies don't make sense why is it a vaccine owned policy and they'll ask me all right gotchas he invested in companies that make vaccines is he invested in Mass companies uh as well so those are common questions I do think America deserves to know well this is just extraordinary okay this is absolutely extraordinary you've got the vaccine makers Pfizer and moderna they're going to generate 95 billion dollars in the coming year or two on these vaccines you're telling me he invested in the vaccine makers and secondly uh here we have Anthony fauci under oath testifying in front of your committee testifying in front of uh Rand Paul uh a couple of times and and not telling the truth we know now that he did push forth a uh a grant uh to Wuhan so pretty much taxpayers in America funded the covid pandemic you know you're exactly right of course Maria you're on top of this 59 of Americans don't trust Dr fauci every time he goes on television the people that declined the vaccine just dig their Hills in more and say no we're not going to do it the other bombshell that we released yesterday was another viral gain of function research project that was denied by the Department of Defense but Dr fauci funded via Eco Health with Wuhan China again so he's lied again we caught him in another lie that's why he's visibly shaking at the end of both sessions of questioning okay but he's still there he's still making his half a million dollars a a year I mean can you do anything about this is he ever going to be held to account for lying under oath isn't that a felony that comes with jail time no this is why the Democrats are are going to be toast this fall right so in November when Republicans get control back of the Senate Rand Paul will be chairman of this committee that that gets to gets uh Dr fauci in front of us so that's why we need the power of the gavel that's why we have to get back control of the Senate we can set the agenda we'll have subpoena power that's the only way to really address this he's not an appointed member of of uh the cabinet he is he serves at the pleasure of the president this President holds nobody accountable he creates crisis rather than solves them this is again extraordinary you know we'll see if you get the gavel because your colleagues on the left want to jam through a voting bill that may very well arguably keep them in power forever Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer moving forward with the Democrats federal election bills he says he's going to use a senate loophole to start debate on legislation this main hurdle obviously is the 60 vote filibuster threshold but Schumer is threatening that Monday there's going to be a vote to blow up that filibuster if Democrats don't get their way will they be able to get away from get away with this well look so far Joe manchin and Kirsten Cinema Standing Tall once again in the face of the president trying to represent their states right but you talk about hypocritical 25 current Senators signed a letter in 2017 begging the Republican party to keep this filibuster but now they're against it and just to simplify things when you hear the word filibuster your viewers need to think about the Supreme Court they want to get rid of the filibuster so they can control the Senate so that they can make Puerto Rico and DC a state and then pack the Supreme Court and federalize elections in their favor it's very simple the filibusters worked great for years it helps helps create more certainty which businesses prefer I mean I've never seen anything like this this is like a dictatorship Senator what are you gonna do about this other than wait for November it is 299 days away from the November 8th election by the way for those of you counting at home yeah we're going to stick together right I've never seen the Republican party uh so together such a cohesive unit standing up to this so number one is we're going to stand together we're going to keep reaching out to Joe and Kirsten I think there's some others that understand those 25 Senators that signed that letter before that are still in the Senate how are they going to go back to their to their uh to their constituents in their states and explain uh in four years when we control the White House and both sides of the Capitol how are they going to explain to them as they see uh See legislation go in a different direction correct so we're going to keep fighting we're going to make sure that Americans know that they're hypocrites I was just incredible he's buying the stocks of the vaccine makers as he's forcing the vaccine down everybody's throats and and and Joe Biden is putting mandates in place never seen anything like this Senator this will go down in history in the history books as one of the most shameful times for Our Country Senator we'll be watching the developments thanks very much you should wear that comment as a badge of honor sir Senator Roger Marshall this morning in D.C thank you sir quick

mr warren it's good to see you i am so proud that patrick industries is in our district and uh most of these guys on this community have heard about the rv industry every time i get a chance to speak about you guys but for the folks that don't know can you go into a little bit more detail about lawn wood like why is it so important to your sector what it actually does and then can you kind of talk about why there is no domestic product that can actually fill that lawn order yes thank you very much um just to give an idea i don't know if everybody on the panel knows what lawn is i brought a sample here so basically it's a thin plywood type product a three-ply product uh ranges in 2.7 millimeter thickness up to 3.6 and ranges in four foot wide seven foot long to nine foot long in length uh our sector or the rv industry consumes approximately 750 000 panels a week to build rvs so it is a very very important part of our rv sector it is used in every rv that is uh purchased in some way shape or form um as far as being able to do it in the domestic side i have been with patrick industries for 20 years and i have been on the forefront of trying to find alternative type products that would work and the real thing comes down to that the particular species of wood that's used to make the lawn is not found in north america the infrastructure that it would take to create that many panels is not there and the amount of substrates as far as the logs even if we were to find a different species that would work the same way would still not meet the requirements that we're looking for we have reached out to domestic suppliers to see if there was a wood alternative and we got no response and you would think that if that was 50 million panels a year that you could build you would try to find a way to do it inside the us but again very very difficult so we do have some people that are trying to do alternative type products uh non-wood products but those have multiple draw packs in them which don't work throughout the whole rv in general thanks so much scott i'm mr chairman i yield back

i'm congressman brett guthrie welcome to our virtual second district academy day i'm a proud west point graduate and one of my greatest honors as your congressman is getting to nominate kentucky's best students to our service academies while we cannot host this in person this year my office and i stand ready to assist any interested student in applying to one of our nation's outstanding service academies i remember going through my process and it's kind of an ancient process to go through which we'll talk about as we move forward but take a little bit of my experiences at west point i remember as i was older out of the army and was visiting franklin roosevelt's home in hyde park guy saw my kentucky plates and he said what are you doing up here and i said well i enjoy touring the hudson valley it's beautiful and he looked at me goes well you ought to visit west point if you like the hudson valley i didn't have the heart to tell him because he got into he goes you ought to go on a game day can you believe they go to school on saturday i said really somebody would go to a place that goes to school on saturday then they have parades i didn't have the heart to tell him that plebes are telling the upperclassman jokes as they're doing the parade but he goes through the whole day and what a wonderful place it is and he finished and i looked at him and i didn't tell him i just said well i've always heard it's a great place to visit but you wouldn't want to live there actually it is a great place to visit and it's a great place to go to school but on everybody really wants to live there and kind of my advice is it's not just a little bit of military and a lot of college it's not a lot of military and a little bit of college it's every 24 7 military and 24 7 college from the time you wake up do you go to sleep actually even while you're sleeping i remember as a plebe having to get up march to the bathroom when i had to go in the middle of the night so it's 24 7 military and it is 20 we had did 20 plus hours of academics so it's a tough place and i will just suggest to you and i didn't do a career in the military but i thought i was do when i went for when i decided to go it's not a place just to apply because you think that it's a great school and it's one that's that's affordable because you're going to be miserable if that's your reason for going you have to at least want to explore or think you might want a career in the military or at least have a good time serving in the military it's some of the best times of my adult career was the time i served in the military so my advice to you is uh it's a great place to go just to make sure you really want to be there but although i like to talk about west point the united states has five surface academies the united states military academy or west point the naval academy or annapolis the air force academy the coast guard academy in the merchant marine academy each school has a slightly different application process i encourage you to explore the resources available from each academy to assess which one might be right for you my office is ready to help you walk through each process once you have decided to apply to a surface academy you must apply to receive a nomination from a congressional office you can receive a nomination from my office or from one of our senators

challenged at the highest levels and serve our country in the most noble of professions cadets and midshipmen at america's service academies accept a lifestyle that is unique and demanding though they differ in terms of their history and missions the military academies have more in common than most people think the service academies all offer a rigorous four-year program their main focus is on

with a bachelor of science degree they are commissioned as officers in the uniformed services each academy is rated as a top undergraduate college all offer majors in engineering math science and the humanities when cadets and midshipmen graduate they take with them lasting friendships they forge lifetime bonds under the intense pressure and the high moral and ethical standards demanded by our

equipment is state of the art the unique challenges are unmatched no other school offers the range of opportunities available at a service academy in keeping with a famous quote by general douglas macarthur that on the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that on other fields on other days will bear the fruits of victory all cadets and midshipmen are athletes and every athlete is challenged [Music] the academies share a belief that the competition and teamwork learned on the playing fields reinforce the team spirit needed to get the job done at the service academies there is both an officer and undergraduate chain of command cadets and midshipmen have a chance to develop and practice personal leadership skills to be a leader you must learn to follow that's why upperclassmen have a great responsibility in training lower classmen it's about becoming a leader who will inspire respect and obedience even under the most trying of circumstances our cadets and midshipmen are taught how to keep their heads when things get tough to make the right decision the first time they see what is required and make sure it is carried out learning through their mistakes

graduates inspire on the strength of their vision and the courage of their team service academy graduates excel in every sphere of influence from general and admiral to government leaders and captains of industry some say that much of the history taught at the academies was made by graduates who went before our country expects a great deal from our cadets and midshipmen to make them the best in

with a nuclear weapon now that question is before Congress joining us to discuss as a democratic representative from Connecticut congressman jim Himes a member of the House Intelligence Committee congressman it is great to have you a lot of details coming out I'm sure you're still going through it from what you've seen what do you think of this historic deal well it's a good moment to sort of step back and take a deep breath this is a very complicated thing with profound consequences for a roiled region for our national security and the first thing people need to do is take a deep breath anybody who has come out in the last two hours with aggressive statements that this is a no-brainer that it's obvious frankly should stop being listened to for the duration of this consideration these are hugely consequential you know Warren peece type items secondly it's a complicated thing you know minus this deal wasn't going to be anything that we were going to celebrate it is in fact a compromise and so we need to get into the details and satisfy ourselves that in fact Iran is going to be a lot further away from having a nuclear weapon than they were before and that this is a key point and that we have an ability both the sea cheating if it happens that's essential but also to bring back significant pain through sanctions if in fact they do cheat and lastly and this is really critical to and nobody's talking about it you know you never choose in Congress between the good and the perfect you choose between the alternative you have and all the other scenarios so we've got to start a conversation about what happens let's just imagine that Congress says no to this thing where does that leave us in particular if our other allies say yes so these are all really complicated things that we need to take up and be very serious about in the coming days Congress we appreciate your no hot take mandate but there are critics who say and this is not a hot date they've been looking at this deal for some time that it's undeniable this will make Iran richer this will give them a hundred billion dollars perhaps that they do not have or did not have yesterday are you concerned that they're going to take that money even some of it and continue their sponsorship of terrorism it is undeniable that this will make our own richer and that's one of the very significant risks associated this deal which again therefore means we ought to be very very careful in its consideration rather than you know coming right out and having very strong black and white statement so but it is undeniable that this will make a ron richer and that is a problem it will also as the secretary point out if and again we all have to look at this thing it will also you know presumably and again I've got a look at thing make Iran a lot further away from having a nuclear bomb then they were before that the money is what they get what we get of course is the removal at least immediately the possibility that Iran has a weapon and of course the possibility and here we look at this with a great deal of cynicism and we are not naive about it but the possibility that interacting more with the world trading actually having a more reasonable society actually begins to change that regime from a pariah regime to a more constructive participant in the region now obviously that's a that's a that is far from a no-brainer but we got to consider that as a possibility now 11 of the details in here that's getting a lot of attention is the UN arms embargo the fact that you're going to see a lifting of an arms embargo in five to eight years we're talking about conventional weapons we're talking about the country's ballistic missiles program the Democratic ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee eliot engel he released a pretty blistering statement saying that the fact that the arms embargo this was one of the issues that was off the table this was maybe it was described as a redline this was off the table for a long time now that it's included in now seeing that it's included in the sanctions relief is deeply troubling even ash Carter the president's Defense Secretary has said that he has huge concerns allowing the arms embargo to be lifted do you think it's a good idea no it's not a good idea and again this is a deal right that means that we get some things and they get some things and it's uncomfortable to think as we talked about before that they get a whole lot of money that they may use by the way to try to buy off their middle class to try to you know help their economy and get their people a little less angry than they are but they also will probably use it to further their own aims in the region and of course the prospect of weapons going in is not a happy prospect it's something that probably makes the Russians and the Chinese and maybe the French who probably want to sell them weapons happy but no that's a that's a very real concern but again we have to remember what the court negotiation was about here which was taking away Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon look when we negotiated with the Soviets the Soviet you very very bad actor they sponsor terrorism they oppressed Jews in the Soviet Union they had proxy armies all of the world but we considered it worthwhile to negotiate with them narrowly on the topic of nuclear weapons and ICBMs and we did that we just need to remember that this is a deal and we're not going to get everything away that we want and they're going to get some of the things that they want a little bit interesting 60 days ahead of you congressman jim Himes of connecticut thanks so much for being with us thank you take care thanks so much congressman

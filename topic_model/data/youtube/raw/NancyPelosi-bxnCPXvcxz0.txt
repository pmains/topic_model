thank you very much mr. speaker mr. speaker today across the globe people are make marking World AIDS Day it's an opportunity to reflect upon the progress we've made in the fight against hiv/aids and this pandemic and to rededicate ourselves to ending the disease once and for all World AIDS Day is an occasion to remember friends family members loved ones and millions of others lost to the disease some solemn reminder of those still living with hiv/aids whether in the cities of the United States to the villages of Africa Asia or elsewhere it is a reminder of the need to continue the fight to keep investing in research in medical advances to stay focused on new treatments care prevention an early early intervention key a key element of quality of life to expand housing opportunities with people hiv/aids to end discrimination yet it's also a reminder of how far we traveled since the first World AIDS Day in 1988 and the first aids diagnosis which we acknowledged recently 30 the 30 year anniversary of the first aids diagnosis in my hometown of San Francisco we learned early on the terrible toll of hiv/aids that the toll it could take on a community but that knowledge as sad as it was drove us to action advocacy and progress because we had suffered so much we could also become model for the country and indeed the world with our community-based solutions in regard to prevention to care and to research for a cure or vaccine this something I'm very proud of and really it found its way into legislation the Ryan White Care Act housing opportunity for people with hiv/aids growing funding increased funding for NIH research expanded invest prevention care treatment and an end to the ban on federal funds for syringe exchange something very important if you're going to prevent aids beyond our borders we have extended a care to millions of developing world early on in our community when we would have an AIDS mobilization day right almost from the start and congresswoman lynn Woolsey can attest to the we understood that if you're going to meet the challenge of hiv/aids at home you had to have a mobilization that was global that was global because he's it aids new no borders but it had to be global and so we would have these vigils of thousands of people walking in a great solemn way to talk about ending AIDS globally almost right from the start although we were feeling it very personally very locally in our community beyond our borders that's why we extended care to millions in developing world with increased resources for PEPFAR and the Global Fund and I commend President Bush for his leadership on pet foreign a commitment that he made there and I congratulate President Obama for the statement he made this morning which increased funding for the Ryan White initiative Ryan White Care initiative that supports care provided by HIV medical clinics across the country and additional funding for a dot the drug program or initiative for people with hiv/aids and his commitment of a new target of helping six million people around the world get treatment by the end of 2013 it's very important and I commend Secretary Clinton for her strong leadership in her statement about ridding AIDS especially among children as soon as possible the the challenges that we faced over the years some have disappeared when I first came to Congress I I didn't I was sworn in in a special election and they told me you're not allowed to speak you just raise your hand and say yes I support and defend the Constitution but then the speaker speaker right said where the gentlelady from California wish to address the house and I had been told not to address the house and if I did to be very very brief so I stood up and knowledge my family my father hood Thomas da Sandra had served as a member of Congress so he was on the floor of the Congress and my family and thank them all my constituents and then I my one sentence was I came here to fight against HIV and AIDS and that was about it well my colleagues who had told me to be brief then said why would you even mention that this was 24 years ago why would you even mention that the first thing that you want to say to members of Congress when you get here is that you're here to fight hiv/aids why did you say such a thing and I said well I said such a thing because that's why I came here but I never I never would have thought that over that 24 years ago that we would projects really a nut to another generation now that we would not have a cure for hiv/aids never would have thought but in the meantime we've reduced discrimination we expanded a prevention care deepened our research actually mobilized support some like bono on the outside using his celebrity to attract attention to the issue public policy whether it's President Bush President Clinton and now with his global initiative and President Obama were at a completely different place than we were then when they wouldn't even have an AIDS ribbon in significant places in Washington DC today we all proudly wear that with ribbon and again it's a day of reminder but it's also a day where we act upon those reminders of the work that needs to be done and again it's a global challenge but it's a very personal issue so the sticks are staggering but we think of them one person at a time and that is what we have to act upon this Congress has been great on the subject I hope that we will continue to honor our responsibility and again on aids day in San Francisco today we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of the aids memorial grove this is something that this congress designated as a national memorial and national memorial is this great significance for our community for sure i think very appropriately so but also for the issue of aids so when you go there you have to go to the AIDS Memorial when you go west to see it as a spirit of renewal a garden a grove always is that fresh new growth as we have it as a remembrance two of those who have lost and a comfort to their families so with that again mr. chairman and I Mr Speaker I join others in calling to our colleagues attention and those who follow Congress his importance of fighting hiv/aids two people two communities to a country to the world for our good health for our economy for for the success of individuals and with that I yield back the balance of my time Thank You mr. speaker gentlelady yields back for what purposes gentleman from Illinois rise without objection the gentleman is recognized for one minute

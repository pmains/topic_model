history demonstrates that wars are easier to start than they are to end i think that's fair we have agreement we have agreement i think the afghan war is a great example of that um you know after nearly 20 years of war many are questioning the mission in fact many have been questioning what the mission is in afghanistan for a decade or more including president trump um i traveled with him to the sad duty at dover receiving two of our soldiers home and i know it affects him personally i know he's been very public and very consistent and i think very sincere in wanting to end the war in afghanistan army lieutenant general dan mcneil put it this way when asked about the mission he says i tried to get someone to define for me what winning meant even before i went over and nobody could nobody would give me a good definition of what it meant some people were thinking in terms of jeffersonian democracy but there's just not going to that's just not going to happen in afghanistan this statement was 13 years ago when asked about our mission general douglas lutz said we were devoid of a fundamental understanding of afghanistan we didn't know what we were doing what are we trying to do there we didn't have the foggiest notion of what we were doing this is from five years ago how long is it going to take you know what what is our current mission why why are we in afghanistan do we have a cogent military reason to be in afghanistan right now so the president's given two missions one is to reduce our force posture both the risk to our young men and women who are fighting there second is to ensure that there's not a terror attack that emanates from that space we set about conducting a peace and reconciliation process we've now reduced forces there by about half since their most recent peak we're on our way to reduce even further i'm hopeful that we will get the afghans to begin their negotiation because president trump has made very clear his expectation we've entered into agreement that we'll go to zero we'll get our forces out of there i think it's may of next year we're looking to do that on terms that make sure we protect america from uh would you agree that afghanistan is just one of probably hundreds of places that we uh potentially have terror threats or radical islamic threats and may not even be the no longer the primary uh hundreds if you'll give me dozens and dozens yes sir absolutely yeah and um do you think that maybe it's a you know we talked about in uh europe that we had hundreds of thousands of troops in in germany because there was a soviet union and they had i don't know two million three million people in their army and we had this sort of cold war standoff but it circumstances have changed and maybe even your opinion has changed over whether or not we need so many troops in germany and i applaud that i think the same as in afghanistan it's certainly changed over 20 years the war on terror is now it always has been sort of a global one but i think it may be a 20th century idea that we have to occupy territory so much that we have to have acres and we have to have large bases particularly in countries that uh are in prolonged civil war but the other question is is really is our is our goal in these in these locations around the world our national security or is our goal sometimes muddied by the idea that basically you know we're in afghanistan for for the equal rights amendment or for women's rights or we're there for you know democracy or making a country out of afghanistan are we there for building roads you know we built a 45 million dollar natural gas gas station in afghanistan they have no cars that run on natural gas so we bought them cars that ran on natural gas they have no money so we gave them a credit card my understanding is that the gas station was supposed to cost a half a million costs 45 million and is no longer functioning so i mean is our goal national security or is nation building part of what we should be doing as a country i think president trump's made it unambiguous our our mission set there is american national security plain and simple it i i'd add only this there are times in the world where we are better off if there are democratic nations the state department is designed right to provide to build resilience to quite do this kind of thing but i do think our foreign policy sometimes has been overly ambitious about what it is we can accomplish through the use of military force with respect to getting other nations to well i think encouraging democracy and being part of supportive of democracy doesn't mean we have to pay for trying to institute our image in some other country because it just doesn't frankly work um when we look at trying to end the afghan war i think in some ways we are stuck in the sense that people have decided we can only leave with a some sort of treaty with the taliban some sort of agreement with the taliban i'm sort of of the opinion that in some ways it might make it worse because i think that the taliban aren't necessarily trustworthy and if we leave under the agreement that they have to meet certain parameters which is what we're looking towards and then they break those parameters we're right back in you know with with a threat to stay in i think it's uh almost that the threat has to be and maybe the threat should have been this 20 or even 30 years ago the threat should be that if you harbor terrorists that are organizing international terrorism that you know there will be military repercussions but those don't have to be landing 50 000 troops it might be landing 50 000 bombs absolutely right you know and so i think we need to think about what are and i think we haven't escaped we're still stuck in this idea of we have to we've occupied this acreage and we have to do something with it you know and we can't leave until it's perfect it's never going to be perfect there and the only thing i would just exhort you is that let's don't base it completely on you know that we have to have a perfect deal to leave i think there's always the threat that we can come back and people say well we there's ten there's ten al-qaeda left in afghanistan they might be plotting right now and um you know the president has admit you've said there they're a shadow of themselves the president has admitted there'd been reports that there are you know now we are talking dozens not hundreds we're talking dozens not thousands uh same with the islamic state uh general lute came and spoke to one of our committees recently and he said he couldn't name any group there that he thought had the capability to attack the the united states and he said there was no evidence that the so-called islamic state presents a threat to the u.s from afghanistan um so i think we do need to be mindful of that but we do have to work towards finishing it and the only thing i'd say in the end because i don't want to finish this without mentioning that it takes friends of the president the president has policy people have to try to fulfill his policy and i think for a long time for several years john bolton was trying to thwart that and john bolton was an enemy of the president's policy so i hope the people who are remaining will try to fulfill the president's policy and get us out of the war in afghanistan thank you

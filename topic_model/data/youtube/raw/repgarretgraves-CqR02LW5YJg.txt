mr chairman i want to i want to thank you for comments you made the opening statement where you talked about how this committee is is not ignoring um energy issues and how um how we are going to going to pay attention to those um mr chairman this amendment gives gives this committee an opportunity to do just that um you know it's it's it's incredible to me to look at what's happening with with energy cost and how this is having such a profound impact on every single american when you add up the the cost of of increased energy and you you add that to inflation cost which of course energy is the largest driver there are statistics showing that the average american spending five thousand 000 a year more than they were last year and of course real wages have gone down not up as a result of of these policies mr chairman this is a direct result of policies by the biden administration that that are causing higher prices let me let me give you an example in the budget that the binding administration submitted last year for the u.s army corps of engineers there was a provision in the budget that explicitly said it explicitly said that no project would be funded that would result in decreased cost of consumption of oil and gas let me say that again there was a provision in president biden's budget that was submitted to congress that said we will not fund any project that decreases or results in decreasing the cost of consumption of oil and gas in the united states let me say it again i said this last week i'll say it again boy did you do it you succeeded you we have the the highest energy prices we've ever seen i saw some posters up there earlier over five dollars a gallon but mr chairman it's more than that because people can't afford new vehicles they can't afford to maintain their vehicles because of what this administration is doing to them so the aaa just last month came out and said there was a 30 percent just last month a 30 increase in roadside assistance calls because people can't even afford to keep up with their cars now this committee has not done a single thing nothing on energy prices whenever upstream energy is our jurisdiction we're all about production at this point during the during the obama administration there had been 50 lease sales 5-0 50 lease sales i never thought i'd say this gosh i wish president obama was still here we have had zero what is a lease sale a lease is is offering public lands and waters for energy production at this same time what's happened we're going to venezuela to iran and to saudi arabia asking asking them to give us energy while we're blocking louisiana texas oklahoma ohio pennsylvania we're blocking these other states that have energy resources from producing mr chairman who is it that we're representing we're talking about a bill on big cats right now seriously that's what this bill is it's about big cats now let me tell you what this committee jurisdiction is one of the areas of jurisdiction we have jurisdiction over national marine fisheries service guess why there are hundreds of thousands of barrels a day of domestically produced energy that are being held up that are already leased that are already permitted guess why mr chairman it's because national marine fisheries service has acknowledged they have an error in their loa process and they're holding up over a dozen approvals for loas that that could allow for hundreds of thousands of barrels a day of domestically produced american energy american jobs american economic activity could allow that to be produced and how many hearings have we had on that zero yet we had 70 something members of congress write a letter and say you've got to fix this so i'm going to say that again within our committee's jurisdiction hundreds of thousands of barrels a day that we're just sitting here just waiting on approval but but national marine fisheries services acknowledge it's their error in their modeling system and instead of just thinking taking this taking weeks for an loa approval which is historically what's happened under republican and democrat administrations everything's frozen and been frozen for months and months and months there are areas where we need to focus

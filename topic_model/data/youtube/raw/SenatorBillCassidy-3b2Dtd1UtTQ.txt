now senators met on capitol hill to discuss the deadly fentanyl crisis here in america china and mexico took center stage in those hearings senator bill cassidy republican from louisiana and a medical doctor joins me now mr senator what i don't understand is why javier becerra has done what appears to be nothing about fentanyl and he's the health and human services secretary what's going on yeah yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure that javier is actually in washington dc i still think he's zooming from california and i say that because if this is an emergency if we have a hundred thousand americans who died last year as they did then all hands should be on deck at their desk implementing the programs that congress has previously given and bringing new programs to to congress that you think might otherwise help squash this epidemic of death are the cartels sending fentanyl now through the mail oh they're doing it both through the mail and directly across the border now from china it comes to the mail exploiting a kind of loophole if the declared value is less than 800 then it's not inspected now congress has appropriated dollars to increase inspection of every package but that's taking a while to implement you've got to build out new facilities on the other hand across the border it's not just people coming across that open border it is fentanyl and other drugs flooding and that's the consequence of abiding administration's like like open border policy senator let me change subjects and look at inflation we've got a new report it says 64 percent of us have altered our driving habits or our lifestyle just in the last few months because of inflation what are you hearing from your constituents in louisiana yeah i'm hearing why don't why doesn't president biden come live like a real person he speaks oh isn't it great that we're paying less for gas not knowing that we're paying less for gas because they're not driving therefore there's demand destruction if you're in a 15 year old pickup truck you're not driving that truck because you don't want an electric vehicle it's because you can't afford a new car and for them to kind of tout the solution to his electric vehicles is ignoring the reality most americans live in the husband or the wife has to drive to work and she may drive 45 minutes and then 45 minutes back in an older vehicle these gas prices are still punishing the american people are the people of louisiana losing ground financially oh many are by the way it isn't of course just the fuel it's also their utilities it is also their grocery prices um i like to say people who used to eat steak or now eating a hamburger if you're eating a hamburger you're eating hot dogs they are readjusting their lifestyle down and uh and they're frustrated and and and they're looking for answers they are indeed senator uh senator bill cassidy louisiana i'm starting getting tongue-tied here and also a medical doctor thanks as always for being with us doctor always appreciate it thank you yes sir

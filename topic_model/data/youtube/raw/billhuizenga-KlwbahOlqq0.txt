cognizes Thank You mr. Speaker I rise uns today in support of continued preservation and restoration of the Great Lakes through the Great Lakes restoration initiative a very important initiative for the Great Lakes system for Michiganders the Great Lakes are directly linked to our our identity our way of life our history and our future the Great Lakes basin is home to more than 30 million people and it contains ninety percent of the nation's fresh surface water supply many know that but they don't always understand the economic impact and that provides a backbone of a six trillion dollar regional economy well the Great Lakes restoration initiative has a strong track record of success specifically in West Michigan where the work to clean up toxic hot spots in areas like Muskegon is estimated to have increased property values by nearly 12 million dollars and generated 1 million dollars in new recreational spending this holds true across the West Michigan and the entire region as every dollar invested in the GL RI generates more than 3 dollars in additional long-term economic activity the GL r GL RI is critical to our efforts to protect drinking water prevent the spread of invasive species and to accelerate the cleanup of areas of concern with the threat of Asian carp inundating our waters high water levels and erosion threatening our shorelines and the ongoing threat of P phase contamination in contaminating our water we must be committed to a bipartisan solutions to protect this critical resource and recently my Republican colleagues and I had an opportunity to spend some time with the president and he committed his support for the GL RI and towards the Great Lakes as well as making sure that Brandon Road and other efforts to keep invasive species out is happening so the GL RI is a bipartisan example of an effective and efficient use of taxpayer dollars that protects 15 seconds thank you this taxpayer dollars protect preserve and strengthen the Great Lakes today and for future generations and I yield back gentleman

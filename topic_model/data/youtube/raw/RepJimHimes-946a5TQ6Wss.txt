probably Barbara Starr at the Pentagon thanks for that report i do want to talk more about this now this growing war of words between russia and turkey and how this could affect the anti-isis mission in Syria joining me now to talk about this is congressman jim heintz he's a Democrat from Connecticut he's a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence and he's a former member of the Homeland Security Committee congressman thanks for being with us and see the role of the u.s. in all of this we know that air gawand Putin President Obama they're all going to be in france on monday for this climate summit do you see this as an opportunity for the u.s. to get involved or does the u.s. need to stay out of this dispute well I think particularly in the case of the russian-turkish issue with the shooting down of the Russian plane the u.s. can play a calming role you know that's a sort of a step backwards away from where we all and by all I mean basically everybody except Isis needs to be which is getting their heads together really committing to the negotiations that are underway right now in Vienna because it is only once there has been an agreement about you know what Syria looks like in the next couple of years that we then have the alignment to do what we all so badly want to do which is of course and with the French go after Isis you know as long as we have you know Turk shooting down Russians you know Iranians operating independently of you know of each other and the u.s. not quite sure who's doing what to where it's going to be very very difficult to come up with the alignment that we need altima tlie to defeat Isis I want to ask you shorted to that point about political transition in Syria the french Foreign Minister has caused some confusion this morning he said that Syrian government forces could be part of the ground force against Isis then he clarified he said they would take part only after a political transition in the mind of the u.s. from your perspective is there really a role for the Syrian milk well it's interesting that you ask that question because of course one of the catastrophic mistakes that the United States made in Iraq after after the invasion was to dismantle the Iraqi Armed Forces and boy did we ever pay the price for the fact that you had you know tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of newly unemployed Iraqi soldiers without a paycheck with weaponry and with military training absolute catastrophe so the answer is pretty clear that once an agreement is made and that agreement will include and easing out of Assad and boy do we wish it wasn't an easing out but it will include an easing out of an Assad then necessarily there will be a hard look at the officers and the commanders of the Syrian military those that committed war crimes or atrocities obviously won't be part of the of the future of Syria but those who are not you know the fact that that military is there will once all those agreements are made and once we sort of found out you know who the bad guys are and there and they get held accountable then absolutely there's a role in a post-assad Syria for for the Syrian military you have said that efforts to end the civil war in Syria could involve working with some unsavory characters I know you're talking about easing out Assad but does that include working with Iran perhaps Hezbollah well you know it doesn't involve working with Hezbollah what i mean by working with unsavory characters is yes Iran is there and at least eat three different forms there there with Hezbollah there there with Shiite militias and there they're actually with their own Revolutionary Guard operational in the country so whether we like it or not they have a seat at the negotiating table of course they you know they're there right there in the region so no it's not so much that we're going to work with Hezbollah it's going to be the fact that the final deal that gets done here is going to be profoundly uncomfortable for a lot of us because you know sadly it's not likely to end with Assad spending the rest of his life in jail as he should although who knows and you know the Iranians are going to get something in that negotiation as will the Russians by the way so like all negotiations we're going to get a deal that's going to be terribly important to aligning Isis but there's going to be active ab aspects of that deal that are gonna be pretty uncomfortable to us and what about Assad obviously the line of the US government is that he needs to go but at the same on the same token I think other countries are asking themselves the question which is the lesser evil here Isis or Bashar al-assad ya know and frankly that's been a question that has been you know part of the problem with us strategy for a long time I mean you know assads violence and the you know absolutely atrocious way in which he ran the country has a lot to do with Isis's success in that country on the other hand you know I sort of looked at some senior White House administration officials a year ago and I said really if you could push a button today an Assad would be gone would you push that button because of course who's in Damascus if Assad is gone now the good news is look let's face it you know Assad is an embarrassment to the people who are backing him he's an embarrassment to the Russians he's an embarrassment to the Iranian so you know they too have an interest in us in Assad being gone but again you you can't just wish the man away and you can't snap your fingers and have a vacuum in Damascus because if there's a vacuum in Damascus I promise you it's going to look like the vacuum you know in Tripoli it will look like the vacuum in so many other cities around the region where you know the leadership went away and some pretty bad people moved in congressman Hines really appreciate you talking to us on this what's really a holiday Friday we hope you have a wonderful holiday weekend

I'm Tim Hagedorn Republican candidate for Congress in Minnesota's first District and you deserve to know where I stand on the issue of these big omnibus spending bills recently the Congress and the president enacted a 1.3 trillion dollar bill to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year I opposed that bill I did it on these grounds first of all there were no government reforms you know when I was a Treasury official out in Washington I downsized my own federal agency we eliminated government jobs we saved taxpayer money we reformed the government to make it serve the people better that can be done across the board including at the Pentagon we can save tens of billions of dollars each year if we just put our minds to it and get it done so moving forward that has to happen also moving forward what has to happen is we have to get back to regular order on the appropriations process the house and the Senate needs to pass the 12 individual spending bills send those bills to the president for a signature if we do that there won't be any threats at the end of the year to shut down government right now that's not getting done because the Senate's 60 vote rule and if they need to change that and move to 51 votes in order to get the spending bills through Soviet they need to get that done lastly it's time to deal with this national debt we're up to almost 21 trillion dollars in debt and you know we've been financing that debt on artificially low interest rates these last above 16 years 1% basically we're spending about 250 billion dollars to finance 21 trillion dollars that's quite a deal but as the economy improves and interest rates ratchet up so tool our debt payments we'll be paying 500 750 billion even upwards of a trillion dollars where are we getting the money it's time to get back to fiscal responsibility especially to my Republican friends in Washington I'd be a congressman that would get that done for you and vote that way I'm Jim Hagedorn in on this issue that's where I stand

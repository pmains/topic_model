i rise today in support of my legislation house resolution 935 the small business mergers acquisitions sales and brokerage simplification act of 2021. uh madam speaker uh this bill isn't new we've been here before in fact this will be the third instance that my legislation has actually come to the floor and each time members of this body have unanimously supported the legislation before us today and i certainly hope that the third time is the charm but let's be clear for small privately owned businesses merger and acquisition advisors and business brokers perform crucial roles in preparing these privately held businesses for a sale or a merger by finding and screening potential business buyers or partners these brokers play a vital role in navigating m a transactions to successful outcomes unfortunately federal securities regulations technically require an m a broker to be registered and regulated by the securities and exchange commission as well as finra just like a wall street investment banker selling or buying publicly traded companies this is a problem long identified by both practitioners and the regulators themselves so whether it's a small locally owned store in holland michigan my hometown or a fortune 500 company today the same rules apply regardless of the size of the business the size of the transaction or whether they are publicly or privately held and sadly these last two years have only increased the need for my bill despite five trillion dollars in coveted relief packages which have often picked winners and losers rising in costs due to inflation are making it difficult for many small businesses to keep the lights on today recent data from the federal reserve itself showed that 85 percent of small businesses experienced financial hardships and difficulties in 2021 and according to the small business administration 68 percent of small business owners say they are having a hard time keeping and hiring staff nevertheless small businesses continue to be the backbone of all of our local economies just look at my home state of michigan which is home of very large companies like the automakers and office furniture makers and chemical companies and and uh and medical device companies but it also is a place where 98 percent of businesses are small businesses 98 of them and they employ literally half of the michigan workforce and just as important for every 100 spent at a local business roughly 68 stays in the local economy according to studies small businesses need to grow and have to do a couple of different things to go be successful for some that means they need to consolidate some they may need to restructure and try to recover from the challenges that have been exacerbated by whether it's the pandemic or the economy or whatever it might be sometimes it may be a family succession plan that is happening within those small businesses these innovators entrepreneurs and risk takers are critical to our country's economic growth and prosperity and so we need to level the playing field that gives an unfair advantage to those wall street big guys so how did we get here as was discussed in 20 2006 merger and acquisition brokers attempted to address their concerns with the securities and exchange commission by developing a rule that would codify and simplify the quote broker dealer regulation unfortunately due to the fallout from the great financial crisis the sec could not make the time for this rulemaking and make it a priority which sent groups then to congress for a legislative fix but along the way this bill has enjoyed bipartisan and bicameral support it passed the committee on financial services not once not twice but now four times uh including this last summer and in 2014 the chief council of the division of trading for of the uh securities and exchange commission released the m a broker no action letter which concluded that the sec staff would not recommend enforcement against an unregistered person who was engaged in facilitating a securities transaction solely related to the purchase or sale of a privately held company regardless of the size of the company provided certain enumerated conditions were met well hr 935 is consistent with the no action letter and but will clarify and simplify the merger process for small businesses and m a brokers the bill codifies the extensive investor protections which while not affecting the sec's jurisdiction over m a brokers however a no action letter is not legally binding it cannot change securities laws that's up to us congress so we must pass my legislation to provide legal clarity once and for all so madam speaker we've been on a journey for uh nearly 10 years would the gentleman have 30 more seconds madam speaker gentlemen is recognized thank you madam speaker well we've been on this journey for nearly 10 years going back to the 113th congress and while many of the members who served with me back then no longer remain the challenges in small businesses face have not dimmed and i want to take a minute to recognize my colleague representative brian higgins from new york who has been the original co-sponsor from day one and he has been on this step every uh on this journey every step of the way as well as uh as congresswoman maloney and chair waters and ranking member mchenry so again i urge my colleagues to pass this common sense bipartisan legislation

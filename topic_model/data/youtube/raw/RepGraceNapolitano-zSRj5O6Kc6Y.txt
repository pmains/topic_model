and and metaphorically there's a stigma that says don't talk about you know being depressed and having bipolar disorder or ptsd or anything of the sort so a hundred percent i think for me and i'll agree with taran that it really helps talking about it i would say that it's not talking about it um it's the the kind understanding reception of the listeners because coming out and we all have lots of days in our lives there are those proud moments we would love to tell you about trying to kill myself is not one of those proud moments it is hard awkward uncomfortable every single time if there was a heart monitor on me you would that it's not comfortable but it helps to disprove that inner voice that is telling you you can never tell anyone that you know all of the mean things that you say to yourself every time that we do this it disproves that so that is what's healing not me sharing but you all being understanding and supportive that's the most healing thing so thank you the other thing can i add this panel spoke at our national chapter leadership conference this past january in atlanta so i asked taren to clean up her presentation now i'm sorry that i did but would you mind sharing with the group what you shared with the folks in atlanta about the conversations you have with your brain oh yeah give people a sense of what you do every day with yourself before you have a conversation with anybody else sure you know i just shared um and again if your brain is anything like mine again as an alcoholic my brain will have me and my brain will kill me if i'm not vigilant every single day i'd use the term my brain as an [ __ ] because my brain because from that time i was eight years old i programmed it to believe i was worthless i was a piece of [ __ ] i had no value i didn't matter that is the dialogue i have told myself i'm 39 years old you know i've said that for 31 years those neural pathways are pretty deep and pretty entrenched it has taken a long time and i'm still actively working on that process of shifting the way i've thought about myself the process of recovery and and what i've learned and gained through going through the steps of alcoholics anonymous has enabled me to be open so i want to share something that i shared just with my sponsor a few weeks ago that truly freed me when i experienced the sexual abuse for the first time i experienced an orgasm so of course in my body i thought what is wrong with me i know this is wrong but my body felt something different what is wrong with me and i've carried that hatred because i thought there was something wrong with me and i know that now no i experienced what my body was exposed to but again being young i was so confused and that has kept me sick to finally be able to verbalize that out loud to somebody else freed me so again the truth does the truth will set you free i believe that 100 sorry thank you john just a comment and then a question first of all thank you all so much for having the courage to give us your voices to give us your stories to give us your hope and give us your inspiration so first thank you there are a lot of and people voices of others who are talking more about their experience and it is very important we know actually those voices of hope can really reduce suicide there's actually studies that show that but our question that we're having a lot in a lot of our our conversations in our community now is um how do you know when you're ready and and so my question for you all is as you went through the process of making the decision to talk about it you know when you finally did obviously there's been amazing dividends for you and others but what kind of advice might you give to those who are on precipice or thinking about talking about their story what warnings might you get what what caveats what you give what advice might be like i shared earlier it it it's a coming out of sorts it's just something that's not again and i think i'll say this on blue in the face it's just not talked about and as i said earlier you're engaging people who have lived experience and just reaching out to people is going to help them share their story just knowing that there are people out there who not only can empathize with them or have the compassion for somebody who has lived experience but just knowing that there's somebody who's going to listen my my my feelings is that nobody wanted to listen to that story it was boring it wasn't something that you wanted to talk about i it wasn't getting me an award it wasn't making me any money it was just something in my life that had happened and i didn't i just chose not to really discuss about it um i put like i s like i said i think knowing that there are people who are going to listen to you is probably the best advice that i can give you is when you talk people are going to listen some people are afraid that there's not anybody going to listen there's nobody going to be there there's no audience and what's the point of talking in an empty room by yourself so just the best advice i can give them would just be know that there are people who are willing to listen who want to listen and there are people who need to listen there's somebody who spoke that helped me tell my story and i'm hoping that my story will help those people who just feel like nobody's out there and there's nobody listening there's no more hope that there is hope and you can talk about it because there are people willing to listen and if there are not people willing to listen make them listen i think my and i just recently i guess over the summer it's been less than a year that i've been sharing my story publicly and it started as a result of the way forward report that came out of the national action alliance sally spencer thomas who played a role in that she contacted me going hey will you make a video and i said well i will but i want you know that i'm not an ally i am an attempt survivor and she and i being two professionals in the field you know going over all of the safe messaging guidelines you know one of the things was really crucial to me was before i recorded my little 30-second video i contacted all three of my children i contacted my best friend i contacted my mom because it's not just my story my story affected everyone else's lives and so for new people that are thinking i want to tell my story to take care of that personal support system so don't sacrifice your own support system to help others it's kind of like you own an airplane the oxygen mask put on your mask first and so i needed to make sure that my support system because sharing my stories to help others is worthless if it destroys me and so my terminology that i used to call it i call whenever i give these presentations i call it doing emotional burlesque that i share enough that i share a number of me intimate and compelling i feel like you guys know and get a sense of who i am but i protect my core and i change it you could hear me tell my story 50 times it's going to be different each time depending on what i'm comfortable because i can't go home and feel naked or exposed i need to protect so knowing yourself and knowing that your support system will be there for you is very important i just i just wanted to add something i think i i spoke with an intense survivor recently who when i asked her what what made her reluctant to share that part of her with other people she said it's because they asked me why and she said i still don't know why i got there and she said it's not a simple answer i don't have a simple answer and it's hard for me to share that without people asking it so i think the one thing that i've learned is when people do share is to not press them for why that they may not understand why be respectful about what they do want to share about their history with you i have i do have a thought i would add you know i i think for me it's just being in a space and place where you're healthy and unlike shelby said is self-care knowing that it is emotional it does expose you your vulnerability of sharing some of those things you've got to be in a place where you're you're actively working i actively work recovery every day because my brain will still have thoughts my brain still some days has the thought that says you don't matter you're not worth it and so i think just being in a place and knowing that that you are going to be exposed to some of that vulnerability when you do share and knowing what self-care actions you can take and i want to echo what she shared you know my my mom is one of my greatest heroes my mom did the best she could you know she didn't intend mouths and what she said to me she was a mom i'm a mom if my child came to me and was being abused i don't know how i would have reacted either you know so i just think that the purpose of what we learn and go through and experience is huge but i always encourage folks who say you know i want to share my story i want to make sure they're in a safe place to do so so that it isn't detrimental to their own mental well-being also so yeah i think clearly if i could add having lost my sister's suicide it's part of the gift of forgiving yourself forgiving your mom for not knowing what to say but it doesn't mean she was a bad person right and that each of us have to find your own way and to shelby's point about protecting your network of support it's critically important to do that any other questions anybody have some thoughts and we have passed several laws or in the process of passing laws to basically help educational facilities so whether it's k-12 or for colleges and also there's another law that claims september 10th as suicide prevention day yeah so correspond to the national day in the world by date i'm just wondering is there anything that your particular state is doing that is working really well that you would like to see other states um copy give you credit oh yeah but but you'd like to see you know um i would i'll speak first just on monday you know i attended a ceremonial bill signing where our governor signed five new pieces of legislation uh we funded a couple years back two positions one at the division of substance abuse and mental health and then the state office of education full-time suicide prevention we saw that when new york did that they reduced suicide you know dramatically so to have two people in state government actively working and our state office of education lady we joke she has boots on the ground that woman is in every school as soon as she hears of a suicide she's there i mean we we just have seen huge things happen the other one that's been huge was providing training for mental health providers you know for folks who've gone through and are working with individuals in suicidal crisis you know sometimes they haven't even had the training so seeing that happen you know at a national level would be would be huge and then just funding i mean we we can say it we're blue in the face we need funding to provide research so that we can better understand what's causing suicide how do we get ahead of this we haven't put the money towards it at state levels at a national level you know afsp we are we're we're out there walking our butts off 18 miles i got the blisters to prove it from dallas you know still going why are nine hills um but no i think there's there's so much we can continue to do at a state level and i'm i'm amazed at what our state in utah has done but it's taken as you know being personally affected you know those are the people that are pushing the most because they've they've been affected and and let's get on the front end of this instead of waiting till we've been affected let's implement change now can't this be a conversation we have now you know before we're reacting so go to a more to a more specific thing in pennsylvania we we had uh passed uh 1559 act 71 which actually requires teachers to have suicide prevention education training across the state um and we're pushing more than sad which i spoke about earlier uh as a tool for that to to give that training to the teachers and i think that's very important to get our children at a younger age to talk about it and to have their educators and the people they spend six to eight hours sometimes more a day with and that works with not only teachers but administration it can work for coaches of sports and everything else too so to go to a more specific level if i would say getting the training or passing a bill to require the training within the education department that would require them to have some type of training for mental health or suicide prevention more than sad would be a research-based very successful program to get into your state yeah i live in georgia we just passed the act that um that brandon was talking about the jason flat act which requires teacher training and suicide prevention huge thing um the other thing relates to research you know one of the things many people are in psychology what many people don't understand is that our understanding of suicidal behavior is like where our understanding of heart disease was in the 1960s we really need funded research to understand this at the national level you know to move us forward so that we can prevent it um i'll just say i can speak to arkansas which is where i lived before i've only been a new york resident since november but in arkansas one thing that we did aside from the jason flatt act which we had was through our trauma system launched into some comprehensive training of our ed nurses it's a crucial role we tell individuals if you're at risk to go to the emergency department yet oftentimes these individuals have no training so i love the initiatives that who were involved with the zero suicide initiatives but trying to train those nurses and so to speak with an rn who can come to me and say hey you know the online training that you asked me to do yesterday we had someone come through red 22 year old young lady and i responded so much better with her because i had that training and i'm so glad i know that our people that come through our ed at risk are going to be so much safer because of this training that we have so doing that training to help train the nurses how to recognize someone in a suicidal crisis and respond to them appropriately so that was a good effort and i hope they're continuing that in arkansas now that i'm not there okay because i think we're going to ask the congresswoman to wrap up and then i want to the panelists will be here john is here colleen is here so feel free to stick around and ask some questions well we have voice coming upside down thank you so much for burying yourselves thank you very much um i was a mayor of a municipality and i have four children and joe was my oldest and he was 18 years old a senior at sanchez's high school and he took his life we did not know there was any issue six six and a half national championship grower great sense of humor tons of friends hugged us all the time home on time it was just out of the ordinary out of the ordinary and at the time that i was mayor i was also running for state representative and he was already going door-to-door with me and then of course i was approached well are you going to continue or you're not going to continue and to me i needed to be there for my other children i needed to be there you know for for my husband and you know my my mom and my mother-in-law and they're all of his friends so with that i saw the need for all of his friends at the high school and after my kids sent them back to school i went right to the high school and i noticed that the kids were struggling because six months before that my son rode on the crew team they lost another team member that same year and that happened to be an accident so those kids were all struggling with two deaths of friends and i thought he needed to help the school he got to help his friends so i started there with helping the school and getting emergency counselors in there to help all of his friends and then when i came to the state house of course i met clark flatt and ours is a little bit different i think we i think four states passed it by the time they came to me and i ended up being the 11th state that that casted and i said i will pass it if it is the jason flatt act in honor of joe spanielski so i did that in memory of my son and i also added that the training that the teachers can get and earn c eu credits it can be any program not just the jason foundation to me i wanted the training out there i wanted the parents to get the training i wanted the friends to get the training so people can recognize and since then you know i've had one other one pass i have one in the senate now it already passed the house and i'm working on about four other bills that's going to help not only the kids and i always go to the kids also the veterans and i do a lot with military personnel as well because i think all of you know 20 of all suicides are with the military personnel so that is my story and i will just um continue moving forward not only for the health and well-being of myself but also my family my children who's also my daughter is studying to be a psychologist as well and i just think we need advocates out there to help all the other kids that are struggling and people aren't listening to them thank you thank you thank you again please feel free to pick up lunch if you haven't yet and come by and say hello thank you very much

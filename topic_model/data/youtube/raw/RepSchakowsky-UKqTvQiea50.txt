so congresswoman jan schakowsky works and is known well around the northern suburbs and we've called her in this morning to help with our coverage of what took place in highland park yesterday she's joining us now good morning to you this certainly has been a tough 24 hour so i have to ask how are you holding up this morning you know i'm really really angry i feel like this gunman stole the fourth of july for really thousands and thousands of people of course my heart mainly goes out to all of those victims people who lost their lives and um and who are you know still recovering and hopefully they all will but you know over 60 different celebrations were were canceled um this is all about what guns in our society can do to us and if we don't get a grip on this honestly our whole culture is going to be transformed by fear and security and i'm just i'm really furious about that well congresswoman you know obviously this conversation about gun control is ongoing years long if you think about going all the way back to columbine to now these incidents keep happening why isn't anything done well actually we made some progress i was feeling pretty good about what the congress did and a bill that was sent to the president but we one thing that we absolutely need to do is to get rid of these assault weapons now why would this disturbed young man you know people people in countries around the world also have problems and mental illness and anger etc but the access to a gun that can kill these many people in such a short time why are they on our streets why are they available during the clinton administration years ago there was an assault weapons ban and guess what it worked it actually diminished the number of situations like this and then it expired and then the gun lobby was able to keep it um off the off the books we need to do something about that right away you know we can talk all we want about what security could have done better what we can do about mental health issues but at the end of the day it's the guns so what do we do though in the immediate immediacy right now just to make people feel feel safe do you think people will ever feel safe again at events like this so we always as though we should we're looking for anything suspicious but will we ever feel safe and secure again in this country i think the only way that that we ultimately we feel will feel safe and secure when we do something to limit access to guns because let's remember in chicago there were i think more than a dozen shootings you know sort of the unfortunately the common individual shootings that happened over this weekend as well it's the easy access to guns and it is these assault weapons as well so i think that we definitely can do something about it because the majority of americans want it to be done but in the meantime if you're asking you know are we going to be able to have events like this i'm just wondering whether or not the uh the towns even those that uh that went ahead with their uh their marches and their fireworks this uh this week over the fourth are going to take another look at it and decide maybe it's not worth you don't need to have that risk no other country has that risk we are the only ones that have this kind we have about four percent of the uh the population and over 46 percent of the guns in the uh in the in the world we don't need to have this it's a sad state of affairs we appreciate you being here just to continue this conversation for us and lend your um your aspect of things to it thank you so much for being here with us this morning thank you so much all right it's 9 45 and we do have breaking

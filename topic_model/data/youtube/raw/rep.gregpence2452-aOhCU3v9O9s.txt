joining me now is congressman greg pence of indiana who is also on the energy and commerce committee in congress great uh congressman how are you doing good job how you doing today can't complain except for i filled up my gas tank the other day and uh i don't know if you know this but the price was astonishing i sure do know it's astonishing i mean it's been going up since the biden administration took charge yeah so uh there's a big hearing on capitol hill today in your committee uh with a bunch of oil executives i believe h.r mcmaster is also there uh i just want to lay this out for you and let you kind of run with it what is the narrative that it your partner's on the other side of the aisle are trying to push with this hearing and kind of break down what the actual reality of it is well the oil companies are committing to crimes joe bob one is they're uh making a lot of money in their uh they're price gouging the consumer those are the two things it's coming from the democratic party and yet of course we're pushing back on that i like to say that the petroleum is the lifeblood of our u.s economy and it appears to me that the democrats are trying to bleed us out on behalf of china uh you know they're trying to hurt the oil companies they have driven up the price biden administration uh certainly ukraine is an is a very unfortunate and dire contribution to that but gasoline at the pump was up about over a dollar uh before anything happened uh in ukraine and so today they're trying to hide disguise justify uh their actions of releasing some of the oil reserve it's called the spro strategic petroleum reserve as a way to push down prices but that's not working uh it has it really didn't have much of an effect i could get into the details of that having been in the petroleum distribution all my career uh so what they're gonna do is they're gonna blame them for price gouging and joe bob you know here's what we have to be real careful of this is an assault on capitalism as well it's one thing to talk about the oil companies have price gouge and windfall profit taxes which you're going to p here all over the all over the new york times and los angeles times and the atlantic but they're starting with the oil companies then they're going to get to the health care industry then they're going to get to the farmer then they're going to get to everybody else that has raised their prices because of the inflation caused by the biden administration wow yeah that's uh just kind of spreads out from there i'm curious you brought up the strategic petroleum reserves i think i read somewhere that we are now at the lowest strategic oil reserves since the mid 80s uh as a part of national security is that something that we should be concerned about well it exists uh the reason that we filled it out over the years and what we filled it up was about a little under thirty dollars cost per barrel today uh when we refill it uh what we're in the 90s immediately as you and i are talking so i fill it back up we'll be at about 40 percent of capacity the purpose of the strategic oil reserve is a natural disaster that shuts down the petroleum industry or of course much more importantly a war that would temporarily shut down our production or distribution of petroleum so we've got it there to be able to take the fight to the enemy and so it's it's a wrong thing to be taking out this reserve for a catastrophe and be using it to try to push down prices and again it's not working joe bob it's not happening this is the third time this administration has pulled uh barrels out of the strategic oil now you mentioned being an oil executive so i'm curious on your take on this the white house has been the last couple weeks trying to push this idea of well there's 9 000 unused licenses by the oil company uh is there any validity to that or or what's what's actually going on there well i i'll keep this real simple if someone applies for license or permit to drill and has given that license then they determine whether or not there's crude natural gas or whatever it is under the ground then they have to finance it then once they get through that they have to get permits then to actually do the work so the the number of permits has nothing to do with whether or not there's production available in those permits sounds like they're saying everybody has a steering wheel i don't know why they're just not driving everywhere lacking the rest of the car um congressman what is your uh your sides uh your side of the aisle in this committee hearing today going to be pointed on with these oil executives well i wouldn't say we're necessarily trying to show support of the oil industry as much as point out the reality the importance of what they do how they provide energy every day whether it's to light your home to cook cook on your stove to drive your truck to deliver your goods to drive your car to work what they have talked about today in their opening statements was how much they have done to reduce emissions over the years and i can tell you having been part of that industry i i wish they'd talk about that a little more a little about what their accomplishments in that area are and they've also talked about how critical a gr how critical they are to a growing demand world of petroleum you know where it's not just the united states these these emerging countries economies are also demanding more and more oil every day which has an effect on price but here in the united states if you're going to shut down drilling distribution you're going to you're going to force the price up now i know this is more of a long-term type of thing but on effect effectively on day one of the administration they shut down all of the yank the licenses back to to complete the keystone xl pipeline is there any buzz or talk that you're hearing on the hill about possibly restarting that just given all of the things going on right now that uh restarting the keystone pipeline is not as simple as it sounds it's not just which the the flip the switch on that uh it would have to be a lot of the piping is gone a lot of permitting is gone the investors are gone the point of bringing that back up and and maybe focusing back on that is there we have crude oil right north in canada that we can bring into the united states down to our refineries and increase production and distribution so i believe in the keystone pipeline i also believe there's a pipeline coming from canada into the detroit area that they want to shut that down too so it's it's a broader conversation the keystone pipeline is an example or it's something we hold up as look what you did when you shut it down uh congressman before i let you go anything that anything that you would like to to let people know that i'm missing or the media is missing or anything that's poignant and need to be talked about that we're just not talking about we can't be we can't allow the democrats to push us to the electrification of the transportation industry until we're ready to go there that's the big deal and just trying to penalize and shut down the petroleum industry so that it forces people to buy electric cars like pete buda gig wants everybody to do is a catastrophic disastrous plan that will cost us a lot of money and as i said you know if petroleum is a lifeblood of our economy to include making plastics rubber everything else cutting off or bleeding out the petroleum industry can have catastrophic effects on our economy going forward i just i just want to clarify or at least maybe let you expand just a little bit on what you said there didn't sound like you're against any of these other initiative or green energy projects it's just you can't do it immediately is that an accurate assessment as a as an individual spent many many years in the petroleum uh within the energy distribution field yet what you're saying job is exactly right i'm not opposed to windmills solar panels to natural gas i have coal in my district we have windmills we have solar panels that's all fine you have to have enough base load or baseline power and solar and windmills aren't there yet okay the electrification transportation industry doesn't have the base load available to be distributed at this point yet the democrats would like to penalize the oil industry to force us to get there quickly awesome wow great perspective congressman thanks so much for for joining us today okay thanks for having me joe bob

thank you madam chair um so in regards to i want to reference what the ranking member was questioning you on just a few minutes ago have you had talks with the national security division regarding the memo from the attorney general i have not covered it so um are you ignoring the directive that the um attorney general's office put out i don't believe there was any specific directive for me as u.s attorney to coordinate with the national security division on that issue of conversation so there was not a directive that you coordinate from the u.s attorney's office there was a directive in the october 4th memorandum that we convened a meeting with our federal and local partners on that issue which we did i'm not familiar with any directive that i work with or coordinate with the national security division um you talk about criteria and things like that to deal with the root causes of crime do you consider parental involvement as something that's important that should be included as one of those top issues i think certainly people's family circumstances uh and support can contribute to crime you know i think there's plenty of evidence that suggests that having a stable and healthy family environment makes it less likely that you're engaged in crime and particularly violent crime thank you for that answer so we've been um i've jotted down a few phrases that we've been hearing today reimagining of course reallocate resources antiquated ideas violence interrupters all those things have been bandied around today and i would hark back to a week ago in regards to president biden's state of the union speech where he said we are going to fund the police and i think it's very clear today that that was just rhetoric on the part of the president all americans should understand that you have um per the video that we saw earlier per these words that we're hearing per the um the poster that's right behind me a quote from the chairman on june 7th of 2020 it's very clear that should be very clear to the american people that the majority party does not have an interest in getting control of crime they do not have an interest in looking out for the interests of victims and you can tell with the blame-shifting rhetoric that is being used two things that i've heard today root causes and blame covid where did we hear the term root causes about a year ago it was when vice president harris was announced as being the border czar or she's going to take care of border issues first thing she talked about was boy we've got these root causes we got to get control of this has it been brought under control what has happened on the southern border not at all we just had all kinds of root causes rhetoric so whenever you hear that term phrase root causes you know there's just going to be a lot of jabber drawing that's going to go on and then we see the second blame shift that goes on here let's blame covid same thing that we're hearing from the president's press secretary why have oil prices all of a sudden gone up here in america it's the ukraine it's the ukraine war that's what caused these oil prices to go up ignoring the fact that of what the american people know that gasoline went up a buck a gallon and it started on january 20th of 2021 when president biden said we are going to shut down fossil fuel use in this country and what was the metaphor for it it was keystone xl but there were numerous other actions that were taken that were going to shut it down so here we got the all-purpose bugaboo which is blame coved now i would encourage this committee perhaps to bring dr fauci before us and maybe he and some of the governors that put in place the draconian unconscionable shutdowns that maybe they should be answering for this because you maybe have hit on one of the root causes here the shutdowns the artificial shutdowns that we were warning you about that there is going to be huge societal harm and yes we are in part we are seeing an increase in crime as a result of these unconscionable shutdowns that turn people's up lives upside down and where were those greatest shutdowns they were in the big cities of america where we've seen this striking increase in violent crime i yielded expired miss brain in 2007 the district attorney for milwaukee county who is still there uh said and this is a direct quote from him is there going to be an individual i divert or i put into the treatment program who's going to go out and kill somebody you bet guarantee it's guaranteed to happen it does not invalidate the overall approach have you heard that kind of talk from prosecutors in your city actually i haven't heard any talk of treatment from prosecutors in new york i haven't heard any talk of it that's something that i [Music] would have you had experience where a prosecutor has not uh prosecuted someone who should be yes so you have seen um someone being weak on crime by not prosecuting a highness crime is that correct yes and also judge thank you mayor turner you said covet contributed to uh uh contributed to crime in your city is that accurate that is that is correct were were houston schools shut down for a period of time houston schools were closed for a period of time and then we strongly encouraged them to reopen yes how long ago did they reopen do you know mayor they were open all the way through 21 in this academic year and um and we strongly encourage all of our school districts uh to uh to remain open so they were closed the 2020 2021 school year in the 2021 period they closed down starting i think right around um april of 2020 and remain closed to the remaining of that school year and then in the following school year they did open up yeah the devastation that has happened as a result of closing schools has just been awful and we knew better by april of 2020 that that should not happen um mr lehmann are police in retreat is there an impact of police being in retreat which i think they are uh yet yes certainly both we have survey evidence for major departments as well as my own experience talking to officers that they have a sense of for lack of return being under fire i think you know their greatest concern in many departments not all of them many departments is that they lack the support of those in positions of leadership uh and as a result we reduced both the number of the level of police staffing in many major cities many major cities saw declines in their overall staffing last year and we know that the number of cops is directly relating to the crime level and also their willingness to be proactive to be out on the beat to confront somebody who they think is a problem before they are a problem uh it is likely both of these variables have gone down yeah so mr lehman i believe until both major parties um come out and say and do more than just lip service in saying they support the police that it's going to be hard for the police to not continue to be in retreat would you agree with that until they know that the public sentiment is behind them which we're hearing including with um documents that are behind me here until we hear that unequivocally isn't it going to be hard for police to [Music] be able to offer good constructive safe policing that keeps our communities safe think if police officers have a sense that they are not supported by civilian leadership they are less willing to uh engage in the most challenging parts of police work the most vital parts of police work and also people are less willing to be and remain police officers which contributes to a long-run staffing crisis yeah i just closed with this uh we just heard from the gentlewoman from pennsylvania that she said rejected this notion that there's red cities blue cities you know what it is very clear in democrat-run cities across america crime has skyrocketed seattle portland minneapolis madison milwaukee you name it wherever the political machine is run by democrats we've seen an explosion in crime you can try to deny that it is the case

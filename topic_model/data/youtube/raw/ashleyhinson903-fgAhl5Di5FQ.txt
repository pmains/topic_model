three east you folks in the other time zones now you're used to doing the math to figure it out and of course there's the podcast every hour separately posted and you can download it listen share it do all of that by going to toddstarns.com as i mentioned earlier when someone like me gets asked to do the program you get asked well who would you like to have on and so i am going to use host prerogative to welcome to the liberty new university newsmakers line my congresswoman she is a first-term republican from iowa she's congresswoman ashley henson congresswoman thanks for being with us on the todd stern show how are you well good afternoon jeff it's good to be with you and um excited to to step out into the fresh air here in washington dc and get out of that capital for a couple minutes well you know don't step in the swamp it's all around you there but i noticed something over the weekend as the covet as the covet bill was being debated and you spoke in favor of an amendment that you had put out there to strike fancy nancy's uh fancy subway talk about what you were trying to accomplish with that you weren't just trying to cut the money you had a better idea yeah well i think it came down to respecting taxpayers and respecting our kids and trying to fight back against the swampiest of swampy here in washington dc this was about putting students over subways so i introduced an amendment to redirect 140 million dollars that was included in that spending bill and i want to be clear it was a spending bill it wasn't entirely a covert relief bill for speaker pelosi's subway project it's a project in san francisco instead i think that money should be going to mental health resources for kids it is washington poor spending of the worst kind and it shouldn't have been in the coca-19 related bill in the first place and obviously the votes were not there to carry the day on it which was not a big surprise to you obviously but is it a matter i mean obviously we knew how probably how the vote would go but this is part of what we've been talking about isn't it that there has to be a fight in a dignified respectful manner and to specifically point out the atrocities of the swamp monsters so that maybe maybe there can be victories later on down the line that's really what we're talking about here isn't it exposing these atrocities and showing how things could be done much better very easily yes well it's it's about pointing out the contrast there jeff this is a common sense amendment that i had filed relief dollars shouldn't be going to a failed transportation project in california while our kids are suffering across the country i mean um i'm a mom just to two school age kids my kids got to get on the school bus this morning they're in a classroom learning today um meanwhile we've got about a third of students across the country who are still learning virtually we're seeing increasing rates of depression anxiety other mental health challenges among kids who've been trapped behind screens instead of getting that in-person learning and that in person interaction and so again this is about putting students over subways and prioritizing where that money is supposed to go and making it about relief and fixing the problems that we're actually seeing across this country congresswoman ashley henson of iowa's first congressional district she's joining us live on the todd starns radio program jeff stein filling in for todd today and you have and and and your fellow freshman republicans have not just been shy and let's just sit in the back and and kind of you know be quiet for a few months or uh half the term you folks have hit the ground running and and i think if i'm not mistaken you introduce the very first piece of legislation uh among your cops um talk some priorities that you have advocated so far only what two months into your 24 month term yeah well you know i started off talking about my kids were able to get on a school bus um so many kids across the country are not right now and i think parents are at a breaking point our students are at a breaking point and frankly taxpayers at a breaking point i mean we're spending um so much money on on these relief packages that are not really relief and so what i did was introduce a piece of legislation called the reopen schools act that would actually put some lanes on funding that congress appropriated to reopen schools with safety measures in place we know that safety precautions allow our schools to reopen safely 54 billion dollars was a part of the bill in december before i was even in office um this new uh monstrosity bill that passed last week had 130 billion dollars in it a very small amount of that i think five percent was supposed to be spent this year so that's a whole other story but um we want to make sure these these funds are being actually used as congress intended so that our students and our teachers can get back in the classroom um safely and quickly and i think it's important to point out the vote for the funding to be used on safety measures was bipartisan democrats voted for it um and they all voted down this bill three times now um schools can reopen safely if the right precautions are taken iowa is proof of that our schools are open iowa should be a model and a roadmap for the entire country and so that's what i'm working on trying to put some some qualifiers on that making sure that if they don't use the money to reopen they don't get it so there was a study that i got an email on today you may have had it brought to your attention that suggests that iowa is the state with the fewest coronavirus restrictions and it has to do with wearing the face mask and it has to do with health checks at restaurants and schools and everything else some of this just seems common sense you look at what's being done in our state and so many others or another tremendous example obviously and the the success is evident are these democrats just so beholden to the old school thinking or the teachers unions that they just can't do what's right for their constituents and for the people in their districts i'm i'm missing something here i think yeah no this shouldn't be about politics jeff it's frustrating that it seems that there's this resistance to working together to reopen schools which makes no sense it should be a bipartisan issue i know i'm hearing from parents and students who are struggling and they're back to school in iowa so we know there are people across the country who are are in that same boat this is a way to help them and it's really sad that the democrats in congress are refusing to come to the table on this i would say to anyone listening today if you want to see students get back to class you want to see life get back to normal for our young generation we launched a website go to openusaschools.com we can work together to address kids mental health in this country and get kids back in school and that's what this is about our kids should not be the political football here and they keep moving the goal posts on it and it's just setting the bar lower and lower when it comes to our kids mental health and education and it's just really unfortunate and um it's clearly not common sense jeff which as you know is what i i focus a lot on here in d.c all right and so as we conclude this conversation i'll ask you to repeat the website again but also so that people don't get the idea this is not just let's let's bash on the democrats i mean you have reached across the aisle in your political career back in the home state but also in washington already so i mean basically this is not just gang up on those with a d by their name right and uh congresswoman axey and myself and congressman feinstein uh congresswoman marinette miller makes from iowa our entire iowa delegation is working together to try to make sure we're getting more vaccines to iowa we've been a loud voice for our state and um i can tell you this i'm going to continue to be a loud voice for things that make sense for iowa and especially when it comes to our kids so again the website is openusaschools.com and we would love to get kids back in the classroom so we can continue to move forward and make sure our kids don't fall further and further behind congresswoman always a privilege to talk with you thanks for taking the case nationally today on the todd starns radio program and best of luck keeping up the good fight thank you jeff and we'll talk soon and thanks to everybody for listening today

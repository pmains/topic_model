president biden's proposed build back not mansion available senate majority leader chuck schumer could there be a scaled-back version of this plan one that included a tax increase on corporations and wealthy americans one that had climate legislation in there one that had the ability of medicare to negotiate drug prices one that had subsidies for individuals to help them pay for health insurance through obamacare and it looked like that mansion and schumer were making some progress on this and maybe we're going to get something done before the august recess then last night this story emerged i'll read from the washington post senator joe manchin told democratic leaders thursday he would not support an economic package that contains new spending on climate change or new tax increases targeting wealthy individuals and corporations marking a massive setback for party lawmakers who had hoped to advance a central element of their agenda before the midterm elections this fall this and other takes clearly came from schumer and schumer the schumer side of this what's the other side u.s senator joe manchin joins us on talk line this morning cindy good morning how are you hey hoppy yeah you've outlined it pretty well at the bottom line what you failed to say and what that report and what that washington post failed to say was i said chuck until we see the july inflation figures until we see the july basically federal reserve rates interest rates then let's wait until that comes out so we know that we're going down the path it won't be inflammatory to add more to inflation inflation is absolutely killing many many people they can't buy gasoline they have a hard time buying groceries everything they buy and consume for their daily lives is a hardship to them and can't we wait to make sure that we do nothing to add to that and i can't make that decision on basically on taxes of any type and also on the energy and climate because it takes the taxes to pay for the investment in the clean technology that i'm in favor of but i'm not going to do something in overreach that causes more problems so i want to get and i want to get into the specifics here but this is being portrayed by uh that you blew up the talks but you did not blow up these talks hey as far as i'm concerned we've had good good absolute con conversations we've had good negotiations we've been talking for our staffs have been working diligently for the last two to three months looking at a way happy first of all there's no human being to put that put themselves through this that they weren't sincere about trying to make things better for our country and that's my that's i know people have a hard time believing that because everything is politics my main goal is what's good for my country i'm not worried about what's good for the democrat or republican party they're going to do just fine the bottom line is is american people are getting shortsighted because of the political timetables and the political gesturing going on so what went wrong so what so what went wrong i mean you were talking clearly was it a deadline was it a deadline issue what what specifically went wrong first of all the bill back better way back when was a complete social realignment everything in the world you could throw that at night and i was very clear when the president i talked that's mr president this piece of legislation is going to change our country from when john kennedy said ask not what your country can do for you what you can do for your country that piece of legislation will change us to how much more can my country do for me and we are 30 and a half trillion dollars of debt and climbing and we have to be serious about this but inflation is broken wreaking havoc on everybody's lives i don't care what uh social run you're on so that's why that one killed there's no such thing as go back better again right this is a financial security and energy security this is what this is about and also so i said chuck if you're on a political deadline and it has to be done in july the one thing you know you can get done is basically do the bill run the piece of legislation on reducing drug prices letting medicare negotiate that saves about 288 billion dollars over 10 years take 40 billion of that and extend the affordable care act the discounts that people are getting so their premiums won't go up and also take the other 240 billion dollars and put it to debt reduction you're serious about inflation you're reducing debt you're serious about people paying higher prices for their drugs and we're doing it by letting medicare negotiate and also reduce saving off the increases that would come if the incentives that we given or the reductions we gave for the aca are not extended for two more years that's what you can do chuck in in this july and what do you say what do you say he says are you telling me you won't do the other right now i said chuck it's wrong it's not prudent to do the other right now i can't tell you in good faith because i can tell you one thing i called your staff and they all knew exactly where i stood when we saw 9.1 percent that was an alarming figure to me higher than anything since from 40 plus years so i said oh my goodness let's wait now i said guys this is a whole new this is a whole new page so they knew exactly the concern i had and what i'm doing now everything that we've been talking about for the last two months i'm trying to get all the input i can by professionals that anything we've talked about in taxes does not affect the economy of the united states of america or to the people of the united states of america i want people to pay their fair share i think corporations should pay their fair share but i've got to be careful that corporations aren't basically stymied to where they won't invest they won't hire they start laying off i want to make sure none of that can happen so i'm asking every expert that has knowledge for that and i said chuck can we just wait until the inflation figures come out in july until basically the uh fed rate the reserve are they going to raise interest how much more and how much damaging is that going to be and then make a decision what we can do and how much we can do he took that as no i guess and came out with this big thing last night and i don't know why they did that i guess i guess they try to put pressure on me but they've been doing that for over a year now doesn't make any sense at all and i'm as far as i'm concerned i want climate i want an energy policy here's the problem they have i want an energy policy basically and the only way i understand if you're going to get the price of gasoline down and the world is demanding more fossil everywhere in the world is that we need to produce more they might have a some people have a outlook that the only way you're going to do this is by eliminating stop producing fossil no more oil no more coal no more gas that's crazy the whole world's in flux right now so the only thing the united states can do is if we want to decarbonize then we're going to produce more fossil cleaner than anyone in the world and replace the dirty fossil that's going into the atmosphere now let me let me also also also one more thing also what you can do is invest in the cleaner technologies that we know that will work we know hydrogen is going to work we know we need storage for battery and battery storage that takes care of wind and solar we know that new transmission we know all these things you know geothermal small nuclear reactors i'm all for that all right let me go okay let me lay out what i think that you are saying as to what happened and then you give me uh clarifications that you all are talking your staffs are talking and i assume because you're continuing to talk you're making some progress on all these issues that we've talked about and then senator schumer according to what you're saying senator schumer says we need to act by this weekend on on something we need to get something finalized by this weekend before and before the end of july but okay before the end before the end of july and you're saying i don't want to act that quickly because we got the new inflation numbers see what the fed's going to do we don't have to do this until the end of the fiscal year federal fiscal year end of september so we have more time so let's wait and see what the inflation number is for the next month and for what the fed does is that a correct is that a correct summary of what you say happened you're on the right you're on the right track here's the thing inflation was 8.8 percent the month before correct we were told that it was going to go down i thought it was 9-1 but but anyway whatever it's high no no it was at 8.8 before now went to 9.1 so went up yeah now they're saying that's not accurate they might be right i hope they're right i hope it's not accurate i hope basically it goes down to to eight seven five seven whatever that gasoline everything starts becoming more affordable i'm hoping for all of that i haven't seen that now the thing i said shouldn't you err on the side of caution when basically the economy the united states of america and everybody that's out there working struggling hustling trying to make it you know we all want a cleaner environment absolutely well you wanted to wait but you're not gonna you gotta you have an august recess coming up you're not gonna be in session in august the work will be done we can come back to first of september and pass this piece of legislation if it's a good piece of legislation now let me tell you the politics are involved all right and i will and i will i will fault mitch mcconnell for doing and what he's done he said he was going to hold up the chips bill the the thing that we have fallen so far behind is basically and that's the microchip bill to help companies in this country produce the microchips that would have to rely on on on china go ahead and mitch mcconnell says i'm not going to deal with that right okay okay so he says basically we're not going to do that bill which we already passed it in the senate bipartisan but if it came back from the house for adjustments he would hold that hostage if we try to do anything in reconciliation and i'm thinking to myself you mean if we have a good piece of legislation that gives us a solid energy path for 10 years that we can produce get our gas prices down and have some reliance and confidence in the energy market that we're producing pipelines are taking the energy where we need it helping our allies around the world and also investing in the cleaner technology for the future of energy that we need in our country and do that without harming the economy that mitch mcconnell is going to try to take the republican party down the path and and and scuttle that i said that'll be shame on him so that's wrong they're afraid of now if we wait till september that he'll use the continuing resolution hold that hostage and the continued resolution means we have to keep our government open and i said you're telling me that if we have a good piece of legislation and we've run all of the scenarios and we know it's not going to be inflationary and we vote on that bill september in the first week of september that he's going to hold the continuing resolution hostage and shut down the government and the republicans take ownership of that i don't think so that's the difference we have you're playing a political calendar a political agenda and i do not subscribe to that at all let's go to senator sanders what helps the country senator joe manchin is with us where were you all and you don't have to get into all the details but just philosophically where were you clearly there are many democrats including senator schumer who want to do more than you want to do on on climate let's talk about on climate and you want you want you you want more production you don't want to put a heavy hand on fossil fuels you want decarbonization those kinds of things you want permitting reforms you want those you don't want to see carbon fuels starved so were you all close at all on climate legislation which would seem to me like the biggest hold up between you and some other democrats were you close at all on on the energy front i've got to be honest with we're moving in a very very productive very good i think a position it's been a long time in coming because uh the hard thing is this administration and a lot of my colleagues on the left side of the democratic party have been very clear eliminate eliminate eliminate quit using any other fossil don't put one investment don't put another inch of pipe in the ground don't carry any of it just starve it and kill it with a thousand cuts i said i'm sorry if that's where you are and you're not willing to move from that there's no further discussions needed we don't need to talk this was two or three months ago and and and credit to them they said no we want to talk i said fine i said that in 10 years you're not going to replace the horsepower of fossil fuels with renewables you might 20 years or so we have to go in that in that position but i'm not going to to be part of eliminating what this country needs to run the economic engine and the lives of human beings throughout america and also the support we have to give our allies around the world i'm not going to do that betting on the com that's what europe didn't know that european model has not worked well for europe they're in really really challenging position right now and i'm harmful i'm very hopeful that we can help them before the winter sets in but anyway that's where we went poppy and we talked about that and i said fine i want a robust aggression and fossil for the 10-year program and the cleanest carbon capture doing it and producing it we produce oil coming out of the gulf cleaner than anything were you close almost were you caught i thought we were i thought we were moving truly in the right direction but then i said you have to pay for that i knew no republican because they want to protect the tax code the way it is even if we see loopholes we've seen loopholes hopping we've seen loopholes for the very wealthy that don't need it is that where the corporate is that where the tax increase came into play well here's where the tax basically we said okay a 15 percent minimum they wanted to do 15 starting with what we call the oec the over overseas all of our uh international yeah everybody would pay at least a minimum of their corporations right well you know what the rest of the rest of the countries aren't following they're having a heck of a time and i said we're not going to go down that path overseas right now because the rest of the countries won't follow and we'll put all of our international companies in jeopardy which harm the american economy can't do that so we took that off the table i'm telling you things that we've been working on for months i said but fifteen percent minimum in america makes sense but there's a lot of companies that don't pay quite fifty percent some pay numbers some of us should pay something but with that i want to make sure that we're not harming our economy with some of those people that they're going to say well if you change this tax code and put that minimum even though that we have earned the discounts because of our investments the money we're putting back we're hiring we're building i want to make sure that we haven't disrupted that that's all we're looking at everything hopping okay looking at everything not throwing i'm not throwing caution to the wind i want to make sure and this july figures will tell us if we're on track to do what we need to do or we have to adjust it some that's right so so bottom line senator joe manchin is with us so bottom line what happens now do you continue talks is there a chance to do something uh obviously not by the end of july before the end of the fiscal year where do you want to go from here and where is it possible to go from here hoppy i've been sincere as i can be i want to help our country i think we need an energy policy that works for our country i think we need an investment into the new technologies that will be totally carbon free and and we can do that also with those investments but we cannot expect those investments to produce the energy that we need in a 10-year cycle without relying on the transition of fossil that we need right now who calls who is eliminated who calls who to restart oh i'm not stopping uh you know what they this is rhetoric i've been through this all my life politically and i've never seen it at this level high of level that you would throw caution just throw it out like rubble throw it out and then stick the dogs on them thinking they're going to put all this pressure on me i am where i have been i would not put my staff through this i would not put myself through this if i wasn't sincere about trying to find a pathway forward to do something that's good for our country they cannot come to grips because i have a d by my name or someone has an r by their name we should do whatever one side wants that's not me there's only one side as far as i'm concerned that's the american side and they're having a hard time understanding that from me we're going to leave it there u.s senator joe manchin senators good to speak with you uh certainly good deep insights on what's going on here we will stay in touch thank you very much you got more insight than most anyone's gotten right now and i hope this received in the most positive way for our country all right real okay very good thank you sir okay

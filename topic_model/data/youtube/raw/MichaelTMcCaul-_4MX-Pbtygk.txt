Security Committee Chairman Mike McCall he's speaking to reporters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa Florida right now that's the home of the US military's Central Command which oversees the Middle East as well as the Special Operations Command I want to briefly listen in I did I came here initially to get a briefing on our counterterrorism efforts from a military perspective in the war against terror load that I know on the down here the terror would strike America in the heartland and my heart goes out to the families of the victims of the four Marines and the wounded you know what happened yesterday unfortunately could happen anytime anyplace anywhere in this current threat environment but to see four of our military personnel of four US Marines killed on US soil at one of our training centers to me is unacceptable in this fight against Isis and the terrorists must escalate and we must win we must prevail and defeat them I can talk a lot about the case I know we're going to go into a QA now let me give you just a threat landscape in the threat environment if it can happen in Chattanooga Tennessee it can happen anywhere and the stats prove this over the last year we've had over 60 isis-related arrest in the United States that's more than one Isis follower arrested in this country more than one per week we have forted were 50 plots against the west so I commend the FBI and homeland security and our state and local law enforcement for the good work that they've done in stopping these terror plots but people ask them what keeps me up at night what keeps me up at night is the one case we don't know about because we do know about a lot of the plots we do know a lot about the individuals and the communications going on in the United States but this one we did not this is the one that we worried about this is the one that unfortunately happened yesterday resulting in the death of four of our United States Marines the threat is real and it comes from the internet this is a new generation of terrorists this has not been laden in caves and couriers anymore this is what the new threat of terrorism looks like and it comes from the internet it comes out of Syria it comes from Isis followers Isis recruiters Isis operators out of Syria with directives into the United States to activate individuals in the United States they don't have to travel the Syrian Iraq they're already here to activate them to commit acts of terror and what have been there missives over the past course of the past six months we've been intensely intensely trying to stop these directives these mrs. from activating individuals in the United States many of you recall the fourth of July there was a serious plot in New York that the FBI and homeland security stopped but we can only be lucky so many times we can always stop so much they only have to be right one time one percent and unfortunately I believe yesterday they were this will no doubt be proclaimed as a victory by them but we will have the final word in this war against them these directives call for multiple things but primarily they call for the attack of military installations in the United States and they also call to kill military personnel and to kit to kill police officers and we've seen these missives time and time again there are over two hundred thousand tweets Isis tweets per day that we are trying to monitor but the volume and that are so high and so intense that's hard to get handle on it it's very difficult for the FBI and homeland security to stop and disrupt every one of these and again I believe yesterday was one of those they got through I'm I have a lot of emotions about what happened yesterday this is the event we've been most worried about and then it happened I don't know how many more of these could happen but I can tell you there are Isis investigations in all 50 states across the United States of America they are permeating our society in this country through the internet and through social media it's very very difficult to stop it and I believe yesterday unfortunately we couldn't again I pray for the families it's extremely tragic to see an American soldier killed on American soil it's never happened it should never happen as i get my briefings today at MacDill Air Base we want to take the fight to them over in Syria in Iraq to stop them from doing what they did yesterday we need to drain the swamp so we don't have to swat the mosquitoes over here that is a threat to the homeland and so with that I'd like to turn it over for questions fire fire directed by faces I just got off the phone with the FBI had a very good briefing with them I can tell you this they have opened this case now as a terrorism case which is very significant right now the his communication devices are being there on the airplane as I speak going to Washington where they will be looked very combed over very closely for any information regarding any foreign direction about these tweets as I'm telling you about the forensics will be done on the computer devices and I know we'll know a lot more and probably the next 12 hours as to what what information can is contain on those devices my substance based on my experience both as a federal prosecutor as a chairman of Homeland Security and that is we've seen too much of this traffic there to me the warning signs the targets are identical to the targets called by Isis to attack so my judgment in my experience is this was an isis-inspired attack and it has been open as a terrorism investigation by them by the FBI which is a very significant event in this case I can't confirm that till we've done a full forensics of his technical devices his computers cell phones one aspect that concerns us and the FBI and homeland as well is the ability of these terrorists and Isis to go into what's called dark space they communicate over Twitter accounts with Americans in the United States but they can rapidly jump from one Twitter account to the next and the other phenomenon is they can jump out of normal communications that we could see to what's called dark space on platforms that even if we have a court order we cannot see these communications at all if that is here then I think we need to change the way we look at this maybe change some policies and I think that's the greatest concern that the intelligence community and FBI and homeland have is that they may be communicating this dark space and there's no way we can stop it you know I think that there's there's a legal way to do this but there's also I've been turning to the technology companies to see if there's a technology solution to this a creative technology solution all right we're going to break away from the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Mike McCall he's holding a news conference as you can see these making important news over there breaking news he is now working under the assumption he says this was in fact what occurred in Chattanooga yesterday an isis-inspired terrorist act the worst nightmare that he worries about because there were no indications that this young man Mohammad youssuf Abdulazeez was in fact plotting anything along these lines

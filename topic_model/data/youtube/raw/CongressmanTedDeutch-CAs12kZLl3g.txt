joining us now to talk about all of this is Democratic congressman Ted George he represents this district where this happened congressman thank you for being here I'm so sorry for your people thanks Alison I don't know how to ask the question any differently I don't know how many times I have to ask the question about why we can't stop this do you have any wisdom on this well it's it's not wisdom that we need it's action that we need I just I appreciate the interview that you just did with the two students and and I as they were leaving I just went to tell them how brave I thought they were and and he looked at me and and he said we want action and that's that that's coming from someone who had to endure just unspeakable horror yesterday what happened here in in an incredible community full of wonderful people the kids of the school I was at this school just a few weeks ago these are some of the best kids you'll find anywhere and this is considered it was voted the safest town in Florida right and so what all that that shows us is that no one is immune from this kind of from this kind of slaughter and look I I have to tell you for all of the people who have been saying you can't politicize this for the people who have who have gone in to attack anyone who said anything about the need to do something the only people who are politicizing what happened here the loss of life the tragedy that one of the worst days that anyone here will ever experience are the people who don't want to take action are the people who are looking for any reason to give Congress one more chance to be silent and and you shouldn't have to feel the way I do you shouldn't have to stand with a group of camera in front of a high school where kids were slaughtered don't want to do something and those kids want us to do it today they want us to talk about it today the people who endured it and lived through it want it to happen today so what's the problem with Congress know what they don't want I'll tell you what those kids don't want they don't want to turn on c-span and watch a moment of silence in the house and then utter silence going forward I was my colleagues came up to me yesterday to offer support and condolences there were Democrats there were Republicans they came from every part of the country and I believed them they were sincere and I appreciate it but the the nice words aren't enough we have to look for ways to try to prevent future tragedies like this from taking place yes this is the school shooting and it's a slaughter it's one of the worst mass shootings in our country's history we can't be numb to it we can't accept this as just part of the the price of living in America that's not who we are we owe it to these the kids that you just had on the families of those whose lives were lost here we've got to look for ways every way everything has to be on the table some people say it's just mental health let's talk about mental health some people rightly point out that that there are there's no reason to have high-capacity magazines let's have that debate let's talk about ar-15s let's talk about the Second Amendment and not in there a million discussion are you having those discussions in the halls of Congress we're not having those discussions my god Allison the only the only way that we were able to have a discussion about guns and gun safety on the House floor was by sitting in on the House floor for 26 hours straight that's not the way that you staged a sit-in meaning create a sit-in I look I've raised this with the speaker directly I raised it with the speaker after Paulson for the worst master yes we were here for that Chris and I were reporting on that too and I mean you just with each one of these things you just think that you'll never see something as devastating and then somehow they upped the ante and so what was the speaker's response when you raised all of these things well I like to speak the speaker's response was we were not we're not going to talk about that now I I told the speaker at the time the discussion was about the piece of legislation the reasonable legislation that said if you're too busy if you're too dangerous to board a plane if you're on the no-fly list then you shouldn't be able to buy a gun not controversy at all I told the speaker if you've got concerns about about the civil rights concerns if you've got stories about due process which I think was his argument then let's sit down and talk about it but clearly we ought to be able to find some way to take meaningful steps Allison after in Las Vegas there was a moment a moment where everyone at least said well you even the NRA said well maybe we should outlaw anonymity why would you ever be able to turn a semi-automatic and automatic then what happened well Congress even the NRA said maybe we should do that I remember they quickly pivoted and said well we're gonna let the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms go forward with this know now when when as many people die on a regular basis when you have school shooting after school shooting when you have this scene repeated everywhere in the country all the time we can't allow anyone else to try to take care of this we have to try to do it I've received messages not just from all around the country but from I'm on the Foreign Affairs Committee from people I know around the world they can't believe it and we have we've got to try to find somebody to do this it's not political those kids who were killed weren't killed because of what they believe what their party is how they voted in the last election their students who showed up at school and never got home and so how do you explain it why does the NRA how is it that the NRA has a stranglehold on lawmakers I mean I was looking at the donations that the NRA gives to various lawmakers they're like four thousand here seven thousand there that's worth it right I don't I don't know why I looked I don't want to have a conversation about life well don't act I want to have a conversation about what we have to do to cause people to act that's going forward that's what's the answer what do what does have to happen to get people to act well look the the governor's our governor is down here with the Attorney General the President of the United States is going to be about an hour from here over the weekend I would think that instead of instead of tweeting as the President did yesterday that that some are trying to to inject politics in this I would think that there's an opportunity for someone like the President to actually be a leader and say we can't have this happen and remember the kinds of things that he had said when he was a candidate in his prior life look this is not it's not political and I know there are people watching who who are just they're so anxious for me to bash one side that to make this a political fight look the politics are are hard they're really hard but you not no member of Congress should should have to come down here get out of their car and read a grieving mayor who shared with me the stories of the people that she knows whose kids were there who didn't come home like no one should have to feel that in order to want to take action I I know that this is hard I know that we've got discussions about stranglehold in the politics and outside interest groups I don't care about them I care about stopping things like this from happening so that families don't have to grieve so that we don't have to go through this time and time and time again we hear you Ozma tekkdoge we hope that your colleagues in Congress hear you as well we hope that you can make some progress even in beginning the conversation thanks so much I appreciate

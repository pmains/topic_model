the senior Democrat the ranking member of the Finance Committee leaves the floor and before our senator from colleague from Ohio leaves the floor I just want to thank them both we would not be here on this day without you and without your leadership both of you and when the sherrod Brown says that he's never met a trade agreement he wanted to even think about the supporting thank you for making this one that virtually all of us can support my my highest regards Thank You mam Madam President Madam President I was featured it starts off by mr. president over and over again but I'm gonna say Madam President and I'd rise today to discuss the new treaty to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement affectionately known as NAFTA last week those of us who serve on the Finance Committee had an opportunity to evaluate new NAFTA in fact about a half dozen or so committees have had the opportunity to given different jurisdictions to do that with respect to this trade agreement and Madam President as you know trade rules are often dense agreements that have hundreds of provisions relating to any number of issues but ultimately ultimately trade agreements and trade legislation moves through the Senate Finance Committee we just heard from two of our senior members as another scene you remember that committee for many years now I've considered many trade bills looked at what impact those bills would have on American consumers producers manufacturers farmers and businesses and citizens after all our economy depends on making sure other countries can sell to us and that we can sell to other countries especially close allies like Canada or north and Mexico to ourselves following years of uncertainty thanks to the president's haphazard trade wars I believe this agreement will provide a measure of certainty for those who help drive our economy provisions included in the new NAFTA will help in our state on the Delmarva Peninsula our poultry producers gain better access to Canadian markets it's not just important $2 it's important to Maryland to Virginia and other places where they raise chickens further the new trade the deal increases mark access for dairy farmers in in Delaware those across the country to sell their milk products products like powdered milk to Canada the International Trade Commission estimates that this will allow for an additional 315 million dollars in exports annually that's 315 million dollar increase in exports just on the milk side the dairy side in sales to Canada every year when we evaluate the new NAFTA as what it is a trade deal I believe it or make significant improvements on past trade agreements including the original NAFTA new NAFTA ad stronger language to ensure that the obligations to all three counties under multilateral environmental agreements including the kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol can be fully enforced I'll come back and talk more about that a minute in short well thanks thanks primarily to Democrats though it's no longer the case that the failure of one NAFTA country to ratify an environmental agreement can be used to prevent the others from being held accountable for failing to honor their obligations new nafta also includes new provisions that have never been included in trade agreements before environmental violations will now be treated as trade violations so when the united states does bring cases under the new nafta's environmental obligations those cases will be easier to win going forward thus agreement also includes significant new wins for coastal states including binding provisions around overfishing around conservation of marine species and marine debris when we talk about marine debris just keep this in mind there is floating out and the oceans of the world something called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch it's largely plastics it is twice the size of Texas not twice the size of Delaware not twice the size of Maryland twice the size of Texas an agreement - it's 88 million dollars for environmental monitoring cooperation and enforcement the new NAFTA creates an environment environment and unfortunate mechanism that gives environmental stakeholders and expanded role and enforcement matters this will go a long way toward ensuring that environmental violations can be investigated and eliminated and a substantive in a timely manner so my colleagues have heard me say before I have a friend who would you ask him how he's doing he replies compared to what well compared to all the previous trade agreements that this body has considered new NAFTA and it's implementing legislation have the strongest environmental enforcement provisions that we've seen to date period that's good news especially for a tree deal put forth under this administration now does the new and NAFTA include everything that my Democratic colleagues in Iowa and some Republican colleagues would have liked to see with regards to environmental protection no it does not thus no NAFTA fails to recommit the United States for example to the Paris Accords it fails to ratify the kigali amendment that I mentioned earlier to the Montreal Protocol which could bring the global community together to reduce the use of something called HFCS hydro fluorocarbons found in products like air conditioners and freezers and prevent by the use of those follow-on products to HFCS prevent up to a half degree celsius increase in global warming by the end of this century just we're doing this one thing one thing and like so many of the Trump administration's proposals the new NAFTA fails to even mention the word climate change but this trade agreement does add important tools and resources that were primarily negotiated by Democrats to strengthen the deal hall the administration accountable to enforce NAFTA countries Senate will be in order madam madam president would you say that again the Senate will be in order thank you madam president yes for this agreement I'll say this again but this is a trade agreement does add important tools and resources that were primarily negotiated by Democrats to strengthen the deal Paul the administration accountable to enforce NAFTA countries environmental obligations and help ensure that those who break the rules are actually held accountable mr. president Madam President Madam President as the senior top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works for many here on the Senate I am especially a wire the extreme and destructive environmental policies put forth by the current administration week after week I hope to lead the fight against some reckless robots too many unbelievably qualified candidates and their relentless attempt to chip away at our nation's bedrock environmental protections we know what to expect from this administration when it comes to environmental policy and as a result I know the environmental provisions in new NAFTA thanks to the hard work of both from from Democrats in the house and the Senate and some Republicans too are far stronger than where we started it's certainly not perfect and we can and we must do more going forward but it's better than we've ever done before and that must be recognized I just want to pause here for a moment madam president to thank ambassador Robert light hyzer and his staff the trade trade ambassadors our trade reps office for their hard work and their willingness to engage with my colleagues and with me it's been an extraordinary extraordin outreach great responsiveness and I just want to say thank you to the ambassador and to his team reminds me a little bit of what we had with Michael Froman when he was a trade rep in the last administration let me into her with this amount of president if I could while it's good news that we were able to reach an agreement on the new NAFTA I want to caution my colleagues that the uncertainty caused by president Trump's haphazard approach to trade is far from over president Trump's multi-front trade war with our allies and our trading partners is approaching two years now that's two years of American farmers American manufacturers retailers and small businesses experiencing increased costs from president Trump's Terrace while simultaneously being locked out of overseas markets due to retaliatory tariffs that's two years of uncertainty and disruption for American businesses that have had to put investments into hiring decisions on hold and two years of uncertainty for the American workers who aren't sure if their jobs will continue to exist as trade wars dragged on and where has that gotten us well a limited trade agreement with Japan that may be better than nothing but is largely an attempt to cover up some of the negative effects that withdraw from the trans-pacific trade partnership PPP has had on our economy and our global competitiveness for those who don't remember TPP trans-pacific partnership as you recall negotiated in the last administration was a 12 nation trading bloc negotiated by primarily by US Trade Representative Michael Froman and his staff that included 40% of the world's economy in one trading bloc 12 nations guess who let it we did guess was exploded China for the bad behavior that they sometimes follow on the outside they were looking in and somehow we walked away from that and well we have to come up with in its place is something that's in my view not not nearly as bold and unfortunately not to pass the path that we've taken I'm still reviewing the text of the the phase 1 for that in post phase 1 trying a trade deal that was signed I think today but from what I've seen the agreement falls far short of the structural reforms to China's plant economy that President Trump has Trump trumpeted for some time it's as best I can tell those structural reforms in China's plant economy just did not make the final cut so as we enter this new year and a new decade I sincerely hope that our president will rethink but many believe were senseless approaches to trade and return to a multilateral approach much like we had on trans-pacific partnership where the United States works with our allies and trading partners to constructively write the global rules of trade [Applause]

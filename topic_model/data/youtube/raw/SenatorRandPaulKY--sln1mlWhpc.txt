among those who are wondering and curiously a tad about whether this was just a political vendetta Rand Paul the chairman of the federal spending oversight and emerging management subcommittee to whom he was eager to have Rick Grinnell addressed the acting intelligence official senator where does that stand is Rick Grinnell going to testify to your committee if you've got confirmation of that no but I did send a letter last evening to the Director of National Intelligence Rick Cornell and asked him if he would declassify this and we got this information today and released it and I think this is astonishing that Vice President Biden and really all of President Obama's inner circle individually were requesting the unmasking of a political opponent and you know you remember there was a whole to-do about trying to impeach a president saying that we're using the power of government to go after a political opponent this is this is a smoking gun if there ever was one that Vice President Biden was using the power of government abusing that power to go after a political opponent essentially unmasking someone is the equivalent of illegally wiretapping them the government had permission to listen to the Russian ambassador but to protect Americans we mask their identity but you got the whole President Obama's inner circle clamoring around listening to the private conversation I think illegally and I think with ill ill ill begotten motives do you know senator whether it is unmasking request then in each and all of these cases occurred after the election I mean obviously the assessment was prior to the election that Hillary Clinton was going to win obviously that didn't happen so did a lot of this that transpire after the election itself the document that we got listed all the names and listed the date that they did the unmasking so vice president unmasked general Flynn to listen to his conversation which i think is reprehensible but so did James Comey so did James clapper so did John Brennan so did Samantha Power's and so did President Obama's chief of staff and a dozen other people so think about this it's illegal to listen to people's private conversations you can listen to if you have a national security matter a foreigner but it's thus the foreigner saying we're gonna blow up the capital and will you help me you don't get to listen to the other person's conversation if they're just talking so general Flynn was never accused of saying anything untoward never saying anything that was committing a crime but they all listened to his conversation and then they all decided we've got to get this guy let's try to entrap him let's try to bring him in and see if we can get him either to lie make him his statement or we can get him on the Logan act so this was a cabal this was a conspiracy and really the question is did President Obama directed all or didn't Vice President Biden now we now know for a fact Vice President Biden was involved and he needs to be questioned on this because we can't elevate someone to the presidency who's willing to use the the intelligence community to spy on his political opponents that should be a deal killer because the timing is important senators you know probably better than anyone that the administration the Obama administration in its waning weeks was slapping and punitive measures for their involvement in the election and then lo and behold they argue they get wind of a top trump aide who is now talking to the Russian ambassador would that raise enough concerns to justify them wanting to know more about that well the national security advisors job is to interact with foreign leaders and I think if you looked at the Obama administration they actually look at Press reports there are dozens of press reports of the Obama administration on the way in when they came in after george w bush of them talking to foreign leaders there's nothing wrong in fact i think it's appropriate to talk to foreign leaders and discuss a wide range but it should be and is illegal to listen to an Americans conversation and it's even worse if you're listening to an American who just happens to be your political opponent from the opposite party so no this was this was a conspiracy of high ranking Obama officials to try to falsely convict and taint a 33 year veteran of the military I think it's principal you know if you've heard our number top Democratic official senator are saying that this is all subterfuge and a distraction campaign led by Republicans even this morning at the New York Times Steve after good an expert on government classification was saying it is part of a struggle over who controls the narrative the investigation of the 2016 election going on to say it is putting the spotlight on the investigators rather than the investigated it is saying that the what's irregular here is not the extraordinary contacts with the Russian government but the attempt to understand that what do you say yeah I think what you find is and what we're finding is we look at the FISA Court and these secret courts that were intended to be used against foreigners that the Obama administration and frankly some Republican administrations have termed these organizations that are supposed to be directed towards foreigners and turned them on to Americans this is an abuse of power this is a bigger broader debate we're now discussing the FISA Court and the Patriot Act and I'm making the point that a secret court that doesn't use the Constitution as its standard should not be used to investigate a presidential campaign so I have an amendment that I will put forward tomorrow that says it's illegal Americans would be exempt from this foreign court and you'd be surprised the institutional forces around here many of them still want to keep this because they like this secret court but this secret court is unconstitutional in the sense that their standard is that you might be working or a probable cause that you're working with a foreign government the Fourth Amendment says we can't spy on you or get a warrantless as probable cause of committing a crime that's a much higher standard so that's why I think Americans should not be included in the FISA Court and my amendment would fix this I don't care if you're a Republican a Democrat or an independent the intelligence community the spa's should not be spying on Americans and particularly not on American campaigns do you think that eventually Rick Rennell will we'll talk to your committee I think we need to get to the bottom of this I don't know how much longer he's going to be in the Intelligence director spot but I do think it's important that he Declassified this because in his short term over there he's trying to get to the truth and is there anything you can imagine why this would be classified it's classified only to cover their tracks and this is a problem with classification in general in government it's overused by the executive branch to cover up crimes and abuse of power this at the very least was an abuse of power and because Ric Bernal was brave enough to declassify it we now know that the Vice President Biden was intimately involved in this and we have this perplexing question why dozens even assistance to assistance we're now looking at this there's also the question that others are bringing up Samantha power did this over 200 times and when she was asked about it she says she didn't remember most of those and didn't think she really did it well she didn't do it who did it and who could have the power to unmask people listen and eavesdrop on them without telling their boss I mean this is an enormous power and it needs to be core tailed so for me this isn't about politics this is about abuse of power while we should always try and strive hard to limit government power particularly with these spy agencies now Rick Grinnell is free to decline talking dear committee could you force the issue my committee doesn't have subpoena power but I think he's already done a great service by releasing this by declassifying this and we're getting closer to the truth I think now one of them by the way isn't classified this senator could I understand did you then release the the classified material to the public yes I released this about an hour ago I requested this from him by letter when it was released and we got the information we released that today and so I'm proud of the fact that he stepped up and did something that I think we need more of in government and that is to shine a light on what goes on and when people use government and corrupt fashion to shine a light on it senator thank you very much for taking the time Senator Rand Paul on this

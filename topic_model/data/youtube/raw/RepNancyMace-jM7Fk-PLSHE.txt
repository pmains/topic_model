joining me now congresswoman from south carolina nancy may she was the first woman graduate of the citadel and the first gop woman elected to congress from south carolina congresswoman how are you i'm great trey and so good to see you on fox news i'm really glad i am a huge fan girl so i'm just awesome to see you tonight well thank you and we are thrilled to have you now you went to the citadel i could not make it four days at the citadel you graduated you may be the first woman to graduate the citadel i think you are right yes i sure am let me ask you this all right so you're the first woman to graduate the citadel which for those who are not from south carolina is a military school and it's tough to get through it's tough and then you're the first woman elected yes no absolutely first republican woman elected from south carolina to congress but you served in congress a number of years serving in congress every week at least where i am is like hell week at the citadel it's tough as nails up here too well we're going to talk about congress in a second but i want to focus on something happy tell me the people that inspired you i mean you you have two firsts on your resume who gave you the confidence to help you believe that you could be the first two different times my parents my mom and my dad my mom is a retired school teacher my dad is retired army general he served 28 years in the united states military and my dad was a citizen grad i dropped out of high school at the age of 17 and i was a waitress at the waffle house on the side of the interstate when i dropped out of school and when i when i stopped going to school my parents said well if you're going to stop going to school you've got to start going to work and i learned some very tough lessons during some very tough times and i was 17 and i eventually got my high school diploma but a year later this citadel decided to let women in and that was in 1996 and i knew that if i could meet that challenge if i could face that obstacle face adversity and a challenge unlike anything i'd faced in my life that i could be successful there that i could be successful anywhere and i learned that if you had a dream and you set some goals and you worked hard you could achieve it and i had something to prove to myself and something to prove to my family that i could work hard and be successful and i was able to do that at the citadel the place literally saved my life what gave you the confidence the inspiration to say you know what i've done this i also served in the general assembly in south carolina but now i'm going to take on national politics i'm going to run for congress well this time it was my children and i'm a single working mom and my children know how much i love i love them i love my kids and i love my country and when you love something you love doing something it really doesn't feel like work and so the work i do every single day seven days a week 24 hours a day is for my kids and they appreciate and they they value that and it's important but the other thing that's important is this year in the 2020 cycle is that that republican women prove we more than double the number of republican women in the house and it's not just democrat women that have a monopoly on breaking glass ceilings republican women like myself we've been doing it all of our lives and i want to thank you for having me on tonight and and telling this story it's important that both sides you know we can realize that that women on both sides are breaking glass ceilings everywhere and i can tell you the freshman women in my class they are tough as nails they are smart and nothing and no one is going to get in the way of them holding and us holding nancy pelosi accountable and this congress congresswoman what you're on oversight i believe veterans affairs what are some of the legislative initiatives i know you're in the minority i know how tough it is but you still try what are some of the things you're trying to get done for south carolina while you're in congress well it's important you know i'm trying to work as hard as i can my message to republicans and democrats across the aisle or that is that i am willing to work with anyone who's willing to work with us and i didn't know as a freshman you could have more than one or two committees i sit on infrastructure the va and also oversight and infrastructure issues in south carolina's first congressional district are very very important but not only to my district but to my state and to my region as you know and the va having seen my father deal with health implications from exposure to agent orange and vietnam for his entire life nearly you know i really respect and honor and admire those men and women in uniform who sacrifice everything to serve us and protect our freedoms here and abroad and then as you know on oversight trying to follow in your footsteps a little bit trey you know holding government accountable looking for waste fraud and abuse and exposing the corruption you passed my footsteps a long time ago nancy you're you're two different firsts and i'm zero different first so thank you for coming on i hope you have a great weekend

and let's bring in florida republican congressman byron donalds congressman it's good to see you so president biden had a speech yesterday where he again ripped so-called mega republicans but he is now being very careful dialing it back a little bit not to paint all republicans with the same brush listen to what he's been saying i've been able to work with mainstream republicans my whole career but the extreme maga republicans in congress have chosen to go backwards full of anger violence hate and division but together we can and we must choose a different path he also said in that speech that america has been able to overcome challenges because it is a nation of unity of hope of optimism and that's something that he pledged during his inaugural address and i'm wondering in the last 18 months where is the unity the hope and the optimism been for a united america there is no unity joe biden doesn't want unity what joe biden wants is for every american to bend the knee to his agenda what these senate democrats want is for you to do the same they don't want competition they don't want debate they want to actually squelch and put down free speech that's why they're working with social media companies to stop americans from actually communicating on a myriad of topics including covet 19. so this is where we are people need to understand this joe biden's idea of unity is you do it his way and then you don't challenge him because everybody sees it anytime he's challenged by a member of the press or even a citizen in the audience what does he start doing he starts yelling he starts point he starts pointing fingers that's not leadership that's demagoguery that's actually an autocrat and if you look at his actions whether you want to talk about student loans or the fact that he ignores immigration law or anything else in between this man does not care about the constitution or the rule of law actually republicans do that's why us maga republicans we are the ones fighting for the soul of america we are the ones having to save america from joe biden and the democrats now the president is trying to make this election all about president trump uh and not about him and while he is leading the charge in terms of rhetoric on the ground floor level democrats are spending millions of dollars trying to get elected in the primaries candidates who have the imprimatur of donald trump as opposed to candidates that they think might be able to beat the democrat in in november you say that this is right for hypocrisy of course it is because they're telling the american people oh these these these republicans are dangerous but at the same time who are they trying to support america first republicans people who are committed conservatives who are not interested in the games of washington d.c they're interested about actually getting the job done for the american people because what the democrats believe i think it's wrong but what they believe is is that if you make donald trump the center of the ballot they win and republicans lose and they get to keep their majorities but i got a funny thing to tell them they're going to be flat wrong because what the american people have seen in 19 months with joe biden at the helm is that the democrat agenda has failed all americans and what people really want in our country they want to go back to 2019 america when our economy was growing our streets were safe our border was secure our standing around the globe was number one numero uno and we actually had a president who was doing the job you might have disagreed with something he tweeted here there but you knew the job was being done by the american president nobody has confidence in joe biden right now you know what president biden is doing uh certainly uh is is not precedent setting because he has a long and rich history of strident and divisive language this call for number two control room let's go back to uh 2012 this is from august the 14th listen here romney wants to let the he said the first hundred days he's gonna let the big banks once again write their own rules unchain wall street they're going to put you all back in chains but now infamous comment is going to put you all back in chains i mean this is something that this president does to try to demonize the other side and fire up the democratic base now he does this all the time this is more gaslighting from joe biden and frankly from a lot of these democrats running for senate john fetterman in pennsylvania does the same thing this kind of demonizing this kind of gaslighting as opposed to debating his opponent by the way john you need to go debate dr oz if you're going to run for the united states senate debating the ideas is part of the job but going back to joe biden listen this is the deal with him he always does this when he's not getting his way because the man is not terribly bright he's obviously wrong when it comes to all the issues facing america and he's never actually had to hold a job in the real world and actually live up to the consequences of what he has actually done it's time for america to turn the page that starts this november all right congressman byron donalds from the great state of florida good of you to join us thanks so much anytime

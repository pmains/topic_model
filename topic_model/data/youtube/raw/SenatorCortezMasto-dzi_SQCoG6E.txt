I rise today to speak out against the nomination of Randall Coors to be a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System mr. Quarles served in the Bush administration's Treasury Department in the years that led up to the financial crisis of 2008 this failure to take action to prevent this crisis led to hundreds of thousands of foreclosures and evictions in my home state of Nevada Nevada was ground zero for the financial crisis we were the hardest hit of any state in the country we had the highest foreclosure rate for 62 months straight and we had the highest number of underwater mortgages banks took the homes of more than two hundred and nineteen thousand Nevada families anyone driving through parts of Las Vegas and Reno in 2009 could see boarded up houses for sale signs and empty lots everywhere on many streets you would see more houses in foreclosure than not I was Attorney General in Nevada during this time my team and I did everything we could to fight for homeowners and help them save their homes we sued the big banks and secured 1.9 billion dollars to create the home again homeowner relief program to help Nevada and stay in their homes that all as all of this was going on I know and knew at the time that there was only so much we could do at the state level we needed real change at the federal level to prevent the financial crisis from ever happening again the federal regulators should have protected Nevada homeowners but instead they protected the big banks bottom line I ran for a seat in the United States Senate because I wanted to change the system I wanted to put pleek rules in place that protect Nevadans not Wall Street bankers that's why I cannot in good conscience support Randall fors nomination to a 14-year term as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Randall Quarles was one of those policymakers in the Bush administration who let the big banks write their own rules maybe things would be different if he had learned the lessons of the financial crisis if he had demonstrated any understanding that radical financial deregulation only helps the big banks but Randall Quarles has been sitting on the feds Board of Governors since October of last year and since then he has advocated for policies that weaken oversight of the financial system let big banks gamble with depositors money and undermine protections for consumers and homeowners over a decade has passed since the rules he helped right caused hundreds of thousands of Nevadans to lose their homes and he still hasn't learned his lesson he's pushing the same agenda that led to the financial crisis in 2008 the mistakes he made as a member of the Bush administration devastated families and communities in my home state now the Senate is about to reward him with a position the vice chair of supervision that he will hold for the next fourteen years he will be the lead on writing the rules that govern Wall Street in the banks but I don't trust him to put families first I don't believe he will make our financial system safer and more fair Randall Corr shouldn't be allowed to oversee our financial system for 14 minutes I refuse to rubber stamp his nomination for a position that last 14 years Thank You mr. president

Last week as I travelled throughout my district,
I heard time and time and time again from people worried about one issue: health care. I heard stories like Diane in Mundelein who was able get affordable
coverage through the ACA after losing her job of 30 years to outsourcing. Claire from Vernon Hills who was
diagnosed with Neruofibromitosis just a month before her 26th birthday, yet because of ACA
has insurance despite her pre-existing condition. I was thrilled to learn that Claire recently
got married and is looking forward to pursuing her dreams, raising a family, and living a
long, productive life. Mr. Speaker, across the country there are
millions of stories like these. The ACA is far from perfect, it needs work,
– I heard that from my constituents as well. I urge my colleagues here in Congress to listen
to the people who shared their stories with me and end this ill-considered repeal effort. Instead let’s get to work together to deliver
quality, affordable health care for the American people. people.

I do want to point out that the rest of the budget does matter the Chairman and I have had a little bit of an argument about this where the Armed Services Committee we should pay attention to that you know don't sacrifice our troops for the sake of domestic he always says political priorities that's the one word in your argument that I find not really appropriate there's nothing political about it it's a policy choice it is basically deciding what domestic priorities are important and make no mistake about it the discretionary budget is a zero-sum game I mentioned yesterday the President's budget 54 billion dollar-plus up for defense 54 billion dollar cut from non-defense discretionary so don't tell me that one thing doesn't have anything to do with the other but even the so-called budget resolution the budget agreement that the House Republicans have come up with but have not yet dared to put to a vote has a 972 billion dollar plus up for defense and a five billion dollar cop for domestic so again the two are absolutely connected and what are we talking about with domestic spending I won't go through all of it I just mentioned a couple of things yesterday I mentioned our infrastructure the bridges are collapsing all across the country I saw a big story yesterday about how the more Memorial Bridge is about to fall down we have incredible infrastructure needs that lead to the strength of our country that are connected just like national defenses to the strength of this nation but another example the Fred hutch Cancer Research Center is close to my district it's in Seattle is doing incredible research right now that figured out how to not use chemotherapy but actually go in take out the white blood cells that aren't working get them to work send them back in and to successfully fight cancer this is worked for blood cancers they've just started Studies on lung cancer that basically we could cure cancer without going through the hell of chemo the president's budget would cut Fred hutches funding by over two-thirds so I don't think curing cancer is a political agenda that is a very real deed that has an incredible impact on the lives of Americans just like national security just like making sure that North Korea doesn't hit us with a nuclear weapon making sure that terrorist groups don't cus curing cancer stopping bridges from collapsing these are priorities and because we're not making budget choices these are priorities to get pushed aside and if you plus up the fence and take it from non-defense discretionary that you are having that very real impact I'm not going to say it has to be dollar for dollar I think it probably should be but we can negotiate around that but to simply gut the non-defense discretionary budget the plus up defense does not make this country safer and we heard yesterday in a time of war you make domestic sacrifices and we've all read about World War two all the domestic sacrifices that were made at that time I get that but you know what else you do in a time of war when you don't cut taxes you raised them thousand and one we had never gone to war without raising taxes or issuing war bonds are basically asking for a money but that of course we cannot do and again I will say I care enough about the national security of this country I would raise taxes to pay for it instead of simply adding to the deficit are stopping the ability of somebody like the Fred hutch Cancer Research Center from finding a cure for cancer that's the choice that I would make these choices are not being made in this budget resolution

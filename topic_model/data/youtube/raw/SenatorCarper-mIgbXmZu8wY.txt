as I rise this afternoon to speak regarding the nomination of William burr the servers the next Attorney General of our country first I want to take a few minutes to reflect on the circumstances we're surrounding this vacancy I believe that every member of this chamber should use this occasion to decide ultimately whether we believe mr. Barr will be the Attorney General for all Americans or whether mr. Barr will be the Attorney General really for one American when president elect Trump selected then Senator Jeff Sessions our colleague from Alabama to serve as Attorney General for this country it brought me no joy to vote against our longtime colleague in and friend the truth was though that his views my views were too often diverged on many important issues they included immigration health care Civil Rights voting rights LGBT rights environmental protection and more after considerable prayer and reflection I reached the conclusion that Senator sessions would not be an attorney general for for all Americans unfortunately during his tenure at the Department of Justice he went on to preside over a number of divisive policies and decisions including the Muslim ban overturning protections for dreamers and asylum seekers enacting a cruel policy of family separation at our southern border and failing to defend the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in court mr. president I have not been shy about expressing my disagreement with these decisions and others made by the Department of Justice during the current administration however one area where I strongly agree with attorney general sessions was his decision to recuse himself from the special counsels investigation into Russian interference in our 2016 elections mr. president one of my core values is to figure out what's the right thing to do and try to do it not what's up Lee I played Experion not what's easy but what is the right thing to do and after it became clear that then senator sessions provided testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee that called into question his impartiality on matters relating to Russia and a 2016 election attorney General Sessions recused himself from all matters related to the 2016 presidential election that was the right thing to do and it certainly wasn't what our president wanted him to do the president has said as much repeatedly I should say maybe he's tweeted as much repeatedly and the president repeatedly admonished attorney general sessions for doing what I think many of us believe was the right thing to do and here's what the president were country tweeted on June 5th last year 2018 and I quote the Russian witch-hunt hoax continues all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself I would have quickly picked someone else so much time and money wasted so many lives ruined in sessions knew better than most that there was no collusion in the quote mr. president let me be clear Special Counsel Robert Muller's investigation is not a witch-hunt it is in fact the unanimous opinion of the u.s. intelligence agencies and law enforcement community that Russia attacked our democracy and interfered in our 2016 elections as a result of the special counsels ongoing investigation 34 individuals and 3 companies have been indicted or pled guilty to a range of crimes this includes the Trump campaign manager the Trump deputy campaign manager mr. Trump's national security adviser and most recently president Trump's longtime political vizor special counsel muller a lifelong republican a lifelong republican who served with distinction and if yet nah war a war that i think i'm the last member of this body that served in the Vietnam War but he served there with real distinction he served with distinction as our FBI director following the nine September 11th attacks he's not conducting a partisan witch hunt he and the team he lead are striving to find out the truth and in doing so help us prevent future attacks on our democracy I believe we should be doing everything in our power to allow special counsel Muller and his team to conduct and complete this investigation free from political interference and partisan games during the years I was privileged to serve as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee a bob mother was the head of the FBI I had a chance to work with him that you know him my wife and I know his wife he's among the finest people I have ever known in the military outside of the military in government service outside of government service unfortunately President Trump does not view political independence as a prerequisite for the job of attorney general instead he tends to view political independence as a disloyal act an offense for which one should be not hired but fired just ask former acting Attorney General Sally Yates just ask former FBI director Comey from I also came to know well during the time I served on Homeland Security Committee and including as its chairman just ask former attorney general sessions recalled me with me if you will that after the November election President Trump fired Attorney General Sessions and named the Attorney General's chief of staff Matt Whittaker as acting Attorney General this was a curious decision as well as a legally questionable decision why would the president go outside the line of succession at the Department of Justice I fear it's because of mr. Whittaker's public comments regarding the Muller investigation mr. Parker previously likened the special counsels investigation to a fishing expedition to a witch-hunt and implied that following the truth so this is a quote from him could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family and by extension to the country to our country really could he have been serious in saying that getting to the bottom of all this could be damaging to the President of the United States his family and by extension to our country another president a long time ago Thomas Jefferson used to say these words if the people know the truth they won't make a mistake Thomas Jefferson the people know the truth they won't make a mistake hardly the views of our current president and sorrows me too saddens me to say that well despite publicly expressing these Jews that they're clearly call into question his impartiality mr. Whittaker did not recuse himself from the Lawlor investigation when he assumed the role of acting Attorney General even though he received a recommendation to recuse himself from ethics officials at the Department of Justice mr. Whittaker's staggering unfitness for the job is a big part of the reason why my initial reaction was positive when President Trump nominated William Barr to be our Attorney General after all mr. Barr previously served as Deputy Attorney General and then as Attorney General during the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush someone I revere I think that many of us revere by all accounts mr. Barr is a well-qualified nominee someone who's been a fine public servant throughout many years of public service I strongly believe that we need senator from leadership of the Department of Justice and I want to make it clear that during normal times I might be inclined to support mr. bars nomination in fact they probably would these are not normal times these are extraordinary times in addition to firing the Attorney General and the FBI director for their views on the Russian inquiry president Trump has reportedly asked those around him why he didn't have an attorney general who was looking out for his personal interests according to reports the president has said and I quote where's my Roy Cohn during moments of crisis and for those who may not know Roy Cohn was president Trump's personal lawyer and fixer who pushed legal tactics to the limit and also once served as staffer to Senator Joe McCarthy during a very dark period in our nation's history very dark period in this Senate history this is how President Trump views the role of Attorney General not as a lawyer to defend the right and the rights of all Americans but as a fixer who will look out for him more ever in a State of the Union address last week President Trump highlighted what he sees and I quote again ridiculous partisan investigations in quote he went on to say and I quote if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation close quote it against this extraordinary backdrop that we must ask ourselves water mr. Bars views our presidential powers what are his views on though the investigation led by robert muller as it turns out we don't have to guess what the answer is to that question an unsolicited 19 page memo that mr. Barr sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in president Trump's personal lawyers mr. Barr shares his views and they're clearly hostile to the special counsels investigation in a memo entitled Mahler's obstruction theory mr. Barr raises doubt about the special counsels ability to follow the truth while going on to defend president Trump's actions and even suggesting that the president has the power to limit the scope of this inquiry in that same memo mr. Barr states that the special counsels investigation into obstruction of justice may do and I quote again lasting damage to the presidency mr. president I believe that reasonable people can disagree as I freaked Lee did with my friend former senator then Attorney General Jeff Sessions it's clear to me however that despite whatever your views may be toward the special counsels investigation the views expressed in his memo not only warrant mr. bards recusal from the special counsels investigation they cry out for it attorney General Sessions did the right thing when confronted with a similar decision however despite expressing these biased views for president Trump's own personal lawyers mr. Barr says he will not recuse himself from the special counsels investigation if he is confirmed and to make matters worse mr. Barr refuses to commit to making the special counsels final report public mr. president earlier I asked for us to consider whether mr. Barr will be the Attorney General for all Americans or whether mr. Barr will be the Attorney General for one American that one American happened to all go also go by another name individual one legal moniker given to President Trump in the Southern District of New York for directing his personal attorney to violate federal campaign finance law like mr. Whittaker's public comments prior to his elevation to acting Attorney General I fear I fear the mr. bars memo may have been an audition for the job and that his selection may not be a coincidence during a Senate hearing in 1989 mr. Barr plainly stated that the Attorney General is this is a quote the president's lawyer close quote colleagues these are extraordinary times for our nation we must make it clear to the American people that the Attorney General is not the president's lawyer we need independence at the Department of Justice now more than ever and while I hope I'm wrong I hope I'm very wrong is my belief that president Trump views this appointment as an opportunity to protect himself rather than the constitutional rights of all Americans ultimately for all of these reasons I've laid out I've concluded that mr. Barr despite his earlier service distinguished service in many instances to our nation does not in this instance meet the standard that's necessary to be Attorney General for our country now and sadly on that note mr. president I will yield the floor thank you

afghanistan president biden is getting ready to address the nation and indeed the world very soon from the white house right now we're joined by republican congressman adam kinzinger of illinois he's a key member of the foreign affairs committee he's a u.s air force veteran who served in both afghanistan and iraq congressman thanks so much for joining us let me get your reaction first to the the news that the u.s successfully targeted and killed bin laden's successor ayman al-zawahiri well this is huge it's a a moral victory of course uh zawahiri has been a target of the united states for decades it is an actual victory in terms of making america safer he was the leader of al-qaeda as we know since osama bin laden and while al-qaeda has been a little quieter lately they certainly have not given up on their goals of attacking us this is a big win i congratulate the president for making the call and for the intel military communities for executing this i know some of the details i can't say and it was seemingly fairly complicated but yeah good work to everybody you had heard about this over the weekend is that right i had yeah i had a source that informed you this a number of hours ago and i was impressed it stayed quiet yeah it's a it's amazing how a major development like that does remain quiet as i pointed out congressman you served in afghanistan what are the challenges of conducting a strike like this and we're told it was a drone strike uh after uh the us withdrawal from afghanistan nearly a year or so ago yeah i mean the challenge is massive so first off i think there's a lot of questions uh maybe the uh the military knows more about this but uh did the taliban know that he was there uh that could lend you know further koreans to taliban and al-qaeda cooperation um but it's very difficult when you have troops and intel assets in place obviously they have their sources you can get very real-time information when you don't have that and we've certainly been hamstrung in our ability to be able to target these kinds of targets then it makes it a lot more difficult you don't get as much real-time information how do you confirm something if somebody tells you this person's here how do you confirm that's them obviously we can still do that in some cases and today is a great day to celebrate that but i also think it's a moment to to really keep in mind somebody will replace alzheimeri and how are we going to take them out eventually as well well how does the u.s go about collecting intelligence on an al-qaeda leader like ayman al-zawahiri without boots on the ground whether in afghanistan or pakistan for that matter how do you think the u.s was able to carry out this mission well i mean it could be any number of things um and i don't know the answer to what happened here but uh what we do know we have the ability to do obviously there's you know sources that can give us information there's electronic means i i would tend to think that he was fairly safe on the electronic side as osama bin laden was but he also may have been feeling a little arrogant because we were out of afghanistan and particularly if the taliban gave him safe harbor he probably had no reason to suspect he was a target um and even if they didn't he probably still felt a little safer so there's any number of things the intel community can do to find something out and then obviously when you don't have people on the ground the difficulty is we may have some pretty good cameras and stuff but you can't necessarily tell who somebody is from the sky and so you have to have other ways to confirm that how much you believe this strike actually degrades al qaeda right now congressman because the big question is what sort of threat they pose right now beyond the borders of their safe haven let's say in afghanistan well i think it's it certainly is degrading in the short term so if you imagine kind of a fighter on the ropes this was a massive blow and and knocked that fighter down that's what happens when you lose your spiritual leader we know that's what happened when osama bin laden died we a we got a lot of intel from that but it also was a gut punch to al qaeda but that doesn't mean they're done there will be somebody to come and replace him he may have already had a successor he was grooming and uh their desire to kill us simply because of who we are has not changed and look let's just be honest when we left afghanistan that did embolden them to believe that the united states could be beaten we can't be beaten on the battlefield our will can be beaten it was beaten in afghanistan but that said today's a day to celebrate uh this moral and actual physical victory against al qaeda does this strike congressman show that the united states isn't taking its eyes off the threat from al qaeda isis and other terror groups in the region yeah i think so i mean even though our capacity is significantly degraded with whatever we have the ability to do and i don't know all those details i think they're still an enemy of the united states we'll still go after them again we're not going to be able to do these operations as intensely as we were and we need to keep that in mind when we talk about the us future and and partnerships with iraq for instance when we talk about what iran is doing and we talk about al qaeda isis in iraq which still exists we can keep these actions up here there around the world but it is important to recognize that as great as technology is technology cannot replace people on the ground that know things that tell us things and that's why it's important to both have those assets on the ground but also to be able to follow through on our word so when people tell us stuff they know that we're not going to abandon them i assume congressman the u.s should be bracing now potentially for some sort of retaliation or revenge from al qaeda yeah it's possible i mean you know al qaeda does not have the reach at the moment that they had of course on 9 11. this is why us staying on the offense against al qaeda so when you hear you know some of these senators that say bring all the boys home people like rand paul or josh hawley that just wants to basically give up on the entire world the reason that we've been safe is not because al qaeda's changed their mind it's because we fought them where they exist and so if they have the capacity to strike back they they would not certainly in the united states if they could but they probably have more capability to strike back on our forces or allied forces in those regions this is why it is important as much as we may get tired of talking about the war or we may come up with tripe words like endless wars it's important for us to stay on offense because we're going to find a day where if we let our guard down they will be back here in the united states their will and their desire and their beliefs have not changed good point congressman adam kinzinger thanks so much for joining us and thanks once again for your service to our country we're gonna have much more

Hunger isn’t a Republican problem or a Democratic problem. It’s a real problem facing thousands of Hoosiers. Many of those are children and seniors. I’m Jackie Walorski. No one should go to bed hungry. Ever. That’s why I reached across the aisle to make it easier to help those who are struggling have enough to eat. Bringing people together is the best way to solve our problems and move our country forward. I’m Jackie Walorski, and I approve this message.

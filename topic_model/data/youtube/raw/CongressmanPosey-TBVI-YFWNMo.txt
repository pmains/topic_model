now I will recognize mr. Posey for five minutes for his legislation thank you very much chairman and members of China task force for the opportunity to discuss two issues as significance to Florida to my district to all of your districts and of course to our national security of the protection of our space launch industry in the life-saving pharmaceuticals I urge the task force to consider supporting HR 67 83 the American space Commerce Act and HR 59 82 the safe medicine Act these are bipartisan bills that I introduced with Democrat co-leads the American space Commerce Act extends existing space launch incentives for additional 10 years for companies that launch their payloads from American soil the state medicine Act will help us end our dependence on pharmaceuticals coming from China which is you know places a lower value on safety and has a record of sending contaminated drugs to America from protecting our space launch industry to keeping contaminated pharmaceuticals out of our country the common threat is China China and other countries have taken notice of us market growth in the commercial space arena and are funding their own launch vehicle development providing direct subsidies to their companies which compete with and take market share away from American commercial space launch companies this is not only an unfair trade practice but a direct threat to our national security the 2019 report to Congress of the us-china economic security review Commission's they said China is taking steps to establish a commanding position in the commercial space launch and satellite sectors relying in part on aggressive state-backed financing that foreign market driven companies cannot match the report further states China has already succeeded in undercutting the United States and other foreign launch and satellite providers in the international market threatening to hollow out these countries space industrial bases the best interest of our national security is to stop that foreign launch providers are heavily subsidized by their governments and use those subsidies to undercut American competitors materially harming these new American companies and our American industrial base another national security interest of the United States is protecting contaminated pharmaceuticals coming from China 80% of the drugs that Americans depend upon come from overseas countries including China whose pharmaceuticals have been subject to numerous recalls is the largest provider of drugs and drug ingredients as a result our complete dependence on China we have not produced basic medicine like penicillin in the United States since 2004 in 2008 a Chinese based pharmaceutical company pumped counterfeit blood clot medication into our domestic markets to turn a quick buck the result eighty-one Americans died seven hundred and eighty-five more were severely injured and yet because officials were afraid to of creating a shortage they allowed the Chinese made heparin to continue to enter the country without inspecting it crises like these keep on happening when the US Food and Drug Administration testified before Congress in the 2008 contamination crisis they insisted that we must also remember that this is an essential drug and we can't simply stop the heparin supply why couldn't we because we are totally dependent on China for heparin contamination or not as a member representing a large population of senior citizens I can assure you that this is a critical and and in an address and an issue we must address to the United States which would have to do is embargo to  the United States all China would have to do is embargo the drug here China did something dissimilar in Japan in 2010 of rebutting instant understand in 2018 the problem has only gotten worse in 2018 it was discovered that millions of Americans have been taking blood medication tainted with cancer-causing ingredients from China according to the FDA carcinogens may have been used in these foreign generics for as many as four years before being discovered please consider taking an active role in helping us advance these bipartisan bills HR 67 83 the American space Commerce Act and 5980 to the save Medicine Act the American space Commerce Act will help our domestic launch industry and keep the united states a leader in space this safe medicine Act will help save American lives and end our dependence on contaminated pharmaceuticals coming from China thank you very much for your consideration I look forward to working with the China task force of my colleagues to address these issues that are so important to the American people and and be happy to answer any questions you might have thank you for being here sir and and on reverence to sixty seven eighty three of the Space Commerce Act based on your travels in your experience what was the motivation for tax incentives for actually space launches on the United States soil wow thanks for asking that you know up until the 80s the United States had a lock on virtually a hundred percent of the world's commercial markets our launches commercial rocket launch market but we took the golden goose we over regulated it we had contracts with commercial providers that made it you know very onerous to do business the United States the French area in rocket original one was basically a carbon copy of our Thor Delta and they blew up at least every third one but it was still cheaper to launch with the French than it was to go to the United States so we started loose of business to them and and in over the next couple of decades we parlayed that 100% basically of the world's commercial launch market into about 15 percent for American companies the other countries subsidize their launch companies we don't I mean if you're if you're a foreign customer launching a satellite from Kennedy Space Center and you're lucky enough to get approved within 60 days to watch the launch you're paying 60 million dollars to put up a satellite for you then you do it in a musty old block house you know dusty standing up probably watching the launch maybe a can of Diet Coke I don't know you know when I went to French Guiana and installed the European Space Agency they have you know all Art Deco glass-enclosed launch control center surrounded by a semicircle of those big lazy boy recliner you know probably a hundred of them that they that they Wine and Dine the customers treat them like kings and of course their government you know cooperates fully with them so you know we have the advantage technologically we have the institutional knowledge and the experience to be first in space we just haven't had the support of our government and we never will have the support that the other governments are getting it but we we at least should go forward with giving some tax incentives if they launch from our soil and thank you very much Thank You congressman sorry Andy Thank You mr. chairman just real quick question represented posey thank you for your leadership on this and that especially on the American space Commerce Act very interested in that and I want a co-sponsor I really appreciate your leadership on that I represent a company called space tango they do EXO medicine they provide zero they space on the International Space Station for zero-gravity medical experiments and I just wanted to know you know how would this maybe facilitate more of that science in in zero-gravity environment well there it would definitely help bring costs down to them you know those are those are add-on costs the taxes obviously that the customer ultimately has to pay and it does hurt things so you know most people don't know at the International Space Station we have real real zero gravity that we can't duplicate here even with the centrifugal we can't duplicate it here but in the true real zero-gravity environment of our International Space Station you know they can make pharmaceuticals they can do drug tests that that are 100% perfect you know we when you when you do the molecules and and and put the stuff together here on on earth there there's a percentage of loss from 100% quality that you get you don't get a hundred percent quality throughout because there's deviations due to gravity gravitational forces that you know some of which we don't understand but the International Space Station let the crystals you know 100 percent perfect and they get your mutations expedited much quicker up there so they're faster and the technology advances faster and we learn more and we come up with new products and and but it you know it it's been a godsend and unfortunately most of of the United States just doesn't know much about it because it's not a big buzzword in the news all the time but fortunately there's you know people in Congress that appreciate it appreciate your leader now mr Joyce representative Posey thank you thank you for being here with us today and bringing forth HR 59 82 the safe medicine act the China task force in the technology pillar I have been studying and are keenly aware of the over reliance on China and the Communist Chinese government and what they have done specifically as you had mentioned and cornering the market on penicillin ampicillin amoxicillin the vulnerability cannot continue and your legislation is incredibly important and addresses this issue and I too want to look to co-sponsor this with you as well thank you for bringing it forward to us today thanks so much

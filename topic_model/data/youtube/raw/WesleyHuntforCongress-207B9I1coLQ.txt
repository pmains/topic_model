ending spree unveiling his six trillion dollar budget the largest increase in federal spending since world war ii and one controversial item in biden's proposal is more than 800 million dollars to address the root causes of migration from central america rather than actually focusing on the border itself here to react is u.s army veteran and former texas gop congressional candidate wesley hunt wesley good morning thanks so much for being here so react in any which way you would like but certainly this budget is a reflection of priorities you know that number is absolutely staggering to think that we're spending this much money uh since world war ii let's think about this i mean i'm a proud american and this is the greatest country in the world and we're a back-to-back world war champions and i'm proud of that fact but the notion that we are going to spend that much money particularly when we are not at a time of war is utterly preposterous this is a clear money grab by the left and a clear push towards socialism and right now joe biden wants us to rely more on the government than to rely on ourselves and that's not what our constitution wants us to do and what i what i see here moving forward particularly what we asked our nation to do not go to work think about the the small businesses that were lost the children that were that were not in school and just as we are entering a time of recovery you want to burden us with more taxes more spending in a state of hyperinflation look at the cost of gas look at the cost of corn and other commodities right now we need to be putting this money back into the hands of the taxpayer and the bleeding has got to stop pete yeah and the best way for us to do this is for us to take back the house here in 2022. i think you're right about that uh and we may you may have maybe possibly some information about that shortly too we'll see but i i gotta ask we just we just laid out that there are 24 states in middle america who are getting rid of the supplemental unemployment why would states not be removing it at this point if we are moving through covid and we want people back to work you would think i still think it's just this push towards socialism and and forcing the american public to rely more on the government than ourselves down here in texas we don't have that problem because if you incentivize somebody to not work well of course they're not going to do that and i think you talked about you know us just charging this to our credit card for the future and passing this burden on this is not what this country is about this country is about the working man providing goods and services for our nation and i think we need to continue that in those states that really want us to recover or the states are going to incentivize us to work get back to work and get back to school well we got to spend some time together a couple of weeks ago when we filmed uh the fox nation modern warriors uh special it's airing tomorrow night on the fox news channel it's already uh at fox nation as well it was it was an honor to spend time with you and three other amazing american patriots if you would give folks a little preview of what we talked about as far as modern warriors you know what i loved about that segment pete and i'm glad you do that for us every year what i loved about it is that you had four veterans that we had not met before but we could sit down as like i've known these guys for 20 years that's true and we get to talk about those that we've lost we get to talk about the sacrifices that were made for every american and one thing that i said during that piece was this is not about black america or white america or or you name it this is about people that died for all americans let's focus on that and i think that segment and allowing me to be a part of modern warriors it was really a sentiment as to who we are as a country and what i believe we can get back to amen it was really special to be here and wesley imagine how great it's going to sound once the editors make us actually sound smart too it's great it's remarkable that's right and hey by the way might folks get a special announcement from you if they're watching tomorrow night oh yes please watch tomorrow night i will be making a special announcement about the future and again this is about taking back the house here in 2022 it's something that's near and dear to my heart and it's about honoring those that serve this country and paid the ultimate sacrifice and it's incumbent upon us to continue to serve since they're no longer here to serve for themselves you got it wesley thanks so much great to see you and we'll see you tomorrow thank you brother good seeing you as well yes sir thank you

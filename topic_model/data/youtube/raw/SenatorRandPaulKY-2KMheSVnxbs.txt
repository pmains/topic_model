parents and students across the country are having a difficult time right now instead of back to school shopping we're watching the news and waiting for an update on when and how school will open this spring as covid 19 spread and schools shuttered their doors parents and students found themselves in uncharted territory students grappled with the difficulties of online learning and parents tried to balance work and providing for their families with also educating their children at home the way federal education dollars are managed hasn't helped matters the federal government takes tax dollars and sends them to states to be divided among public school districts while this has always produced questionable results it's now presenting an unworkable situation for far too many american families the good news is there's a better way that empowers and supports students and parents to make the decisions that best meet their individual needs this is why i've introduced a new bill called the school act my bill will take all that federal money under the elementary and secondary education act and give that money directly back to the children in the form of a voucher where those kids can then take that money coming from the federal government that normally goes to the school district they can take that money and take it to the school of their choice it would allow students and parents to choose among public schools private schools and home schools if a public school won't offer in-person instruction then let's fund the instruction wherever it is happening in person let's let people have a choice to go to a school that will actually be there to teach your kids these funds could be used on a range of educational needs including tuition curriculum technology tutoring support for special education i've long been a supporter of school choice and with challenges the challenges that are currently facing us facing us it's the right time to move away from the one-size-fits-all government monopoly over education

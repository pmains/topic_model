hello folks representative gosar here with another minnow monday today i want to focus on how basic mineral development can build domestic manufacturing supply chains tellurium an essential component of cadmium telluride is a semiconductor material that converts sunlight into electricity and is used to manufacture thin film photovoltaic solar panels unfortunately we rely on foreign nations like china for more than 50 percent of our supply of tellurium tellurium is as rare as platinum and equally as valuable thankfully a new tellurium smeltering facility is under construction in utah which will provide a new domestic supply of tellurium and will go directly to u.s companies making solar panels here in america american mining leading to american smeltering creating american manufacturing jobs that's the foundation of a domestic supply chain that will help us make america great and secure our mineral and manufacturing security for generations to come just another valuable scientific thought for this mineral monday

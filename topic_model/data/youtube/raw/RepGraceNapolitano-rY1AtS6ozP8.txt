a chair HR 1837 claims to restore the flow of water to be leaguer communities in the world's most productive and highly valued a great cultural region and I'm introducing into the record a copy of a California's agricultural production in gross cash income for the three drought years from 07 209 they went from 36 point six billion to 34 point I'm sorry from 32.8 to 34.8 in those three drought years the when cvpi a was enacted in 1992 bob vice vice president of the California Farm Bureau Federation said that the CVP bill will  farmers in the nation's most productive agricultural region without solving California's basic water problem farmers farm workers and consumers will suffer because growers will be forced to idle land lay off workers and produce less food and fiber this is 92 19 years later the Delta water exports have increased and agriculture revenues and production has increased as I pointed out it's increased by billions of dollars the environment and the fishing industry which by the way closed last three years has not fared as well eighteen eighty seven six to make sweeping and damaging changes to the CVP IA it extends water contracts for total period of 40 years in continuing perpetuity without completion of any environmental mitigation or consideration for climate change it removed here water pricing that encouraged water conservation and efficiency diminishes the funds for restoration totally eliminates the co-equal goal of protecting the environment and allowing for water deliveries it repeals the san joaquin restoration settlement act over two decades of litigation and legislation worked on by all and agreed on by all parties this would create legal and water rights uncertainty for all parties involved and I think mostly our legal beagles would be greatly enhancing this this bill also preempts state law and attempts to place the water demands some of California's most junior water rights holders ahead of all other California interests state rights are historic and fundamental principle of western water rights the ax surfing of states rights set a bad precedent and it will be a call to arms to all 49 other states and should not be taken lightly this legislation also severely limits ongoing environmental protection efforts and themes that requirements of the Endangered Species Act are met at levels defined in 1994 Bay Delta Accord we face a challenging ecosystem coupled with new scientific knowledge in the early 1990s home internet used through the dial-up service was also revolutionary technology has improved as the years have progressed deeming environmental protections adequate based on a once revolutionary but now scientifically out-of-date Bay Delta Court it's like asking Internet users to go back to the days of dial-up instead of using the available high-speed service the minority subcommittee members were afforded only one witness due to the severity of the possible state impacts from 1887 Secretary Larry filled our only slot there are other stakeholders who are also impacted and did not get a chance to voice their opinion today submitted into the records will be letters from the California State Legislature signed by Senate Pro Tem assembly chairs Speaker of the House chairs the Natural Resources water parks and wildlife in opposition and they quote 1837 undermines judicial agreements eros line standing water right principles usurps California sovereignty and lays waste to any hope of progress in the Delta letters through Dustin fishing industries in opposition there are no strong enough words to describe the complete devastation this bill would bring to the Central Valley Salman runs and those who depend on them for their livelihoods recreation and food source letter from the central dr. water agency and in opposition would transfer responsibility of complying with state river flowing quality protections above the bay-delta court to a non export project water right holder under the California law and our senior are senior to the exporters we must have a balanced approach in solving a California water problems using the best available science and integrating new technology and having everyone at the table 1837 mousses in reversed and prevents the state and all those involved with the Bay Delta conservation program from moving forward the Act has nothing to do with reliability and everything to do with uncertainty and it certainly does not create jobs Thank You mr. chair back

mr man of kansas you are now recognized mr chairman thank you and thank you for making this a priority for the committee mr chairman you know certainly in this down there a lot of areas that people are divided on but there seems to be bipartisan support for doing better when it comes to rural broadband and connectivity uh we all know that's a priority for everyone here it's certainly a big priority for me and in the big first district of kansas we cover a large swath of the rural part of my state and and you know we hear a lot of concerns a lot of time and and it's not just you know concerns about how it is but what it prevents us from doing be it telehealth be it taking the next steps in production agriculture all of those things so thanks for the panel um and our witnesses for being here today my question is for miss robinson it's my understanding that microsoft's air band initiative is working in kansas uh to connect rural underserved communities to broadband so i especially appreciate that work it's also great to see your experience addressing rural broadband in the public sector at the fcc and administering the universal service fund based on your variety of experience how do you think we can involve more private sector investment in our rural communities and and what limits more involvement in the private sector today as you see it thank you for your question and we are proud to work uh with nexlink as they expand broadband access to um consumers in the great state of kansas i think that the key to solving this problem is doing more with public and private partnerships um this is not something that we that any one sector or any one part of the country can tackle by itself and so being able to provide more um more certainty around business models in order that are required to actually uh that can incent private sector to actually do investments to show that this is something that the business model can pencil out in rural america will be key a part of being a part of that business model pizzling out will be making sure that there's actual funding in place to support and that can be that can be leveraged alongside private sector investments so those two things need to work together and it's certainly part of our formula as we approach these issues and trying to tackle the world digital divide okay wonderful thank you and my second question uh different vein is is for dr park um can you talk more about the performance and wave weather capabilities of an aerostat as we discussed the vital importance of broadband we have to consider that high winds lightning those sort natural disasters those sort of things are prevalent in kansas and other areas as well any perspective that you would have on how those have performed under those kind of conditions thank you for that question yes so aerostats can withstand high wind up to 80 miles per hour and if there is a major major uh storm aerostats can be lowered within hours so it can be pretty safe and while it's down also congressman error says can be deployed to overlap coverage uh you know and provide redundancy so in areas where storms are localized and the errors that lowered will have adjacent aerostat to provide the redundant coverage in its area okay okay that makes sense but no further questions uh mr chairman i yield back and thank you all very very much

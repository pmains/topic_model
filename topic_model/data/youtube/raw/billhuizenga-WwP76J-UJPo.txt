MR. HUIZENGA: THANK YOU, MADAM  CHAIR. I RISE TODAY TO SAY THANK YOU,  TO SAY THANK YOU TO A CHIEF OF  STAFF, A COLLEAGUE, A CONFIDENT, AND A SPECIAL FRIEND. JOHN DEWITT HAS BEEN MY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR 11 1/2 YEARS. IN FACT, WHEN I WAS ELECTED IN  2010, JOHN WAS THE FIRST CALL  THAT I MADE AND HE WAS MY FIRST  HIRE AND WE HAVE BEEN IN THIS  JOURNEY TOGETHER THE ENTIRE  TIME. JOHN HAS HAD A GREAT TRACK  RECORD HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AS WELL. HE WORKED FOR THE EDUCATION AND  WORKFORCE COMMITTEE. HE THEN WENT TO WORK ON -- TO GO ON TO WORK WITH CONGRESSMAN --  FORMER CONGRESSMAN DAVE CAMP. THEN, WHEN I LEFT THE POSITION  OF DISTRICT DIRECTOR FOR MY  PREDECESSOR, JOHN CAME AND  FILLED THAT ROLE, FILLED THAT  POSITION FOR EIGHT YEARS UNTIL I GOT ELECTED WHEN I ASKED HIM TO  COME BACK TO WASHINGTON AND ACT  AS MY CHIEF OF STAFF. WELL, JOHN, TWO REDISTRICTINGS,  MAJORITY, MINORITY, GOVERNMENT  SHUTDOWN, IMPEACHMENTS, WAR,  PEACE, WE'VE SEEN JUST ABOUT ALL OF IT AND HAVE LIVED THAT  TEXTBOOK OF POLITICAL SCIENCE. BUT I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT  WITHOUT YOU. AND I KNOW YOU COULD NOT HAVE  DONE THIS WITHOUT YOUR FAMILY. AND I WANT TO SAY A SPECIAL  THANK YOU AS WELL TO JODY,  NATHAN, KATIE, AND JOSH FOR THE  SACRIFICES THAT THEY MADE, THE  SACRIFICES THAT YOU HAVE MADE,  FOR LATE NIGHTS AND EARLY  MORNINGS, FOR TRAVEL, FOR ALL  THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT GO  INTO BEING AN EXCELLENT CHIEF OF STAFF, YOU HAVE BEEN ONE, MY  FRIEND. NOW, I KNOW THAT THERE'S GREAT  PATHS AHEAD FOR YOU AND GREAT  PATHS AHEAD FOR ALL OF YOU. BUT I DO KNOW THAT OUR  FRIENDSHIP WILL NOT END. TEAM HUIZENGA IS ALWAYS TEAM  HUIZENGA AND YOU ARE A VITAL  PART OF THAT. ONCE AGAIN, JOHN, THANK YOU FOR  YOUR SERVICE, NOT ONLY TO ME,  BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE  CONSTITUENTS OF THE SECOND  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT BACK IN  MICHIGAN AND SERVICE TO YOUR  COUNTRY. A J

well south carolina congresswoman nancy mace has been a very outspoken critic of governor andrew cuomo she joins us now congresswoman thanks for being back with us hi sean you know you you've not just been a critic of uh of governor cuomo but you have been somebody who's dealt with this issue personally and i want to read you something that the governor tweeted in 2013 he said there should be a zero tolerance policy when it comes to sexual harassment and must send a clear message that this behavior is not tolerated i mean the governor's not backing down despite these growing calls from the resign the new york attorney general said that the investigation was similar nature and that there wouldn't be any criminal actions but legal experts cautioned that the standard for criminal prosecution is much higher and that's why they're not doing this but you know i i just got to figure that this is i mean over and over again he keeps making excuses as to why he did this right and it's really it's disgusting to see this happening at the highest levels of government um to see these 11 women have the courage and i mean extreme amount of courage to come out and tell their stories and if there are 11 today i have to think there are there are more women out there who are who are afraid and i read the stories today about this uh facebook executive used to be on his communication staff and being part of this smear campaign this is why women do not come forward and to hear the attorney general's office call the sexual harassment well the last time i checked when someone put their hand up your shirt and fills you up that's not harassment that's assault and why there are criminal charges being brought is astounding to me very few women ever get to have recourse when they are assaulted or harassed and he's got everyone from the from every democrat in new york asking him to resign and now the president of the united states suggesting he should resign he should step down yeah yeah congresswoman throughout the pandemic we saw the media refer to governor cuomo as the gold standard for governors and they made him pretty much a media darling one of governor cuomo's accuser charlotte bennett that we heard from earlier said that the media's constant praise emboldened him do you agree well i'm not one of the alleged victims so i can't speak for that but i would say you can see in his media interviews and his his tit-for-tat the the funny interviews or whatever ridiculous interviews he did with his brother on cnn he did feel emboldened i mean he put uh senior citizens in nursing homes that were spreading covet in these fatal facilities he made money off that millions of dollars he'd made money off of by writing a book about the pandemic and to see this culture of fear and retaliation and sexual harassment possible assault in his own office it's abhorrent and he gets away with it because he's a governor and not only is this a poor definition of leadership but he has definitely poor morals as just a normal human being you know you heard a series of excuses come from him right he essentially downplayed these unwanted advances by saying hey look i kiss everyone here's a video montage of me kissing men and women people of different colors and ethnicities short people tall people and oh by the way you know if there's a cultural thing i i think it's you know because i'm italian that's what we do i i feel like this really damages the the rhetoric of sexual harassment victims because he's trying to explain that well it's not that way if you're if you're just being friendly or if you've got a particular cultural background that that lends itself to this now that yeah the excuse is really also you know it lends this culture of sexual harassment not only in an office place it's inappropriate and also in some ways it re-victimizes the victim by making up all these excuses for anyone who's going to be a leader in this country we people make mistakes so own it take responsibility for it do the right thing and step down i demanded that governor cuomo step down a hundred and fifty days ago the least he could have done a step down to the investigation had concluded the investigation has concluded there are 11 women that have detailed um these events and within his office the culture fear the retaliation we now know that is happening and was coordinated against some of these women um he ought to do the right thing and i hope that the state of new york and that other democratic leaders i know republicans are are also stepping up to the plate and demanding his resignation yeah we'll see what happens there i do want to switch gears with you but stay in the city of or the state of new york and talk about the city of new york we had mayor bill de blasio defending becoming the first in the nation to mandate proof of vaccination by saying it's an easy thing to do for restaurants there listen to this there's always that point where you come into a place and people engage you that's the point where you simply have to show your vaccination card or one of the apps that show that you've been vaccinated it's really quite positive and straightforward it's really easy okay at the same time we have the democratic mayor of boston equating requiring vaccine proof to slave papers all right once again a big divide here for the democratic party but it seems like oftentimes we hear democrats saying this is being perpetuated by republicans yet you have a democratic mayor standing up against it do you think that the media is fueling this false narrative the media does feel fear and they're they're dealing with fear rather than facts we saw last week nancy pelosi uh directing the capitol hill police to arrest any visitors on the hill or staff to be arrested for not wearing a mask and then you saw on twitter with the blue check marks mainstream media saying well maybe we should arrest people who aren't vaccinated showing your vaccine papers is not something anyone should support in this country there has to be a balance between protecting our freedom and our liberty and our public health there are many places around the country who've been able to find that careful balance and and not demand vaccine passports and i i quite frankly i think we should be looking into the constitutionality of it because it sounds very unconstitutional to have to show vaccine papers to do normal everyday uh activities like where does this end are you gonna get are you gonna get carded every time you go to the grocery store or take a walk down the street like i don't know where this ends yeah what about a flu shot and by the way since kids under 12 can't get vaccinated can a family go out there's a lot of things that just don't make sense about this congresswoman nancy mays thank you for speaking out against governor cuomo making your voice part of this dialogue and thanks for coming back on the show thank you as always

seeing us now to discuss these latest developments Democratic congresswoman Karen bass of California she sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee congresswoman thank you for spending part of your weekend with us on this new North Korea reporting the president tweeted this North Korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site this is very good news for North Korea and the world big progress look forward to our summit this does seem to be a pretty big announcement coming out of the Korean Peninsula what is your reaction to this development well a couple of things my initial reaction is with caution in a way the announcement sounds a little ominous as your reporter just described they say they don't need to test anymore so I guess that means that they're ready to fire but the fact that there might be discussions between our two countries I mean I think it's very interesting one of the concerns I have though is the consist whether or not either side will be consistent we know that President Trump is very inconsistent and we also know that Kim jong-un is very inconsistent so whether or not both sides even make it to a summit will be one issue but I do think that the point that you raised a minute ago is that there has been no discussion on Kim jong-un's part about getting rid of nuclear weapons all he is saying is is that we've test it it's almost like we're ready to go we don't need to test anymore so let's have a summit well this comes also days after President Trump about to walk out of this summit meeting with Kim Jong hoon potentially or not even a 10-1 if he didn't believe the talks would be fruitful let's listen to what the president said exactly sure if I think that it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful we're not going to go if the meeting when I'm there is not fruitful I will respectfully leave the meeting and we'll continue what we're doing or whatever it is that will continue but something will happen what do you think of the president's strategy and what he's saying leading up to these talks well my biggest concern is I'm not sure he has a strategy at all I mean he starts by completely humiliating the guy calling him you know names and then humiliating his Secretary of State and saying that there's no cause for us to have negotiations now to say he's suddenly going to have a summit that's why I said that there's no real we don't have any real proof that there will be consistency on his part can I mention one thing though is that the korean-american community is looking at this you know Los Angeles has one of the largest Korean American populations outside of Korea and part of the community is very excited about the idea that there might be a summit and one of the things that they are hoping that the u.s. offers is family unification so that Koreans that live here would be able to travel to see their relatives in North Korea many of whom don't have many years left and so they're pushing very hard that the United States used that as a you know as a token of goodwill to allow family unification to take place you talked about this optimism of a meeting period happening because it's been so many years where people weren't talking to each other Democrats have though criticized this president for some of his rhetoric on North Korea here's just a quick reminder exactly best not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen Rocketman is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime if the sanctions don't work we'll have to go phase two and phase two may be a very rough thing it may be very very unfortunate for the World Congress i'ma given we are where we are today could some of that tough talk have actually worked well that's the point of who knows you know again Kim Jong moon has not said he's getting rid of no glutton nuclear weapons he just says he's done testing so how do you go from Rocket Man to saying let's have a summit then when you say you're going to have a summit say well if it's not going the way I like I'm gonna get up and walk away and I might not even have it so that that's why I said a couple of minutes ago that don't believe that the president has a strategy you do remember when he decided to have the summit he did it on a whim no one knew he was going to make that decision he walked into some people talking in the White House and said yeah I think I'll do a summit just a few weeks before he had completely ridiculed his own Secretary of State at the idea that he would even think about having negotiations with North Korea so who knows what this president will do leading up to the summit that doesn't even have a date since you're from California also want to switch topics for a moment ask you a little bit about what the president said this week as it pertains to immigration and some comments from the President on sanctuary cities here's what he tweeted there is a revolution going on in California so many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous crime-infested and breeding concept what do you think the president is getting out there well I think the president has been very consistent with racist comments and I think that is a perfect example of one but it's interesting because he tends to throw out bombs like that especially bombs regarding race when things aren't going so well so all the controversy over the Comey memos the Comey book the interviews and now all of a sudden he goes back to what he feels appeals to his base animals breed humans do not that is a racist dog whistle term when he uses terms like that and talks about crime connecting it with a community of color like in the immigrant community that he's talking about he is doing that to me to gin up racism in the country and I think it's so sad but he's very consistent about doing this tomorrow it'll probably be the NFL again today it's immigration congresswoman Karen bass thank you very much for joining us

we begin I'd like to have a moment of silence and memory of those who lost their lives in the attacks in Paris and in honor those who were wounded today we must make this much clearer we are at war the world was reminded last week that Islamist terrorists are seeking to harm our people destroy our way of life and undermine the foundational principles of the free world the Paris attacks also confirmed our worst fears that of the thousands of foreign fighters who have gone to Syria and Iraq to join Isis some would be deployed to bring terror back to the west for more than a year my committee is worn to this growing threat we launched a bipartisan congressional task force to focus on clothes closing security gaps both at home and abroad to make it harder for terrorists and foreign fighters to slip across the border undetected more than 5,000 individuals with Western passports including Americans have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq and some have already returned battle-hardened and prepared to strike after the Charlie Hebdo attacks we traveled to Paris and met with the counterterrorism officials on the ground who have known that Europe was wide open to this danger and we conducted site visits along the jihadi superhighway from Western Europe to Turkey and then into the conflict zone our findings were alarming the September the committee's final task force report concluded that we are losing the struggle to stop Americans from going overseas to join jihadist groups and it announced that the gaping security weaknesses overseas are putting the u.s. homeland and our allies in danger these worries have materialized we know that jihadist exploited these gaps to plot and execute the worst terrorist attack on French soil since World War two the world is now looking to America for leadership and for a clear-eyed understanding of the threat Isis is not contained as the president says Isis is expanding globally and is plotting aggressively in a matter of weeks it executed major external terrorist plots on three continents destroying a Russian airliner conducting suicide bombings in Lebanon and launching a massive tax on the streets in Paris Isis is now responsible for more than 60 terrorist plots against Western targets including 18 in the United States here at home we've arrested more than 70 Isis supporters over the last year that's on average more than one per week and the FBI says that it has nearly 1,000 Isis related investigations in all 50 states if this is not a war then I don't know what is America cannot wait for terrorists to launch their next attack the security of the free world depends on our response and we must respond immediately we can start by securing the homeland our task force report will not sit on the shelf we are taking action to turn our recommendations into reality soon we will release legislation designed to help close security loopholes and keep terrorists from reaching our shores we will also work to make our sure terrace do not infiltrate refugee flows to sneak into our country as some apparently did to reach France today we released a report laying out the preliminary findings of a nearly year-long investigation into counterterrorism challenges associated with Syrian refugee flows the results of this review are sobering while we are proud of our humanitarian tradition of welcoming refugees and our country this is a special case the president's own intelligence and law enforcement officials have warned this committee of the risk involved with a Syrian refugee program in the high-threat environment and I have to take them at their word I've called upon the president to temporarily suspend Syrian refugee admissions into the United States until we can improve the screening and vetting process but we cannot wait for the present to take action Congress will act immediately to make sure the system is more secure Americans are worried about the terror threat level and my promise to the American people is that we are working hard to strengthen this country's defenses and my promise to our allies is that we stand ready to help you to do the same but as we will discuss today the rise of radicalism cannot be reversed without confronting the problem at its source terrorist sanctuaries for jihadist recruit train and plot against us in Syria we are witnessing the largest global convergence of jihadist in world history yet the president's plan is to contain rather than roll back the threat and what we have seen as a policy of containment leads to a constant stream of terror we need a strategy for victory in the war against Islamist terror and that strategy must begin in Syria our enemies have said the latest attack is just the beginning of a storm and our message back to them must be clear you have fired the first shot in this struggle but rest assured America will fire the last I want to thank our witnesses for joining us here today each of you worked in different ways on our front lines in this long struggle look forward to your insights with that the chair now recognizes the chairman

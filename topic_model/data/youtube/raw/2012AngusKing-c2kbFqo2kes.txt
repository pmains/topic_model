the first thing I want to do is thank you because if you're seeing this video chances are you're already engaged in this campaign and I want to thank you for all you're doing across the state letters to the editor contributions working with our volunteers going to the fairs talking to your neighbors all that is critically important Maine is still a big small town and person to person is the way it works but part of it is going to be communication in the fall over the airwaves television we've pretty much raised all the money we need to do the campaign between now and November except for airtime and of course that's a big accept and we sure need your help and what I'd like you to do is make a modest contribution right now it's very easy you can go to our website Angus 2012 calm and right over in the upper right hand corner is a big red button that says donate and that will walk you through the process get the information that's necessary and we really be a help for us and you can do it right now because I know you're on your computer because that's where you're seeing this I believe is a historic election we are doing nothing less than trying to send Washington a message that the way they've been doing business lately is simply unacceptable the gridlock the log jam the no compromise the bitter partisanship is just not right for this country we have some serious problems but we can't get to those problems until the institution's we work and the United States said right now isn't working so I hope you can join us I'm in this campaign todas porcus is Winston Churchill used to say whole hog and I'd like you to be involved as well because together together we can make some history here in Maine this fall you you

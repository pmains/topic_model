well thank you madam chair i rise in strong support of the coal amendment and i echo my republican colleagues remarks regarding this amendment and i'll add without the long-standing height amendment this bill is too extreme for the american people and it will not pass the senate the height amendment isn't a poison pill rider it is a limitation amendment prohibiting funds containing a particular appropriations bill from being spent for a specified purpose the hot amendment limitation prohibits the spending of taxpayer funds within the health and human services appropriations bill for abortions the height amendment doesn't discriminate against women in federally funded health care and the supreme court agrees the height amendment is widely recognized as having a significant impact on the number of abortions in the united states saving an estimated 2 million american life since 1976. the height amendment routinely saves more than 60 000 lives a year in the united states for decades republicans and democrats agreed it was wrong and immoral to force americans to fund abortion through their tax dollars most americans including millions of americans who identify as pro-choice object to the use of their tax dollars for the war on innocent human life that is abortion none of this is new information to anyone in this room what is new is the committee's removal of this provision that has been part of this bill for years during both republican and democratic majorities abortion is murder not health care americans should not be forced to indirectly subsidize the murder of unborn children i urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment and i yield back

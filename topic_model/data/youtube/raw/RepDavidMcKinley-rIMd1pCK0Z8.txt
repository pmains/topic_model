Thank You mr. chairman Alex I can't pronounce that last day no one else can either the can you can you give me you some insight if this pipeline for whatever reason is not authorizing back our the oil sands going to dry up and not come to the United States well I think mr. Smith talked a little bit about what the options are for oil sands production I I think one one thing that should should be made clear to everybody in this in this hearing is that the the oil sands are a truly massive resource hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested both by domestic Canadian companies a large amount by American companies and and as mr. Smith mentioned an increasing investment by China by Korea and their national oil companies and I think it it would not be an exaggeration to state that the the oil sands will are really expected to be the engine of economic growth for Canada for the next 50 years and you're going to continue you're going to continue producing them and shipping them somebody's with the investment that mean that's really the bottom line is it absolutely so that therefore therefore i want to go to mr. Salmons if you could please I didn't pick up i'm sorry i missed who the author you had some paper that you're referencing run document that we're saying gas prices will go up 10 to 20 cents yeah dr. Philip ver leaguer who's who's a well-respected oil market economist he has a news alert and in was he hired by someone to do this he know he does he doesn't independent analysis and no he just decided I'm going to write a paper and and he wasn't hired by any girl i can't speak for i know he wasn't hired you try to find out i'm just yours who paid for it because i don't think many scientists are going to just write a paper without someone paying for it so i'm just curious actually oil companies pay for his analysis okay so your oil companies are saying in prices or someone's making money off this by when someone's losing money okay so now do you know what his track record is in credibility in making these kinds of predictions can you can you find out somehow to show the reason three has his record is fairly accurate that we can expect that or is this a one-shot deal no the reason oil companies and others and I just like if you get back to me all right I'd like to see this the first actually figure out oil market and the other thing you were saying I would find a curious you seem to be you seem to be trying to prevent Canadian oil sands from going to China you said it as several times is that a first date I miss here that you don't you didn't want to go to China well I think there's a whole web of deception saying that this is going to make us more secure when really they're trying to get it to China and it's okay so we're willing to put potentially 20,000 jobs at risk because of a hypothesis you have or a theory you have that this could go to China you're not willing to you're not willing to see 20,000 Americans find jobs I'm just telling you what the data says I thought this was an informational hearing and what the Department of Energy we ship coal to China every day and it hasn't had that impact on if you think shipping it to China is going to raise the price of oil in America but we ship coal every day to China we're not seeing that increase attributed to the exporting of coal I'm i think it's bit disingenuous in your argument because and the other is that I've got a saving Simon wouldn't it make more sense for for them to just simply build a pipeline over to Seattle than it would be to take it 1,700 miles down to the Gulf Coast if they're trying if they have this clandestine study to ship it to China this is destined take sense we could debate all day you know where the oil should end up but here's the thing we have to remember the Presidential Permit is a green light for foreign energy company to come take the rights of Americans to protect their land away from them if there is not a national interest need the president is what what happens mistress now I hear you what happens mr. Simon if do you have some kind of inside knowledge that the president's not going to approve this is what happens if he approves it I have no are you gonna be just as outrageous yar now I have absolutely no we have been very clear with the administration we oppose this pipeline do you have copies does anyone have copies of these draft conclusions do we have a sense of where they're going with the environmental impact there's a there is a supplemental draft supplemental environmental impact statement that now is available and what can you give us a short version because we're running overtime here do you have a short version does it say this is going to be catastrophic and we can't afford to have the 20,000 jobs in America well what's the sense of what it's saying it concludes that it won't help our energies what a gentleman you want this one a moment I'm just waiting dear his answer place it as it concludes that it won't help America's energy security we are just one moment I'm sorry we usually do to you yeah I just wanted you know i'ma go stain you mentioned a couple of things and I I think they are the Russian should reflect then the State Department is not here because they are in the middle of the negotiations and the review and all the other kind of activities that it was necessary for them to to contemplate and in order for them to make a decision so then they're not here at this hearing I wish they were because they of Silla so it would be inappropriate for them to be at a hearing when they are in the middle of the of the negotiations take back my mother thing I'm not a couple of forgot it back now I'm not I'm not demanding the fact that they're not here I'm just simply trying to find out where that which direction they were going in that's all thank you r us immortal thank you yes go ahead the specific question that the representative asked i believe is as a department of state indicated where they're going with on the environmental draft environmental impact statement and what I can tell you is that the first draft environmental impact statement delivered in April of 2010 stated as a conclusion that the construction and operation of the Keystone XL pipeline system would have limited environmental repercussions in the United States the they followed up with a supplemental draft environmental impact statement a month ago that reiterated that finding after reviewing significantly more information thank you thank you and I might add also that without objection we accepted the documentation that mr. Waxman asked us to introduce we introduced into the record mr. Thompson's testimony and i asked the unanimous consent that we introduced in the record the statement of mark airs who's president of the Building and Construction Trades the department afl-cio who in his statement said the Keystone pipeline project has been subjected to 32 months of scrutiny through the National Environmental Policy Act which includes review by ten federal agencies as well as numeral numerous state and local agency reviews the State Department sde is has concluded that the pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact during construction and operation and that it would significantly strengthen us Economic Security so you pretend the record I mean yes if I may

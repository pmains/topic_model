every year on the 11th day of november we remember our veterans we remember their heroism we remember their service to this great country some of our veterans gave all all gave some veterans day celebrations may look a little bit different this year like so many other things in the last 11 months but our commitment as americans to telling our veterans thank you will never change because of their willingness to serve and because of their courage our nation is strong because of our veterans our freedom has been secured from one generation to the next we can never forget the sacrifices our veterans made and that their families made when their service ends our job to deliver everything that was promised to them begins that means ensuring veterans have access to quality health care making it easier for them to get the training and education they need for the job they want missouri is certainly proud to be home of nearly half a million veterans they put their lives on the line to protect our freedom we owe them a deep debt of gratitude not just on veterans day but every day we need to honor them and renew our commitment to delivering on our promises to those who served

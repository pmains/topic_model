so we just listened to president biden's first state of the union address to congress and i believe he he started his address out appropriately and with the right tone indicating that the world is watching the the devastation in ukraine the atrocities that we are seeing delivered by by president putin out of russia reminding us all as a nation that we cannot stand by the united states cannot stand by the free nations of this world cannot stand by well well russia invades an innocent country with innocent lives being lost it was a reminder to us again of the strength of the of the spirit of the ukrainian people and a reminder that democracy is something to fight for every day and we will stay committed to to that fight with the ukrainian people and the many many around the world who are coming together so i think the the emphasis that the president placed in his speech at the outset was very very important for us in the united states to hear but for for the cut for the world to hear as well i wish i wish that there had been a greater emphasis however on the role that the greatest sanction of all we certainly appreciate what has been put in place with financial sanctions but we we see how putin has used energy as as as a weapon as a tool in in this in this uh effort in ukraine and and clearly with europe the president has has chosen to not engage to not engage literally with with energy as a as a means of of sanction he has indicated today or made the announcement this evening that additional reserves from the strategic petroleum will be released to help alleviate temporarily the pressure that we are seeing put on prices but this is this is inconsistent and in my view almost hypocritical that we would allow allow russia to be able to provide this country with oil while we provide dollars to russia to help them finance this war against ukraine this was a missed opportunity for president biden tonight and and one that i hope in the days ahead he he sees the light and he he recognizes that this is an area that we must look if we wish to really put the directed the directed twist to putin he attempted to point out those areas of of common ground of those those areas that we should seek bipartisan unity and i think he highlighted a few key areas where we have good work to do there was good support to to addressing the issue of burn pits to help our veterans i spoke to the issue of mental health and what more needs to be done he raised the issue again something that i care very much about and that's violence against women and what more we can be doing what more we can be doing when it comes to public safety so those are areas that i think he was right to point to but it was a bit incongruous when he he cited specifically to some measures that have been taken before the congress and and resoundly um defeated on on a party-line basis and he's asked us to basically run that play again that to me doesn't deliver the kind of unity that we need that to me is not where we want to be focusing our energies we need to be working together in these areas of common ground we need to be working together to again show the world a unified front when we are when we are engaged in in in aspects of a very very difficult situation in europe we need to be behind our military behind our veterans behind those that are are truly truly putting everything that they have out on the line for us so the president hit hit some good points when it came to to uh to the ukraine and and russia but i think he failed in trying to to bring the nation together in in a manner and a way that strikes the right cord on unity

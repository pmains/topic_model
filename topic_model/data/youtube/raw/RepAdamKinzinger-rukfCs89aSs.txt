now is one of the two republicans on the january 6 committee congressman adam kinzinger sir thank you so much for being with us this morning and i do want to start with this news that we've heard about mark short that he's testified in the doj's probe what does that signal to you about where the investigation stands well i mean i look at it and it says obviously there's some interest you know there was a lot of frustration just kind of personally for the last i guess year and a half like what's doj doing i think our investigation though it is not a criminal investigation certainly has brought some things to light that doj is watching and it seems like between that and some of the search warrants that have been served and some of the other things we've seen that they are moving forward look i think it is important for the department of justice to get a handle on what the criminality of what happened is and if there are crimes to prosecute them because we cannot live in a country where we send a message that a president is above the law as long as he fails at a coup attempt but by the way if he ever succeeds at a coup attempt then there's probably no law anyway that's as important for us as a country to put out that standard has the committee provided doj with transcripts of its interviews with mark short and also with greg jacob the legal counsel former legal counsel to the former vp yeah i i won't get into kind of the behind the scenes what we are what we aren't sharing what doj has asked for uh as we've mentioned we are cooperating with the department of justice in certain areas there's uh there's a lot coming into consideration we have a i'd say a decent working relationship with them but obviously we have two different interests ours is to get to the bottom of what happened put out recommendations the department of justice is to look at any possible criminality i just have to ask what have they been doing for the last year and a half that said uh if they are moving forward on on looking at this stuff that's i think that's very positive for the country even if in the short term it may be maybe hard when you think of short's testimony with the committee what part do you think would be most relevant to doj i think there's just a lot of you know what did he know you know what was what was the vice president's mindset what did he see you know within the uh within the white house in terms of what the doj is specifically looking at i don't know because again i don't know if they're is it specifically this elector's issue is it specifically what is the president's role i don't know that's not something i frankly need to know with what the doj is doing but i can tell you you know mark short uh he's a good man he certainly knows a lot of uh what happened and i think under oath you can be you can be pretty much committed that he'll tell the truth jenny thomas was pressuring a number of officials to overturn election results she was in touch with many major players liz cheney says the committee is contemplating subpoenaing her when will the committee move beyond thinking about it so that's a discussion right now between jenny thomas's lawyers our lawyers we've been doing this now as a committee for about a year our lawyers are very good at knowing when we've gone from legitimate negotiations which occur between uh you know somebody who wants to come in and testify who should come in and testify and a committee they know when it goes from that legitimate negotiation to stall tactics and that's usually when they kind of give us a signal this is going nowhere they're trying to buy time and we may move to a subpoena i think it's important look we're not we're not interested in talking to jenny thomas because of her last name we're interested because what started out as you know maybe a few conversations with some people seems to have grown this has been publicly reported and uh and so we we want to hear from her and she said i think on i forget which kind of public news outlet that she's very excited in essence to come in and talk to the committee so yeah we're eager to talk to her and just find out what she knows do you think her lawyers are stalling i don't know i mean i'm not in on those negotiations we look at it and say okay the lawyers that that know the lawyerly stuff that i don't for instance they they are the better experts at that but uh look we're interested in finding out what she knows if we have to go to subpoena we will but uh clearly we'd much rather just talk to her voluntarily uh would you have subpoenaed her already if she wasn't married to clarence thomas no i like i said i don't think she's getting special treatment one way or the other we we treat her like we would anybody else i think it's probably the media and public that have more of an interest in her based on the last name but we look and say as information is developed and we see who she's talked to that's when we make the decision okay it's good to come in and chat with us so mark short says he didn't see any of pence's secret service agents in fear of their lives on january 6. he said the more likely scenario was that if the rioters had gotten closer to the vice president the secret service would have opened fire on that meaning he's saying it would have been more likely that the rioters were killed than the secret service was why should people then believe that anonymous white house security official or security official who is uh familiar with the white house complex whose testimony we heard last week over short who was actually there i mean look we i that official said it under oath i mean short can have a different perception of what happened let me ask you a question i mean here's something clear if his if his reasoning for saying that is because secret service agents can open fire and kill people coming after the vice president well i think he just said he didn't witness it that's not what he witnessed that's fine i mean that's fine i there's there's multiple roles of secret service the point is we heard the radio traffic they were very concerned very rarely do you hear secret service in a heightened state saying hey we're about to have our exit cut off and i want to put yourself in the mindset of whether it's secret service the vice president or anybody with him they were 40 feet which is like 10 football yards maybe slightly more 13 football yards from being completely cut off of any exit to the capitol there's no secret trap door in the capitol that the vice president can go through and end up in some protected location they were stuck i would be in in pretty freaked out mode if i was protecting the vice president because you know at that point if the if the rioters of which there are thousands come upon him they are not going to treat him generally they had gallows erected outside did the inspector general of dhs inform the january 6 committee that the inquiry into the missing texts from secret service is now a criminal probe is that going to impact the information you may get i don't want to get i don't know what i want to get into too much with what we've talked about with the inspector general here's what we know as a committee obviously there are missing text messages it's one of two things either complete failure and incompetence of management to lose text messages uh particularly when there are rules governing that or there's a reason they're disappeared that's what we want to know um uniquely i mean on on probably the second most important day of the secret service in the 21st century why those text messages i i'm not going out on a limb and saying nefarious activity but i'm saying suspicious enough that we need to know the ig has their investigation we have our investigation we can get information from each other to the extent that it's feasible but we all have different interests ours is to get the answers for what happened on january 6. has the committee shared information has the committee been in contact with the fulton county d.a in georgia again i won't get into what's been happening kind of behind the scenes on that i'll leave that to those that have had the discussion particularly to any fulton county d.a what they want to share or not share but i'm not going to reveal any of that other than the the tweet that trump put out urging supporters to come to washington uh sort of a siren call and i think that it's reasonable to look at it that way but other than that is there any direct link from the trump white house to the extremist groups in the lead up to january 6th look in terms of any direct links we're going to put out more information we'll have more hearings i my issue is this and this is what we were talking about in the thursday night hearing the president tried every effort to overturn the election in the lead up to january six on january six the president did far more than just failed to act he chose to stand by for the first time in his life actually resist peer pressure um to see where this like attack on the capital would go because maybe it would succeed and only when it didn't did he step out so he had that tweet obviously come there it's going to be wild all the stuff about the election leading up to it stirring people up and then in the middle of knowing that his vice president was in the middle of here that the capitol was occupied he sat there angry and said vice president mike pence betrayed us knowing dang well that he was in danger and then at the end of the day i think it was his last tweet ever mercifully he said these are the things and events that happen when a election is stolen from people like you remember this day forever he's making the day a martyr he's making his cause a martyr and it is absolutely chilling it's the things you see in places like libya and countries that have dictatorships or had dictatorships is that the direct link to you no look i'm just saying from my perspective the president knew exactly what he was doing in terms of specifics with extremist groups we put out some information there's more to come i'm talking about the president's role in january 6. that's what matters to me okay so there's more to come you have hearings coming up and and would you look so more to come i mean when you have these hearings still ahead of you would you think of this more as tying up loose ends or are we going to see some bombshells well let me let me give you an example so you saw the video that came out yesterday about the speech the drafting of the speech we could have had a hearing on thursday that was five hours long with the information we had obviously you guys wouldn't cover a five hour here maybe you guys would most people wouldn't cover a five hour hearing and uh and so there's a lot of information we couldn't get out that will come out that'll come out particularly in the report it may come out in future hearings and we're also getting more witnesses so as we're also kind of presenting this to the american people we're not tying up loose ends we're getting more information and we're going to be in a position where people have no doubt what happened that's all our job is is to say here's what happened here's recommendations in terms of the justice side of things you have to ask merrick garland on that one yeah we might cover that five hour hearing too so just give us a heads up on that you've got steve bannon guilty now of contempt do you think doj should have charged meadows and dan scavino as well yeah yeah i mean look the only question is did you ignore did you get a subpoena from congress were they able to serve that to you and did you show up any one of those people can show up to congress and assert their fifth amendment right they can show up and claim executive privilege to congress they didn't even bother so yes i think the department of justice should i think they're worried about this area of executive privilege but again mark meadows can come in and claim it as for instance uh the the white house counsel did mr sipoloni in certain areas come in and claim it claim the fifth if you think you're guilty but you don't have a right to just ignore it like you couldn't with the court that subpoenaed you your republican colleague over in the senate senator tom cotton went on a radio show he criticized the last hearing but then admitted this let's listen i'll confess though if you not i will confess that i did not watch that hearing and i have not watched any of the hearings so i have not seen any of them out of the context that i see a snip snippet here your response to him yeah let me tell you how he's thinking he thinks it's cool to be in front of the base be like i'm not even watching the hearing guys i'm too cool to watch the hearings but i already have my mind made up frankly that probably works in the base tom cotton has built a reputation on acting like the toughest guy on the planet but he can't even put in front of his eyes you know a narrative which may challenge his soul that he'll have to go tell his people the truth republicans that are watching let me tell you this every one of your leaders that refused to tell you that the election wasn't stolen joe biden is the legitimate president and that trump is a poison to our country anyone that refuses to tell you that doesn't believe it which is 99 percent of them they're abusing you they are lying to you and and you should throw them out with anger because you need leaders to tell you the truth can be ticked at me be ticked at liz cheney all you want fine we can take it we're telling you the truth the people that are lying to you they may patch you on the head and make you feel good but they're abusing you stealing your money all to stay in power i have no sympathy for people like tom cotton or anybody else like kevin mccarthy that lies to the base voter those base voters that you're talking about they're not changing their minds looking at the hearings in fact our dhoni o'sullivan went to the dueling trump pence rallies in arizona and this is what some told him about the hearings let's listen have you watched january 6 hearings i have what do you think i think they're a bunch of why well because do you have both sides or are you getting one side of the sword you mean like the side that attacked the capital do you really believe that happened i was there okay i have a lot of people that were there too and and saw things that it wasn't what they say it was have you guys been watching the general e6 hearings at all no no no we saw it when it all went down and then we saw like a lot of the blm and the antiqua people in the building as well and and it's just it's just nonsense but i think like 800 people now have been charged right yeah and number black lives matter are antifa yeah they're not they have charging been brought into court for their due process because they have not been arrested hunter biden hasn't been arrested yeah i mean your face says it all these these aren't outliers right in in the trump base what's your thought as you're listening to that i mean facts are hard to digest right this is a very one-sided hearing process it's very one-sided i'll give them that it has only been republicans only mainly republicans appointed by donald trump that have testified we haven't had a democratic witness maybe one or two i don't know what their personal political affiliations but it is only republicans coming in and testifying they are being lied to and manipulated they are told that somehow nancy pelosi or muriel bowser controls the national guard the only person with control of the dc national guard by the way is the president of the united states the only person that can deploy the dc national guard but they are lied to they're i mean i could i could go on for an hour about this i will tell you though i firmly believe in five or ten years you will not find a single person in this country that will admit to ever having supported donald trump he's becoming a cancer trump-ism is a cancer and there will be people like nixon that never admit they supported him in five or ten years i do want to ask you about something that we're seeing which is democratic groups who are actually helping push election deniers in gop primaries they're hoping for an easier matchup in the general election what do you make of that as someone who's committee is exposing them i think it's disgusting because look yeah you think you may have an easier time at winning i'm going to tell you after january they're going to be a few of these people look at doug mastriano in pennsylvania i mean look at darren bailey in illinois an election denier governor pritzker spent tens of millions of dollars so that he would win by the way yeah pritzker has a little bit of an advantage right now in a good republican year bailey may win and it's it's you see this in peter meyer in michigan you're going to have election deniers win so while i think a certain number of democrats truly understand that democracy is threatened don't come to me after having spent money supporting an election denier in a primary and then come to me and say you're where are all the good republicans you're worried about democracy i truly believe that all these issues we argue about they matter but the thing that matters the most right now is the threat to our democracy it's the thing our kids will judge us by and when we're sitting here playing d triple c you know dnc politics let's promote the crazy and then that person wins you don't understand the real threat i'm sorry you don't understand the threat to democracy congressman we do appreciate you being so generous with your time this morning thank you congressman adam kinzinger

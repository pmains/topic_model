no we are we are feeling for our fellow Texans as they're experiencing historic flooding and this hearing to me is very timely as you said your testimony today millions of Americans are physically and financially vulnerable to floods week's worth of flooding in my district and quite frankly has brought that statement very close to home as you probably know the president just recently approved governor Abbott request for a major disaster declaration just last week proved very quickly the residence in Hays County Texas my in my 25th district which I represent are beginning that process now it goes without saying I have a vested interest to make sure we get it right and that we fix the problems we've discussed this afternoon i will tell you shortly after this I called your FEMA office and talked to the regional director he was very on top of the job he got with us they were on the ground and I appreciated that very much I've made that public so i guess i would say my first question to you is you mentioned of course we have a hundred and forty-two thousand claims that you're that you're reopening now and that's 40 million dollars you said approximately is that right that'll be the cost to do the work that's not necessarily the outflows of paypal what's not what does that do to your budget there's no impact congressman on our borrowing authority or on our cash on hand we have sufficient funds in available on end without having to borrow additional funds but sandy did strain your resources sandy did constraint our resources yes right so back home when i go to text when i go back home to Texas you're going to have plenty of room to help my texans get done what need to be done right we have we have sufficient funding available right now to deal with the disasters in texas in oklahoma and elsewhere and i would also just point out that we did extend the period to file proof of loss by an additional six months to give people space and time to do that we know it's going to take them time to get back into their homes and it going to take time to find all the damage so they'll have now up to 240 days in order to file their proof of loss and that should help all right next question is you've talked about reforms and the reforms you're doing now to make things that and you talk to pretty good depth about that am i is it safe to say that all the reforms you talked about that you're making it Sean bet making today well my constituents in Texas begin to see it tomorrow I think that your constituents in Texas can count on the fact that we are hyper attentive to what is happening in Texas and Oklahoma and flooding this year because of what we've seen happen in Sandy that mr. right and I and the leaders in our team are hyper attentive to this that's why we're going to establish a hotline that's why we've extended the proof of loss and that's why we're going to be watching very closely on the ground from Washington and working with our right your owns to reduce any sort of risk that this could happen again so we've learned from the past so we can be reassured that what we're talking about today won't happen again in Texas and Oklahoma we're going to take every step we can congressman to prevent that from happening now you guys we've already had five thousand claims five thousand claims in short period of time and you know there's going to be a lot more so we really want to get it right and so I guess you know I come from a retail background and I think it's important that you and I told you your guys this when we talked last week but please understand these people are customers their customers and they need to be treated as such and they deserve good they deserve on-time service with very few hassles and I hope all of your folks will understand that you know think retail and and and give them the opportunity to to realize the benefits that they have coming to them and begin to get their lives back Texans are resilient people and they just kind of need to kind of know the rules but I hope we've remembered from what's happened so we can't we won't we won't see this happen again but I do thank you for your service and we'll look forward to working with your agency as we move forward to fix a fix our needs back home in Texas mr. Chairman I yield back

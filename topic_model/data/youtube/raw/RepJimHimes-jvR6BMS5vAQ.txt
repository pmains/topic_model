let's bring in democratic congressman jim Himes he's from Connecticut he sits on the House Intelligence Committee and most relevant congressman good to have you this morning you voted no to arming the Syrian rebels I think one of the overlooked problems going on here is how Congress is passing the buck to the President on what is certainly a war situation you voted no what do you make of Congress not meeting debating and voting on a war resolution well I was very disappointed by the fact that we did not and of course in giving the president the authority to arm the so-called moderate Syrian rebels we have given up the one piece of leverage that we had to force that debate and look this isn't something that necessarily has to do with today's situation with the Syrian rebels this has to do with 60 years of war making authority gradually migrating from the place that the Constitution put it that is to say the United States Congress to the White House to the point where you know one man it doesn't have to be this president can be any president is gradually getting the authority to make war in contravention to the Constitution so I'm kind of disappointed that we didn't have this debate on what is a very very complicated topic and when we're talking about the specific action which at this point is the bombings which is easy in terms of allowing it because we have a history there and there are no people in jeopardy other than those flying the missions and then you have the peaceable who do you give these weapons to that's a big reason that you voted no you now have Panetta and others coming forward and saying yeah we were going to do this a few years ago that was a bama's mistake he should have done it then was there any confidence then that we knew who we were giving weapons to well look the problems that exist today would have existed back then too it's just that Isis would have had less of a platform look when you're creating a proxy army in somebody else's country without an ability to command and control proxy army which of course is what we've now given the authority to do the unintended consequences are many and this is a region of the world where the unintended consequence is over many many decades have often been an awful lot worse than we anticipated rather than better so I understand that you know this was discussed some time ago and in fact there have been other countries arming rebels for some period of time but the question now is the decision was made by congressman that is the question now is what kind of international support can we get so this looks a little bit like George HW Bush's to get to get Iraq out of Kuwait and a little bit less like what was a somewhat less enthusiastic effort in george w bush's efforts in in Iraq let's be honest congressman it's not looking good we keep saying well this is their war this is a regional fight this is for the soul of Islam this is about the Middle East and we're just going to help none of these big guys are putting boots on the ground will commit troops to the action do you think something will change at the UN this week well you know I think there's a couple of opportunities at the UN first is of course to actually get something other than us branded proxy armies and US aircraft in the air so that this really doesn't become something that none of us want it to be which is a US versus Isis fight but you know I'd suggest there's probably two other really important things that can be accomplished or attempted to be accomplished at the UN one is many of these countries Chris as you know are you know while they sort of publicly say that they don't like Isis they are allowing certain of their citizens to actually fund Isis to recruit in places like Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states turkey of course because they've got some diplomats held by Isis is allowing Isis to run rampant across the border that must change the other thing I would say chris says you know we have no control over clerics in the region and this is a moment finally a great long last for clerics in the Islamic religion to stand up and say these guys have absolutely nothing to do with Islam so that Isis is religious legitimacy is taken away from them that that's we can make progress on that this week I think that you raise the Turk situation people should be paying attention to that there was the release of the prisoners what was negotiated to have that happen we don't really know yet there are a key party not an Arab nation obviously but key to the situation Isis has them in the crosshairs a lot of unknown there lastly this American apparently American member of Isis we keep saying it's a regional conflict it's about them not us what's the chance that you have Americans and positions of command and control within Isis well the chances are reasonably good look there are somewhere between several hundred and you know some figures go up depending on what country you're talking about too many thousands of Westerners fighting with Isis and this is really it is it is a frightening thing but people also need to remember that our intelligence community and our law enforcement people who have received tremendous numbers of new resources since 911 they're very job is to track these people and to make sure that if and when they come back they do not pose a threat so it's not a not a not an attractive thing for us to think about but there are hundreds if not thousands of security people who are who are working on making sure we know what these people are up to congressman jim Himes thank you very much for joining us on new day thanks Chris

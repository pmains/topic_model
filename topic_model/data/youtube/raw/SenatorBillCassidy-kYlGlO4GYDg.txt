thank you Senator Senator Cassidy thank you Mr Turk Mr Turk when you know one of your co-workers here Mr Crane when one of your co-workers Mr Crane was here he and I spoke about the um the Doe's proposed definition of clean hydrogen that would change the legislative definition from two kilograms of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen produced at the point of production to a life cycle requirement of four kilograms of CO2 equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen now we're told that um an all-natural gas grid would be counted in the life cycle analysis but that an all renewable grid would not be required to take into account the mining refining and Manufacturing that went into developing that renewable grid life cycle analysis we're also told that small producers of natural gas who had received no compensation in the hub would nonetheless be considered contributors to the life cycle analysis this really seemed like a thumb on the scale again against Natural Gas this kind of War on fossil fuel the administration seems to pursue now just let me ask where are we with this and have we modified those definitions that go against that which was legislated well thank you senator for your leadership on hydrogen and ccus and a variety of other key Technologies for your state and for our country you're referring to the production standard which is try trying to take a beyond the fence line life cycle analysis making sure that we take into account all the emissions associated with it that is not a regulatory standard and that is not a barrier to any applicant whether it's the hydrogen hubs or otherwise and so we are trying to be true to the legislative intent and trying to make sure that with all of our funding we're taking into account the full range of emissions and being smart uh smart about that now but let me ask back and forth when you say full range you're not including the life cycle of the renewable grid if you're talking about solar you're talking about the mining of lithium the transportation of it typically from Asia et cetera Etc it's pretty dirty actually so we need to take into account all of them so is it so I know you need to but is your current life cycle analysis still taken into account the Upstream on natural gas if it's a natural gas-fired plant and not taken into account the mining associated with lithium Etc to develop that solar panel farm so let me talk further you mentioned David crane Brad Crabtree is our colleague in charge of our fossil energy and carbon management office as well our life cycle analysis should be life cycle analysis and take into account all the emissions throughout the life cycle and so again I I don't mean to feel I don't mean to drill but it should that's a subjunctive is it that's what I need to talk to our colleagues on and is it still taken into account the small producer of natural gas who has no relationship whatsoever to the hub and yet we were told previously that whatever the profile would be of that would go into an industry average as to the production of natural gas well we appreciate your continued guidance and feedback on the hubs we are trying to do this in the right way to solicit information to make sure that what we're looking at the criteria that we're looking at we certainly are being very solicitous rightfully so of not just looking out for the big players but also but that's beside my point because I don't want you mentioned earlier talking past each other right now we're told that on the average Mission profile of the natural gas that would go to the natural gas fired plant they're taking into account the smaller producers which may have not as good a profile they're lumping it into an average so the folks that have taken really care about this are not advantage in fact again it is a there being disadvantaged by including those who for whatever reason may not have the same positive profile so so again I'm asking specifically does the current Rule still include those small producers in an industry average when taken into account the life cycle profile so let me take that back with my colleagues and happy to have further conversations with you Senator I don't know the current state on that particular Nuance so I'll have to take that back um and I appreciate you coming back with that

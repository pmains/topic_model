by democratic congressman from california and member of the house financial services and armed services committees brad sherman congressman thank you so much for joining us really appreciate your time um so on formula you know the president announced some steps this week to try to improve things you know ramping up imports from abroad and also expanding buying options for people who are paying with wic benefits um but the white house says they've been working on this for months and critics are now saying that they should have done something sooner before parents were going to these stores and having to hit multiple locations to find what they need uh should the white house have taken more action sooner we should have been dealing with this and other problems way in advance you see capitalism calls for just-in-time delivery and minimum possible inventories that's how you maximize profits so nobody's paying companies for resiliency and stockpiling we saw what happened to toilet paper two years ago that's less of a crisis than this obviously and so you need a system where you're paying for stockpiles and you're paying for surplus capacity right now i showed my colleagues a draft of a bill that would clarify the president has the defense production act to order companies wherever there's a plant that could be making baby formula to do so and to sweep away any restrictions on imports from japan europe the uk and canada and to suspend the 17 tariffs that we have on imports we need to maximize imports maximize production to deal with the short term long term we need a a host of strategic reserves and or surplus capacity available and capitalism points in the other direction if you're running a company you want to run it lean i think you're right about that this certainly highlights the need to have some backup options um but there's also some signs that potentially you know the white house should have seen this coming sooner that maybe the fda could have done more that whistleblower at the plant former employee there reported safety concerns back in october but the fda didn't do their interview of this person until december uh the uh or excuse me the plant inspection then wasn't until january 31st and then the recall was february 17th so you go from october the first sign of something to now february 17th everything shuts down here we are in may should the fda's handling of this be examined we should examine everything government often works more slowly than it should i'm not aware of any babies that were hurt from that particular plant but obviously we have a nationwide crisis in part because that plant is is closed and it's easy to look back and say we should have seen this crisis what happens is you're made aware of hundreds of potential crises every day and only one of them turns out to be the crisis you should have dealt with um in retrospect it's easy to go back and say that's the warning you should have taken uh seriously there are a hundred other warnings that turned out to not pan up well compounding this for a lot of parents now they're driving around in some cases to multiple locations trying to find formula or specialized formula if they've got an infant with certain needs medical needs and they're paying record high gas prices while they're doing it i want to pull up on the screen a gallon of regular the average 445 a gallon diesel is even worse at 556 so now you got price gouging a formula on top of huge inflation on top of gas prices at record highs these are tough conditions for democrats heading into the midterms are you concerned about how the economy is going to impact all these upcoming races obviously the economy will have an effect the recent supreme court draft leak will have an effect many things will have an effect but the fact is that we produced more oil in this country in the first year of the byte administration then the prior year the last year of the trump administration and next year we're going to produce more oil in this country than we ever have but that's not going to mean that we're going to have the lowest prices ever in 2023 it is a worldwide price that you pay at the pump and whether there's more or less production in the united states is probably less important than whether the saudis will turn on the tap and our failure to put more pressure on saudi arabia to turn on the tap that's the only place where more oil could be produced next month i won't rehash all of the points that republicans often bring up about this administration not embracing uh you know sort of energy-friendly policies as far as domestic production is concerned is we're going to have more oil production in 2023 than ever in the history of the country so to say that biden is suppressing oil production means you have to ignore the facts and just listen to the rhetoric well i guess we can all look at the gas prices and supply issues and judge for ourselves if that ends up panning out congressman brad sherman we've run out of time really appreciate you coming on to speak with us uh hope to see you again soon look forward to it

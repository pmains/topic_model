thank you mr chairman and thank you mr reagan for being here today and uh you know exactly what i'm going to talk about because it is one of my very top concerns as being the senator from mississippi and always has been since the day i got here the yazoo backwater area pump project and you know it's a concern to me but it's definitely a concern to the mississippi delta the november 17 2021 letter from the epa office of water the u.s army corps of engineers brought this long overdue congressionally authorized flood control project to a screeching halt leaving thousands of mississippians without hope of decent flood control and more than 10 million dollars in taxpayer money totally just flushed down the drain mr administrator i cannot begin to express my frustration and disappointment by your agency's decisions which was by all accounts an abuse of the epa's authority under the clean water act and to my colleagues on this committee this may be a mississippi issue today but make no mistake the same abuse of authority may end up in your backyard tomorrow mr administrator you and other administration officials including the white house council on environmental quality profess that the yazoo backwater pumps are a priority and that you're actively looking for a solution and talk about an environmental injustice this is a true minority community who live in true poverty they cannot afford homeowners insurance and you heard a testimony i think of mr anderson jones that talked about his an elderly man that talked about his senior class party that he went to with mud on his pants because he had to wade through the water and he said my grandchildren are waiting through those same waters i will never forget that man's testimony what is the status of that process and are you involving local stakeholders are the congressionally authorized pumps an option under this administration and if not why not well thank you for that question and and also thank you and the delegation for the invitation to host me in mississippi and vicksburgs and actually see it firsthand that was really helpful um you know i am going to stay with my commitment to you which is this process is a priority i think what i agree to and we are meeting that obligation is i pull the white house in i think there's been a number one this issue has been there for decades we can agree that it's not political because i think it was the bush administration that put the veto in place in the trump administration that had a process that was deemed political interference to change the bush administration's decision on this project but that aside i have asked the white house this council for environmental quality to convene all of the federal agencies that are involved u.s fish and wildlife u.s army usda and fema to focus on this project and we have done just that we've got technical experts from all of those agencies reviewing all of the available data there are no options off the table to your your question green and gray hard and natural infrastructure solutions are on the table what i can say is our teams have started meetings and there are weekly two-hour meetings occurring over the next month to put solutions in front of both leadership at epa and u.s army corps of engineers so we're tracking on that timeline that i committed to you on we've got all of the agencies we have like we have an interagency council actually focused on this problem i committed to you and senator wicker that instead of continuing to kick the football uh down the road like we've seen for the past 20 30 years we're going to get a solution to this problem during all these meetings and all these hearings that you're having and all the agencies that you say you're bringing in it should be very clear that the the letter that was sent that the pump project is subject to epa's 2008 veto 2008 veto of a different core plan you should easily find that according to the epa assistant administrator of the office of water the 2020 proposed plan is the same plan proposed by the corps in 2007. the 2020 proposed plan would discharge fill material into the same disposal site prohibited under epa's 20 2008 veto this is just not true the facts are the proposed location of the pump station in the new 2020 plan is in a completely different county than the 2007 plans project site that's a big difference and when i got that and i saw that you were looking at the things in 20 in 2007 in a completely different county i was just totally amazed another fact the 2020 plan included in the new mitigation features that that to help sustain aquatic habitat fisheries and mussels during low flow season the 2007 plan called for nothing of that sort that is a big difference another fact the 2020 plan included an adaptive management plan in light of the uncertainty related to the effects of pumping out surface water within that area and to allow the flexible decisions making when operational adjustments are needed the 2007 plan did not include any of that so this is a big difference and the list goes on the bottom line is the 2020 plan is not the 2007 plan given the long list of differences detailed in the course final supplemental environmental impact statement how can your agency determine that these two plans are basically one and the same i think that um you know the the the experts i think you we can agree that this issue has been going on since 1940 or 50 and epa and army corps and fish and wildlife these agencies have been having this discussion for 50 years and placing the blame in different categories but it's time to straighten it out it is which is why i am proud to say that for the first time in 50 or 60 years i got the white house to convene an interagency council to pull all these agencies together so that staff can't hide people can't hide we're going to take a look we're going to do the analysis and we're kind of we're going to come up with a solution and i feel very good about the process that we have underway because it's never been done before and what you're going to find with the proposed solutions is for the first time in decades you're going to see a u.s epa usda you're going to see an army corps and a u.s fish and wildlife in the same administration stop bickering and agree on what we believe to be illegally sound and engineering durable solution to the yazoo pump issue the other thing that we're going to also do because you raised environmental justice is army corps evaluation of the yazoo pumps project has never done an evaluation on ej never provided any data to support that we're going to do that this time around so we want to button this thing up i i want to button this thing up probably not as much as you do but i want to button this thing up because it's the right thing to do and i believe we can get it done well if you look at the facts and the science you can get it done and i'm just asking that all of this is cleared up because this is information coming from your office that needs to be cleared up and i truly appreciate you trying to find this solution and uh it's been a long time coming and i just hope that this is a quick resolution to this and that it's not two or three more years down the road because these people in the mississippi delta need your help and it did come to a screeching halt after it was congressionally approved so i think you've got a lot of explaining to do i think you've got a lot of corrections to make and i truly appreciate your efforts in this well thank you and i agree with you 50 60 40 years however many years is way too long and this is a priority for me and we want to find a solution thank you very much thank you senator

>> THIS IS CHICAGO'S VERY OWN  WGN EVENING NEWS AT 5.  >> RAY CORTOPASSI: CONGRESSMAN  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI TOOK A  TRIP TO TAIWAN WITH HOUSE  SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI, WHICH,  OF COURSE, SPARKED SOME  CONTROVERSY. REPRESENTATIVE  KRISHNAMOORTHI JOINS US NOW  LIVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT  FIRST, WE WANT TO GET YOUR  REACTION TO THIS STATEMENT  JUST MADE BY ATTORNEY GENERAL  MERRICK GARLAND ABOUT THAT  SEARCH MAR-A-LAGO. YOUR  THOUGHTS?  >> AS YOU KNOW, IS AN  UNPRECEDENTED SEARCH. AND SO I  THINK IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR  ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND TO  MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT THIS.  AND I THINK I'M HOPEFUL THAT  THE PRESIDENT AGREES TO  BASICALLY PUBLICIZE THE SEARCH  WARRANTS AND THAT WE CAN KIND  OF REDUCE THE RAMPANT  SPECULATION ABOUT THE CONTENTS  OF THAT WAR.  >> RAY CORTOPASSI: FOR THE  WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT IT WAS  NOT TOLD ABOUT THE RAID AHEAD  OF TIME. IS THAT A REASONABLE?  THINK THE PULLEY TO BELIEVE  GIVEN THAT THE RIGHT FEEL SO  STRONGLY OTHERWISE ABOUT IT.  >> I THINK ONLY BECAUSE. YOU  KNOW, THE FBI AND THE DOJ HAVE  BEEN IN THE NEWS A LOT OVER  THE LAST FEW YEARS, ESPECIALLY  DURING THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION AND THEN  TOWARDS THE END OF THE OBAMA  ADMINISTRATION. THE IDEA BEING  THAT YOU KNOW, DECISIONS WERE  POLITICIZED. AND I THINK THAT  IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE, I  THINK THAT MERRICK GARLAND  PROBABLY DID NOT WANT TO BE  ACCUSED OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND  HOW INVOLVING ITSELF IN ANY  DECISION-MAKING ON THIS SEARCH  WARRANT. SO I TEND TO BELIEVE  IT ALL THAT BEING SAID. I DO  THINK THAT MERRICK GARLAND,  THE DOJ AND THE FBI AS WELL AS  DONALD TRUMP NEED TO ANSWER  SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT  EXACTLY WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE  SEARCH AND WHAT WAS ACTUALLY  ON THE INVENTORY OF WHAT WAS  COLLECTED.  >> RAY CORTOPASSI: AND AS  YOU'RE ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS,  A LOT OF OTHERS HAVE BEEN  JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT  IT. YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN ABOUT  THE POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE IN  THE AFTERMATH OF ALL OF THIS.  >> I DO. AND I THINK THAT THE  RHETORIC THAT WE'RE SEEING  WITH REGARD TO VIOLENCE  AGAINST FEDERAL AGENTS, THE  FBI OR THE DOJ, MERRICK  GARLAND HIMSELF AND THEN  FOLLOWED UP BY THE INCIDENT  THAT HAPPENED. I BELIEVE IT  WAS CINCINNATI FIELD OFFICE OF  THE FBI WHERE A MAN CLAD IN  BODY ARMOR BASICALLY ENGAGED  IN A SHOOT OUT WITH SECURITY  GUARDS AT THE FBI OFFICE ONLY  LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT WE  NEED TO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE  WE TO GET RID OF THE  SPECULATION. WE NEED TO KNOW  EXACTLY. YOU KNOW WHAT THESE  YOU KNOW, WHAT IS AT THE HEART  OF THIS INVESTIGATION?  >> DINA BAIR: REPRESENTATIVE  CHRIS SEA. LET'S SWITCH GEARS  NOW TO YOUR TRIP TO TAIWAN.  HINDSIGHT, OF COURSE, IS  ALWAYS 2020, BUT GIVEN CHINA'S  WAS IT WORTH IT?  >> OH, ABSOLUTELY. THERE ARE 2  REASONS. WE WENT. ONE  ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE  SAW IN UKRAINE. WE HAVE TO  PREVENT WHAT HAPPENED IN  UKRAINE FROM HAPPENING WITH  TAIWAN. AND THAT MEANS WE HAVE  TO STAND WITH OUR PARTNERS,  ALLIES AND FRIENDS IN THE  REGION TO RESIST AGGRESSION BY  THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY  AND THEN THE SECOND REASON WE  WENT WAS WE WANT TO EXPAND  ECONOMIC TIES IN THE  ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE  PASSAGE OF THE CHIPS ACT,  WHICH ENCOURAGES MORE  MANUFACTURING OF SEMICONDUCTOR  CHIPS HERE IN THE UNITED  STATES. ALL THE COUNTRIES IN  THAT REGION ARE EXCITED ABOUT  THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MOVE  MANUFACTURING OF THESE CHIPS,  ESPECIALLY FROM PLACES LIKE  THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA  TO THE UNITED STATES AND  INDEED, COMMITTED TO  20 BILLION DOLLARS IN  INVESTMENTS IN THE UNITED  STATES TO MANUFACTURE HIGH AND  SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS HERE AND  VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT  OPPORTUNITY. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE  YOU ARE THINKING THAT THE  FRUIT OF THAT TRIP WAS WORTH  THE POLITICAL RISK. BUT HAVING  SAID THAT, DID THE THE  INTENSIVE MISS OF CHINESE  MILITARY DRILLS.  >> SURPRISE, YOU AFTERWARD.  NO, THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE  PAST THAT THEY DID, OBVIOUSLY  AFTER OUR TRIP, I HOPE THEY  DON'T DO IN THE FUTURE, BUT  IT'S RECKLESS. THEY'RE  PATIENTS. I HAVE ABOUT THIS  ONE. IF THE COSTS OF AVOIDING  THESE PROVIDE MEASURES BUT THE  CHINESE COMPANIES PARTY IS TO  CEDE CONTROL OF TAIWAN,  RECEIVE CONTROL OF OUR TRAVEL  SCHEDULES TO THE CHINESE  COMMUNIST PARTY. THAT IS THE  PRICE WE ARE NOT GOING TO PAY.  AND THEN EXERCISES WERE DONE  BASICALLY TO DEFLECT ATTENTION  FROM THE INTENSE ECONOMIC  PRESSURE THAT SHE'S A PAY IS  FACING INTERNALLY BECAUSE IT  IS RESPONSE TO COVID AND HE'S  NOW SEEKING A 3RD TERM IN THE  UPCOMING PARTY. CONGRESS OF  THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY  AND SO USED OUR VISIT AS A  PRETEXT FOR ALL THESE  EXERCISES TO SHIFT ATTENTION  TO A SUBJECT OTHER THAN WHAT'S  HAPPENING AT HOME. HE WOULD  HAVE DONE IT HAD ANOTHER  DELEGATION GONE, BUT HE CHOSE  TO DO IT WHEN WE WENT. THAT'S  WHY IT, AS I SAID BEFORE, WE  HAVE TO STAND STRONG IN THE  FACE OF THAT TYPE OF  AGGRESSION.  >> DINA BAIR: IT SEEMS LIKE  THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO  WERE CRITICAL OF THE TRIP. BUT  YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT SOUNDS  LIKE THE ADMINISTRATION'S  GOALS WERE ACHIEVED. IS THIS  SOMETHING THAT WASN'T  SANCTIONED BY THE PRESIDENT?  >> KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT  WE DID. YOU KNOW, BASICALLY AS  A CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION, I  SHOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT 25  REPUBLICAN SENATORS ACTUALLY  WROTE A LETTER. I THINK IT WAS  LED BY MITCH MCCONNELL.  BASICALLY SUPPORTING OUR VISIT  BECAUSE THERE'S TREMENDOUS  BIPARTISAN SENATE, BOTH IN THE  HOUSE AND THE SENATE FOR  SUPPORTING OUR FRIENDS IN  TAIWAN. IT'S NOT ONLY THE  MORALLY AND ETHICALLY RIGHT  THING TO DO, BUT IT'S LEGALLY  OBLIGATED OF US UNDER THE  TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT, WHICH  CALLS FOR US TO SUPPORT THE  DEFENSE OF TAIWAN'S DEMOCRACY.  >> RAY CORTOPASSI: CONGRESSMAN,  I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME. WE  HAD A LOT MORE TO TALK ABOU

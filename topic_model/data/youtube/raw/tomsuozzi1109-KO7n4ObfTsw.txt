it was disturbing it was traumatic and the insurrection on capitol hill that unfolded wednesday will live in infamy the eyes of the world watched as thousands of trump supporters pushed and clawed their way into our most sacred bastion of democracy all in a failed attempt to overturn an election president trump lost lawmakers were rightly terrified as the masses violently forced their way inside the capitol here's congressman tom swazi's account as the ordeal played out i'm in the capitol chamber we're being evacuated people are being asked to put on to make sure evacuated being asked to put on masks checking the door to make sure it's locked [Applause] okay [Music] joining me right now the man behind that video congressman tom swazi who represents the great state of new york congressman good to see you wow that you had the the instinct the wherewithal to say i'm gonna i'm gonna videotape this moment as i'm also listening to instruction trying to figure out what is going on and put this mask on take me back to that moment um how you know how you were processing all that was unfolding all at once you know it was uh obviously a shocking day for all of us and earlier that day my wife had said you know this is going to be a very important day in history make sure you you keep track of everything that's going on because you you sometimes forget what happened so i was making a point of writing notes to myself before that about what was going on inside the chamber where people were debating which is you know i disagree very strongly with my colleagues who were objecting to the electoral process but they were debating and what was going on juxtaposed with outside where they were being violent and people were getting more and more violent so i just wanted to make sure i kept track of what was going on that day and it just ended up being something much more dramatic than i thought it would be right when your wife was talking about that she was really making reference to the fact that this was going to be the day that you know you actually certify the vote but you and your wife no one really could have known that it was going to be i mean this kind of history that was being made so um you know were you thinking about your safety were you thinking about you know whether following the instructions on you know going to this place of safety was was going to be the you know priority here was it you know survival instincts kicking in uh was it the disbelief that these americans you know were coming into this capital and threatening your lives and threatening the very institution of democracy and capitol hill i think it's all those things uh federica i think that i was feeling all you know they i talked to some people afterwards because i said in one of the videos that i felt remarkably calm and they talk about how your adrenaline starts pumping during fight and flight and uh you know there were guns drawn all around us we heard a pop pop pop we thought there was guns that was probably when they were breaking through the door with uh through the glass in the door where the president walks through they say ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states of america the protesters were breaking through that with steel pipes later on we did hear gunshots and the the capitol police you could hear on the radio saying shots fired in the capital shots fired in the capitol that was probably when the woman was killed in the speaker's lobby afterwards i was one of the last people to leave the chamber because we were up in the gallery and my seat was the furthest away from the exit point and we actually got delayed because we weren't sure it was safe to go out into the hallway uh finally when we did get out of the hallway into the hallway we saw people on the ground the protesters surrounded by capitol police so it was really a harrowing experience i'm sure for a lot of people i was very worried about some of my colleagues who were really very nervous and i was certainly worried about my family and was texting them and saying everything's okay everything's okay wow well you've so happily described that among your emotions you know fear and calm now you know three days later are you feeling angry that this has happened or described for me what you're feeling and what's the what's the resolve now you know there's a lot of different first my first strongest instinct is we have to get back in the chamber that was the most important thing i felt that day is we have to get back and we have to certify this election we cannot let this drift and we can't let them feel that they won by delaying the process and i was relieved when we did go back i didn't go to bed at five o'clock in the morning that day i stayed on the floor the entire time until the vote was done until the process was done i should say the certification uh then i get back to new york and you know exhausted really had a very bad night's sleep thursday night all kinds of work to do uh on friday we had a big conference called three-hour conference called the democrats about what we're going to do regarding impeachment uh and today i'm just uh i'd say i'm i i went through my anger i i've still got a touch of anger because i'm so angry at the president for his irresponsible and reprehensible behavior and the people that collaborated with him uh uh now i'm exhausted and i'm also looking ahead like what do we need to do to move forward [Music] introduction of that article of impeachment on monday is that the moving forward impeaching him uh this week is is is that your kind of plan of attack and moving forward right now that's the plan of attack i would i really would like to hear more from uh president-elect biden as to what he'd like us to do one of my colleagues at a press conference kim jeffries just said president trump is a clear and present danger so we certainly need to hold him accountable for his reprehensible behavior but now he's saying a clear and present danger this is the next 11 days it's very dangerous with him in office what if he calls on his supporters to do something like this again what if he starts pardoning people that participated in this insurrection so we have to push for resignation we have to push for the 25th amendment and if that's not it doesn't happen we need to push for impeachment because the next 11 days he's a very dangerous character and he's behaved so recklessly up until this point that we all have to be prepared to address how he will behave again when vice when president-elect biden becomes president united states of america on the 20th we can start the healing process and coming together we still know the whole need to hold people accountable we need to consider prosecution of whoever we can but we can't talk about reconciliation until we get through this very difficult time between now and the 20th and then quickly despite all of your efforts what if he's not held accountable well i'm gonna i'm gonna make sure he's held accountable i'm gonna do everything i can to hold him accountable this is this cannot stand we cannot let people in america think that this is okay to behave this way and that you're not gonna be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law now we don't all know what those answers are with the best processes and preseason we're all processing that right now but this cannot be held as being oh this is politics this is political behavior this is insurrection this is violence and this is what cannot happen in the united states of america and it can't happen for the people who watch us throughout the rest of the world so we have to do everything we can to hold him and his collaborators accountable congressman tom swazi thank you so much for your time and your point of view on this thank you fredrika

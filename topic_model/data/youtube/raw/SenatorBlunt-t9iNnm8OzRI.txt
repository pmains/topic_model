hi i'm senator roy blunt i want to take a minute to congratulate all graduates in and from missouri high school college and university graduate school people getting a certification that they wouldn't have otherwise i actually really like the whole concept of graduation you've got graduation where people are clearly finishing something another term we often use is commencement where you're starting something and the two come together in a great way i know for many of you this year for most of you this year graduation won't look like it usually does is all of us have to do our part stop the spread of coronavirus and keep you and people around you safe most of you had to finish your senior year or your final paper your final coursework in some way where you missed out on the way things normally happened a big assembly the awards assembly the high school prom the commencement ceremony itself and the other celebrations that people have people who you know who would be there if they could be there but believe me they're thinking about you no matter what this was not in anyone's plan and I hope it doesn't take away from the tremendous pride you should have at this moment your parents your grandparents your brothers or sisters in the case of some of our older graduates your spouse your children people who've watched you accomplish what you've accomplished are there with you and for you just like they were there with you and for you while you were trying to get this done all the people who've been part of your life are cheering for you thank you for the hard work you've done as you finish this chapter of your life and move to the next from graduation to commencement despite the challenges you face at this moment I hope you all move forward with excitement with determination most importantly with faith I wish you the best of luck class of 2020

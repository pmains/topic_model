so one of the things that we love together thank you for joining us there's a graph that illustrates the changes between that initial uh behavior at time one and time two and we see decreases in behaviors that were off tasks or negative behaviors such as attention seeking things like that uh over the course of the beginning of the school year to the end of the school year usually around another graph that sort of illustrates um overall problems psychiatry and we see changes in those measures as well over the course of the middle of north america so you know it's always renting for silver hair me to tell you what the research says but we also see it you know in our students day-to-day behavior report teacher report um and the students report as well that the mental health services that they're receiving school has certainly been beneficial for them and has a positive impact on their behavior but also especially if you have any questions on these issues and um i'd like to invite her up to give a bit of a welcome um just as a bit of our final speaker representatives elected in 1998. currently um management analyst for the international travel team under the office of the commissioner at the food and drug industry so much uh federal government careers for the nationals all of you especially the center for this is an ongoing thing a non-profit organization families and community partners but there's some special education resources to enrich up to the plate and have connections and dedicating to mental health awareness empowering people doing research in uh trauma to the head i mean these are things that they started over a decade ago with ucla trying to get to the bottom of these issues so but to our panelists thank you so very much to our abacus thank you for hanging in there with us to all of you who are here as you ready stay tuned we need your help we need you to be able to carry the message whether it's to your offices uh to the constituency

connect people to where they can get assistance to be able to deal with these things and i know people call me i direct them to people and somehow this needs to be uh moving forward so that those people can advocate for the reduction of stigma and the funding to be able to do the things that we need done especially for mental health in schools actually okay ciao um please if you can wear the lime i realized that i was going to need to tell people do not be afraid to speak up that's possible to help me matter for my child before anything else i was very concerned about on my bill 12 11 most of you know you can just pick it up and you go to my website we're introducing it we now have two republican members that are smart enough and brave enough to maintain the value of gibson and return uh it's successful going so far there are no attempted suicides or suicide prevention i had no idea the children in school clinicians ever we must start their learning earlier as they grow into productive adults your involvement we need to network so please network with the people around you uh learn the warning signs the extreme changes in behavior the verbal approach etc uh we must continue to educate our general public especially parents to be able to seek help um the national crisis hotline is 1-800 273 talk or 8255. it's a 24-hour competition hotline and assist veterans now you have a package that do you have any questions please don't hesitate i'm not sure because you need to hear from the folks up here so thank you very much god bless you for attending in most cases the children cannot educate themselves so we become their advocates and for those of us who serve doors without any further ado we'll move on to our speakers because they're sharing our their expertise with us my friends i'd like to hear from you um who was appointed in august 2011 as the principal deputy administrator for samsung guidance um leads in this capacity ms serves as my friend the principal advisor to the administrator on policies and programmatic activities um with more than 600 employees and a fiscal year budget of approximately three point five million schools this motto brings 23 years of experience in the behavioral health field 15 of which have been in federal services i'll just wait a minute i'm sorry the two representatives seemed to have come out of nowhere they showed up as if they had been there from the start uh i don't like bios either but i don't quite have the gravity for congresswoman napolitano as you all know the teenage years are already challenging enough you know just such a great perspective this is the time when we need it to include how often we at sam says the administration administrators why they have the instructions do chores or adhere to a simple bedtime thanks to the mental health services being offered and recently i'm not here to lobby i just like to educate their members about the importance of these programs in the class yes program was there to provide and by paying attention to children's mental health we will save money i think that that's one of the bottom line counseling process also save lives um but also the organizers and the sponsors of this event the promotion of mental health of resilience who work on communications case management which is the one that's so important to me we've been at this event before right information regularly and we hope that everyone is in our iep um are telling us they provided support for me and my americans the school based any given mental health services are a tremendous asset to youth and they're not here that is my school eight percent that all families wouldn't want to live next we'll have access to these services all they need to do is look around this will ensure that no child is the americans will be no child to find that they may be married a family member with a mental illness or different or that they're special in that you know they're very fundamental to our success in life and they're not something to put away we don't we don't shy away from people with diabetes we don't shy we really like to thank all of our stylists if you have a question feel free to raise your hand you may have one out of ten one in ten adolescents suffered from a major depressive episode last year represented one in 10. and how many do you think got treatment some of you know how many who knows less than half 38 only 38 percent of kids got treatment and depression is a life-threatening condition we know that and with any other life-threatening condition we find it acceptable that only 30 actually have a section on our website i believe that talks about and so we need to get this message out and then that will lead you to create a so we at samsa are very familiar with the incredible resources out there that tells us that early intervention can see on our grounds available in mental health at in schools in colleges and universities it works it works and we can do this for many years for over a dozen years with the support of congress samsa has funded the safe schools healthy students program where we have uh put over two billion dollars into local educational agencies as well as the most recently state educational agencies to foster five major components of a program which have been documented by the institute of medicine safe school environments and violence prevention activities alcohol and other drug prevention activities student behavioral social and emotional supports mental health services and early childhood social and emotional learning programs and these sure yes we work very closely with you know what we have found is that you know certainly there are so many students who have such a wide range of the number of students issues and concerns you know we find that the school psychologist while they are there and available to provide treatment are often very busy with assessments and um 43 percent and iep meetings and all the other things they need to do so they're not as available to provide the direct um counseling and support services similarly with guidance counselors you know they're also available to to be able to counsel students but you know they have schedules you know meetings and lots of other things that are also on their plate so they're not able to be as dedicated to only providing those therapeutic services and supports as our school-based mental health staff are but we certainly work in very close collaboration with them they often make resources as in terms of students that might need more support or need more assistance we certainly talk a lot with the teachers our staff provide an enormous amount of teacher consultation so helping the teachers you know once we only see students for a limited amount of time and then they're going back to their classroom so helping the teachers understand you know how to really help the best support those students based on whatever issues or disabilities they might have and to really help support them in the classroom as well in terms of implementing some of the strategies that can help them be successful the president proposed funding for programs to protect our children and our communities by increasing access to mental health services with the project aware that i mentioned we've funded 20 state educational authorities at about two million dollars per year for five years to develop the necessary systems in their state school districts again using three pilot school districts or leaas because we have this model that worked with 12 2 billion dollars and 12 years no state was doing safe schools healthy students statewide even though we had the results even though we had the data and so that's why the president has put his support behind project aware we also have a hundred project aware local educational agency grants which is for schools to and school districts to work with their communities with parents with youth to promote mental health first aid and youth mental health for state to increase behavioral health literacy so people know the signs people can detect these things early and we know that early intervention is very important we're of course working hand in glove with the department of education and the department of justice with their now as the time programs because we know that all of these systems have to work together because kids don't live in a vacuum they don't just live in our families they live in ecologies and we have to partner at the federal level with all of those agencies that have a role in fostering a positive ecology for every child another place where now as the time is emphasized and where stamps is really proud of our work is in healthy transitions that's a new program that we got in 2014 and that is fostering connections for those kids that are 18 to 25 or 16 to 25 as they're at that very precarious stage of life not only do we know that half of all mental disorders show up by the age of 14 and three quarters by the age of 24 so there are some kids that are first experiencing the signs of illness at this very delicate time we also know that kids who are in youth serving systems and are already being served have challenges as they make that transition to the adult serving systems and the data with our programs department of education for community navigation development disabilities with the 20 million we have for ourselves and we recognize that kids with behavioral health problems also many of them have another effort that's emotionally whatever we already know about us are very successful so our social care programs our children health initiatives in terms of kids up to the age of 21 and their families with serious emotional disturbances many of them have multiple this program has had an impact on millions of our sampson programs with respect to college campuses tribes and territories about everyone who is touching child welfare step everyone who's just have to understand what is the kind of name that they say all the things that they are around what do you need to be on the lookout for the very holistic approach we also wanted to take to the tribes and so we've had our circles of care program i want to add as well mental health recently um partnered with a few different organizations but they recently developed a series of online training modules and one actually focuses on personal occurring disorders um and it's free anybody can can log on and take it um so if you go to the center's website there should be a link to that as well i think it's maryland behavioral health online we've seen incredible tribal communities mobilizing and developing tools necessary to plan for the particular needs of their young people as we move early on the trajectory samps is really proud to have supported the good behavior game this is a program often done in first and second grades where we do it's a universal evidence-based preventive practice where we've seen um great progress we've done some grants to some schools that had at least 50 free and reduced lunches and these programs address early aggressive and disruptive behavior which is a powerful risk factor for later emotional distress and we've seen reductions in the aggressive and disruptive behavior in the young kids but then following them over time children who participate in the good behavior game in first and second grade have less juvenile justice involvement they have better school completion rates i think that certainly is an important point you know one of the things i always talk to to parents and teachers about is that you know it needs to be a collaborative effort we can't um solve all of these problems by ourselves and so you know we do need the the families on board and engaged we need the school staff engaged and sometimes you know due to a lot of other issues it's hard for people um you know sometimes it's hard for us to what i usually say kind of play nicely together in the sandbox you know sometimes we have competing agendas but it's important to you know always bring back the focus to to the students and you know together we can certainly do more than we can in isolation but i think it's just important to really get that message across that um it really does require you know the whole village and the whole community to work together um you know that's where we really see the the programs that have the most success when we are able to partner with families and partner with community agencies and in the schools work in isolation sometimes you may see programs that may sort of set up shop in a school and they're in a corner and office but they're not at all engaged in the larger school community and and engage in what's happening in the school um and so it really is important it makes a huge difference when you do have those collaborative partners and collaborative relationships primary care follow-ups where you do uh really aggressive screening and intervention for some of the really high risk factors in middle age populations as you know there's nothing that samson does and we don't have the resources suicide prevention in general it should be culturally competent it should be evidence-based something that we're really looking forward to is another tribal initiative disability have the lowest rate so very hard to concentrate in school anyone so if you've got so many to bring obviously the schools are sometimes hard to sample is partnering with against our bie with ihs and our other colleagues across the department and then you know once you get to medicaid and housing i mean um gets that one and finally as i mentioned i'm the table and say this is the 10th anniversary of children's mental health awareness central these issues and so we do hope that airlines will join us on may 7th we're excited we have marriages for them you know they're all busy so how do we get them to have the bandwidth for that thank you please let us know if samson can be helpful in the future and so our next speaker will be jill diamond um jill diamond is the chair of world blockchain cares a program that reaches out to impoverished children in 164 countries her journey send her across the globe as an official and supervisor of the championship bouts and as an ambassador to ver for various charitable programs miss diamond's commitment was recognized with the boxing humanitarian ward wbc's women of the year new york city's pal 911 award and was acknowledged by the california legislature for her work with women athletes in addition jill writes for several media outlets and i will stop the biography now so there certainly are programs that are doing that collaboration hello everyone quite well i'm probably the least qualified person here to talk about this but my quali my qualification comes from life experience i would say i grew up in a home where my much older brother was quite ill he was handsome he was smart he was funny and then he went off to college and a month later he came back and that was the beginning of the journey for us the lucky part was that he never heard anyone outside of the home and today many many years later he is taken care of in a very wonderful facility where he's safe and that's considered a success story i don't consider that a success story this is 40 years later and still many children would rather kill themselves than come forward and risk the shame of rejection and stigmatization because they won't ask for help this has to stop we can cure everyone but we can change our perspective about this illness so at the world boxing council which seems like an unlikely organization to get involved in mental health awareness it completely isn't many of our boxers many of our athletes come from very disadvantaged backgrounds they've dealt with poverty they've they're very damaged people some of them and they see boxing as a way to elevate their lives to become normal whatever normal means to get you know reward from their sport and so what we do in addition to boxing is we travel through countries youth centers hospitals our boxers go in and they tell their stories and the children really respond to them particularly boxers that come from their area they tell them if i can make it you can make it when i get hit and i fall down i get up you can get up they are very fragile people outside of the ring and they are very open and willing to share their experiences and i think that it's very inspirational to the people that we come and visit so out of respect and support to grace we are honoring the month of may this year also we will be wearing the green ribbons at every fight including the fight that's happening this saturday mayweather and pacquiao we dedicate our month to mental health awareness in hopes of knocking out the stigma thank you and our next speaker will be dr dana cunningham dana graduated from southern illinois university at carbondale with a doctoral degree in clinical psychology in 2004 following the completion of her internship at the university of maryland medical system maryland veterans administration consortium she completed a postdoc at the center for school mental health currently dr cunningham is the coordinator for the prince george's met school mental health initiative and i'm not even going to attempt that acronym thank you good afternoon and thank you for inviting me here today it's a pleasure to be here uh and i think you have a copy of my powerpoint slides in your green folders so i'm here today to talk just briefly about school mental health and the value and importance of school mental health services the title of my presentation is about increasing access and improving outcomes and i believe that by providing schoolman health services that we can improve access for mental health for youth to receive those services and also to improve outcomes for them just to give everybody a clear definition about what school mental health is or what it looks like there's some key components to mental health that's when it's implemented well we usually see a partnership between the schools and the communities that is undergirded by families and youth and making sure that their voices are a part of the work that we're doing we see that school mental health programs really build on existing partnerships that are already taking place in the school so it's not our intention to come in and take over the role of a school psychologist or school social worker but to really help support what's already taking place in the school environment the goal is to really focus on all students not just a subset of students so all students can benefit from mental health services that are based in the school so there's really a full array of services that can be provided in a school setting from school mental health promotion for for instance you might have a broad school-based bullying prevention program that all students all staff members would participate in there might be a subset of students who might need more specialized attention and treatment so perhaps maybe a group of students who may be at risk for substance abuse disorder a group of students who maybe have been exposed to trauma can receive more of what we call secondary level of prevention and then there might be a smaller subset of students who might need more individualized treatment because they are at risk for significant challenges so why are schools an optimal place to provide these services one of the things i think connor kind of probably provided a very good overview about the importance of school and health services is because we know that the onset of mental illness many mental illnesses begin in childhood many of them before the age of 18. so if those illnesses go on untreated there's a significant cost to that and so as we know there's you know as was mentioned earlier there's about one in every five students have some sort of mental health illness and about one in five i'm sorry one in ten are really impacted by a significant impairment but the reality is that many of those youth are not receiving services the good news is that we know that youth that do receive services overwhelming majority of them are able to receive those services in the school environment so there's research that shows over 75 percent of students are actually receiving mental health services in the school setting we know that there are some barriers to receiving mental health care in a traditional outpatient setting i certainly don't have to go over all those with you but you know certainly things like stigma or or insurance are barriers transportation past experiences with with mental health agencies that have not been positive sometimes steer people away from seeking those services in a community setting we know that traditionally in many outpatient settings it's on for in some instances people after they make their first appointment don't even show up to that first appointment and beyond that uh the most frequent number of times that people actually go to an outpatient it's really wonderful an inspirational health center for services is one so you're so they may go with that first appointment that is why schools provide i believe a really optimal place of providing those services for one yes students are certainly there and it's easy to access them but addition in addition to that there's also the ability to reduce the stigma of seeking mental health services because the counselors are based there in the school students can see their friends going to see a counselor and it's not i've had students bring students in to come see me and talk to me because they feel that it's a safe place to be as a good place to receive services so it's definitely less threatening we heard earlier about some of the statistics with depression and suicide i think being present in a school environment allows you that opportunity to see those students who might be isolated to see that student who sits in the back of the the classroom with their head on their desk and is not really engaged often times in schools the students that we typically get our attention are those that are making a lot of noise when we're based in the school setting it's definitely much easier to also reach out to those students who might be suffering some of those internalizing disorders such as depression or child or youth so if i had to sum all of that up in terms of the advantages i would say that when students have their social emotional behavioral needs addressed through wellness prevention and intervention there are fewer barriers to learning and more time for productive classroom instruction and we see that there's really you know some people have concerns about the impact of school on academics and say well maybe that will take time away from a student's learning time but we know that if students mental health needs aren't addressed they're going to have difficulty learning and difficulty performing well in school and we do also know through lots of research that's been done about the positive impacts of providing mental health services and some of those the ability of school health services to reduce some of those non-academic barriers to learning so we see that students are more engaged in school that they can perform better academically that we see less fewer students going out to participate in more restrictive school placements so in overall improving academic outcomes decreased dropout rates so there are lots of positive advantages of receiving schoolman health services and actually the center for school mental health where i work is dedicated to improving the advancement of school mental health practice and policy and on their home page that's listed there if you can see it on your handouts but it's csmh.umaryland.edu but on their homepage there is a link to a whole list of academic outcomes and impact of school and health services and other positive outcomes if you want to look at that we know as well that school health certainly reduces long-term costs if we think about you know the cost of you know i said earlier we talked earlier about the number of students who exhibit mental health illnesses in adolescence and prior to the age of 18. so if those students go on and become adults and have mental health problems that are not treated what is the impact of that going to be on our workforce on the justice system on the health care system so if we don't treat those problems early long term that certainly is going to be quite costly in terms of dealing with those issues in the future within our program we have had an opportunity i've kind of told you what the research has said about the benefits of school mental health but we've also have simply asked the families and students you know what do you think how have these services benefited you and some of the things we hear family members have said or that you know therapists are always available a grandparent said that her daughter was less angry a case manager helped her get back on her feet so so families are able to certainly see the benefit and similarly when we ask youth they report positive experiences as well you know that they appreciate having somebody right there they can get their feelings off their chest one person noted that it's free and that was from a young student who actually had experienced the challenges he saw his mother um having difficulty paying for the insurance co-pay so he was very happy to see that you know there was a service that was available there in the school that didn't require a cost so just to tell you very briefly about our program again at the french georgia school of health initiatives the founding partners right across the world members here helping us organize this wonderful and we're based in french county maryland and we really have a great collaboration between the prince george's county department of special education maryland state department of education and putting on this briefing the university of maryland baltimore and the purpose of our program is to really provide more intensive services and supports to students who are at risk of being removed from their homeschool places to really focus on that population of students but we also do a lot to really help enhance staff training and self-competency um provide some training and family outreach as well we provide individual therapy group therapy prevention activities really the whole range of mental health services that you could receive in the community we provide them there in the school we also actually have a psychiatrist who provides consultation services as well so it's a very comprehensive program in terms of the students that we see as i mentioned we really focus on students with disabilities but we also have had a wonderful partnership over the last couple years with some of the local graduate school programs and so they also provide services to students who are in general education as well so we really are able to serve a broad range of students and you also i'm not sure how well you can see this in your handouts but we've also done some research over the last couple years with our our students who've been involved in our program and one of the things that we do is is observations of students behavior at the beginning of the school year and at the end of the school year um and and try to look for areas of change

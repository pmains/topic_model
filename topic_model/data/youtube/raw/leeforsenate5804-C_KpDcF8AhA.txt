one of the one of the things our dad taught us from when we were very young was it's important to hear the other side and our dad was this high-powered attorney but he said listen you gotta you gotta understand the other side as well as you understand your own side and I think that's one of the things is I watched my brother Michael in action um he cares and he listens and even if if he thinks he has the right answer he's always open to to listening to somebody else he's always been that way our dad taught us that I think that's one of the things rexley would be most proud about Michael Lee the man and the senator and because he's the son that's doing the job I think in the way our dad would have wanted him to do he's doing it in a way that's committed to the document that our dad spent his career advancing and and cementing I would say this Mike Lee would be my favorite Senator if he weren't my brother there is not anybody who I respect more in terms of the way he approaches the job of the United States Senate the way he treats his colleagues the way he treats all of the people that he works with the fact that he's also my brother just gives me such pride and and joy and love for him my late father he died 26 years ago he taught me to love the Constitution and taught me the basics of it from the time I was very young he taught me to Revere it I promise that I'm committed to keep it's a constitutional promise it's one that recognizes that a smaller government is a greater America that's what was promised to you by the founders we honor the Constitution of the United States of America Mike Lee for Senate I'm Mike Lee and I approve this message he goes out of his way to help people I've had sons nephews former students of mine always come back to me and your brother has been such a big help to me and such a big sport to me and he's done that for all of us and it's been really fun to see him do that for so many other people it doesn't matter where Michael is it doesn't matter the company he's in who he's with he's the same always he he's a man of integrity he's not going to change his core beliefs that's just not who he is I know people know Michael politically and they know his views and how hard he works I wish everybody could know his heart he has the best heart of anybody I know he's the kindest person of anybody I know and that consistency of character has been with him forever since childhood so I wouldn't expect him to change just because he's in Washington there is a consistency of character of being able to remember what he believes in and stand for what he believes in in the halls of Congress few have the courage to stand up and say no more to run away spending to big government to the assault on our constitution in Washington Mike Lee often stands alone because he's standing with us back home when government threatens your freedoms I fight back every time I'm Mike Lee and I approve this message because standing with you is what I've always done and always will do standing for us our Senator Mike Lee welcome and thank you for tuning into this series of conversations about issues affecting our livelihoods our homes and our families today we're discussing inflation too many dollars chasing too few goods thanks to government spending gas prices have been rising dramatically since President Biden took office the day he was sworn in gas in the United States was averaging two dollars and 39 cents per gallon today we're paying far more than that thanks to the inflation that Democrat policies have inflicted on us filling a cart with groceries to feed a family is getting harder and harder it's no longer a question of deciding which luxury items to forego parents and families are now having to decide which basic Staples they're going to live without these catastrophic Biden policies aren't limited to just when it's time to fill the gas tank or the grocery cart it's now harder than ever for families even to secure housing what was once an integral part of the American dream is now more of a pipe dream there are effective conservative policies ready to be implemented to combat these punishing liberal problems election day is not that far away if we're going to win the war on inflation and make life affordable again we must retake the Senate and the house we have a good shot at doing so but casting conservative votes is the key in Utah we're bearing more than our fair share of the burden of inflation I'm the ranking member of The Joint economic committee my team of economists tracked the impact of inflation on various States we see the rising costs of gas groceries and housing Across the Nation do you know what else we see and we see that in Utah families are being hit the hardest harder than pretty much anywhere else thanks to Democrat policies in the Biden Administration life in Utah for the average Utah family is costing an extra 925 dollars per month every single month as compared to the day Joe Biden took office that is completely unacceptable and by the way we track that data with respect to every state in the Union and there's no state that's been hit harder than Utah joining me tonight to discuss exactly what President Biden's inflation looks like in Utah and what Republicans can do to stop it is Utah Governor Spencer Cox Governor Cox thank you so much for your support and welcome to this conversation Governor tell me what uh what are you hearing from constituents throughout the state of Utah and and what do you tell them when it comes to issues they're facing regarding inflation well Senator I'm hearing the same thing I I know that you're hearing and that is uh people are incredibly frustrated with what they're what they're seeing um of course as they uh as as they see inflation going up and and understand that wages are not keeping Pace with that severe inflation uh well north of 10 here in Utah um some of the highest unfortunately in the country um they're they're they're very angry they're upset um and and they're struggling I you know for for many of us we're fortunate that we don't have to count pennies anymore but I I remember going to the grocery store with my wife as a young married couple and taking a calculator with us every time we went to the grocery store and that's the case for far too many utahns and so as as those prices go up there are real impacts if you have to choose between groceries and gasoline um that's that's a real choice that has negative impacts and so there's certainly a tremendous amount of frustration on the ground here in Utah yeah there certainly is and you know when when you measure that inflation that we're experiencing in Utah relative to the day President Biden took office it's over 15 percent and that's just a just stunning what we're seeing so Governor when you take stock of the of the inflation hardships that utahns seem to be facing how easy is it for us to walk away from that uh versus how easy is it for us to see the connection uh between Democratic Leadership in Washington and the uh the cause of the inflation sure look I I I'm I understand that there are multiple causes to to the inflation and and some of them of course the the war in Russia uh Russia and Ukraine uh has has a role to play in that but we we know this is quantifiable in fact uh even even Democratic economists um have have have have verified this I mean even even the the FED has verified that policy choices and decisions made by this Administration have significantly increased inflation in the United States and right here in Utah um there's a direct line I mean the president himself talked about how it was important to raise the cost of of energy so that we could we could get away from fossil fuels um that's that's a terrible policy especially at a time when uh when when there is a war happening in in Ukraine and Russia when so much of the world is dependent on um on on a on a terrible dictator light like Putin for their oil and gas when when we know as a country we have the ability not just to be self-sufficient but to be an exporter of energy to the world um and it's again it's the people of the margins that get hurt the most by by these decisions and it's not just that it's it's of course the Reckless spending um we know as we're coming out of a pandemic um there's always going to be an increase in demand before Supply catches up but but what has happened uh there's been fuel poured on this fire by this Administration um with with so many so many different uh policy choices bills that they've passed that have have increased the the budget spending and uh and it just it just poured fuel on this Raging Fire and so you know it's it's not partisan to say that this Administration has significantly impacted the um the the rate of inflation um that that has been it has been Quantified it has been verified and it is a fact that uh that that the Democrats are making things far worse than they need to be and by the way when when called on this um we hear things like oh it's really not that bad or everyone should just buy an electric vehicle um there's a disconnect happening between Washington DC and and and real people here on the ground and the struggles that they're facing and so it's it's been deeply disappointing and uh and again I know you you get to see it firsthand almost every day yeah no that's that's exactly right and and you're also correct to point out it's not partisan to observe that it's their policies it's their policies that have done it the problem is that all Democrats have supported the president in those policies at least the Democrats have served in Washington D.C now and by the way again it's by Design I mean I it's it's you know we we this is this is really simple stuff um it's econ 101 it's it's just supply and demand and uh and and we've been warning about this for years and years and years and now we're seeing it play out right in front of us and 8. you know one of the more common comments that I hear from utahns as it relates to inflation sometimes relates to housing there aren't that many single-family homes for sale and those that are for sale or often way too expensive there are a lot of people who fear home ownership is is just no longer part of the American dream and now I don't I don't agree with that I think there are ways to make sure that utahns can feel the pride and security of home ownership I've got proposals before Congress right now to address that specific issue one of them is called the houses act basically it would make certain portions of Bureau of Land Management managed land available for the building of more homes more single family homes uh Governor from your own position how hard has inflation hit those specifically looking to own their own home for the first time well it's it's really interesting Senator um this is one area where Utah is not proud to be a leader in the nation in the rising uh cost of of of homes here here in in Utah not just along the Wasatch Front but really all across the state um the the the silver lining of good news is that because we had the right policies and during covet and Utah has been recognized as the best state um for to to combat covet um and and to improve the economy we were the best state to get kids back in school um what that did was it attracted people from all over the country who were leaving blue states where there were terrible policies around covet and they're coming where we had a strong economy where where schools were open where people could work um and and they came here so that has significantly increased the demand for housing and we're the fastest growing State anyway um we have the highest birth rates over the last 10 years and and it's just a wonderful place to live and so uh our housing has not kept up with that and that's one area where we can as a state really make a difference unlike some of the others like energy and The Reckless spending in Washington D.C um and so this is something we're committed to we're working closely with the legislature um to increase the supply to lower the barriers to get into Home Ownership I'm with you I absolutely believe that that we need to keep the American dream alive and part of that American dream is homeownership we're going to do everything possible uh to to uh to to make that dream stay alive here in Utah but you you mentioned something so very important and I appreciate that and and I love your leadership on the houses act um because we we fight about uh public lands here in the state of Utah we just filed a lawsuit um a few weeks ago uh challenging the the president's decision uh with the signing of a pen his his ability to make these these giant national parks but but people often think that that federal land ownership almost two-thirds of Utah is owned by the federal government is all outside in international parks and these other areas and and that's not true there are parts inside of of our city limits or just outside our city limits that where the federal government does own property and what you're doing is something that needs to happen not just here but again across the country because this is a this is a problem being faced everywhere in every single state right now the The increased cost of of building and of homes and so I I think it's brilliant um we're here to support you any way we can to make sure that we have the opportunity to use that federal land to build homes and that's going to decrease again it's simple supply and demand as we increase the supply um the price will go down oh thank you that's a great answer and I really appreciate your insights our our time together uh um this program tonight has come to an end Governor I'm so grateful uh to you uh for your support and for your friendship we've covered a lot of ground uh in these few minutes but there's uh there's always more we could discuss and uh really appreciate you joining us thank you Senator um I I just want to say um I I too appreciate your friendship I'm grateful for your leadership in these difficult times and I look forward to working closely with you as we work on these issues together thank you so much now if you have any questions about any of the inflation topics that we've covered tonight or if you'd like to send questions or comments or ideas please visit my campaign website at leaveforcentate.com I'm commissioner Mark Whitney Beaver County Tracy Glover I'm the Kane County Sheriff Leland F pawlik Garfield County Commissioner my name is Bruce Adams I'm a San Juan County Commissioner my name is Tammy Pearson I'm a commissioner in Beaver County I think Senator Lee understands the needs of public land counties small counties there's vast legal knowledge of Western issues and public lands issues is what draws me to endorse and support him Federal public land in Garfield County makes up 93 percent of my county and it can be a nightmare if we don't have representation in Washington D.C and someone fighting the good battle for us and Mike Lee has always been there he has been a champion especially for Rural Utah and Utah as a whole on representing our values and representing the Constitution he's a fighter he's the conservative voice for us in DC in the Senate and he's done a remarkable job [Music] Mike Lee is our guidepost to the Constitution as you know he clerked at the United States Supreme Court and he continues to be a daily student of the United States Constitution people will actually approach Mike Lee on the floor of the Senate to ask him his opinion about what the Constitution would direct us to do with regard to constitutional rights of all kinds my name is Eliza I am Mike Lee's youngest child and only daughter so I'm the obvious favorite child and I wholeheartedly endorse him he is the most wonderful person I know he's a wonderful Senator because he is an incredible dad [Music] I'm so honored to be joined by my friend Ronald McDaniel Ronna has served as the chair of the Republican National Committee since 2017. under her leadership the RNC has raised record funds and and made its largest ever ground game Investments Rona previously served as the chair of the Michigan Republican party and you know she's a hero she's an icon she's a Bastion for the conservative movement now Rana welcome to the conversation and thanks so much for joining us tonight thank you Mike thanks for that great introduction I'm so happy to be with you and thanks for all that you do for our country in the Senate and serving the great state of Utah yeah thank you you know well it's an important time to be serving because there's a lot that people are dealing with all over the country you know inflation is crippling American families it's hitting them especially hard in Utah how important is it in your opinion Ron for Republicans to win back control of Congress how important that is that specifically to the to the objective of getting inflation under control you know Mike I say this all the time that inflation didn't just happen it is a direct result of policies being put forward by democrats policies like getting rid of our energy Independence and over stimulating the economy and paying people to stay out of the workplace so that employers had to pay people so much more to work and then they pass those increases onto the customer I know it we feel it I have a daughter in School in Utah she's calling me all the time about gas prices and Mom it's so hard um and we feel it every day as parents every time I go to the grocery store with eggs and milk and not just that insurance prices are rising rent prices are rising I know there's a housing issue my daughter's friend at Utah State didn't even have an apartment when she started school this year because there's such a housing crunch so the fact that you're the senator from Utah and you understand these problems is so instrumental in why we need Common Sense concern observative fiscal policy in Washington I just want to remind people that the person you're running against um still has a seven hundred thousand dollar debt for his failed presidential run um and I just don't think that's the type of leadership that's going to help solve the inflation crisis in this country yeah of course the Democrats like him and that's why they've endorsed him and why they're supporting them from all over the country and that's also why we're going to beat him you know the Democrats uh make a lot of mistakes and they're making all of this worse they of course recently passed their their bill this ironically uh named inflation reduction act and you know they did this without a single Republican vote and without a a hint of an acknowledgment on their part of how I ironic and deeply disturbing it was that they were enacting a piece of legislation that suspends three quarters of a trillion dollars that we don't have and calling it the inflation reduction Act Meanwhile my colleague Bernie Sanders you know the the most liberal among uh Ultra liberal Democrats he acknowledged that the bill itself would do basically nothing to reduce inflation now look we we never experienced inflation anything like this under the Trump Pence Administration so I how exactly do you think Americans will benefit and now by electing a republican majority in November in so many ways and and again I go back to the Democrats control everything the White House the Senate the house and I think your opponent would have absolutely been part of this uh Bill and would have supported the Democrats because he's their nominee in Utah he's going to pretend that he's not but he's their nominee I call him Evan dim Mullen but the reality is Republicans when we take back the Senate we are going to restore Common Sense fiscal policy and you know you you can tell what a party stands for by their priorities and we're seeing the Democrat priorities through their legislation so no this didn't reduce inflation um but what it did do is say we're going to fund 87 000 IRS agents we're going to pay off student loans for people who've already graduated from college instead of saying how do we fix our crime crisis across this country how do we figure out the drug crisis that's coming that's impacting our kids how do we solve the problems for kids who are having deficits we know nine-year-olds are now reading and doing math at a 30-year low coming out of the pandemic so they didn't fund ways to help parents whose kids are suffering they didn't fund more police instead they put money into more government control so Republicans will change that and we will because we're running on it we're running on Common Sense Solutions and we're going to make sure that we're actually putting the American people first instead of our party first and right now the Democrats are only concerned about power in their party and I guarantee you your opponent would have been a vote for this insane um act that has just reaped more damage on average hard-working Americans yeah I'm quite confident uh you're you're right on that yeah and and almost everything else is of that matter but you're almost certainly right in concluding that he would have voted for it I asked him on social media whether he would have supported it and uh all he would say was that he would uh that he likes parts of it and that he would work if he were in office to get the best deal possible now um every Republican literally every Republican the the the most moderate middle of the road Republican in the United States Senate was strongly against this the fact that he wouldn't acknowledge the need to vote against it and the fact that all he did say about it was praise the the specific Provisions were just praise tells us everything we know we everything we need to know about the fact that he would have voted for it now Ron you and I share the same faith and something that's important to me that I know is also really important to you is uh the need to protect religious liberty what do you think's at stake for Religious Freedom in America uh that's that's relevant to this midterm election uh Mike we we've talked about this before first of all just so it's so fun to talk to you we've become very good friends since I've been in DC you were my class president when I was at BYU uh I never thought I'd meet you as a senator my daughter's now at BYU and you've been such a help for me as we've had family away from Michigan where I live and my son just got accepted to Utah State so um you're not just a man of Faith you're a man who um exemplifies Faith because you've always been there to serve me and my family um when we have our daughter far away you've reached out and said if she needs dinner so just let me just share that that's one of the things I love about about you um that goes Way Beyond being a senator you're just a good person but faith is is at stake and when you look at the Democrat Party right now they don't uphold Faith whether it's any religion um from the Jewish faith to Catholicism to our faith um it's deeply deeply concerning um and I think that if people don't realize that that's at stake and I know sometimes it's uncomfortable to talk about politics and it you don't want to get in The Fray because it's so vitriolic but when you know that your faith is under attack and when you know that we stand for things that are so good um it's hard to sit back and act like it's just gonna be okay because trust me there is no reverence for Faith coming from the Democrat Party right now and in fact um I think they're moving towards removing tax exemption if we don't abide by their view of America and the view of what we should be as a religion and they're going to do that across the board so it's absolutely on the ballot this fall yeah I'm glad you raised that about the tax-exempt status of religious institutions it really is troubling we've seen this coming for years but we've seen it coming from Democrats in Congress in both houses of Congress and in the White House aggressive moves but that and less stop will culminate in threatening to remove and ultimately removing the tax exempt status from religious institutions that happen to Harbor unfavorable or on uh unpopular religious views now the First Amendment uh is supposed to protect us against that the the fact that we're even faced with this Prospect is very uncomfortable and all the more reason why we need legislation affirmatively prohibiting the denial of tax-exempt status for religious institutions along the lines of what is being threatened you know our our border with Mexico is also something that troubles me it's um we got a crisis that is unparalleled in modern history I I don't think we've ever seen that in our entire history as a country uh the the crisis along the southern border is just absolutely insane right now now under Republican leadership we made some amazing strides towards actually securing our border in fact uh we achieved a degree of border security that I'm not sure we had seen in decades how in your view has the Biden Administration unraveled those gains gains won so many ways in so many ways Mike and you know you and I know we're we're we love um immigration we love people who come to our country illegally uh many of us come from families that did that right but this um this open border policy isn't Humane for the people making this dangerous Crossing who are having to pay coyotes whose children are being trafficked um and they're being put In Harm's Way and it's certainly not good for the communities that are being inundated um and what Trump did and this is just a policy that he created called remain in Mexico he said if you're seeking asylum in the United States of America while we're adjudicating your case you're going to remain in Mexico what Biden is that is no you're going to come in into the country we will we will just release you and we'll help you show up for your court date and many of these families get lost and many of the children are getting lost and trafficked and the news media is ignoring some just truly horrific stories about what's happening in our border but I'll just give you one statistic which is just alarming to me on the fentanyl crisis China is pumping fentanyl through Mexico Mexico cartels are bringing it in through our Southern border just in August just last month 2 000 pounds of Sentinel fentanyl was seized enough to kill 500 million Americans and as we're approaching Halloween um they have created this rainbow candy colored fentanyl to look like candy and even Chuck Schumer so this is bipartisan just at a press conference on this on this last weekend showing sweethearts candy and this Fentanyl and how similar they look they literally are poisoning our children and they're bringing this across our Southern border and this is fixable and you know how we know it because we did it and so again you're running against somebody who is in lockstep with the Democrat agenda and I just don't know how it's Humane or or even good for anybody that we have this open border um and it's bringing crime and other things and it's not good for people who are coming here you want to come here legally because we should have a pathway for legal citizenship we love that my sister-in-law is from Colombia she's a legal citizen the RNC is now doing citizen initiatives where we're actually tutting tutoring people who um have qualified for citizenship and we're helping them pass their citizenship test we love those stories that's that's the greatness of America but coming in through the darkness of night and having to hide is no way to live and having to pay people to smuggle you across our Southern border is is no way to survive and that's what the Democrat Party is promoting right now that's right and they're promoting in the name of compassion under the guise of compassion something that is not compassionate it's oppressive uh you know I I spent uh two years of my life on our Southern border with Mexico in the southern Rio Grande Valley of Texas in neighborhoods where nobody spoke English they were inhabited almost entirely by recent immigrants and what I found there is that contrary to what a lot of people think they know about the border and about recent immigrants there's no group of people in America I believe that that are more fearful of uncontrolled waves of illegal immigration then recent immigrants themselves particularly those living on or near a border it's their jobs it's their neighborhoods it's their children's schools it's their families that are threatened by uncontrolled waves of illegal immigration and so what the Democrats are doing is really good for the drug cartels who make billions off of this human trafficking operation they have but it's really bad for recent immigrants in America it's really bad for those coming up through the Caravans most of the girls and the women are subjected uh to sexual assault many of them are become subjected to the human sex trafficking along the way this is a horrible oppressive practice and as you point out it's um it's also uh the Caravan system that's bringing in all this fentanyl fentanyl that has the ability to kill so many Americans it's absolutely frightening they've weaponized fentanyl and I would just add it really quick is two of our congressional candidates in Texas right now Monica De La Cruz and Myra Flores Myra Flores was the first Mexican American woman to serve in Congress he's a republican um they they serve on the border the Rio Grande Valley their husbands are border patrol agents and if you talk to them they will share their stories about inhumanesses and I hope people go look up what's happening and the kids that are dying there's a nurse who was just putting out that um of the 11 fatalities they had in their er um six of them were kids under 15 dying from this fentanyl we are killing our children and there's a silence coming from the Democrat Party I certainly don't hear your opponent talking about it no um every mom in America right now is afraid every time my son goes to a party or football game right now I'm talking to him about hey don't touch anything don't oh don't look at a pill or don't you know it's so frightening and we have a government that can stop it and they're choosing not to and that's what's even more upsetting yeah that's a great point and and you're also right that the Democrats aren't talking about it you're also right that my opponent isn't talking about in fact my opponent after criticizing everything Republicans do everything Donald Trump ever did also claims that he doesn't intend to he that he absolutely will not caucus with Republicans and then uh as people have asked him about it he said well I I I don't really intend to caucus with either party I don't really buy that because you can't get committee assignments without caucusing nobody doesn't caucus anyone who does try it ends up becoming a de facto member of the democratic caucus and and that is especially true in his case where he is the Democratic candidate in this race having been endorsed by the Democratic party he's raised money through the Democrats he voted for Joe Biden he encouraged other people to vote for Joe Budden but tell me how how would an independent who as acknowledged up front that he absolutely will not caucus with Republicans ah how would that person interact in Congress and if in theory he did refuse to caucus with either party how might that affect the direction of our country you know first of all you'd be totally ineffective if you're not caucusing and like you mentioned Mike you're not going to be on a committee assignment so what he's doing is he's he's lying and I'll just say it and I'm a nice you know Mom from Michigan and but he's lying he's saying this so he can get votes from both sides in Utah and he's trying to act like everything to everybody but you know what if you don't stand for something you don't stand for anything and he's not calling out the drug crisis he's not calling out the Border he didn't call out the bite inflation act he's silent because he's the Democrat nominee and he's not going to criticize this party so we all know where he's going to be he will be a plus one for the Democrat Party and by the way if he wins it's a minus one for republicans and Chuck Schumer controls the Reigns of the senate for another two years and look how good they've done look how good they've done gas is more groceries are more crime is surging our borders out of control drugs are coming to our country are we a more united country no they've done nothing to bring bipartisanship so give me a break he's just not telling the truth and he's pretending and I think that's really dishonest at least stand up and say who you are right but he's trying to get votes from both sides and that's his plan that's his game plan and I hope the people of Utah see through it I'm thinking about having my daughter change her voter registration I don't know if it's too late from Michigan to Utah because she's a Michigan resident but um it is just really really shameful and Mike you are the best thing you understand the Constitution you understand the freedoms you understand the greatness of this country um you are a true intellect in a senate and you study everything and you're thoughtful and deliberate about everything and your colleagues like you I've spent a lot of time with you um you are the absolute right person for Utah but you are also the key to Republicans winning back the Senate because we're one seat away and that's how we'll restore some common sense Insanity to Washington but we have to retain your seat it's even shameful that we even have to talk about that right now um because this person's charading um but don't fall for it don't fall for it people oh thank you that's super nice of you to say that I um it is important to focus on these things so isn't it as we approach uh the November 8th election uh what would you say to voters out there um voters out there who aren't sure whether they're going to vote how important is it for Republicans to show up and actually cast their votes and even if they're not Republicans how is it for people who how important is it for those who are dissatisfied with the direction of our country and the direction that the radical Democratic agenda is taking it what what could you say to encourage them to show up and cast votes for Republican candidates in November you know I I hope everyone gets out and votes and this is such a critical election you know it's interesting that Democrats hold the reins of power in Washington with the Senate the house and the White House and they're not running on their record they're not running on well we've restored jobs or we've um you know brought down gas prices or we have a more united country or our streets are safer they're not running on a record of accomplishment because what they have done is actually made our country less safe less prosperous less United Republicans are putting forward a plan to make sure that we restore jobs that we restore economic sense that we have parental rights and our kids education that we secure our border we have all these plans that we're putting forward and you want to know how you know we're doing it look at our Republican Governors the states that are doing the best in in job recovery and economically and kids schools are all led by Republican Governors across this country right now so you can see our policies at work and in action and then you can look at what the Democrats have done as they've held the reins of power they're not running on their record so they're going to try and distract and talk about anything other than what they've been able to not been able to do the last two years as they've held everything so you've got to get out and vote get your family members to vote get your friends to vote don't assume they're voting I know I go to church on Sunday and people the Sunday before the election are asking me who to vote for so start studying up and make sure you vote for Mike Lee number one make sure you vote for Mike Lee and he is absolutely such a great Senator he represents Utah so well and he's going to tell you where he stands he's not gonna you know wishy-wash and pretend to be something he's not to get your vote you're going to know where he stands and that's called integrity and that's what Mike Lee has wow uh Rhonda you're amazing I really appreciate your your uh uh your wise and very kind words and we're doing everything we can to get out the vote in Utah on October 15th uh if you happen to be in Utah then or can be there we'd love to have you we're going to have Gatherings all over the state uh to try to get people out in every County and get them excited get them knocking on doors and we're going

respected by the entire body I'm a great fan and friend of Mike Lee and the country is fortunate to have him as United States Senator when I need to have a conversation with somebody who is smart who is principled who's got experience who will make a decision based upon what the law the Constitution says that person I want to talk to is Mike Lee with the country has a better Senate as a result of his presidency well Senator Mike Lee is one of the the true thinkers in the U.S Senate and he sees somebody that you he never has a waiver he he has the subject matter down pat Mike is a constitutional conservative that is a voice of reason and Clarity on the core of the United States Senate it's my great honor to support him I look forward to serving with him for six more years John

conservative principles especially when it comes to budget integrity and all the things that I believe in like Freedom Liberty and skin in the game being a scrappy entrepreneur from Indiana you know he and I and a few others are sometimes the only ones side by side on those core issues welcome to the conversation we're discussing inflation and I'm happy to be joined by representative John Curtis John has represented Utah's third congressional district since 2017. before coming to Congress he served as the Beloved mayor for the city of Provo from 2010 to 2017. Congressman thanks so much for your support thank you for joining us this evening Senator I'm just delighted to be with you and delighted to support you you know you spent a lot of time in Utah as as do I sometimes we even get to spend time together on the airplane as you travel the state and as you hear from constituents in your District I would imagine that you're hearing about inflation from time to time is that right if I can quote you there's three issues in Washington inflation inflation and inflation right and it's what's on everybody's mind it's killing them and those are big issues because everybody's feeling it and they're feeling it like they've never felt it before I mean we haven't seen this in many decades most people alive today have never experienced inflation like this so some of us remember the 80s and it was not a good time and it feels like we're headed on that same trajectory right people are finding it difficult to just to obtain their basic monthly necessities sadly so much of this uh is the predictable foreseeable and in fact foreseen result of things that Democrats do and have done under Joe Biden's leadership to spend money that we don't have for example the inflation reduction act that was passed just uh you can actually say that with a straight face it's hard to say it it's it's such deep sick irony that they called it that isn't it it is you know when I was in college they taught me in economics 101 inflation happens when there's too much money chasing too few goods and Washington's blowing it on both sides of that equation right in fact that's it's the only thing it comes from Milton Friedman said in the United States of America anytime there's inflation it's because too much money is being spent in Washington that's it it's it's no mystery and so these guys just churned out an additional 750 billion dollars in one Fell Swoop when in one bill that they misnamed uh that was supported by at least in the Senate was supported by every Democrat and not a single Republican same in the house yeah we didn't give them a single vote and they got it through they only hit in the house their margin is about four uh for votes and they didn't need us they got it through and that was of course on the hills of almost a half a trillion in for giving student debt and sometimes people don't look at that the same as government spending but that's putting a half a trillion dollars into the economy that should otherwise not be there that's right and and when that exceeds the amount of money that we have coming into the government we're just printing it and makes everybody's money buy less yeah and on the other side on the supply side we're over regulating right if we wanted to get the supply side moving which would that's the other half of the equation we need to get businesses rolling and you can't do that when you're over regulated you're exactly right failed regulatory policy has made inflation worse during this Administration we've seen that with Energy prices and energy prices go up they uh they in turn affect the price of everything else we've also seen it with shortages that have come about because of bad regulatory policy this year we've seen a baby formula something that's in high demand throughout who would have ever thought that we would be having that discussion in a conversation like this exactly and you notice they didn't have a baby formula shortage in Mexico or in Canada or in Australia or New Zealand or in any country in Europe is just here because it was an artificial shortage it was a shortage brought about by bad regulatory policy it was uh a significant enough problem for us that I introduced a bill called the formula act that passed was signed by the president and has eased the burden what does that say how sad is that that we had to enact a law so that we could actually have baby formula caused by a problem of gross regulatory mismanagement well thank you for that act and I say thank you as representing the hospital with the largest per capita birth rate in the United States you know it's no surprise to all of us in Utah that there are a lot of babies and many many people were very concerned about this formula including my kids so we're expecting our 15th grandchild and it was seriously yeah it's fun but it's a serious topic conversation at the Curtis home we're expecting our first in January we can't wait John thank you so much for joining us tonight I I really appreciate your friendship and your support and I appreciate your willingness to talk to the people of Utah in this conversation about inflation I hope we can do it again thanks Senator thank you ever since he's been in office I felt like he's pretty active accurately represented the majority of Utah situents it doesn't just go with the flow I've also got a number of reforms related to personal privacy making sure the government can't spy on you domestic surveillance by the US government is problematic got a couple of pieces of legislation that I'm working on the women Federal government's Authority on the pay grade act foreign intelligence surveillance act another authorities to surveil you I like Mike Lee because he's straight to the point he's honest he stands for the Constitution I'm a veteran I flew Apache helicopters in uh two tours I can appreciate people that say it like it is we need to elect more Republicans who are willing to get criticized and willing to vote no with Democrats they really want over getting to come so they can resort to socialism I support Mike Lee 100 Mike has been someone who you can truly um You can count on right so he's a man of principle his votes always uphold his what he says he's a man of action honesty and integrity I appreciate that and I appreciate the fact that he's always been a very conservative Republican no matter what he's always stood for principle he always fought for individual rights and he believes in the Constitution and that is very very important to me so I support Mike it's unconstitutional and unlawful for about 12 different reasons and I like like because he's very transparent I have loved that he's been open on Facebook about his actions why he's taking them I love that he is a true Republican he has no fear he is very articulate and when he speaks he's very open to where you can communicate with him and ask him questions find out why did you do this what's going on and when he talks to you you come see everything that he's done is logical it is right down the Republican way and being able to protect the American people and what they are standing for to be able to have the freedom to be able to have their constitutional rights protected

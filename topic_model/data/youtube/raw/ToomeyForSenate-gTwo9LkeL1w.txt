newstalk 7i dwae be hello got there hey pan over here oh good I was hoping you could call me I wasn't sure we were on the same page i never got heard from your guys so good i'm glad you could be on with me for a few minutes here this morning so what do we want to talk about what would it where did where do we want to go here this morning what's on your mind well one of the things i would like to talk about is the ongoing bailouts that are happening quietly vmac uh friday afternoons and christmas eve and it just is an ending up just missed it not even slowing down nope and the I saw that when I came back into work and I what's this about gmac want to talk to me about that what's going on tell us about that and make us aware I tell us make us all more aware of it well uh you know this is I suppose we shouldn't be terribly surprised once they go down this road of course there's demands for forever more about sixteen billion dollars worth of taxpayers in to gmac subsidies turns out not enough and so they quietly announced uh uh gotcha a week or so ago that they're gonna they're going to pump in another 3.8 billion dollars of taxpayer money but but let me just be clear this is chump change compared to what they did on Christmas Eve with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did you notice that know where they do a Fannie and Freddie well and that was part of the ideas that people wouldn't notice this uh taxpayers have have kicked in a combined between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac something on the order of 200 billion dollars um at least that's that's the cap uh when they when they as closing it as they're closing in on this figure the Treasury raise the potential for total taxpayer investment in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to four hundred billion dollars concert and not million billion on Christmas Eve they decide to Lissa cap all together no cap this so there's now and uh unlimited endless potential liability commitment on the part of the taxpayers to just continue to fund to funnel money into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac uh this is a conscious decision to prevent them from going into actually receivership when in case they would be wound down instead they have a different status that's called conservatorship they can only maintain that status as long as they have a certain adequate amount of finances well at the rate they're losing money the only way they can maintain that criteria is if we keep pouring more money in no that's exactly what's happening and so we're giving money to Freddie and Fannie which are private companies right well you know they used to be Gunther uh you know we basically owned them now uh but we haven't fundamentally changed anything about them they're still enormous except now they're operating under government dictates among other things forcing them to lose money one of the things that the government is forcing them to do is to modify all kinds of mortgages this is costing them billions of dollars in additional losses every quarter and that's completely unsustainable as for standalone companies and that's part of why the Treasury has to keep pumping money into these monsters that's what they are it's it's fascinating you know you might ask yourself well um how about the the senior management how how how are they affected by this one they're exempted from the the restrictions on on pay they come uh you know that the pay's are now isn't that amazing that there were having this big hullabaloo and follow and brock obama protesting about the banks and other companies that are that they're bad by the way that have paid the money back so they could get the big salaries and benefits they paid the money back though right so Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a combined 24 billion dollars in losses last quarter and their two top executives receive six million dollars in you up to six million dollars annually uh it's just unbelievable they're basically not in the business of making profits anymore the government is now using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a massive vehicle for a huge subsidy of the mortgage industry that's what's that's what's happening uh to the tune of hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars my point got there is the bailouts aren't ending their continuing uh this is very very disturbing now what do we do about it we need to win some election Gunther I really I you know I mean I think we need to keep as much pressure as we can on elected officials but I'm afraid that the Democratic Party has been captured by the left wing of that party and their mindset is we use this opportunity to grow government massively we're going to raise taxes we're going to increase spending we're going to nationalize health care we do all the things that they have long wanted to do including nationalized parts of our financial services industry which they have done the federal government is the domestic residential mortgage industry in America there is not really a private and there's some some segments of it like mortgage origination mmm something like ninety percent of all residential mortgages are originated then sold either fannie or freddie which as we just discussed are completely creatures of the federal government there's a privately held though well yes uh but uh but the federal government has a huge thing I know maritza knock on which by the way Fannie and Freddie can't pay the dividends they're supposed to pay it's a disaster Gunther we're paying for it all folks we're paying for it all I don't know how much longer this can go on it is uh I really don't know how much longer this can go on I don't even know if we can wait till another year from now there's been so much damage done in one year and yes some of it was done under the Bush administration as well but I got news for you when George Bush had five percent unemployment they were screaming it's terrible as the economy now we've got ten percent unemployment I think it's even higher than that then there's the underemployed they say the number of people that applied for unemployment went down so that's a good sign but if still more new people applied for unemployment the number shouldn't be ten it should have gone up there no total number of people right well the the lot of people became discouraged and have given up searching for working so they are no longer counted as unemployed so you can get some real corks in the statistics but but just to back to spending for one second because you know I was very critical of excessive spending in the bush administration you know I've oat against the huge expansion of Medicare that was uh unfunded and and I thought unsustainable the Bush administration in the last well last year 2008 ran a budget deficit of 406 nine billion dollars which I thought was too big and I criticized the spending that got us there 469 billion Gunther last year it was 1.4 trillion it's on track to be 1.3 trillion this coming year this is not sustainable that we with there is not enough money in the world to keep borrowing at this pace and even if their work under how outrageous is it to impose this kind of crushing debt load on our kids it's it's just completely unacceptable we've got to get this under control all right Pat Toomey for senate dot com if you want to know more about paths campaign to unseat Arlen Specter Pat Toomey

steve scalise house minority whip and ranking republican on the house coronavirus subcommittee is here with me now uh congressman it's great to see you today my first question is is the cdc in trouble harris i think the cdc is in trouble because they're being asked very serious questions and you go back to the campaign president biden said he was going to follow the science and then here you had science saying most schools could reopen in fact the scientists were saying all schools should be opened and they were getting ready to come out with that and all of a sudden the teachers union said well we'll wait we don't want to have to go back into the classroom and let students back in and so you saw them change it they changed some of the basic metrics of science that were going to be used so that then instead of having most kids back in the classroom very few kids about 90 percent of schools stayed closed because of that change in metrics undermining the science and that was done by the bond administration they've yet to answer for it we're trying to get those communications because this is hurting kids it's hurting millions of kids across america who may never make up this difference of not being in the classroom when they should be and the science says they need to be real quickly and i want to move on to a more big picture question but how important or critical is it to know that the aft was a huge donor uh democratic donor oh it's it's very important and again it's something that should be on the table for discussion uh when you heard president biden saying he was going to follow the science and all of a sudden he throws the science out the window because a special interest donor the teachers union says that they don't want kids to be back in the classroom learning and we've seen this in so many states where parents are just rising up even in berkeley when the teachers union head is telling all the teachers you know don't go to class you can't be in the classroom and then they see him taking his kids to private school in the classroom that double standard is just people are going livid they're infuriated because they know it's hurting their kids and they're watching these union heads uh take steps that go against the kids san francisco just to get a money grab is going to go in the classroom for one day so it shows you they can be in the classroom if it's about grabbing a bunch of money but if it's about helping your kids they're not in the classroom uh this is a dangerous place to see what they're doing long-term damage for our kids what you're talking about is out in san francisco they're going to open up all the schools so that they can qualify for that cash and then go right back to where they were again tons of questions about that i want to go though a gestalt view 37 000 feet the big picture there seems to be some heat building here you've got all of this over the covid 19 school closures and the overall handing really of the handling of the pandemic by this current administration trouble getting americans back to work representative scalise a massive crisis on our southern border violence exploding in the middle east the pipeline hack that's causing panic buying of gasoline i mean the list actually is a little bit longer than that and the big picture leadership from the white house where is it are americans hearing enough from president biden president biden's leadership is non-existent and you just mentioned a number of crises that we're seeing the crisis at the border has become very evident the president still won't acknowledge and go down to the border a gas gas prices are through the roof and people are now waiting in line there was a major hack by russia likely president biden doesn't want to confront that you're looking at home prices right now because of lumber prices going through the roof an average home is over 36 000 more than it was a year ago look at what's happening right now with unemployment eight million jobs are unfilled right now and president biden just ushered through a very partisan bill to pay people billions of dollars not to work when eight million jobs are unfilled right now we're paying people not to work and they're borrowing money from our kids and our grandkids to do it we've seen this on every front uh and the economy is really in a delicate spot we're seeing inflation starting to go through the roof our country is less secure look at what's happening around the world the middle east iran who the president wants to let back into an agreement to get a nuclear weapon there they're helping funnel these bombs that are being being shot into israel i mean where is the president's leadership on any of these crises well and where is he to answer the questions on all of this i mean specifically with iran and what's going on between the palestinians and israel right now what's breaking off really into a very volatile situation this week alone we can't have access through our press corps to the president of the united states to ask about how that iranian agreement or negotiation affects or infects what's going on with policy that we would have toward what's happening with israel i mean we can't get there uh we've got ginsake but that's not president biden so we think i wonder and she's trying to encourage him not to answer questions well and that's what we're hearing if if there's something different than show us a house hearing underway right now uh the topic on violent extremism and the response on the january sixth capital riot congressman is this unfolds you're now asking the fbi to reopen the investigation into the 2017 shooting at that virginia baseball field that left you gravely injured god bless you you have recovered but life-changing your injuries and along with several others who were hurt why the push for this now you know my colleague brad wenstrup who he's a congressman but a medical doctor who saved me on that ball field he started asking the new fbi director ray why the fbi classified this as suicide by cop everybody who knows this this what happened on the ball field knows it wasn't suicide by cop he went there to kill every republican on the ball field he had a list of names of other republicans he wanted to kill and thank god for the heroism of capitol police who by the way were in plain clothes they were not dressed out as officers that day they were plain closed uh so he didn't know that they were cops and they get into a shootout he was trying to kill them they both got shot uh david and crystal in the shootout uh that's not suicide by coppin yet that's how it's classified by the fbi other agencies have called it domestic terrorism which is more what it is we've asked the fbi to go back and and just update the record to reflect this properly but also to let us know why it was classified that way in the first place when everybody else who's given it a classification called it domestic terrorism yeah i mean if you can talk about what's going on in one place we can certainly learn uh our lawmakers and police officers under attack and another to get to the answers congressman scalise great to have you on the program thank you very much great being with you harris thanks

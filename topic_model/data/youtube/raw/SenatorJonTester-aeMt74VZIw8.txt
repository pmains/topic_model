Today Montana’s senior Senator Jon Tester took the time to hand deliver military medals to 3 veterans whose accolades slipped through the cracks. Senator Tester read the biographies of the 3 veterans, Gorvan Le Duc and Thomas Huff who served in World War II and Ron Sims, a veteran of the Vietnam War. My name is Ronald W. Sims. I was in the Army from January 28, ‘69 until December 12 of ‘72. The first decoration that I’m really the proudest of is the Combat Infantry Badge. I earned mine in about two weeks of infantry. Didn’t take long to break me in. And then I’m proud of that Bronze Star with Valor because I captured an enemy solider without shooting them. You know I scared him and he was scared of me and I was scared of him and he just surrendered. I had a 45 on me, but I didn’t want to shoot him again, he was already wounded. I was awarded two of those for valor. One for capturing an enemy and one for doing crazy things like going into tunnels and clearing bunkers. But I was a good solider. In the field. And that’s a Purple Heart. That’s this medal here. And that was when I was wounded pulling road security. A lot of times we look at the medal and say gee that’s a nice medal, but a lot of the time these folks went through hell to be able to earn the recognition that that medal gives them. And I think it’s just really really important
that if somebody goes above and beyond the call of duty, which is what these folks have done, that we make sure we recognize it, whether it’s in the form of a medal, or a bar or a star or whatever it might be. I think it’s an honor to be noted by Senator
Tester. And he, last summer or last fall, he personally reissued me all of those medals that really, really made me feel proud you know that I
was recognized and that that he was appreciative of my service to
my country.

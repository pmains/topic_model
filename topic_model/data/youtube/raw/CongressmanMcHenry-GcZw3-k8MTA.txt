North Carolina mr. McHenry the sponsor of the legislation 45 minutes well thank you mr. Chairman I certainly appreciate your leadership thank you for having this mark up today and today's early-stage companies are the source for American innovation economic growth and jobs but fundamentally funding these early stage companies remains a major challenge investing in start-up companies is inherently risky which is why many investors who qualify to become angel investors often shy away from it this is a major hurdle facing small and early-stage businesses that are struggling to find capital particularly in parts of the country like my district in western north carolina if you're in austin Boston Silicon Valley your access to capital is unrivaled in the world if you're in the rest of the country we have an enormous challenge to meet these demands folks in my district in small counties have actually lost more businesses than they have created in in recent years small counties like those that I represent in Western North Carolina are disproportionately impacted and so we have to do everything we can here in Washington to reverse this trend that's why addressing the challenges facing angel investing is a great first step this can be accomplished by changing our mindset and creating a regulatory framework that encourages innovation and growth while also ensuring that shareholder investor protections remain strong this bill does that while the JOBS Act lifted the shareholder limit to 2,000 it left in place the one hundred investor limit for angel investment funds as a result many investors who want to become angels are excluded for investing and many early-stage companies fail to acquire the capital they need to get off the ground to address this problem representative of Velasquez and I joined together and reintroducing this bill I filed last Congress that it mends the investment company act of 1940 by increasing the investor limitation from 100 to 250 for qualifying venture funds which is which are narrowly tailored for early stage investing our bill would open up angel investing two more accredited investors allow for early-stage companies to raise capital they need needs grow and create jobs after all that's why we're here isn't it I also employees that companion legislation has been introduced and was marked up and voiced voted out of the Senate Banking Committee this morning with a co-sponsorship of senator Heller and Senator Heitkamp my hope is that what their efforts combined with ours here today this important legislation can become law the bottom line is that this legislation is a sensible way to get more capitals startups and small businesses it will allow for asset diverse diversification for angel investors more access to capital for companies and ultimately more good-paying jobs I'd like to thank the Chairman chairman hensel Inc ranking member waters representative of vel√°zquez and all the committee staff on both sides I'll for working hard on this bipartisan bicameral legislation we like to see it done today I thank you for your support and I yield back about who would you yield to the chair very happy to yield to the chair I thank the gentleman for yielding I just want to thank the gentleman for his leadership that and the gentlelady from New York as well working on a bipartisan basis again we know that entrepreneurship is at a generational lobe this is a bill that will raise a threshold that hasn't been raised since the times that before most of us were born it needs to be increased it's a very important piece of legislation and I hope that all members will join in supporting the this piece of legislation I go back to the gentleman and the gentleman yields and I yield back

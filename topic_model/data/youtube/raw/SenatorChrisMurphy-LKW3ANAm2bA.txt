senator Murphy thank you very much senator Romney thank you to the nominees and to your families for being willing to serve in the case of our two-career public servants not for the first senator Romney thank you to the nominate and look forward to hearing from you with that I'd like to recognize the distinguished ranking member for his comments senator Murphy thank you very much senator Romney thank you to the nominees and to your families for being willing to serve in the case of our two-career public servants not for the first time and thank you mr. Coulter for being willing to step up for your country let me just add on briefly to Senator Romney's remarks Mr Norrell and if you're confirmed you are going to confront a country that is essentially tipped into civil war eight years after the February 17 the revolution that supposed Qadhafi Libya has yet to find peace or stability much less attain its aspirations for democracy and prosperity most recently the renegade commander of the so-called Libyan National Army Khalifa heft R has tried and failed to take Tripoli by force and at great cost more than 650 killed and 3500 wounded just since April 5th and in the wake of president Trump's outreach to half guard there is more uncertainty now than ever as to where the United States stands as this chaotic civil war spirals out of control next door in Egypt as Ana Romney mentioned we are increasingly seeing a theater anism and relentless repression in the herbs world's most populous nation through a widely discredited referendum this April president Sisi succeeded in amending the Constitution to allow for an exception to term limits so that he can stay in office until at least 2030 he has crushed his political opposition tightened repressive policies targeting the LGBT community rounded ab writers journalists artists and activists for peaceful criticism yet President Trump has praised Sisi for doing an outstanding job and Egypt remains the second largest recipient of US aid in the world without much money at stake and again with that this much confusion of where the United States stands with respect to this campaign of repression we need strong leadership in our embassy and lastly Arab Emirates is one of our most important partners in the region in terms of counterterrorism political and military cooperation and trade and investment but that relationship is also amongst our most challenging the UAE leadership has asserted an increasingly risky militaristic foreign policy and many of us have a list of growing concerns with the UAE s conduct in Yemen its aggressive isolation of Qatar its role in Sudan and inhumane and unfair detention practices and trials at home it is not insignificant that this will be the first political appointee to represent us in the UAE a post that has traditionally been reserved for career diplomats I would argue for good reason but I look forward to hearing from the nominee thank you for agreeing to accept these very challenging assignments and I look forward to your testimony thank you senator Murphy will now turn to our first nominee ambassador Norland again we express appreciation to all of you for will your willingness to take on these critical roles your full statements will be included in the record without objection so if you could please keep your remarks to no more than five and Baghdad into joining their effort vacations mm-hmm have a party I would prove you my opening remarks a relationship with of ours and plays a payout at 16 but it very quickly the fact that I'm much they be influenced relation and good encourage of all is including all too well I am if ikan dollar I would on this in April President Trump job thank you very much and freedoms that we have as a US citizens thank you senator Murphy thank you very much mr. chairman Mr Norrell thank you for your commitment to the country in taking on this very difficult job you're gonna face a very fluid situation when you arrived in Libya and as I mentioned in my opening remarks in April President Trump called Kalifa heft are as he was leading his failed offensive on Tripoli and a public readout of the call made no reference to that offensive and instead the president seemed to praise Hefner for his ongoing counterterrorism efforts a message that deeply perplexed our international partners since he has been actively attacking groups we worked with to dislodge Isis can you clarify for this committee the u.s. position on Khalifa heft our yeah senator thank you and as you can imagine as part of my consultations I've been exploring that theme and it's it's clear to me that we consider the Libyan National Army to be a key player in any effort to produce a political solution to the situation in Libya and it was I think as I understand it in that respect that there was a conversation between the president and half dar I understand that discussion revolved around counterterrorism oil market stability and and the role of the LNA precisely in a political solution and what I found in the course of my consultations is unanimous consent across the US government there has to be a ceasefire there has to be movement towards a political settlement that the United Nations role in this process is key and and if confirmed that's the path that I'll be embarked on I'm glad you're willing to take on this job you I think can understand how a phone call in the middle of an offensive that doesn't mention the ceasefire or the offensive would be interpreted by the international community and our partners as an endorsement of that offensive not a move towards a ceasefire but that is not your phone call that as the president's and I appreciate your willingness to take up this job mr. Cohen you talked about the importance of our security relationship with Egypt let me just ask you a general question do you believe that it's appropriate to use US aid and the threat of cut off of US aid as a means to try to push a human rights agenda in Egypt situations getting worse not better and I think a fundamental question is are we willing to deliver are we willing to deliver a message to CC that there is a line he can cross at which point we are no longer comfortable or bound to be a partner with them if they continue to ratchet up this campaign against political dissidents thank you senator let me take this in two parts and the first is that I'm I believe in and if confirmed I will of course be supporting the law and the law that the Congress passes that provides the financing has Human Rights provisions in it and consequently we currently have a significant amount of money that has not been released because those conditions have not been either met or waived by the administration so I think the the path we've taken is completely appropriate I also believe the counterterrorism assistance that we provide is in our own national security interests so we need to find we need to be sure as we go forward that we are protecting and defending American national security interests which are served by ensuring that the Egyptians can prosecute counter terrorism against Isis in Sinai address terrorism in their western desert address terrorism in Egypt's heartland it's not just Egypt's the interests that are at stake there it's America's let me just sneak in a couple questions for mr. Rakolta you disclosed as part of your process before the committee having some business interests in the UAE that may require you under UAE law to keep some of those companies open can you can you just talk about the projects that you have participated in your company or participated in in UAE and the steps that you've taken in coordination with this nomination for the question senator from 2003 to 2013 my company did significant amount of business in the UAE we we stopped bidding in 2011 we finished the final project in 2013 all of our staff and everything was removed from the were the UAE and sent elsewhere in the world secondly there are contractual obligations and guarantee both contractually and by law that require us to give a corporate guarantee on those projects if you will the fact that something were to go wrong they could come back at us that is the only thing and we could have closed down our our LLC that was working there but as a practice for tax purposes we leave those open until the final guarantees are completed do you if you had other business in the Middle East over the past sover that period of time we did work in Doha on one project but the projects were primarily in the UAE and and though and the Doha project was obviously back then conducted out of the Dubai office but everything has been shut down and we have absolutely no intentions of going back in fact I'll make it a little stronger we will not be going back to doing business there in in the region in at least yes and will you make that commitment once you leave this post as well yes I would personally thank you very much thank you

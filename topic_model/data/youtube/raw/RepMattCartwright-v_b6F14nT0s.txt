the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized Thank You mr. speaker and speaker the ozone act or perhaps more accurately the smoggy Skies Act will put our communities at risk and dangerously harm public health the delays and exemptions in this act are unprecedented they will cut critical portions of the Clean Air Act to the detriment of our nation and our people's health this motion to recommit is simple if the Clean Air scientific advisory committee which is an independent group of nationally recognized experts if they believe that this Act will increase asthma attacks increase emergency room visits increase preterm births increase impaired fetal growth lead to an increased risk of heart attacks stroke a premature death then the Act will not go into effect now I ask what is more important or fundamental sedatives of the people to ensure that our actions do not bring harm to the American people how can we go home to our constituents and look a mother in the eye and say we voted for something that could make her child sick how can we visit a school if we voted for something that could spike rates of asthma we originally passed a bipartisan Clean Air Act to protect the health of our people as we vote partially to dismantle it today at least we should ensure scientists certify that we are doing no harm to the American people and some of my colleagues may vote against this motion to recommit because they already know this act will have a devastating impact on the American people's health plain and simple ozone is a pollutant it is the leading component of smog it causes chest pain shortness of breath respiratory infections asthma attacks acute bronchitis and even premature death smog is linked to 16,000 preterm births per year exposure to ozone in the womb and in childhood causes permanent lung damage the new ozone standards could prevent 230,000 childhood asthma attacks per year delaying implementation of the new ozone standards will only sentence more and more children to lifelong lung disease when setting the new ozone standards the EPA used the best available science and reviewed hundreds of studies on the negative health effects of ozone one conclusion was clear the current standards do not protect the American people now my Republican colleagues here recently passed legislation that would have taken health care away from 22 million people and now we're considering a bill that would make our nation sicker a bill that would hurt our most vulnerable babies infants school children the elderly for good reasons this bill is opposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics American Heart Association the American Lung Association and the American Public Health Association will suspend gentlelady's correct the house is not in order members please remove your conversation from the House floor the house will be in order the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized it is opposed by the American Public Health Association the National Association of county and city health officials and many many more these experts know that this bill is nothing more than a recipe for increased sickness and more suffering we know that people are being harmed by ozone we have a duty to our citizens to raise the bar protect their health this is the people's house we're here to protect the people we're here to fight for the most vulnerable among us and not to represent special interests we need to be the body to promote health not take away health care we need to fight for kids not make them sick we need to clean our air not protect polluters support this amendment and make sure this bill is not the health catastrophe all the experts know that it is a back balance of my time Pennsylvania yields back the balance this time

my next guest says he is frustrated because senator harry reid and president obama keep moving the goalposts when it comes to negotiating a deal joining me now Republican senator from South Carolina Lindsey Graham senator thank you very much for coming in well thanks thanks Fred you did a an interview with a politico yesterday in which you said and I quote the president is a pathetic leader he's only engaged in the last couple of days you're not one to mince words but that's what it was not that I'd you know dislike the president but he has shown very little leadership the time when the country needs it the most from a Republican point of view we've created unreasonable expectations we have 46 senators you need 60 votes in the Senate to do big things we have a slim majority in the House and President Obama is still president so for us to suggest to the American people that we could defund Obamacare delay it for a year by shutting down the government I think was unrealistic but having said that the president's response was I won't negotiate with you you will raise the debt ceiling and you will open up the government without any conditions as just an immature response and Harry Reid twice has moved the goalpost when it came to a bipartisan deal in the Senate so here's where I'm at on a cloudy Sunday afternoon I'm not going to vote for any deal coming out of the Senate that doesn't have a reasonable chance of getting a majority of House Republicans understanding that defunding and delaying Obamacare is a bridge too far let's take a break and listen in to you just mentioned Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid he's speaking from the Senate floor right now they just gaveled in less listen it Karn they paid for two wars costing about two trillion dollars with borrowed money and they rang up 400 billion dollar cab for a Medicare prescription drug plan and Madam President they ran up the nation's credit card for years and years on lots of stuff now Madam President there was one conversation on one of the sunday shows today and said we were trying to break the cap set in the budget act we know it one little generous portion of my Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid opening remarks from the Senate floor any reaction to what you just heard there well you can't say fiscal responsibility of without mentioning Harry Reid this is President Obama since he's been president for the last five years has added more debt to the national debt than almost all presidents combined he's on pace to do that it started at ten point six Trina snout 16.6 or 16.8 senator Reed is warning the Republicans in the Senate to agree to bust the budget caps as a price for opening up the government we're not going to do that the one thing that I think all senators and congressmen should do before we open up the government is put ourselves in Obamacare under the same terms and conditions as every American the Office of Personnel Management at the White House made a ruling that members of Congress are exempt from being in Obamacare I think that ruling is illegal and it's certainly not leadership so what I'm telling Senator Reid and every other Republican and Democrat when this debacle is over and it will be one day all of us every member of Congress should be in Obamacare under the same conditions as every other American no better no worse to me that's the minimum we should be doing one of the great ironies of the Republican quest to to defund and then delay the implementation of Obamacare a fool's errand you might say maybe those are two strong words but the irony of it is that it blocked what would have been a huge story covering every newscast local national and every front page the rollout of Obamacare which was disastrous by any measure here's the good nude from her news from a Republican point of view Obamacare is the disaster we predicted it would be as bad for the country but from a political point of view the last 12 days have been a nightmare for those trying to sign up for Obamacare it's been a complete fiasco and failure but instead of having headlines about people can't sign up for Obamacare the system doesn't work it's about the shutdown but six months from now we won't be talking about the shutdown if Republicans will embrace reality and get this behind us we'll be talking about a failed concept called Obamacare and Democrats the middle of next summer will come to us and try to get some relief from this fiasco called Obamacare if we don't screw it up now there there is this perception and I think a reality as well of a fundamental inability for this White House to negotiate with Republicans on in either house this was illustrated in a really great piece that i read this week which did not get a lot of attention written by a Susan Crabtree the wash the White House correspondent for the washington examiner she was writing about Miguel Rodriguez who is not a household name he he is the White House liaison to Congress a hugely important position she says quote even prominent Democrats say they don't know him Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin d-mich again says he may have met him but can't recall when asked what he thinks about Rodriguez represented representative john Larson of Connecticut turned to an aide to ask who he is this speaks volumes senator well I know Miguel but here's the problem Ronald Reagan said Alan Tip O'Neill to solve social security a moment of crisis in a bipartisan fashion Clinton sit down with Newt to find a way to end the shutdown in 95 and 96 this president's refusal to negotiate being AWOL at a time the country needs his leadership the most is a pattern that needs to stop there's plenty of blame to go around we overplayed our hand as Republicans but the Democratic response of trying to jam us basically and use this moment to increase spending at a time when the gartner the federal government is spending more than next generation can afford to pay is not the right response but again I just want to stress the Republican Party can survive this if we embrace reality there are many ways to attack Obamacare I along with Senator Barrasso are going to introduce legislation when this government shutdown is over that would allow every state if they chose to opt out of the individual employer mandate under Obamacare let South Carolina if she chooses to come up with a better plan or a different plan there are so many ways to attack Obamacare but to my Republican colleagues less embrace reality we can't defund or delay at this moment we don't have the political leverage let's keep fighting Obamacare but let's open up the government in the house should lead it's important that Paul Ryan come up with a solution that's conservative in nature and send it to the Senate put Harry Reid in a box rather than the Senate putting the house in the bottom that would be the attempt of your legislation they're basically to put the cinema jord leader in a box it would not pass no way was it no I think Paul could find a way along with John Boehner to open up the government with some good government reforms attached like making sure we don't have future shutdowns like making sure that every member of Congress is in Obamacare on the same conditions of every other American and fixing some of the bipartisan concerns about Obamacare if you sent that package to the Senate it really would put Harry Reid on the defensive the house is offense the Senate is defensive the best we can do in the Senate is Republicans is block an increase in spending and block some of the bad ideas that they want to push but if you want to go on offense it has to come from the house and the last thing I want to see happen is a bad bill passed the Senate that goes to the house where majority of Democrats vote for it in a minority of republicans vote for it putting John Boehner speakership a tryst nobody in the country should want to lose John Boehner Speaker what happens if he does lose that position what's the alternative who are we looking at I don't know who would follow John but it would be a huge mistake for the Republican Party to put the speaker the house who's been a wonderful leader during tough times following a policy that has no chance of success if I thought I if I could if I were king we would defund replacing repeal Obamacare we just don't have the political leverage and it would really be heartbreaking to follow strategy that's quite frankly unrealistic and one of the victims of that strategy be a fine man called John Boehner Democrats are very fond of pointing out the polls these days and how much damage has been done to the Republican Party but we're still more than a year out from the midterm elections will anybody remember this despite if you're smart about the government shutdown in 2013 will be old news and we'll be talking about the flaws and Obamacare in 2014 but sixty percent of Americans want to replace every member of Congress to my Democratic colleagues if you think this is working well for you you need to look at the polls all right Senator Lindsey Graham South Carolina thank you very much for coming is great to see you sir

well thank you um I also dr. Robinson wanna thank you for bringing up Planned Parenthood and clinics that are just so critically important especially in communities like mine I represent a district in South Los Angeles that includes serozha Compton and Watts there's only four districts that are poor in California than my district and when I was a child after seeing my three sisters go through what they went through I decided that I would have to find a clinic much like a Planned Parenthood back in those days we looked through the yellow pages and I found a clinic and I tell you I I was afraid to tell anybody that I was even going to go seek advice on what options are there were but I remember walking in and I remember being welcomed and being told there my first question was how much is this going to cost me I didn't I didn't have a lot of money and I was told it was a sliding scale and I didn't didn't have to pay but it was just so important as a young person to have that opportunity to go and get access to health care people think oh well there's healthcare everywhere you can go wherever you want but there's many people in low income communities incommunicado that don't have the access to health care and access is something that we've been fighting for and it's not as easy as going to wherever you want especially not when you're 14 or 15 and you just want to go get advice and get some some guidance um

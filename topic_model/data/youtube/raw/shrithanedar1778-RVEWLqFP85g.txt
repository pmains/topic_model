Shareen Siri how can I help you 310 radar Tammi doc should eat Canada not Rick Snyder that's closer closer that's the humorous Superbowl ad bought and paid for by sweet anodyne Indian immigrant turned Michigan millionaire who's now one of the Democrats running to become your next governor welcome back to rip as we hear more from this chemist businessman and politician about his personal history and this plans for Michigan of course you've already met Charlie three you have to tell the story of how you came here back in the 1970s with $20 in your pocket and now you were Michigan millionaire how did that happen well here actually I only had 16 because I had a couple of beers on the plane but but to come here with virtually nothing and to achieve all that you how did that happen what I want to so I started got my PhD in chemistry and they paid me $300 a month so I would take $75 of that send it home so my family can put food on the table you know I mean I was 14 years old the family fell into dire poverty and I worked as a janitor and helped my family come out of poverty and education was the ladder for my success but that ladder is broken for too many Michiganders and I want to be the education governor make education and health care accessible regardless of your financial status you know no matter what your success though I I have to wonder in this current climate where you have people in power who are bashing immigrants yes if the state of Michigan won by Donald Trump by some 11,000 votes in the last election if the state of Michigan would vote for somebody with a foreign name and a foreign accent well let me ask you this if I take our state which is currently 35th in the nation in education we have terrible roads we have infrastructure problems after I get elected within a year or two I'm at state-of-the-state giving an address and I say we have brought our state of Michigan in the top ten would it matter in what accent I say that no but why would you want to be governor you've never run for any political office ever and it's the first time it's a big look in I came to Michigan in 1982 to work at the University of Michigan and that those days all of my worldly possessions fit nicely into the $200 car that I'd bought it for the name Paula so when I put my stuff in the trunk I still have so much room left over and look at that look at that a person that started at that level look at the country what a great country we live in we have a relationship with immigrants we're a nation of immigrants and look at the freedom and look at the opportunities that this country is known for what time can I ask what did the government do because you will advocate a lot of government positions yes healthcare that's everything what did the government do specifically for you to help you succeed well a lot of the education my bachelor's degree my master's degree I was able to get education the I could not have afforded education and I was able to come out of college without a debt and what a lot of the kids today come out of college with so much debt and I think we have to make education accessible it should not be a privilege we should make four-year college affordable regardless of your financial status you're also making history too in calling for the legalization of marijuana yes in Michigan and across the country and for releasing prisoners who've been convicted of marijuana crimes Christa's do not violent well look off the fifty six billion dollar budget that we have for state of Michigan we have about 8 to 10 billion discretionary funds and of that 25 percent of that almost two and a billion dollars on spend on our prison system and we need a prison reform we're putting locking up people that have operatic addiction we're locking up people for a small position of marijuana what I want to do as a governor is I want to expose the record for small position charges I want to release and pardon the people and I want to give them skill set so that the returning citizens can learn some trade skills learn some important technical education so they can return to society and become a productive member of our society how many people though are in prison just on those minor charges for which you will give a pardon there could be about 10% you know I'm looking at various numbers look we spend $40,000 per prisoner and we spend $9,000 per student in k-12 should we reform his sentencing guidelines should be reformed to because we judges put people in prison too much for too long exactly and then we also see you know people of color disproportionately get higher longer sentences you know so the justice has to work in a fair way and the justice should be blind to you know color of the skin or ethnicity or you know whether your sexual preference you know we need to have a justice system that's fair to all when rick snyder ran he was a businessman who reluctantly became a politician I get the feeling that the same thing is true with you you are doing this from your heart not because you want to really enter politics but by the same token there are political machines already set up just this week Gretchen Whitmer who is apparently the front-runner and the Democratic side got a big endorsement from Mayor Mike Duggan how can you possibly compete with that sort of political weight and a political machine that doesn't know and doesn't embrace well this is well I'm always been an underdog and always fought and every time I did I was defeated or I farm up against the something difficult I gave him a lot more energy and I fight even harder I'm a fighter you know my mother is my hero and when we were growing up in power D I learned from her how to be fearless and how to be pragmatic and how not to give up regardless of what the odds are I understand the entire established machinery going to be against me three months ago I was 2% in the poll an epic MRA poll put me at 24% and my opponent is at 34% so on the Democratic side we have two candidates on the Republican side we have two candidates so I call that a the final forest you know final for August and I intend to big to draw a contrast between myself and Senator Whitmer you know I do not like corporate Republicans and I don't like corporate Democrats there is a lot of corporate money that is corrupting our government is corrupting our politicians and we need Lansing work for the people once again but now as a millionaire as a businessman where are you not happy with Donald Trump's recent tax overhaul it gave businesses a 40% tax cut wasn't that good for your company look when you give tax cut to the businesses that money doesn't come in the economy the money goes to pay the shareholders when you raise the minimum wage to $15 the people won you let people live with dignity and when they you give them a raise people would spend that all of that money will come in our economy and grow our economy trickle-down economics has never worked and we gotta stop trying trickle-down economics we need to invest people and my plan is to put people over carpet it roughly talked about a single-payer health care system is that the government runs the health care in the state absolutely you know insurance companies take 20% of the bite out of our health care dollars we spend what trillions of dollars on health care once you eliminate the insurance companies you know this will actually be cheaper and we'll able to cover a lot more more little cross to done gone well I'm glad you mentioned them they Blue Cross recently sent out a letter there was a letter with a letterhead of Senator Whitmer and there was an appeal made to the employees of Blue Cross Blue Shield a Blue Cross Blue Shield gave a list of all of their employees home addresses to the Whitmer campaign and then there was the letter said if you are a vice president then paid six thousand eight hundred to the Whitmer campaign it's almost like a Whitmer tax and if you're a manager you pay so much and you know what top of it was the letterhead campaign letterhead at the bottom it was signed by the four highest ranking member officers of Blue Cross and you are accepting no corporate donation I will accept zero dollars from Carper special interest I will be beholden to no one except the people of Michigan all right senator you've heard from the candidate next it's your turn when charlie takes the show on the road [Music] help me out all these people he's on channel 4 let's treat chip in it on whatever the name is yeah sure add something like that I would definitely vote for him because I feel he's the most purest of them all three apparently your Super Bowl and his work people may not know how to pronounce your name but they do know that they appreciate what you're saying in public and this is your campaign side right exactly this is my campaign sign and let me show you the backside of the rally sign okay no BS and I suppose that shooty and that's devil yeah bill cutie and this is the 45 by the way we're inviting Bill Schuette Brian Calley Patrick holdback everybody to come on let it rip so we're not endorsing surrey-canada we're just giving you an idea of what he stands for and who he is and it is it is different it is different to see a millionaire back programs that really help support those who don't make that much money yeah but you know there were time when I didn't know where my next meal is going to come from and I'm the only gubernatorial candidate that knows what it feels like going to bed hungry and today you know 22% of Michiganders live below poverty line 40% of African American children live below poverty line and as a governor I want to make sure that no child goes hungry in Michigan and I want to cover and I want to make Medicare for all if not at the federal level we'll do it at the state level and I'll start that with covering the children first so anybody under 18 I would cover them an ambitious agenda three tenets are thank you for being here we want to thank the first of many appearances all right and thank you for watching this edition of let it rip

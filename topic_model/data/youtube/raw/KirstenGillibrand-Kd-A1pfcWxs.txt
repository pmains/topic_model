hi i'm howard dean i have the pleasure of introducing senator Kirsten Gillibrand from New York we're going to talk a little bit about things like the public option what she's been doing in her time in the United States Senate and welcome Thank You Howard would you like to tell me what your major kind of short-term priorities are in the in the Senate you're in your first surprise term here yes well you know I'm really trying to be a voice for those who don't have fancy lobbyists those who are most vulnerable among us and I've looked on a lot of children's issues because i'm going to add committee we're going to do the children's nutrition bill this year so i'm going to focus on childhood obesity some of other childhood conditions and diseases like autism and childhood diabetes also focused on basic things like clean water there's a lot of pharmaceuticals in our water and I just passed an amendment with Senator Kerry on helping our renters because during all this foreclosure crisis if you're a renter you're just kicked out and so now they have 90 days to be able to find a home if the building that they're in is foreclosed in speaking of bringing new issues you are where you were the first United States Senator ever to really have transparency you put all kinds of stuff up on your website that nobody ever done had done before can you tell me a little bit about that yes you know when I ran in 06 a lot of the concerns that my constituents voice to me was that they really felt like Congress had gone awry and then it was very much bought and paid for what they really wanted was open and honest government so one thing I did was try to put more information online so I put on all my earmark requests so people would know you know I asked for a road I asked for bridge but they could say well we really needed was the senior center so I could get that kind of feedback I put all my meeting so any kind of meeting with a lobbyist or a special interest group or an advocacy group was online so if I met with one side of the debate the other side could say can we hit police have a meeting and I put my financial disclosure and I was the first member of Congress to ever do all three speaking of lobbyists one of the most heavily lobbied in the Senate and it's going to continue to be as the health insurance bill and you recently came out in favor of the public option correct i guess my question is if the president if by some horrible a chance the Senate passes a bill without a public option what's your position well I'm going to support a bill that has a not-for-profit public option I really want to focus our time and attention on really playing hardball here I think if it doesn't have it it's not the kind of reform that America has asked for so I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure there's not for profit public option and one of the formulations I really like is the Medicare for All formulation where you can open up Medicare and to anybody who wants to buy in and I would have people buying and have the buy-in it could be a sliding scale but something about 5% of your income that means it's always going to be affordable and it means it's going to have a revenue stream to offset some of the costs what do you do about the frustrations of folks who who seem to be on the other side and think the insurance companies are more important than the average American well they don't that's not what the American people believe and it's certainly not what they want so there I would say they're very out of touch and I would also say that they're not going to solve the problem the problem is right now is that health care is too expensive everyone's health care costs keep rising when their income does not rise so co-pays deductibles all of those costs have continued to go up insurance premiums everything and so what we want to do is make it affordable and I think affordable quality health care is a right and should not be a privilege well I've got two more tough questions for you you know you you've had to make a difficult transition from a house number to a Senate member and from coming from what was arguably the most conservative district in New York to now representing an entire state where the politics is different than it was your home districts they're two different districts are two issues which you've got to be tough for you one is the employee Free Choice Act what's your position on that and why and how have you had to kind of that around since you now represent the whole state instead of just a conservative district you know I support the employee Free Choice Act and I actually supported it as a House member as well because I believe it took some courage for the district you came from sure well I believe that our unions have been advocates for working families since their inception I believe that what the union movement is about is fair labor laws Fair Pay making sure that we have a level playing field and they really do fight for the working families core values of America and so what the employee Free Choice Act all it does is allow for people to unionize if they want union representation and takes away some of the intimidation and factors that really have prevented it for over the last several years under the Bush administration the last one is an interesting one in that same-sex marriage which suit seemed to dissolve the United the New York State Senate which I'm not going to ask you to comment on it doesn't want to but same-sex marriage certainly is not an issue that would received major support in your and you're much more conservative mystery before where do you stand on that well I support full marriage equality and you know it it's really to me it's the civil rights march of our generation it's about equal rights it's about equal justice and there's no reason that any family in America you know my family gets certain rights and privileges a gay couples family should also get the same rights and privileges and there's always an over a thousand rights and privileges in federal and state law that would come with marriage equality and on the federal level I'm going to work on repealing DOMA I'm going to work on repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell I've a bill right now that i'm considering basically putting a moratorium on the enforcement of don't ask don't tell for the next 18 months so the administration has time to consider it to decide if they want this to be part of their policy and for the military to come to the table and make their own assessments because all that all the evidence shows us our military has been denied some of the best and brightest in America because of this policy particularly in areas where we really needed them in language translation and intelligence services and we need all of our best and brightest at the forefront of our operations to keep America safe I want to thank for the time she gave to the interview I asked her to do an interview because i'm considering endorsements in the in the united states senate race in new york so i'll tell you one very quick story about Kristen Gillibrand she was elected in 2006 and I spent four years in Washington a lot of people in Washington will say a lot of things and usually don't do anything about it she came in about two and a half years ago when she was a representative and told me when I was chairman of the DNC that she wanted to do something for women with through the women's leadership for him and I thought to myself this is really great but I'll bet it'll never happen she's the only person in four years who came in to me made a promise and then got brought six of her college women colleagues in the house in to raise money for the Democratic National Committee so we could have this big majority in the house and this big majority in the Senate and today she satisfied me that she knows how to use that majority in order to get things done so I'm pleased to endorse Kirsten Gillibrand for the United States Senate for her re-election Thank You Howard it's my pleasure good luck thank you

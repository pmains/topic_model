uh good morning everybody i'm tom hunter uh the associate state director with arp west virginia and on behalf of our 250 000 members across the mountain state a few of whom senator are joining us here today a few of our volunteers and our aarp west virginia state director gailey miller and our aarp west virginia state volunteer president jane marx who unfortunately couldn't be with us today i want to thank senator manchin for the opportunity to make this presentation today and senator as i know you have heard from many of your constituents across the state and we hear it from many of our members here in the mountain state the rising costs of prescription drugs are truly creating an economic hardship for older americans and older west virginians west virginians are struggling to afford everything from groceries to rising utility bills to gasoline right now while the big drug companies are charging three times more for prescription drugs than everyone else in the world in january 2022 big pharma raised prices on 800 800 prescription medications it's outrageous what's happening with pharmaceutical prices if consumer prices had risen as fast as drug prices have over the past 15 years gasoline would now cost 12 dollars and 20 cents a gallon now folks aren't happy paying five dollars a gallon okay but had had gasoline stayed with the rate of what we've seen in the increases in the cost of prescription drugs 12.20 cents a gallon a gallon of milk right now would be 13 a gallon using that same formula uh to bring that comparison to something all west virginians can understand and and most certainly you can understand senator from your hometown bakery and fairmont country club bakery pepperoni rolls pepperoni rolls in 2006 center cost a dollar if those prices had risen at the same rate as prescription drugs you'd be paying four dollars and five cents now for one of these four dollars and five cents so that's what we're dealing with in terms of the increases in prescription drug costs it's it's out of control older west virginians who are living on fixed incomes face challenges every day and have to make some tough decisions do i pay for my prescription drugs do i pay my utility bills do i pay my rising costs for groceries if they're still out driving do i do i put a full tank of gas in the tank medicare spends more than 135 billion dollars on prescription drugs every year 135 billion yet current law prohibits medicare from negotiating with drug companies for lower prices big pharma is trying to scare lawmakers with misleading claims to stop them from allowing medicare to negotiate for lower prices allowing medicare to negotiate would save older americans older west virginians and taxpayers billions of dollars a year helping to protect seniors from inflation by lowering their drug prices and putting money back in their pockets lowering prescription drug prices is something that has widespread support among voters regardless of party affiliation an aarp survey recently of voters found that strong majorities of voters want congress to act on the issue was 70 percent saying that's very important the survey also found senator that 87 percent of voters 87 percent support allowing medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices senator manchin you have expressed your strong support for medicare negotiation and we appreciate you senator being a champion on on that point it is urgent that you keep fighting for west virginians and stop drug companies from price gouging us i want to ask our volunteers to come forward with the senator they have petitions today if you guys will go ahead and step forward here with the senator they have petitions today that they will be presented to you senator to urge members of congress to take action on meaningful and necessary prescription drug reform more than four million americans have signed on to this effort joining aarp in this fight and today i'm pleased to present to you senator with more than 35 000 petitions signed by west virginians urging you and your senate colleagues to make sure medicare negotiation is part of a new reconciliation package senator we thank you for the time today we thank you for welcoming welcoming us and and we invite you to make remarks absolutely to all of my friends and tom thank you very much for the kind introduction to galen and angelo who i understand are just taking precautionary measures uh and to uh all of those uh who are here today what tom has just said is absolutely correct and we all know it we see it every day that one of the most i think challenging challenging parts of our life today as we are older especially seniors is the cost of medication to live a quality of a life and to have that continually being taken advantage of with high prices is unbelievable so we're doing everything humanly possible and i think the time is right right now there's so much that we can do there is a bipartisan consensus that's going around right now wondering how this can be challenged and how we can basically bring these prices down first of all if you look uh the the the pbms the pharmaceutical benefit managers i've looked at everything and everyone's blamed everybody i've talked to big pharma and they're blamed in pbms i talk to pbms they blame big pharma so i figured there's a problem between one or both and pbms were brought in to try to reduce the prices to negotiate it should have been done through the government and i'll tell you the reason why i say that the one agency that does the best of negotiating the lowest prices for drugs is the veterans administration the va so i said they have the ability they have the ability the va to negotiate for medicaid medicare and themselves and bring all these prices down tremendous reduction in prices and why we don't don't agree to this and allow this happen is beyond my understanding so i've talked to the secretary dennis secretary of the va and he says we can do it this is something we could do overnight and make sure it happened but i can tell you there is a movement that we are going to do everything that we possibly can it'll be done this year it has to be done we can't continue um letting this go on year after year and kick down the uh down the the road this is a piece of legislation that you just read tom just read the statistics it's over 70 to 80 percent everywhere in the country democrats and republicans i've said this before the country's not divided it's the politics of a country it's the politicians that are dividing the politics coming out of our capital and in washington dc and out of every state is forcing you to take a side are you from this side or this side what do you believe or what don't you believe you look at this basically cable news or you're on social platforms and you don't know what to believe and everyone says well the country's divided it's not the country people want to work together they want to make common sense decisions that works for them and their lives and we're the ones basically holding something back as common sense as being able to allow medicare to negotiate for lower prices lower drug prices that seems like the easiest lift at all on top of that then you have the price of insulin why life-saving insulin this is not new break breakthrough drugs that we don't know how to handle there's all types of iteration of that but you know i can tell you that we're going to do something there i'm working with a group and we have a piece of legislation that's going to cap the price of 35 a month that's the maximum anybody should pay out of pocket and it just makes all the sense in the world i've also supported importing drugs from canada if the loans have been proven safe by the fda it's ridiculous for us to pay the highest prices in the world on the drugs that we bring to market for and have the americans paying the highest price for the world to enjoy life-saving drugs that we can't afford something's wrong with that scenario i can tell you that so we're fighting hard on that and trying to bring that directly into relationship and cost with uh canada and other countries canada uh has been willing to work with us on that we're working through some of the different exchanges back and forth but if when we talked about medicare advantage and medicare part d the insulin prices should be capped talking about drugs from canada the fda should be working with the canadians to making sure that we can have drugs especially when there's been a sharp price increase for an off patent drug that means it's not on patent anymore but there's been a spike in the pricing we should be able to do that because a single manufacturer can control they makes basically monopolize it the the senior cost drug drug cost act which would provide transparency to hold pbms the problem is right now we don't know where the cost savings are going we don't know why it's not giving back to the patient uh and the pbms basically are not transparent it's profit-making they're some of the three largest companies in the in the country are pbms that were established because they have a they have a monopoly to to negotiate the pricing everything you do has to go through that and that has to stop and we're going to work on that one too um i have uh in march i also led a group of 30 bipartisan senators sending the letter to cms administrator brooks leshore urging to finalize the proposed rule that's going to stop all retroactive direct and indirect remuneration fees another way prescription drug prices are driven up for hardworking seniors the solvency of medicare 2026 we become insolvent and we haven't done anything so if we don't get our financial house in order i can continue i can guarantee you it'll continue these prices will continue to increase out-of-pocket will continue to increase and more hardship on and people with fixed incomes is going to be almost insurmountable this is something that we're working on immediately to fix that to extend that insolvency on medicare and we can do that by getting these prices under control which would give us a long long life if you will and fd heart one of the best quotes that i think fdr ever made but basically he he uh he walked the walk and what he talked but he said the test of our progress is not weather we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little and as we grow older and you start living on fixed incomes and you have no control over inflation and what we're dealing with is it's affecting every person it affects people on fixed incomes more than anybody else and the seniors are affected more by this because you have no other means to offset that except if we have some controls in place to keep it from rising in this country we as a nation we have to bring our finances in order get our financial house in order we can do that the drug pricing is something we all agree on if we do nothing else this year i think we can do a lot more but if we do nothing more this year that's the one thing that must be done a lot of times they hold something that's that popular and try to say well if we put this in this bill here it'll help this bill get passed the waiting game is over the time to act is now so i'm going to do everything i can to make sure this happens and we're negotiating on a lot of things right now we're going to see to make sure this is the first the highest thing on the order to get done it's really comes down for me it's all about west virginia and the people of west virginia but every senator in the country right now has the same concerns for some reason they don't have the same desire to act i can't figure that one out but i can tell you i'm going to do all i can so i want to thank arp you're always there on the front for us galen's been fighting this is something she's passionate and she's passionate tom you and the whole and all the support staff you all give us every time you get a chance to talk to somebody that's had that you have as your representative elected official make sure they understand there's no reason why we don't do this all you gotta do is put up a vote there's no reason why we can't get this on the board to be voted on and they're playing games with it it's time to stop playing games let's vote but thank you god bless you god bless the great state of west virginia and may god continue to bless the united states of america

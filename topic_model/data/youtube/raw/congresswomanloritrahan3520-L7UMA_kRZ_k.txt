good evening and thank you to everyone for joining us for our second teletown hall whether you're joining us for the first time or coming back after last week's discussion welcome the kovid 19 pandemic continues to evolve by the hour and my priority is making sure that you and your families have the information and support that you need to stay healthy and safe my office has been assisting constituents day and night getting connected with resources they need to stay on their feet we've been working with the fda and the health and human services to advance potentially game-changing technology to improve covid19 testing we've been advancing local production of personal protective equipment otherwise known as ppe we've been even been able to help get some constituents home who had been stranded abroad so please don't hesitate to call us we are living through unprecedented times we must remain mindful that every single one of us has an urgent responsibility to lessen the impact of this crisis all of the small and perhaps uncomfortable life adjustments we've been asked to make social distancing washing our hands all too frequently disinfecting surfaces regularly and frankly just staying home it all helps flatten the curb it ensures that our health care workers can meet the surge of patients and it ultimately saves lives we can and we will get through this together as we continue to confront the health component of this crisis everything we do as leaders and as citizens should continue to give assurance to workers that their jobs will be secure and that we won't let our small businesses fail and that for as long as our lives are disrupted we will be there for each other in moments of great need we rally together and we put the greater good above all else it's who we are as americans we see what happens when our leaders resort to pettiness or prejudice or knee-jerk tendencies toward blaming others our neighbors get hurt a regrettable reality for our asian-american community right now please remember xenophobia only harms us and it's incumbent on all of us to stand strong and uphold our values like you i've made a lot of changes at home and at work my two daughters are home from public elementary school until at least may 4th my husband and i are competing for home office space which all represent it all presents you know challenges on its own my mom who i've come to rely on for help with my girls she's been at home with my dad who has ms for the last two weeks we've had to cease physical contact relying only on face time tonight i plan on taking safety precautions by driving down to washington dc rather than flying to vote on the third emergency funding package and i've transitioned my staff here in massachusetts and in washington over to telework procedures so that we can adhere to social distance protocols and mitigate virus spreads no effort is too small or too big especially when we are discussing taking care of our health care workers they are on the front lines working around the clock to save lives all too often lacking the protective equipment they need to keep themselves and their families safe the wealthiest country on earth should be more than capable of providing masks tests and ventilators to our nation's hospitals clinics and community health centers an effective response to this pandemic requires a wartime footing and that means invoking the defense production act in the absence of our administration executing the fact our office is actively soliciting information from manufacturers in the district with excess capacity that want to repurpose their facilities for producing ppe additionally i co-sponsored legislation to force the issue at scale the medical supply chain emergency act takes over the federal supply chain for protective equipment and ensures that health care providers and first responders have what they need to keep themselves and their families safe earlier this week i also joined with congressman ro connor from california and other colleagues to call on president trump to institute a mandatory national two-week stay-at-home order it is the most effective thing we can do to protect people and mitigate long-term economic damage in the meantime congress is working diligently to get working people and small businesses the assistance that they need to survive on march 6 president trump signed congress's first emergency supplemental package to the tune of 8.3 billion it consisted of entirely new funds and included support for state and local health agencies vaccine and treatment development and loans for affected small businesses to lessen the economic blow of this public health emergency money from this package is now starting to work its way into our communities two weeks ago congress took decisive action once more when we passed the family's first coronavirus response act which provides emergency paid leave establishes free coronavirus testing supports expanded unemployment benefits ensures food assistance for vulnerable children and families while they're home from school protects front line health workers and provides additional funding to states for the ongoing economic consequences of the pandemic the president signed that package into law last week and finally of course within the next 24 hours i'll be voting with my colleagues in the house to pass a critical two trillion dollar coronavirus aid relief and economic security package like any legislation of this size the cares act isn't perfect but it's a necessary robust and urgent response to the pain and anxiety that workers families and small businesses are feeling right now this package will send direct cash payments to more than 150 million american households it will set up substantial loan programs for businesses to help them survive this downturn it will pump billions of dollars into unemployment insurance programs to meet the unprecedented increase in unemployment it will greatly boost spending on hospitals they will have their own marshall plan it will expand financial assistance to state and local governments to make sure they're able to continue their own response to this pandemic and it will expand funding for child care services and community health care centers two priorities of mine this legislation is important but we all have a duty as members of our community to keep ourselves and our families safe and healthy especially our seniors and our immune vulnerable here on this call to lend their expertise i'm pleased to welcome dr zondra kelly the chief medical officer at the greater lawrence family health center mr bob nelson the district director of the small business administration's massachusetts office and dr eric w dixon president and ceo of umass memorial healthcare i'd like to thank you all again for joining us tonight and we'll turn it over to our experts who can give a little more insight into the virus and our response let's start with some brief introductions up first dr sandra kelly chief medical officer for the greater lawrence family health center welcome thank you so much congresswoman trahan and thank you for bringing us together to speak today about the coronavirus um so my name is andrew kelly and i'm a family physician by training my medical degree is from the university of chicago and my residency training was at the lawrence family medicine residency here at the greater lawrence family health center where i'm currently the chief medical officer and a faculty member for our family medicine residency program our health center sees all patients including children adults pregnant patients and the elderly we are located in lawrence massachusetts about 30 miles north of boston we serve around 60 000 patients and our staff provide both office and hospital care we have more than 60 physicians around 20 nurse practitioner pas and around 40 resident physicians in training i'm honored to be a part of this teletown hall and look forward to answering your questions thanks thank you dr kelly the greater lawrence family health center is doing such incredible work for so many in our community next we have mr bob nelson district director of the small business administration here in massachusetts uh thank you congresswoman tran for your leadership and for inviting me to be part of today's call and to share information with everyone about the sba in our programs and services uh for a little background on me i started off as a a banker a long time ago but for the past 29 years i've been with the federal government i started off with the fdic during the banking crisis in new england in the early 1990s when banks were failing left and right here in new england but for the past 21 years i've worked for the sba 11 years of which i've been the state director and responsible for the effective delivery of sba's programs and services across the commonwealth um uh proud to be part of the sba and i absolutely believe that i have one of the best and most productive sba offices in the entire country each year with the help of our lenders and our partners we do roughly 700 million in capital support to massachusetts small businesses and that's massachusetts alone and we counsel and train uh thousands of small businesses so that they can be successful and the sba also plays a critical role with government contracting and helping to make sure that small businesses get their fair share of government contracts and lastly why we're all here today the sba is the agency that's charged with helping small businesses to recover from disasters i can tell you that this disaster is unlike anything i've ever experienced in my career and nothing that i ever would have imagined i thank you again and i look forward to hearing the questions and providing the best guidance that i have available thank you congresswoman which makes your contribution to this session tonight so valuable thank you bob and it last last but certainly not least dr eric dixon president and ceo of umass memorial healthcare thank you congresswoman and thank you all for being on the call today my name is eric dixon i am a emergency physician who's also trained by the us army as a respiratory therapist to run ventilator machines that you're hearing so much about and a proud graduate of the state's only public medical school umass i now serve also as the ceo of umass memorial healthcare located in worcester leominster fitchburg marlborough clinton and many of the other towns in and around central massachusetts i just want to say thank you to everyone out there for the sacrifices that you are making by keeping your distance and social distancing uh cutting down on your social activities and not gathering in large groups being relentless about hand hygiene and disinfecting because what you're doing right now is helping us save lives and by keeping the burden of disease in this state down to a manageable level such that the health care system can keep up so thank you for all that you're doing and thank you for having me on the call great so thank you so much thank you for those introductions and without further delay let's get right into the questions now we've received hundreds of questions through our submission portal and we did our best to select questions that were widely reflective of your concerns and we'll continue to do our best to answer all the remaining questions we can uh following this call but dr dixon the first question is for you it's from paulie r in concord she asks what is the state of covid19 testing and medical personnel protection in our district well those are probably two of the most important topics related to the the treatment and the identification of patients with coronavirus disease right now testing is still limited we are only testing individuals that are sick enough to be in the hospital and individuals that are working in health care situations including first responders police fire ems and those that work in nursing homes because they play such a vital role in the health care system and preventing the spread of this disease over overall the test turnaround time is in the range of 24 hours now in the region and what we really need is a point of care test that can turn around in 45 minutes we believe that's coming and but that probably won't have that at least for another month that would allow us to test much more broadly in the in the population and identify who is potentially carrying this disease and spreading this disease so uh testing is a very very important topic and we'll hopefully we'll continue to make progress on that the lack of testing then lends to use of personal protective equipment ppe on patients that you suspect have the disease and you're waiting for the test to turn around so early on every patient with respiratory symptoms had to be put on precautions and we had to use our personal protective equipment and use it up because we didn't have a test that would come back fast enough to to remove that patient from the isolation precautions so our supply of ppe in this region is dwindled um we uh we hear that we're uh hopefully going to get some release from the federal government of some stores we have not received that yet um and we're probably living off about a week supply right now and working every day probably on this more than anything else right now to get the equipment in that our caregivers need to keep our patients and to keep themselves safe thank you dr dixon dr kelly you may be best suited to answer our next question from tom r he asks what does this crisis tell us about the gaps in our public health and information resources great thank you so much for that excellent question first to start a little bit with controlling a pandemic such as this it's best begun when the number of infected individuals is low so early on one of the keys as dr dickson was just saying is to be able to test and then we could track those patients who were infected and this would allow us to educate on how to isolate and further track the contacts of that person so that we could ask them to quarantine themselves and unfortunately this was a gap that did not happen in our country because we were unable to do those tests so we did not know who had the disease and who did not um we knew that coronavirus was in our midst though because of the symptoms our patients were presenting with but we were not able to test them to know and so a lot of these patients went home from our outpatient clinic sites with instructions about how to isolate themselves to try to help them to not pass it to others but isolation for many people is very difficult especially in homes where people may have many people living together in a small space and they don't have any spare rooms to serve as isolation rooms at home and it's extremely difficult for people who may be homeless staying with a friend or living in a shelter and these are some of the situations that we're facing in our community is how can we help to curb the spread when we don't really have adequate space for the people in our community to be able to isolate themselves and practice what we are encouraging them to do so because we're unable to test people we did miss that first phase of actually tracking people's contacts and having them stay home so now we're into the second phase which we call community spread as everyone's heard about and that's when the individuals are sick but we have no idea who they came into contact with that infected them they don't know who they got it from and we don't either so last week at our clinic sites we started seeing up to 80 patients a day with respiratory symptoms i'm sure they didn't all have coronavirus but i'm sure many of them did and so with not being able to test of course they went home with instructions and i'm just learning today that we have a number of seriously ill patients requiring a ventilator at our local hospital which was zero on monday and today is at 11 so it's increasing very quickly we started to be able to send out these tests last week around wednesday for our outpatients and unfortunately these tests took five to six days to be completed and result which means we didn't get the results until around monday or tuesday so this was um as dr dixon said a huge gap in our ability to respond we have gotten some tests that turn around a little bit more quickly now so we're getting more positive tests one of the other things that we were kind of unprepared for was right now we really need to not have patients come into the clinics for face-to-face visits because we are trying to keep people from congregating together but very few offices were doing what we call telehealth until last week so since last monday we have put an extraordinary effort towards converting almost all of our visits into telephone or video enabled visits so that patients can stay home and not be exposed to other patients who may be presenting with illness at our clinic sites and many of the other offices in the area are doing the same thing and you probably are seeing that in your area as well um i just i think another gap just across the whole country is our broader system of health care was not um prepared or didn't have any reserves in place for a surge of illness like this so i'm sure you've all heard about the shortage in ppe or personal protective equipment which continues to be an extremely concerning reality for those working on the front lines and we don't have uh backup medical personnel or sufficient backup equipment for a crisis like this one so to summarize i think one of the gaps was our lack of ability to test as we've talked about another one was that we weren't really ahead of the game in terms of education or putting together some housing options to help people to isolate themselves um thirdly we didn't have a system in place um for any virtual visits of health care system and i think the last thing is just an overall broader sense of not having the capacity or the backup to be able to handle a large volume of ill citizens like this but if we can do what's called flattening the curve that will space out the number of people who are seriously ill and not have a huge spike and that will be accomplished by people being able to stay at home and so i think the medical community is really increasing our capacity we're learning quickly and we're adjusting as fast as we can so with the help of you and all the communities understanding to stay home and keep themselves healthy we can get through this together well thank you dr kelly it is in large part why we do this um so that everyone is empowered on how we can delay uh that surge and i imagine there will be many many more lessons to wring out uh when the time comes uh uh so that you know we put proper uh healthcare and public policy uh in place for for any uh other you know future crisis i'll switch gears now this this next question is one that i get uh from small business from the small business community uh so it's great to have you on the line bob eric s wants to know what is the status of assistance for small businesses today great thank you for that question the sba worked very closely with the governor's office the mass office of uh housing and economic development in mema and we were able to get a quick application into the sba for a disaster declaration in massachusetts and we got a declaration last wednesday the 18th massachusetts was one of the early states to get a full statewide declaration and what that did is it made economic injury disaster loans available to small businesses in non-profits these are direct loans from the sba these are not processed through our lending partners like our normal uh loan program so direct loans from the sba small businesses and private nonprofits would apply by going on to sba's disaster loan portal which is sba.gov slash disaster uh these loans are up to two million dollars the interest rate is 3.75 for small businesses fixed for the life of the loan with terms of up to 30 years for private nonprofits the interest rate is 2.75 percent again fixed for the life of the loan uh with terms up to up to two years the proceeds of these loans are for working capital purposes so that businesses have some uh capital so that they can pay bills that they otherwise would have been able to pay with cash flow had the disaster not occurred so think of uh rent payments uh debt service payments payroll utilities any of the normal working capital needs that a business would have the economic injury loan proceeds could be used to meet those obligations one of the recent changes that sba made within just a couple days which i think is really significant is we've we're now implementing an immediate 12-month deferment on those loans i know small businesses are concerned about taking on new debt at this time of uncertainty so at least we're uh reducing some stress on their part with them knowing that they're not going to have to make payments on the sba's economic injury loan for a full 12 months one of the other things that we've done is and we're continuing to tweak the process as days go on and i continue to learn new things daily we know that it is critical to get capital into the hands of small businesses yesterday uh you know for the past week and a half two weeks uh our phone calls and emails have been off the hook with small businesses looking for information and guidance on how to access the economic injury loan program how it works uh what are the what are the terms who's eligible so i can tell you that you know small businesses we're encouraging you to apply i know there's a lot of talk about the stimulus bill that is about to be signed there's certainly a lot of money in that bill for the sba and there will be new programs but at this point in time what we're suggesting that all small businesses do is apply for the economic injury disaster loan through the sba disaster website uh these uh the funds on these loans are a critical lifeline to help small businesses to survive and recover this is the work that sba does you know when you think of floods hurricanes tornadoes you know this is the the mandate of the sba to help you know small businesses to recover and so again uh that's just one of the the tools that we currently have we we did introduce and push out to our lending partners a new uh program that has become available it's called an express bridge loan uh so an express bridge loan would be processed through our lending partners it's a loan of up to twenty five thousand dollars it's not a lot of money but uh under the express bridge loan pr program we provide a guarantee to the bank in order to help them get comfortable and to say yes uh with the sba economic injury loan program it is a process we have been given guidance that it could take up to 21 days for a decision by the sba but i can tell you you know we've had a declaration for just a little bit more than a week there have been approvals uh all across new england so applications certainly are going through quicker than 21 days but that's the guidance that we're telling folks and it could take another five to seven days for closing in funding on that loan so the express bridge loan is a tool that a small business can work with their existing lender their existing sba express lender to get some immediate cash so that they can make some payments on their obligations and to provide them with some capital and the in most instances the express bridge loan would be paid off with the uh economic injury loan once that is approved and funded the other thing that we've been doing we we have such a strong network of lenders here in the commonwealth each year about 135 different lenders use our program we've been talking to our lenders about providing payment deferments on existing sba borrowers we do a lot of sba loans as you heard me mentioned earlier so for borrowers out there you know our lenders are processing deferments uh these can be anywhere from three months up to six months so it's another uh way that we're trying to reduce the stress in the immediate concerns of uh having to make debt payments on your existing sba loans the other thing that the sba administrator announced is that for existing sba disaster loan borrowers their their payments are automatically deferred through 1231 of this year but the the other thing that i just want to stress is that the sba we have an incredible partner network with the small business development centers our score organization the center for women and enterprise these are folks everyone is working remotely but they're accessible and they have all been trained on the sba economic injury loan program we're going to continue to train our partners uh as new programs are released so that they can work directly with the small business community all across the commonwealth but uh you know definitely if you if you're uh wondering how to access local resources what i would suggest that businesses do is go on to the sba massachusetts website which is sba.gov m a you can see a button to search for local resources you'll also see a button to sign up for our email blast i would encourage everyone to sign up for our email blast this is one of the major ways that we're going to continue to communicate with the entire community to let them know about the most recent programs and services and accurate in current information great thank you so much bob and i'm looking forward to voting uh tomorrow so that uh we can unleash the help that we know is in this uh this next package so more is on the way uh i'm going to take this next question it's from hank m in marlborough and he asks how is the federal government working with the commonwealth of massachusetts to supplement our health care system and emergency response so hank this is an all hands on deck problem and we all need to be all in to solve it that means working closely with state regional and local agencies you know since day one we've been in constant communication uh with governor baker and secretary sutters with agencies like sba's massachusetts district office and certainly our state and local officials our congressional delegation has been ringing the alarms on behalf of the commonwealth not just to the administration but to all federal agencies to the health and human services secretary azar we demanded an update on the status of massachusetts request for personal protective equipment from the strategic national stockpile to the white house coronavirus task force we called for evaluation of funding needs at state and local public health facilities we requested supplemental funding as necessary and greater access to testing kits and certainly encouraged wrap around services for coronavirus patients moving forward we are also in close coordination with our local hospitals and our va system this virus has left no one untouched and the fight will take all of us you know as i mentioned the phase three package is approaching the finish line this is the biggest economic relief package in modern history it's bigger than the 2008 economic relief package of 700 billion dollars it essentially injects two trillion dollars in assistance to workers families and businesses during this pandemic it's new money on top of what's already been funded to help uh strange state and local governments some of our biggest priorities in that package include billions in direct cash payments of 1200 or more per household 350 billion dollars in loans and grants to small businesses 150 billion to help state and local response and prevention efforts over 100 billion dollars to help stabilize hospitals and community health centers and to cover unreimbursed health care expenses along with a massive temporary expansion of unemployment benefits look i know that some like to focus on the stock market but i would urge everyone to focus your attention on the health crisis and the health crisis first and foremost we need people to be well it's the only path to restoring confidence and breathing life back into the economy think about it people are home they're unemployed there's no demand and frankly there's very limited supply these these are unprecedented dynamics and they'll you know they'll continue if we don't focus on securing our public health we do that by strengthening our health care system our emergency response and protecting our health care workers okay let's get back to the experts dr kelly our next question is from colin w from sudbury and he writes i'm hearing anecdotal evidence of people contracting the virus who were seemingly very careful they only went out for groceries they made six they maintained six feet of separation and now i'm paranoid that i or my loved ones will contract the virus despite our best efforts what's your advice on how to not live in fear while still being cautious and attentive to the guidelines thank you so much for that question and uh also thank you so much for maintaining your six feet of separation and staying at home because that is really what's going to help us in this situation so my best advice is to stay home and stay healthy so as most people have heard there are some key factors to preventing the spread of the virus and that doesn't mean a hundred percent but it certainly um helps us keep our families and ourselves healthy so that social distance and that includes if you need to go to a doctor's office for example try calling first and see if they can provide you service or over the phone a lot of places are doing that now and also washing your hands the soap and water for 20 seconds or using hand sanitizer be very careful about covering your cough or sneeze so um making sure that your elbow blocks that cough or sneeze from spreading further in the room or use a tissue that can cover your face and then throw it away the other thing that i think is extremely hard to do they actually have done studies on this is to avoid touching your eyes your nose and your mouth so that is the way that germs get into your body um besides just coming through the air someone's coughing or sneezing so wash your hands and then be very careful i know it's very hard every time i want to go towards my face i think oh i should you know bring that hand down and stop touching my face so um i think they do some studies where people do it 20 times an hour so i know it's hard to do but that's a big one um you can also sanitize the high touch surfaces like doorknobs and faucets and things like that and also if you're if you're still going to any type of workplace if you're a healthcare provider or other essential person to make sure that doorknobs and faucets are being cleaned so a lot of these measures are not comfortable i mean personally for myself i'm a hugger and it can feel very awkward to not be able to greet people the way i normally would but these are so important to the health and safety of our community in times like this um the other things that i would really recommend to keep yourself as healthy as possible is to get adequate sleep and that means around eight or nine hours a night um doing some exercise regularly and making sure you're eating healthfully so i know these are recommendations that are easy to say and not as easy to do but this might be a good time to redouble your efforts towards healthy habits because your immune system really depends on that adequate sleep and it can be in the best shape possible to weather the storm if we're eating well exercising and getting adequate sleep thanks so much for the question thank you the uh you can't hear those recommendations enough i'll tell you especially when you have a five-year-old i can't believe how many times i've asked for her to please keep her her fingers away from her eyes or ears and her nose and mouth um this next question is for you dr dickson uh if you could take it from uh lori w from dracut she just basically wants to know what is the current procedure uh if you think you have symptoms what what should uh what should people like laurie do it's an excellent common question so if you have a fever and a cough runny nose into a lesser extent a sore throat and feel very tired there's a chance you have a coronavirus the vast majority of people that have coronavirus are going to have four or five days of symptoms and then they're going to feel better and that's the natural course of the disease some will go on and become sicker the only people that need to be tested now to know for certain if they have the virus because there is no treatment is health care workers including those that are in ems fire first responders anyone working in a nursing home or anybody that is on dialysis because if you're going into a dialysis center that includes people that work in skilled nursing facilities and rehabilitation facilities as well we have to know if you have coronavirus because we really need to keep you out of work so that you don't infect anyone else in fact if you have those symptoms regardless if you have coronavirus you should not be going to work until you're at least three days symptom free so most people that want to get tested for coronavirus we don't test them because we have to save that testing capability for the sickest patients and the health care workers where we really need to know if they have the virus not to treat it but instead to prevent the spread of the infection segregate yourself from the family drink lots of fluids and in general even if you have it in three to five days you're going to be feeling a whole lot better now sometimes the disease progresses into a lower respiratory tract infection that's a pneumonia and you start to have symptoms of shortness of breath and your oxygen level going low is the cause of that shortness of breath you may also have a low blood pressure from it and start to feel light-headed with standing not just a little bit but persistently not just shortness of breath with coughing because we all experience that but if you walk up a flight of stairs and you find yourself breathing heavy that's a sign that you need to be seen in the emergency department and checked for a lower respiratory tract infection and if you have that any low oxygen level any low blood pressure we will then test you for coronavirus because we're likely going to admit you to the hospital and we have to make sure you're segregated into an area so we can't spread the infection in some instances and it's relatively rare the disease progresses and people end up in the intensive care unit requiring a chemical ventilation and as scared as everybody is about that it's a very small population of those that are infected especially the elderly infected that are that progress to that point in the disease so what i would say is if you're young healthy and are not a healthcare worker in some way stay home segregate yourself drink lots of fluids you're gonna be better in three to five days and don't go back to work until you're three days symptom free regardless of what the cause of the infection is great great advice thank you [Music] miss bob our next small business question comes from john f he asks as a small business owner who recently had to lay off 135 employees due to restrictions surrounding covid19 what are the best options for me to consider regarding sba emergency funding thank you john for that question when we hear of a business having to lay off hundreds of employees it speaks to the seriousness of this current disaster and uh you know it was announced earlier today that unemployment claims soared to 3.3 million last week it really is an unprecedented situation but what we're encouraging all small businesses that have suffered economic injury that they apply for sba's uh economic injury disaster loan what small businesses and private nonprofits should know is that there's no cost to apply for the sba loan there's no requirement that you close on the loan if it gets approved if you do close on the loan and it gets funded and a better alternative an option for you comes down the road you can pay off the sba economic injury loan with no penalty there's no penalty at any time so again there's going to be new tools in the toolbox for sba to help small businesses through the stimulus bill i would encourage uh everyone to stay connected with the sba through our email updates and to work with us but as far as being able to demonstrate economic injury there's no mathematical formula if you have a reduction in revenues and sales or even if you're projecting because of closures that you're going to have economic injury we suggest that you apply for this uh economic injury loan and to get your application in the queue it is uh processed on a first-come first-served basis and since massachusetts got its declaration the entire 50 states now have declarations and everyone is in the process of trying to apply for these thank you bob i have a just a follow-up on that how quickly do you imagine the sba will be able to stand up the bill's new small business resources like the paycheck protection program i mean is it too early for small businesses to begin reaching out to you and we've been hearing from a number of small businesses about this issue from our office and including a bookstore uh that i've long uh gone to in andover and we're just wondering what they can do as they uh anticipate you uh standing up these new resources that are coming in congresswoman this is going to be a huge priority for the sba to stand up this program and to to deliver for the small business community across the entire country we've been getting calls you know asking how do i apply for this lenders saying how do we do this what do we do it really is uh very early because the bill hasn't been fully approved and signed off by the president but trust that this is going to be a priority for everyone within the sba as i mentioned we're working extended hours working weekends once this gets approved we get talking points and messaging is you know we're going to be on the road communicating with the community with the most current guidance in order to help them to make decisions and hopefully to get access to the capital that they need great uh thank you thank you so much for that um i'm going to take this question it's from marianne b she asks what are you doing to help hospital workers who need child care in order to keep working during the crisis and will massachusetts enable workers to find professional child care workers and subsidize that care so mary ann my my mom raised us my three sisters and me uh while while working in child care today i'm i'm raising two young girls ages five and seven so as a daughter of a child care provider and a working mom myself it's plainly obvious to me that america's child care crisis is an economic crisis covert 19 has exposed our nation to this uh problem in ways that have really [Music] stressed our system we have parents who can't stay home to watch their kids because they're on the front lines of this pandemic caring for patients and hospitals and community health centers assisting customers at grocery stores or or running small businesses to stay afloat on march 18 the governor issued an emergency order requiring all early education centers and child care providers to close but in lieu of these closures the state created exempt emergency child care programs to provide child care with priority given to families of emergency personnel medical staff and others playing a critical role in confronting the coronavirus these will be the only child care program operating during the covet 19 outbreak in massachusetts and during this time subsidies from the state can be used for payroll in addition to front line health care personnel families of essential employees like your neighborhood neighborhood grocery store clerk your gas station employee they will also have access to these child care centers furthermore priority will be given to vulnerable populations and communities my staff and i have advocated for these uh child care centers to be opened in places like lawrence lowell haverhill marlborough and fitchburg it's plain as day that investing in child care is central to our nation's economic health and stability and for far too long the child care sector has been starved of the public funds resulting in both providers and families operating on the margins so as we advance this package and the legislation that follows congress must act swiftly to provide robust federal funding for local providers our child care workers and our centers so that our families and economy can remain whole okay we are this hour goes by so quickly um i think we have a time for another quick round of questions i'm going to start with dr kelly as the chief medical officer for one of the state's leading community health centers um please take this important question from sheila oh and methuen what financial measures are being put in place to support community health centers in this critical work thank you so much for that question for caring about community health centers so prior to the changes uh with coronavirus we were not able to do those phone or video enabled visits i was talking about so that's been huge for us and it just changed last week so that we can now continue to see our patients virtually and still um be paid as if we were seeing them in person so this allows us to continue our vital functions now by switching over to these virtual visits there are also a number of funding packages and i know congresswoman trahan's doing tireless work to support us in trying to weather this storm together at the moment with the current losses that community health centers are experiencing it's estimated that they'll run out of funding in about 37 days i mean i've been speaking to a lot of other chief medical officers at community health centers across massachusetts and a lot of the discussion is around how to keep their doors open and what to do with employees such as purdue and putting them on furlough so it's definitely a scary time for our community health centers who really are on a mission to remain the backbone of basic health care for our communities i certainly appreciate the question though and all the support that we continue to receive from congresswoman trahan as we work through these unchartered waters so there's definitely some positive there great bob this one is for you gary s from hudson wants to know how do self-employed small business taxpayers impact along with events and entertainment service businesses musicians artists 1099ers and gig economy taxpayers get some financial relief okay uh thank you gary for that question so sole proprietorships are certainly eligible for the uh economic injury disaster loan program there's actually a separate application for sole proprietorships on our disaster uh portal it's form 5c all other forms of business uh entities are through form five but uh when you think of uh a sole proprietorship it's important to note that uh sba is going to be looking to see that income and expenses are being reported on the personal tax return with the schedule c uh businesses that are 1099s would certainly be eligible if they're reporting the income through the schedule c it but it's important to know that the applicant cannot be a hobby it really really needs to be a small business and it comes down to if they have a business and are filing tax returns as a business owner on a schedule c or other tax form we consider them uh to be eligible and we encourage them to apply terrific thank you i think we have time for two more questions so dr dixon this is a broad question and you might have already touched on it but sherry h from lowell asks what is being done to support our hospitals well the easy answer is from the executive branch of the federal government not enough and not enough fast enough and the executive branch exists to be able to act quickly without the passing of new laws and there was a strategic reserve of ppe that critical equipment that we need to protect our patients and our people and it just has not arrived and we're a month into this and so um you know that's that's very concerning and hopefully now the federal government is is at the executive branches is starting to take some action and we just saw the first uh bolus of equipment come to the state and now that will be divided up amongst the hospitals that need it most and because you're from lowell i have to say jody white the ceo of circle health and lawrence and lowell general hospital is also the chairman of the board for the mass hospital association and he's been a tireless advocate for your region and your hospitals and others to try to get that equipment distributed out to the hospitals i think what one of the most amazing things that has occurred for us in our hospitals is that the community has has come together and the businesses and the dona and the the only outside help we've been getting today really with equipment and our needs has been from businesses donating masks and face shields and um and in some situations uh dollars to help the organization get through this the we have pallet loads of things that have been donated by construction companies who use n95 masks during installation uh procedures and other things so you know been incredibly touched by how the community locally has come together to support its hospitals and have had the opposite reaction in terms of the federal government's response now thankfully with um congresswoman trahan and congress and mcgovern and congressman neil have really led a charge to have to get these bills through which will get some support to hospitals and i i just thank the stars every day that uh that we have the the right party in control of the house right now because i'm not sure where this would be this legislation would be if we didn't uh everything you say about what we're seeing on the on the community level is um it's really unbelievable we've heard so many stories uh but you know when brown uh from hayward hospital was recently talked uh telling us about how you know an auto mechanic a local auto mechanic came down with you know a few masks that he had just to donate them to the hospital so it is touching what folks are doing at the ground and community level i'm going to take this last question from jorge he asks direct economic assistance should be provided to each american adult what steps are being taken to provide households with direct economic assistance so jorge i don't need to convince anyone that working families they are the biggest brunt of this economic downturn they live paycheck to paycheck with no source of passive income often without rainy day funds or savings to fall back on i know this intimately well i grew up in a family just like it last wednesday the president signed congress's second stimulus package which supports low income and working families it included new federal funding such as a billion dollars to social safety net programs like snap and wic but as this pandemic grows these families are still stuck in a precarious economic position and it's imperative that phase three provides direct immediate support such as direct payments to low and middle income families greater social safety net benefits suspension of loan repayments enhanced tax rate tax credits and health care benefits housing assistance and so much more the package that congress is currently considering provides twelve hundred dollars in direct aid per adult as well as five hundred dollars per child in households that aid called a recovery rebate is maintained at full value for individuals earning up to seventy five thousand dollars or a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for couples then the recovery rebate is incrementally reduced until it phases out for those earning more than 99 000 there's there's no time to waste we must put money directly into the pockets of individuals and uh and families so i think i think that's all the time that we have uh for tonight at this these go by so quickly um i'd like to once again thank uh dr sandra kelly uh mr bob nelson and dr eric dixon for sharing so much vital information with us and i want to thank everyone who dialed in uh for an easy way to stay updated on the federal and state response as well as information on future teletown halls please follow me on social media at rep lori trahan and if there's any advice i can impart on you it's that we all have a role to play and i think dr kelly explained it better than i could but it's worth repeating that staying home and keeping your distance from others go a long way to preventing the spread of coronavirus coughing and sneezing into your sleeve frequently washing your hands and sanitizing surfaces it can't be overstated i want to thank you all for tuning in tonight may you stay healthy and safe good night

I'm a small businessman and I know that government and specifically Congress can help create an atmosphere for job creation and improve the economy by letting companies thrive by cutting red tape holding back growth lowering taxes and simply by understanding that the private sector not the government sector creates those jobs to do this we must implement some common-sense solutions that will get America back to work that's why I'm happy to support the plan for Americas job creators it empowers families and small businesses those are often the same and entrepreneurs well they're going to do that by empowering small businesses and reducing regulatory burdens we do that by fixing the tax code by making it flatter and fair by increasing in competitiveness for many American manufacturers by battling back unnecessary regulations encouraging innovative ideas and entrepreneurship that's an important one maximizing American energy production both offshore and inland and by paying down America's debt and putting us on the path to living within our means just like your and my family's have to do every day with our own budgets thanks again for your questions I'd love to hear your ideas for job creation and economic growth as well as your responses to my thoughts send them to me at facebook.com backslash rep Huizinga or here on youtube at youtube com backslash rep Huizenga thanks again for the opportunity today

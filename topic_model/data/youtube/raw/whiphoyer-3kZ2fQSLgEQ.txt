minutes to the gentleman from Maryland the Democratic whip mr. Hoyer the genders recognize I thank the gentleman for yielding the speaker I have been here this is my 37th year this is the most reckless and irresponsible budget that I have seen in the 37 years that I have been here today we are considering the Senate's budget resolution not because the house supports it but because it is just a vehicle to get partisan tax reform strike that tax cut on an issue as consequential as tax reform the Congress should not be rushing to meet self-imposed political deadlines without enough time to read and analyze its effects more importantly we should not be considering a bill to cut taxes that is partisan and that is a and as as term as we are hearing the majority's proposal will be I say that because we still haven't seen the full details of a bill that this resolution provides for Republicans to jam through on an expedited process when they will reportedly introduce markup and bring to the floor in a few legislative days we have left before Thanksgiving is the sunshine too bright for you even my friends on the other side of the aisle don't know exactly how bad it will be for their constituents when asked about the details of the Republican bill representative Chris Collins a Republican from New York said we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know we don't know that's a Republican member of Congress who's saying he has no idea what this bill is empowering but we do know that based on a nonpartisan analysis of their framework it will raise taxes on 47 million Americans we know that 80% of the tax cut 80% of the tax cuts we'll go to the top 1% and we know as well that nearly half of all taxpayers with children 45 44.5% will see their taxes go up those same children will not be on the hook though st. Joe will be on the hook for a two point four trillion cost this is the biggest debt explosion of any bill that I have seen Republicans representative Matt Gaetz a Florida summed up today's vote as being for a budget let hear this my friends on both sides of the aisle this is Matt Gaetz Republican Florida summed up today's vote is being for a budget that quote nobody believes in so that we have a chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody's read that's not what we should be doing we ought to be working together to craft a bipartisan tax reform package that is revenue neutral it will be the height of hypocrisy to say that you're for fiscal discipline and to vote for this budget let's not risk our fiscal future and the economic security of our people defeat this resolution Jeff Kentucky reserves gentlelady from tuckies recognized Tennessee I'm sorry

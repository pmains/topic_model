commissioner chairman and thank you uh mr for appearing for us again um serious question we've already talked about ccs and boiler or koash and some of these other matters so i won't get into that but i am interested in the spruce mine and the fact that for 44 years the epa never used that authority to retroactively withdraw a permit but they've done in this case and i guess your the answer is you just gave the fact that you don't consider the economic impact before you make a decision and make a ruling i guess that that comes into play because the consequences of that decision uh have a chilling effect um not just certainly not just the coal industry but all industries that have a four or four or four or two permits if they have to make those applications you can pull them i talked to a bunch of bankers and they all said they're going to revisit their decision whether or not they will purchase any bonds or obligations if the epa for the first time now is entering it they can pull a permit so the consequences of your actions are are detrimental to the economic growth here in this country i i'm i'm surprised that you don't take that into consideration but i'll just have to cause this i was trying to make a distinction here the nac standard is really a health-based standard where cost is considered in the implementation not the standard itself i really want to spend more time on the clean water and safe drinking yeah that was one of more of a comment that i just hope you would be more considerate for the economic impact you're doing with some of the decisions but on the clean water and drinking act i really want to amplify a little bit on what angle and tomco their comments about that because and i think numbers of other people have made that same response do you agree with the president's priorities uh in his budget yes i certainly do um this is a this is a chart that i just wanted for for everyone to to maybe be able to cut a grasp because you you you made me suck in my breath when you said how much this the the president is investing in a clean water uh when you when you see that he is now his recommendation that you say you support is half what it was when he came into office he does not have a priority for funding the state revolving fund for clean water and clean drinking you can see the numbers dropped from 3.9 to 1.78 um but yet i see that other things you're when you have a chance of 555 million dollars you've reduced they've you because you're with him on this you're reducing the allocation into that account but you're increasing the money for climate change air quality and reinforcement mr i i've got to i hold a lot of town hall meetings and discussions with small communities in rural america they don't they're not concerned maybe to the level they should be but they're not as concerned about climate change or your enforcement they just want sewer and water lines and by virtue of the president slashing the money for sewer and water lines for water water quality that just that undermines all their hopes and dreams of being able to achieve some healthy environment in these small towns how do you react to that when you see that the president is not making it a priority to fund clean water well i i can answer that in a few few different ways congressman because it the president was clearly respecting the the bipartisan budget agreement that made that put challenges on epa in order to identify how we were going to expend our resources we did recognize that there was significant investment over the past five years during this administration well beyond what had been invested the prior eight we know that money is out and being expended we also know that the revolving fund that states have been operating for years is accruing significant revenues that that that is increasing the amount of money they can spend on these projects i think so also if i could mystery so look unfortunately the uh the chairman of the appropriations committee has gotten a hold of this and now he's stopping it and and reversing this this downward slide by increa by holding steady the amount of money we have for this i'm just going to reinforce again it's at the end these other issues of enforcement clean up our communities there may be that's not what america is worried about american citizens in these small towns want sewer and water lines and it's for you to take an arbitrary you said it was a tough decision think about what that decision is for those small towns where they're trying to improve their economy they're trying to get health i can tell you example after example people those little communities that have no money and no clean water and yet we put money into more environmental part of our consideration sir is how does climate actually exacerbate the challenges you know better we'll talk about that another day but you know it has nothing to do with climate change and you know that this time recognizing a gentleman from illinois mr kinsinger for five minutes well thank you mr chair and uh

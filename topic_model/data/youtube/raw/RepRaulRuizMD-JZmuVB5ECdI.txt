today we join together in celebration of LGBT pride month as a community we remember those men and women who across generations have made great strides in our fight towards equal rights in the past 10 years we have legalized gay marriage in 36 states ended Don't Ask Don't Tell and struck down the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and while we have made great progress there is still much work to do to advance equal rights for all the issue of marriage equality is being debated at all levels of government from city councils and state legislatures to the White House and the US Congress the fight continues right now the Supreme Court is considering a monumental case that will decide whether people have a constitutional right to marriage equality this historic case will have an incredible impact on the rights of people across our nation I hope to see the Supreme Court come down on the right side of history and expand the rights of LGBT Americans but no matter the outcome we will continue our fight for equal rights and we will not accept a patchwork of equality that leaves untold millions without the Equal Rights they deserve there are many loud voices that threaten to roll back the headway we have made but know that I will always be an advocate and a voice for equality because no matter your gender race age religion or who you love we all deserve equal rights under the law this LGBT pride month let us join together in declaring with one voice that we will not be silenced we will not be stopped and we will not rest until we achieve equal rights for all Americans

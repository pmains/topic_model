but in front of a big ship well done sir joining me now is Pennsylvania Democratic congresswoman Madeline Dean and Congressman condyloma Dean thank you for being here glad that we cleared up we did bring on a constitutional lawyer to debunk the idea that Donald Trump could core intent quarantine states just in case people had questions but now he has already been told by someone we don't know who that no you cannot do that so he's doing a strong advisory from the CDC instead what do you make of these reversals and double backflips that Trump keeps doing on the things he says he's going to do and the advice he's giving the public so I thank you for having me on tonight and I guess what I leaned upon is what you heard Nancy Pelosi say from the floor of the house yesterday and she said it over and over to our caucus as we've been on call after call ash the quotes Pope Francis who said he prays to enlighten those who are responsible for the common good I pray for this president to enlighten him that he is responsible for the common good and so not to just bow to the whims of somebody in Florida who said you're sending too many people who are sick down here we have to listen to the epidemiologists to the scientists to the doctors to dr. Falchi and the CDC and others to make sure we're doing the most effective things we can possibly do to stop the spread of this pandemic do you do you think it would help the public and not because of a partisan difference with him well Trump just stop talking stop doing public statements and let doctor foul Cheney be the only one that talks I thank you for asking me that I am so over the partisan difference and let me tell you something from literally from the floor of the house yesterday it was an extraordinary moment I've only been in Congress a little more than a year it's been a heck of a year but I will tell you that it was not a partisan day while there was some little small bickering and some silliness and obstruction by a single member of the Republican Party you saw a house United a house United in a historic bill that sends 2.2 trillion dollars in relief it's called the cares Act it's properly named that it is not a perfect bill but it is a robust bill that actually sends important resources to our hospitals to our state and local governments to our schools to small businesses to medium businesses and large important money to individuals and families so what I hope is that the president does quiet down listen to the experts follow their guidance so that the American family can have the confidence that their government has their back their government to lift them up and that this president will not get in the way of that let me play the governor of your state Pennsylvania Governor Tom wolf regarding the bill that you were just talking about the two trillion dollar relief bill take a listen we're still trying to figure as late as just a few hours ago at our daily staff meeting what what exactly is coming to Penn so we're working with government relations folks in Washington and our representatives in the House and the Senate to try to figure out exactly what it is coming to Pennsylvania and when it's coming we'll keep watching that but certainly appreciate the the timely action on the part of the the federal government and we know that one of the things that did come out of the pack so that's in the package is relief on student loans payments suspensions until September 30th for those paying back their student loans eligibility if the money was borrowed within the last ten years and interest not accruing during suspension I think that is an arguably good thing what would you say to Pennsylvanians who are you know are asking what they individually are going to receive and what the timeline is going to be I hope the timeline is as rapid as it can possibly be to Governor wolf who I've been on the phone with him and most importantly his entire administration throughout the course of the last month or six weeks on the corona buyer they've been at the forefront of it 150 billion dollars is going out to States to help them and local municipalities get through this epidemic and that's just one piece of this two trillion dollar bill another part of it is exactly what you just pointed out thirty million dollars is going toward education that's almost thirty 1 billion dollars toward education I have to admit that I and members of the house for for a sixty billion dollar benefit and relief package for our school districts K through 12 Head Start food programs and also student loan debt relief I was very proud to having the House version of this bill which did not make it to this final version a student student loan debt relief of ten thousand dollars per student perhaps she saw the both senator Warren and Vice President Biden endorsed my bill it was not just mine others supported me in it I don't want me to own it but that would get relief to ten thousand dollars per student loan borrower we have to do that as you know we're not done with our packages of relief this pet is not one and done this was the third in three bills we will do another and I will fight hard for greater student loan debt relief including ten thousand dollars per borrower and I believe we should drive interest rates down to zero on student loan debt congresswoman Madeline Dean from the great state of Pennsylvania thank you very much for being here stay safe really appreciate your time tonight thank you so much cheers and for more I want to bring in my panel EJ Dionne Washington

the Commissioner Nelson you you made a good point in dr. as a not just reiterated that the the the money that is spent improperly could have been used to build out broadband and and then this is part of the infrastructure program that we need to be doing as American so this is that really a stunning report actually and and takes money away from deserving people no doctor eisenach you mentioned oversight that that we should be exercising but also you seem to be really making a larger point do I understand really that it is your view that this whole program was just miss designed from the start and what we ought to do is go back and design and start from the from the ground up and designed something actually is more likely to work is that your point of view and how would that and what would be the outline of that sort of program well senator thank you for the question and yeah that is my view and I outlined in my testimony for principles I think that we should follow in designing such a program the first is just getting out of the way and you know part of that is taxing telecommunication services about 18 percent on average is what is paid on mobile device mobile broadband service bills national national wide about seven percent of that is directly from the u.s. Universal Service Fund taxes at the federal level that and other things ought to be done to stop taxing it's a very extremely regressive tax so we ought to get out of the way in that regard and in other respects allowing broadband deployment to occur on prices to go down second there is a question of targeting whatever we do better targeting support so the fact that 19 out of 20 people who are receiving subsidies already had a cell phone or already had lifeline service that's that's not an effective program we ought to use that money more effectively third and I think this is the hard part not I don't want to suggest it's easy but the the type of support that is needed by the vast majority of people who are offline today is much more qualitative than simply writing a ten dollar cheque and so for I cited my testimony a number of studies which show that people who are not sufficiently connected to the Internet today need training they need personal assistance we're talking about elderly people we're talking about ethnic minorities who have problems with cultural and language issues those people need a lot more than a free or reduced-price cell phone and and then you know lastly as I said I do think it's time to realize the FCC is just not the right vehicle for this and certainly writing checks to communications companies is not the right way to go miss Collier mister dr. oz and I'm speaking for himself according to his testimony I take it you're here speaking on behalf of citizens against don't have ways and and do can can we summarize that that you largely agree with the position that dr. house Enoch has taken over the years we've seen a lot of waste fraud and abuse within the Lifeline program and the way the system is set up it's setting it up to induce fraud in the program we've seen that across the board with companies sending salesmen out in Colorado and Indiana and other states just generating up subscribership so there does need to be a deep dive into the program to see where it can evolve I think the National verifier program that's been initiated that's a good start if we can have memos memorandums of the understanding with the different states and the Universal Service Program that will allow them to data share understand there's privacy concerns within the states but overall there does need to be an effective revamp of the program mr. Gbagbo and dr. eisenach said we need to quit writing checks to phone companies what what did the phone company say to Gao well we did not have any contact with other than when we performed our undercover work which was essentially trying to enroll in the program and obtain the phone service do you think that would have been a good idea I'm sorry do you think that would have been a good idea too to hear their take on the situation well the scope of our work was designed in a way that did not include extensive contact with the phone company I was not what do you say to that well one really important caveat I think we don't want to paint with too broad of pressure there there are a lot of people in this business who are doing the right thing for the right reasons and I don't want suggest every lifeline provider out there is a fly-by-night corrupt or doing anything other than the Lord's work well thank you for bringing that out that's so that that's that's number one I don't want to be interpreted as painting with too broad a brush but it is certainly true that there is a systemic incentive problem here we have the fox guarding the hen house and all of these reforms essentially amount to you know let's find a better class a fox or put up more chicken wire around the henhouse but the basic dynamics of foxes and henhouse is isn't gonna stop until we change the structure of the program Thank You mr. chairman

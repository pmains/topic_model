it is a non-binding resolution that simply expresses Congress's free speech on this issue only on certain American campuses is thought to be a violation of the First Amendment for somebody to simply say something that's in favor of Israel and finally on 442 recognizes the 10-year anniversary of the sri lankan the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War the Sri Lankan government hasn't done nearly enough to heal the conflict the military continues to occupy much Tamil land that was seized during and immediately after the war and this land needs to be returned for it to really put the war - to really create peace the government has also failed to meet its promises to amend the Constitution to give more autonomy and power to the Tamil regions a devolution of power to the local level is the best way to ensure future peace with that I yield back the gentleman yields back are there any other members seeking recognition I hope not well hearing none seeing none the chair will now recognize himself briefly I want to thank the ranking member mcpaul and chairman Engel for the good work that they and committee members have done on this and block a series of resolutions legislation and amendments that reflect I think a consensus on this important Foreign Relations Committee that attempts to every day work on behalf of the American people in terms of what is in the best interest of America's foreign policy clearly the challenges that we discussed here today as it relates to the Middle East particularly with regards to Israel and and the West Bank the Palestinians have been vexing issues for decades my first visit to Israel was back in 1981 I have had numerous visits to that part of the world like many members of this committee spend a vacation just a few years ago and in Israel while there has been progress made in many areas the ability to arrive at a two-state solution still seems to be very very difficult as we all know but I think that the good will and the good work in a bipartisan effort by this committee will continue to try to move the ball forward ultimately to find a two-state solution that will resolve the challenges we see there and hopefully have a lasting peace certainly that is the goal that we all share hearing no further requests for recognition then without objection the committee will proceed to consider the notice items unblocked

from kinziger joins us now I guess my first question to you sir is is this a badge of honor or how do you look at this Center I mean it's a it's a defining moment for the party and I think it's a defining moment for every member of the house or the senate or you know any Republican leader Kevin McCarthy obviously who I think asked about this in response he just you know went after Liz and I goes to show he is the weakest leader that has ever frankly existed in that position and so I think every member of the media every citizen every person out there needs to pin down every Republican and say do you side with what the RNC did or do you condemn what they did and don't let them trust me politicians are really good at kind of skirting around that answer don't let them on this one I think it's so defining well so I I'm curious what your thought is about uh the definition of what happened on January the 6th people obviously uh charging in uh breaking the law going into the capital uh committing crimes committing sedition uh uh bashing in cops heads with American flags jamming cops heads uh in in the doorways uh having several cops uh begging for their lives thinking about the children they were going to be leaving behind because of the Trump rioters uh beating them within inches of death uh in what they certainly believe is inches in debt what do you make of a political party in America one of the two major political parties in America now calling that legitimate political discourse uh that was obviously a huge surprise to me I expected that maybe this uh Century thing was going to happen and I think the amazing thing about it is you know as Ronald McDaniel who now uh is out trying to say well that's not what we really meant sure okay so this whole thing is coming from the January 6 committee which we're doing because of the violence we would not be having a January 6 committee if it was all quote unquote peaceful and legitimate political discourse for her to now say well all we were talking about were the peaceful people of course not the writers no trust me that's not that may be what you want to have us believe now but think about this it goes through the rules committee which is about 200 members of the RNC it passes unanimously with a Voice vote you know there are members on that committee that disagreed with this that were too scared to speak up and stop this from happening that to me is as disappointing as anything there are members of the Republican Party he probably who have been there for 30 years that are scared to death of the mob excluding them that they won't even speak up with the RNC deserves every aspect of backlash and is going to come down on it and this is a defining moment in American politics and in the rnc's future are you for authoritarianism are you against democracy or are you going to wake up to that slide and come back to actual democracy again I mean let's be very clear about this uh you guys are not investigating peaceful Behavior you guys are not investigating uh people that went up to the Capitol and didn't break the law the people that you're investigating and what you're investigating what the federal government's investigating are people who violated the law people who broke the law people who tried to overturn the election as Mike Pence basically admitted last week Donald Trump was an authoritarian who wanted one person to decide who got elected president so you start putting all of this together look at any definition of fascism and it is a a far right wing ethno nationalist uh movement uh that uses violence uh to to get what it wants and to under undermine uh undermine democracy uh and I'm just curious uh based on what the RNC said this this week this past week as far as their definition of legitimate uh political discourse uh does that not look like the statement of what fascists would say well you may be smarter on what led up to Fascism itself than me I know is certainly authoritarianism I know that certainly the RNC has lost any sense of and frankly those that are driving the train have lost any sense of democracy mattering and what's happened is they've they've they've seen these kind of cultural Wars that have been spewed and and stirred that you know by their own kind of Tucker let me read you a definition of fascism let me just read you this about the definition fascism is a form of for right authoritarian language they used Ultra nationalism characterized by dictatorial power of our forcible suppression of opposition and a strong regimentation of society and the economy I mean it's far right trumpism uh Ultra National ethno nationalism talking about us versus the others uh a yearning for authoritarianism and the use of violence to get there it sure seems like when they're talking about what happened on January 6 beating the hell out of law enforcement officers who would not let them steal an election seems like we're checking off a lot of boxes there in that definition aren't we yeah maybe I mean look I don't know and maybe there's fascist elements maybe it's a Vienna fascism maybe it's authoritarianism maybe it's something else I don't know I don't know how you want to Define it all I know is I'm out here seeing what is happening which violates everything the Constitution I believe in is standing for so I don't care how you define it I don't care you argue it I know that it is a really serious thing that has gone from being kind of a cancerous line within our party to overtake in the entire RNC and we have to stand up against it and you're going to have a lot of members of Congress and other leadership positions that sit around put their head in the sand pretend like their job is just to win their re-election none of this ever happened they have to get pinned down on this we've got to whether you're a republican a Democrat independent whatever you are in this country we've got to stand up and say that truly democracy is threatened that's that's not just you know some line we're gonna say because it sounds cool democracy demise no it is actually truly under threat and we are on the verge of legitimate political those legitimate political Civil War discussion in this country because I used to say that we'd never get there in this country now I look and say we can't even talk to each other anymore and one party believes that believes nothing but lies it's a concern and there is the rnc's definition of legitimate political discourse right there they've defended and let's just let's just cut the BS with people trying to back away from that statement they've been defending this behavior from the beginning Ron Johnson a United States senator who is seeking re-election said he didn't feel any danger from this crowd at all he'd feel much more Danger from black lives matter you had a a another member who actually was standing at the door of the chamber trying to stop people from getting in while guns were drawn later saying that it was nothing but a group of tourists uh it's it's and and there has been the attempt uh Congressman to Define this as a battle between the RNC and AOC uh good thinking free thinking uh conservatives and left-wing socialists which of course looks past the fact that the Wall Street Journal editorial page has repeatedly condemned this type of behavior looks past the fact that Mitch McConnell is actually cheering your committee on saying he wants to to hear all of the evidence even if he opposed the bicameral uh uh committee I mean there are a lot of Republicans especially in the Senate uh and in the the the right media that are actually wanting to get to the bottom of this and have said as much they want to hear what you have to say so Kevin McCarthy may try to make this and Jim Jordan may try to make this a left-wing versus right thing deal but are you not heartened by the fact that the Wall Street Journal editorial page Mitch McConnell and others are saying hey let's get to the bottom of this chaos of this Anarchy of this violence look I think it's a good start I'm heartened by it we should be from way further along in people's recognition than we are now but again I think we have to look at kind of moments and say okay that's good I think look I think the RNC and not because it's me and I have hurt feel I don't get the hurt feelings that Donald Trump gets on a daily basis by the way but um you know the the center of Liz and I I think is a bridge that went way too far by the RNC and I think people are starting to go wait hold on a second Donald Trump literally just admitted to a coup attempt and you're going to turn your fire on Liz and Adam and uh you know if me taking those shots is that that's one thing but look I I think this is a this is an insane moment I think people are slowly starting to speak out but the fear that exists that permeates members of my party particularly elected officials uh it really is it really is frightened and incredible we're gonna get to the bottom of this I mean I think the January 6 committee historically in past history and in future against would be nothing like it because we are working together pulling in the same direction all to get one thing which is answers this is not the left wing against the right wing this is authoritarianism you can call it even moments of fascism against democracy and even as bad as the violence was over the summer during riots that at no point threaten the self-governance of the United States like the self-governance of the United States was threatened on January 6th there is no false equivalence no matter how much the victim and hurt feelings King Donald Trump likes to say that he's always been so ill-fairly treated hey Congressman Kinser good morning it's Jonathan mirror let's shift a little bit to your work on the January 6th uh committee and give us an update on where things stand most notably we've heard from the former president last week or so all but confessing uh on a rally stage and an email statements that yes he did try to overturn uh the election tell us how that's factoring into the committee's work and also what do you want to see from the Department of Justice right now considering the criminal referrals that have already been referred over well let me start with the doj all we can do is provide information particularly in Mark you know Mark Meadow's case he he violated a subpoena Congress has the same subpoena Authority as as a court and then but we don't enforce our own we rely on doj to do that I certainly hope they criminally charge Mark Meadows with with uh with contempt as we as we have charged him with in the house uh I think any of the information the doj sees that leads to a broader conspiracy or anything leading even all the way up to the top they should take to a court or to a grand jury obviously that is not our focus is anything criminal it's just getting answers to the American people and defending the institution and I think we're making an extreme amount of progress I mean I think we're getting some real answers the problem is we need to produce a report by the summer I think that that report is going to be pretty fulsome we'll have hearings at points um the question is though are there people that want to hear it is is this constant leak of information out of the committee or new information that may even be done by some of the Trump folks designed so that I mean he's basically admitting to a coup every day and we take a yawn and go focus on you know the latest cancel culture issue on The View or something and I think this is a big deal where you look at this and go Donald Trump admitted to a coup d'etat attempt if you'd have told me that 10 years ago I'd have been like no way not in America we have to keep that outrage fresh every day Congressman Donnie Deutsch um I I always wonder you and Liz Cheney pretty much standing alone and the hundreds of other Republican Congress men and women do you ever talk to them personally off the Record and say guys you know you know the truth you you you're you're you're a bright person you're educated you see what I saw you you're not dumb do they just look at you and go well we want to keep our job do they I mean what happens behind the scenes I always wonder because you're sitting next to these people and you're eating with them and you're dining with them so what is their explanation to you personally off the Record when you talk to them good question because it can be any any number of things so if it's somebody that I know isn't like crazy right you know a normal person you'll you'll hear them say well if look I just have to win my primary because if it's not me trust me the guy I'm running against he's really bad I'm like okay great but you know at some point you have to stand up some of them it's hey you have to quit trying to tell me how to do my job you'll get that occasionally if I ask somebody for instance if they've even tweeted anything or made a statement at all in opposition to what Donald Trump said where he said I tried to get you know Mike Pence to overthrow the election have you said anything hey I I get I just don't want to get in a Twitter war out there or I'm a local person I focus on local issues you know look again I I can't begrudge anybody how they do their job everybody's got their responsibility but there is a moment and this is that moment at which if you don't stand up you are part of the problem you are part of the problem your silence is complicity and that's what we're dealing with right now it is so egregious we are in such a dangerous position but I'll tell you every time I talk to anybody like that I just walk away disappointed a little angry and just blown away that you know my friends don't have a red line they won't cross all right congressman Adam kinzinger thank you very very much for coming on the show

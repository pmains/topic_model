with me now to discuss January 6th and a lot of other issues is a member of that committee Democrat Adam Schiff thank you so much for coming in let's start with that post report which was a really remarkable report staffers were told the final January 6 report would likely almost entirely focus on Donald Trump potentially leaving out a significant amount of your committee's report and investigation in other areas that's what the post said Is it true uh no I mean I certainly hope not um I would like to see a report be as Broad and inclusive as possible uh we are discussing as a committee among the members uh what belongs on the body of the report what belongs in the appendices of the report uh what is beyond the scope of our investigation uh and we'll reach those decisions uh you know in a collaborative manner um you know I think that one of the things that has made our committee so successful is we have worked extremely well together that doesn't mean we always agree on everything but it doesn't mean we have a lot of respect for each other and we get to the the goal which is providing the American people with a full accounting of what took place on January 6. that has certainly been the public perception of it and the public face of the committee but it sounds like there's a different story at least in some parts of the committee behind the scenes I mean Liz Cheney's spokesman put out a statement accusing staffers on that Berry committee on her own Committee of trying to slip quote liberal biases into the report here's what this quote said that Cheney won't sign on to any narrative that suggests Republicans are inherently racist or smears men and women in law enforcement or suggests every American who believes God has blessed America is a white supremacist and then a committee spokesman accused disgruntled staffers of quote cowardice and said they're helping Donald Trump and others responsible for the violence of January 6. those are remarkable statements they are you know I don't think the back and forth is particularly helpful of the committee and and I don't want to engage in it um we're going to get to a consensus on the report we're very close to that now we're close to the putting down the pen and going to print and I think the report is going to set out in a I hope very comprehensive way what took place what led to that attack uh um and and all the circumstances around that we're also going to be releasing the evidence which may be the most important thing uh the voluminous transcripts the documents and emails uh we want to make sure that that's put before the American people we certainly don't want uh the Jim Jordan's of the world to cherry pick anything not disclosed and make a false or misleading narrative out of it so the the country's going to have the evidence they're going to have our report and I'm enormously proud of what we've done and and know I'll be proud of the final result well I was going to ask you about that Jim Jordan has already said that he is is going to he will be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he is likely he is going to go through the evidence you left out you're saying that there won't be evidence that will not be made public the evidence will all be made public now we'll have to make sure that we scrub that evidence for a personally identifiable information that the evidence that we provide protects people's uh uh security it doesn't put them at risk so there are things that we're going to have to do along those lines uh but but yes we want to put the evidence before the American people which supports the hearings that we've done as well as the report that we'll put out and we'll be a comprehensive picture a few weeks after January 6 you said the attack on the capitol was quote a massive intelligence and security failure that needs to be fully investigated there were nine public hearings none had a specific focus on exactly that on the security and intelligence failures will those be detailed in the final report I certainly hope they will and I'm advocating for that I think that's part of the broad picture of why the capital was vulnerable to attack what intelligence we had what intelligence we missed what intelligence was put before law enforcement are you meeting resistance on getting that in you know I don't want to go into our internal discussions I think we'll get to Common agreement part of it is you know what belongs in the body of the report what belongs in the separate appendices uh you know what can be corroborated we want to make sure that we have every fact nailed down that's been part of the reason our committee has been so successful and we want it to continue to be I want to move on but before I do there does seem to be 10 surrounding the vice chair of the committee Liz Cheney one former staffer told the Washington Post that people working for the committee became quote discouraged when they felt it had become a quote Cheney 2024 campaign is that fair uh I've never viewed it that way and I think her role on the committee has been indispensable I have tremendous respect for her and for Adam kinzinger they've shown a lot of courage and backbone something in very short supply in the GOP these days so the committee not would not have been the same without both of their participation and and I have nothing but respect for both of them as you well know the man who was trying to be speaker the Republican Kevin McCarthy says that he wants to kick you off the intelligence committee the committee that you now chair because of your handling of the trump-russia investigation and specifically that you repeatedly asserted that there was direct evidence of collusion direct collusion which didn't materialize what's your response to McCarthy well McCarthy apparently doesn't think it's collusion if your campaign manager is giving inside polling data and battle strategy in key states to an agent Russian intelligence well the Russians are helping your campaign but most Americans would call that collusion McCarthy's problem is not with what I've said about Russia McCarthy's problem is he can't get to 218 without Margaret Taylor Greene and Paul gosar and Matt Gates and so he will do whatever they ask and right now they're asking for me to be removed from my committees and he's willing to do it he's willing to do anything they ask and that's the problem Kevin McCarthy has no ideology he has no core set of beliefs it's very hard not only to get to 218 that way it's even more difficult to keep 218 that's his problem so he will misrepresent my record he'll misrepresent Derek swalwell or ilhan Omar whatever he needs to do to get the votes of the Q Anon caucus within his conference he's not the only one the incoming oversight chair James Comer told punchball news in an interview I don't believe Congressional investigations have a whole lot of credibility now I blame Adam Schiff for that but it's also both parties to blame for investigations in the past I want to change that what's your response well Comer doesn't believe in the Russian investigation he doesn't believe in the Ukraine investigation he doesn't believe in the investigation of January 6th and why because those were investigations of the serial abuse of power by Donald Trump and comer and Jordan and McCarthy will do nothing but carry Donald Trump's water someone as you point out who's sitting down for dinner with anti-semites who's sitting down for dinner with with bigots who won't condemn them this is who they're making common cause with and so they will do and what and they will say what they need to get along with Donald Trump we're out of time but I just have to ask if you are subpoenaed by Republicans when they take over will you comply um you know what we'll have to consider the validity of the subpoena uh but uh I would certainly view my obligation administration's obligation to follow the law and the fact that they have disrespected the law uh is not a precedent I would hope that would be broadly followed but we'll have to look at the legitimacy or lack of legitimacy of what they do Adam Schiff chairman of the intelligence committee thank you so much appreciate it thank you

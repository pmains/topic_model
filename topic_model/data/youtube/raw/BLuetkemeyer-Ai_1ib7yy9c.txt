Zuri center race has seen national attention since august one race that isn't a race right now is for Missouri's third congressional district where Blaine Luetkemeyer doesn't have a major party challenger for ABC 17 News this week i sat down women to talk about other races redistricting and the trends in this election cycle house the political climate different in 2012 compared to in 2008 when you first ran for the house I think it's significant different I think that as you saw in 2010 it was a referendum on the first two years of the president's administration I think this this election is another referendum on not just the first two but the first four years of the president's term and I think that you know 2008 there was a large wave of folks who are voting against the administration of time the Bush administration and they were upset disappointed the solution and so they went with the with the mr. Obama and this time as you saw in 10 there continued to be the continued disillusion they don't like the direction he's taken a country and I think Intel's in 2012 here I think you're going to can see that continue the standpoint that I ask people what's changed since 2010 and nothing which can work continue to go down that same path that he put us on in the first two years of his term and so I think the the climate is significantly different the wave is going to be the opposite of what it was an eight and you know we're going to continue to to work along those lines it sounds like the wave though may have some similarities than that some people are don't really like what they're seeing right now is that fair to say that there's just a lot of people out there that maybe aren't really happy with policies with politicians oh I think so I think you can see the angst if you listen to the talk shows you listen to the the media I think you you watch the reports of what's going on and as I talk to people around my district around the country they're not happy with the direction the country they don't like the economy continuing languished you know the job situation we got an emic numbers again today and now we have this uprising the Middle East which is fostered by what i believe is probably a policy of appeasement instead of a peace through strength policy like regan proposed it's those sort of things that I've got people riled up they see the direction of a country the future their country in jeopardy and when they see the future of the country in jeopardy that's harmful because they're looking at their kids and grandkids and whenever their kids and grandkids are affected that's whenever they get engaged and they will not get out of this situation they will not step back from it until they see the future other kids and grandkids that has been secured what's your thought on the Missouri Senate race well I think it's going to be a it'll be a tight race for it's over with but I I think that you know Kanye can certainly got an uphill battle you know the senator McCaskill has been in office six years and you know as as Congress taken says you know she's had six years of mistakes and he's had only 11 Burrell mistake that he made but by the same token that one has been taken and and really harmed his campaign and what he can overcome that or not we're going to find out what you endorse him I support everybody that's on our ticket obviously now that he's our person in that race he can no longer get off the ballot he's on our tickets so I support our entire ticket what have you seen statewide going around and so when you're talking about the Republican ticket what kind of thoughts do you have about where the electorate may be going because in 2008 most Republicans outside of yourself and Peter kinder pretty much lost for most of the big name races so where is the state right now well i think it's i think if you look at the polling data and you look at the people who i talked to both Democrats and Republicans across my district I think I've got a pretty good microcosm of the state when I have some of the suburbs of st. Louis we've got I had had the you know city of Columbia and I have Jefferson City I've got some of the larger cities and in the state as well hello ruler he said you know the people are concerned they are not happy with the direction of the country they see and a stagnant economy they see a regulatory regime in Washington that is a big boot on their neck that they that there's a lot of uncertainty as a result of that they don't know whether to invest or not invest we've got Obamacare sitting here getting ready to come into shortly and of the year so and that is a huge boot on the neck of the small business guys who are job creators in this country and as a result they're sitting on sidelines and you talk to them they're they're wanting to invest them need to invest but they are not willing to put their blood sweat and tears that they have they have worked their life for to put that at risk right now because of the uncertainty that's out there with our economy with the rules regulations come out of Washington you talked about your district it looks different than it did when you first ran in 2008 has that changed anyway that you you represent the district now it really doesn't you know we'll have to change how we have our offices structure in that sort of stuff but at the end of the day you know most of the issues that we represent the people on in Washington DC or are all either state or national in scope there probably is probably five percent of our of our issues are local for the standpoint of legislating them in Washington now that being said a lot of things we do in watching obviously have the radical fact on what goes on here but we handle the individual issues normally through our constituent services and our various offices around the district but generally you know it's it's going to be a new district for me for the standpoint I've got sixty-two percent of it's all brand-new so it's going to be

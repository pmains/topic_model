tracy mann in the first episode of our meet your sorghum belt representative series [Music] this is tim lusk ceo national sergeant producers and i know i'm honored today to be uh with congressman tracy mann uh as he joins us this morning for the podcast uh tracy of course served as the 50th lieutenant governor of kansas uh from 2018 to 2019 and then was sworn in as congress in 2021 but certainly i just want to start from a background uh you know no fifth generation kansan and born and raised on a farm that your family i believe your great grandfather may be born in the same house as you were and so certainly someone that has deep agriculture roots and and understands uh the realities of agriculture and then great business background as well and leading into this so just wanted to welcome you to the podcast this morning first and then we'll jump into some some items yeah well tim great to uh you join great getting to know you thanks for all that you um are doing for agriculture and specifically for the sorghum industry and just pleasure to to get to be here like you said i grew up on a family farming operation in northwest kansas i was the fifth generation to live in my house and like a lot of listeners you know these are generational family farms not all of them but a lot of them you know these are family businesses a lot of nuances with that and we got to make sure that we have the right policies in place to make sure that that all of our generational family farms can continue to operate uh successfully here moving forward so let's talk about that obviously uh uh no no stranger to sorghum had it as part of family operation and and certainly cattle side and other uh agriculture interests as well yeah yeah no that that's exactly right so you know we had a farm and a little pre-conditioning feed yard and um so you know i spent thousands of hours driving a tractor and combine growing up it was it was wheat a little bit of sorghum and then as the freedom of farm happened and as agriculture changed we went more to a no-till model and practices and now our farms a lot of sorghum and a lot of corn and a little bit of wheat um right now so definitely seen some changes there i um my dad and brother um operate our family's farm and then i've done other things in my career i'm kind of the first guy since my family our family immigrated to the country that's not in production agriculture every day which is kind of strange but i try to help the industry um and advocate for it every chance i get well that that kind of leads directly into the next question of what drew you to politics yeah good question you know i've always always cared i've always cared a lot about the country and um you know just had a deep sense and gratitude frankly that we all get to live in the greatest country in the history of the world i went to k-state studied agricultural economics um ran for and was fortunate to get elected to be student body president so kind of got involved politics a little different but from that regard in college and then i moved to washington dc my first summer off the farm while i was in college and i served as jerry moran and congressman jerry moran's first ever intern so i worked for him for a summer and he instilled in me a love for kansas and kansas has never left me so came back finished up at k-state i always planned him to move back to our family farm but my older brother beat me back and there really wasn't room on the farm for everybody plus i have really bad asthma and allergies and so i decided to go in the commercial real estate business kind of wrote off politics and i got appointed lieutenant governor a few years ago and served in that role and then ran for congress here in in 2020 and got sworn in here a little over a year ago certainly there's just an incredible legacy with the big first and and certainly you mentioned jerry moran and uh obviously pat roberts before that and just a a just a tremendous number of kansans that have had a tremendous impact on the country originating in the big first and so certainly a congressional district with it with a rich history as well but as you look at that you know agriculture obviously you're on the sorghum podcast so we care a lot about sorghum and and you know talking about how you represent our members but but also really you know farmers of the big first in agriculture what what what is it like representing the big first well it's like winning the lottery tim i mean you know it's just first off you know we call it the big first district for those that don't know it's basically the western two-thirds of kansas except for the wichita area is generally speaking what the district is and of 435 congressional districts we are the number one we're the number three ag producing district in the country on dollars so only three districts do more than 10 billion dollars a year of ag production last year we did about 12 and a half billion dollars and out of 435 districts kim our district uh migrants the number one district in the whole country for sorghum production um we were also number one for beef production and we're number one at a 435 for wheat production so you know it's a big ag district um a lot of people have represented well over over the years just trying to you know fill some pretty big shoes and do right by our ag producers in the ag industry in the district well certainly uh you're off to a great start from our opinion and uh we certainly appreciate your leadership and and working through and and just appreciate your background and uh uh certainly understanding of agriculture from all sides in all aspects and you know i think that will be really important as as we jump into some of the policy areas that we see coming and and so we might just jump to that talk to me a little bit about uh you know what what are some of the current policy areas that that you certainly see either agriculture obviously we'll get to a farm bill discussion here in a bit but maybe before we get to the farm bill what are some of the other areas that you see that uh maybe from a positive or from a from a huge concern right now from a policy standpoint yeah those are the great questions you know there's a lot of some in the house a committee a really important committee for agriculture but there's a lot of things happening in other committees in other areas washington d.c that absolutely affect agriculture like the stepped up basis um tim you know which is in the region means committee it's tax policy but we saw efforts in the president's budget last year to do away with the stepped-up basis we fought we and others fought tooth and nail to keep it i remember we were meeting virtually uh where our house that committee was and then i offered an amendment to to a bill um via zoom i actually went and stood in the middle of a sorghum field and offered amendment to uh get a sense of of the ag committee of a willingness to keep the stepped-up basis i was actually pretty very surprised and very disappointed that that um amendment actually failed um due to due to some politics it later um we were able to preserve the stepped up basis but that's a big deal and then another thing that's come up here tomorrow if you follow this is this um effort to we call it the farm killer tax but it would be a one-time capital gains hit on unrealized gains for businesses or property that's been owned for 90 years and that is buried in the president's budget that he just released last month and you know you think about this all of our generational family farms could be disastrous so we're fine tooth and nail to to to stop that and a whole bunch of other bad things on their regulatory front as well no i think there's certainly uh as you read the details of some of these policy items there's certainly things to be concerned about and certainly those general business items uh related to taxes and regulatory or are some critical ones in terms of of things that are important to all of our our listeners and our members i believe one of the things i wanted to jump to uh here is towards the end as we wrap up is as is we got a farm bill coming uh obviously uh from a timeline pretty close but from a process maybe not not as close uh what's your thoughts on the farm bill and where we're headed yeah well to remind everybody you know the current farm bill expires september 30 of 2023 so we are now almost exactly 17 months away and frankly i've been frustrated and pretty vocal about the fact that i feel like the house ad committee is behind in gearing up for this next farm bill um before we did the last one i was not in congress at the time but there were 120 to 130 hearings listening sessions both in dc but also all over the country and so far um tim we've only done six or seven and they've all been in washington dc and so we have got to and we've been pleading with the chairman and others we've got to be having field hearings listening sessions we've got to be listening to producers and really provide opportunity for input because we got to make sure that the farm bill that gets put forward works for the ag producers that are most impacted by it and to make sure that it works for rural america so 17 months away i'm starting those discussions but but a lot more to come and a lot of work left to do absolutely and uh certainly from our organization's standpoint uh look forward to working with you through that process and as we've started a lot of the policy things behind the scenes and a lot of work from our side on looking at options and looking at costs uh certainly a lot of concerns about uh where where that budget is is we look at a budget baseline and uh you know some of the things we hear from our membership that our needs and then look at the budget realities of how do we do that and so i think uh agriculture is a whole uh has a lot of work to do to try to figure out some baseline dollars certainly there's been a tremendous amount of baseline of non-baseline dollars spent on agriculture uh over the last couple of years but those uh unfortunately don't really count uh in the way the government does accounting in preparation for a farm bill so have to look at some creative ways of how we can come together with some dollars there certainly um know that would make the ag committee's job a whole lot easier if there was some resources available there as opposed to a status quo funding situation that uh then with a lot of a lot of changes in agriculture and with the impacts of inflation uh frankly a lot of the numbers that are there in the safety net just aren't much of a safety net today so a huge job coming in in terms of the next farm bill but we certainly look forward to working with you throughout that process to to make sure we do have that safety net that's so critical for our producers well i completely agree in the heart of that of course is crop insurance and uh you know so we look at this next farm bill my number one priority is crop insurance and to your point i think we've got to acknowledge unless things significantly change that that we're going into this next farm bill discussions uh negotiations hearings in a climate that has record high input costs for our producers and also that has very high commodity prices right now but we know that that's not going to necessarily hold producers are going to get squeezed potentially if we see a dip in prices here because input costs likely won't go down correspondingly at least in the short term and so he's got to make sure though that we have tools in place to protect that risk because then you add in the risk of course for mother nature and which makes crop insurance so vitally important and is a great public private partnership and i think is a huge success to to your point you know we're going to need to have some candidates to have some very clear discussions on is the safety net too low to the ground meaning it's possible that um with with how high input costs are and how low some of the the rates are in the farm bill that you might have to you know land in the net but you still might hit the ground um and so we need to really look at what those floors are and make sure that the crop insurance is properly funded and uh and is appropriate for the risk that ag producers are taking today well totally agree with that and and look forward to working with you through that process as we wrap up this time uh today final thoughts or comments that you'd just like to share well i would just say you know another conversation that's certainly happening a lot of is climate and i think we've got to realize it's administration most not all but a lot of policies you know they're looking through the lens of climate and a lot of discussion on what happens there i think we need to make sure that whatever the the government does potentially do so far as climate uh incentives and those sort of things that one that agriculture doesn't left out and two that those dollars don't get pulled from crop insurance and other existing programs and then three that there's an acknowledgement of the positive benefit of sorghum and of american agriculture to the environment and uh and we don't want to punish our early adopters for some of the practices that they have so just the whole climate discussion tim is something that that i'm watching very very closely we're actively engaged in and we want to make sure that agriculture ends up on the right side of that issue as you know just a an issue that our organization's spending a tremendous amount of time in and and one that we think sorghum has a tremendous story to tell on one side and and uh is is a part of the solution and on the other uh as you mentioned a very slippery slope when it comes to policy and and uh one thing is you have to be very careful of unintended consequences so couldn't agree with you more and look forward to the opportunity to to work with you in that area as well as as we move forward so thank you uh very much for taking some time out on i know what is a busy day for you to visit with our listeners and uh look forward to seeing you soon likewise thanks for all you're doing tim and more to come and let me know what could be helpful thanks a lot

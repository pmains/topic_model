another headline that the covid aid facing a very s uncertain path on capitol hill as white house warns of severe consequences white house officials warning key pandemic programs could soon run out of money unless congress fails to quickly authorize another 15.6 billion in new covid aid so we're just throwing around billion here billionaire new 1.5 trillion here here a billion there a billion everywhere a billion billion want some aid here's some aid coveted ukraine aid who wants aid get your aid here congressional aid here sure what the hell why not let's talk to congressman dan muser of pennsylvania's ninth congressional district about all this aid uh congressman uh can i get some of that action welcome in yeah hey chris uh yeah no kidding right um that's pretty much what these bills are are about just uh the so-called um christmas tree type of uh special interest let's do this let's do that you know the compete bill which didn't get much press a couple of weeks back i mean that added only 150 new government programs and of course was was only voted on a very partisan way for by debt by democrats yeah and you know what that's what they're doing in our city of brotherly love right now um all i'm hearing is that they're coming up with ways to spend more money uh plans for spending and how not to sound preachy so it sounds like um sounds like uh they're you know they've got a lot of work to do you know congressman music uh we haven't talked before and i'm grateful for your time today i know you're going to be part of a conference call today on the democrats visiting philadelphia there's a few things at work here so i'm a bit scattered in my presentation my apologies i'll jump around a bit let's let's let's start with um let's just talk about spending in general this party knows everyone understands the basic economics of if you continue to spend money at the clip we're spending money in 40-year high inflation you're only going to exacerbate things we all understand that yet it just keeps getting spent yes i i i don't know at some point one is left to conclude and i guess as a member of congress you tell me is this on purpose is this willful ignorance is it obtuseness what is it economics it's all that it's very short-term thinking clearly they don't misunderstand the laws of gravity yes too many dollars chasing too few goods etc etc as you stated uh we've increased the money supply by by nearly 40 percent just in the last couple of years so jerome powell and the fed are very much in on this as well as well as the spending primarily from from from the far left look during covert there's no question during 2020 uh it was bipartisan we spent nearly five trillion dollars an obscene amount of money for the shutdowns and everything else but then biden comes in and thinks it's a wonderful idea to double down on that with the rescue plan and flooding uh the uh the communities as well as the states and every other coffer with with all kinds of all kinds of cash and you know we saw a lot of the entitlements run out at the end of of 21 and it was no surprise that's why we had such a such a strong jobs report in february you know a lot of those entitlements and and uh and and freebies and all ended at the end of january one including the cobra extension you know people needed health care so they needed to go need to go back to work and we're not talking about the vast majority of of americans not by any means but we're talking about you know that four to five to six percent that didn't work because they could afford not to and that makes all the difference in workforce shortages and and the unemployment rate and uh and such so look you know we got serious business to take care of we need to be the strongest economy on the face of the earth as well as the strongest uh defense and military and we're in the biden administration and and absolutely supported by the democrats that are there in uh in in philadelphia right now are are supportive of actions and policies that are weakening both weakening our economy and leaking our national security um that is not the uh you know the 21st century america that that needs to stand up to china and everything else congressman dan muser with us pennsylvania's 9th congressional district um we had your colleague brian fitzpatrick on the show yesterday he's part of house intelligence i know you're on the house for an affairs committee is that right yes i am i asked him yesterday um and i think it's kind of under that committee's purview maybe not foreign affairs but maybe you can speak to it are you hearing reports concerns now that um in ukraine we've been monkeying around with bio weapons research there much like wuhan have you heard that yet and if so what do you know if anything about it is that something you feel you can confirm yet or the house fitzpatrick says they're certainly going to be looking into it in his committee do you know anything about it i i honestly don't uh we have a tremendous amount of regular dialogue and discussion uh on uh with our foreign affairs i mean probably six seven eight times a day as well as classified meetings uh and declassified of course um with you know some of i guess the top people at the state department and department of defense i haven't heard that now we do hear that uh russians are being found dead or alive with gas masks and things of that nature so what their plans are are either either to resist the so-called vacuum bombs uh you know the air cluster bombs or uh or they're planning some sort of other um uh uh other gaseous uh type of uh you know attack on the on the cities which is which which are is known to be effective in cities but you're aware of that uh testimony this week before senate intelligence marco rubio's questioning of uh victoria newland under secretary of state who who kind of confirmed that there are labs there that she's con she she expressed and confirmed concern would fall under russian hands okay i um look that the ukraine has uh you know some sophisticated uh um research and all i had a testimony with newland as well uh this week and and honestly that discussion uh that those points did not come up okay it i mean it certainly sounds like it warrants further investigation though i think absolutely i mean in this in this day and age where we uh just dealt with a uh the wuhan virus and the uh the issues and us having absolutely you know a complete cover-up frankly on on its origins yeah that's that's worthy of ed concerns certainly earnestly too i ask not because i miss him don't misunderstand i don't where is fauci sincerely i mean from a guy that went was every day on our you know in it seemed like there was a congressional hearing every day with the guy he's on every channel every day all the time he's standing next to biden every day all the time it's like this thing never happened two years of our lives hijacked and now it's like it's over he's gone moving on russia ukraine yeah well he's he's not sure if it's showing to be useful to uh the by-administration spin any longer maybe he couldn't stomach it or maybe they polled him and he is not in in favor with the vast majority of americans um so therefore that's that's how this this uh this team runs i mean it runs on it runs on perception it runs on spin it certainly doesn't run on good policy or facts you know here you have already can you just can you continue you know the american people and the people in pennsylvania can call this out i mean this is how many times have you now heard that this is a putin inflation that this is putin gasoline uh price hikes i mean they've got they've got websites for that effect i mean you know they're really just trying to fool the the american people and meanwhile of course we know the price of gasoline was way up energy was way up uh uh weeks before uh the russian invasion took place and that's all due to us losing our energy independence and basically the bible administration and the democrats in the house and senate having an assault on our domestic energy resources and companies pennsylvania's ninth congressional district representative in congress is dan muser he joins us uh today the democrats as you have mentioned a couple times are in philadelphia i chuckle because the president um loves to come to philadelphia it's it's it's so funny because they will always say that the president hits the road to push this initiative the president hits the road to push that initiative it's nine times out of ten always pennsylvania and we all know why because it's just down 95 from the bunker in wilmington where he goes almost every single weekend so his travels are always to pennsylvania so that he can always go on friday right to wilmington i'm kind of i guess i shouldn't be amazed that the media doesn't tell that story like the entire party is going to philadelphia just to make it easy for grandpa to get home quick yeah no question uh about it it's all about ease it's all about comfort it's all about familiarness uh for for the president look very unfortunately we're now experiencing look we've all known uh joe biden over the years i mean in the past he was a gregarious guy never in doubt but never right um and but now he's lost that and we are seeing what having a a vacuum in leadership a a leader that's not determined that's not decisive and it and doesn't have their own policy that is being led by the far left and probably six or seven maybe eight of staffers that are around him uh feeding him information and what to say on a regular basis and so therefore we're seeing in the ukraine and no leadership we're seeing germany step up heck we're seeing poland taking a far stronger leadership role than than the united states uh and the end they're being tougher and they're more aggressive uh and and they're they're right on top of russia you know so so you know that's one reason that they're being more aggressive but but secondly they've got they've got far more to potentially lose um you know and i'm relating that just to this whole aircraft deal that went bad and really was a was a mess at the state department and they they admitted to this that but this was this was agreed upon the aircraft was going to go to the german air base or excuse me the u.s air base in germany and then the aircraft was going to go to ukraine at the last minute um advisors came in as top advisors i was told who uh told bideno it's it's it's too risky and they they halted that midstream so what you know american people gotta understand just like a strong ceo in a business or you know just a strong leader in general um we're uh we're seeing that level of weakness right at the top and you know and kamala harris isn't exactly playing a a a significant supporting role uh i think we can all see that as well so you know we've uh do you think yeah congressman do you think politically speaking i really do wonder setting even aside party loyalties for a minute do professional class politicians in washington dc watch the vice president's performance yesterday and everyone kind of cringe i would imagine that even democrats watched her yesterday in poland and thought oh boy that's i mean we we're not sending our best the international community knows that's true yeah uh look the only ones that can continue to clap and applaud and say how wonderful that was are those who drank extremely spiked kool-aid because no there was no getting around the the fact that unfortunately the vice president was overseas in over her head respectfully i don't know why it just doesn't do their homework and have an understanding and at least have some deliverables and and and a plan that at least synergizes with the eu and is in line with what zelinski's asking for none of that was articulated it was uh frankly embarrassing i i'm struck that on that same day that she's the one speaking on behalf of the united states as russia's on the march in ukraine um new inflation numbers come out that are just devastating biden issues a written statement he literally doesn't like he's not physically present the man is physically a vaper and now he's in philadelphia today having a private confab with democrats before again as i say he undoubtedly runs home to wilmington the man and i don't mean to make this too much of anything but it's just the guy is not on the stage he's not present he's clearly not in command at a time the country needs a president to be in charge um as much as i don't want it to be him he is the guy and he's nowhere to be found it's like he's phoning it in and he's sending cut rape hacks like kamala harris to to do his work he's issuing statements while the country is hurting it's so tone deaf i know they know this i know they must well they they they do but they don't they they are tone deaf they're out of touch there's no leading taking place you can see that there's no rallying of of of nato being being led by biden and uh and uh actions of courage again that we're seeing seeing from zielinski everything is being reactive right it's being responsive we responded to the oil embargo because the the oil companies themselves stop stop purchasing uh russian oil you know where we were supporting germany's efforts things of that nature so yeah it's an unusual role for uh for the united states and you know i i i think we're seeing the this lag is is a big reason for the the disasters that we're facing in the catch-up from afghanistan to or certainly now uh the the ukraine and you know and when i say they're sort of not out of touch look no matter what no matter what that group that surrounds the president on a regular basis will not will not engage in um increasing our energy production here at home because they are so sold on on on the green new deal and and that that woke direction and it's absolutely terrible no matter what they'll buy from venezuela they'll buy from saudi arabia they'll buy from iran the the center of terrorism in the world before they will drill in pennsylvania or allow added added permits uh in the permian base and such and in the dakotas i mean it's just outrageous talk about being tone deaf and allowing that to destroy um our economy frankly inflation and high gas prices um and and and weaken us from a national security standpoint it's it's it's it's outrageous and you know what the democrats in philadelphia should be redirecting that policy uh uh on on their own because they are are in touch with the american people i um it's so clear to me that this feeble old guy who couldn't ever win the presidency on his own basically struck a deal with the devil i think this is the third term of barack obama i think all the principal players making decisions in this administration are still obama's and i think the deal was look we'll let you be the legitimate face of our operation but you shut up and sit down and you write or you read the words we write and you'll have nothing more to say about it than that i think he's just so enamored with being called president because he couldn't get there himself he's making no decisions on his own and uh in a way it's really kind of sad and pathetic but anyway congressman before i let you go could i just briefly get you to talk comment on um that redistricting uh done by the pennsylvania supreme court it affects all of you who represent pennsylvanians in congress fred keller has basically been drawn out i know there was time uh there was a talk we just talked with fred a couple of days ago um that maybe the two of you would be in some kind of weird uh primary fight but he's decided he's out he's just gonna step down so um you'll run again this fall but what do you make of what the supreme court's done in pennsylvania and redistricting yeah well well first off just on on fred keller i mean yeah it was a very difficult decision for him he certainly showed to be a person of of honor and truly cares about the greater good uh than himself and the uh winning the house back is is absolutely crucial as well as the senate i mean you know they want to pass they want to pass voter federal takeovers of elections and add to the you know make d.c a state and these things these things cannot happen or else or else truly our democracy will will be in jeopardy and i stand by that remark to any of my my democrat friends but on this um honest redistricting it was just just a terrible shame i mean it was an unconstitutional manner that it was that it was uh rolled out i mean you know that legislators are are to come up with the districts uh that they negotiate with with the governor uh find a way and come up with a map instead the governor vetoes it which was you know we we knew that uh would occur because that's what he's done in the past it moved on to the state supreme court which is very political and very liberal and they set it up in a manner so as the republicans would lose a seat even though we had all incumbents with republicans and there were two democrat seats that that are open uh that have no incumbent conor lamb and mike doyle in the western part of the state so if they really cared about the citizens you you don't remove a member you let the people vote that member out and since there's no incumbent in the the western uh districts i mentioned that's the one of those should have been should have been absorbed those two should have been and i think that would be very rational to uh the people of pennsylvania but instead you know they took it as an opportunity they meaning uh the the left in the governor's office as well as the state supreme court uh to take advantage of the situation and uh and and wipe out a republican seat so it was uh it was um you know more than just i'm predicting it i mean yeah yeah i mean it's it's a in many ways an abuse of power and the american people need to appreciate that whether you're democrat or republican you don't want to see things like that uh it should follow the rules of the game which is the constitution and um and and we gotta you know deal with it this is statesmen on occasion states women as opposed to always always uh uh political maneuvers yeah the pennsylvania supreme court you know the pennsylvania supreme court has to be dealt with congressman dan muser of pennsylvania's ninth district um you you're going to be our go-to republican unless things change here in the southeast a little bit and we hope they do but uh with the monkeying around with the districts it's going to be challenging for sure we hope some other republicans can pick up seats here uh closer to us here in the southeast in philadelphia but you're our go-to republican going forward if if in fact they're not successful so thank you congressman museum well hey anytime chris i appreciate that but yeah we got some real pickup opportunities lisa sheller in the allentown area jim bognet in the northeast and we got some good candidates running it running in the six so you know we got some uh we got to win back the house that's just that the republicans need to be a majority in the house and uh that's uh that's an important goal yeah pennsylvania six is huge chrissy houlihan currently occupies that seat i think pennsylvania six is the most likely pickup for republicans and uh i'm personally pulling for guy shiraki in that one um i think he's fantastic i hope he gets it done thanks for your time today my man guy's a real good friend yeah hey chris i appreciate

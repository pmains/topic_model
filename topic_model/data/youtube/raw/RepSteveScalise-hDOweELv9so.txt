thank you mr chairman and i also welcome federal reserve chairman powell thank you for being with us and look forward to having an interesting conversation about the state of our economy but i first want to begin by making sure to reiterate a point that we've been making for over a year and that is that house democrats still refuse to hold a hearing on the origin of covid19 if this virus did in fact leak from the wuhan lab by the way which a growing mountain of evidence now indicates is the real possibility everyone in this country and around the world who has been touched by this evil virus deserves to know what happened and how it happened given the chinese communist party's documented cover-up and lies every member of the subcommittee should agree if this is a man-made virus then this is exponentially worse than chernobyl yet not a single hearing by the house democrat majority 209 house republicans wrote speaker pelosi asking that the committees of jurisdiction simply hold hearings i've asked repeatedly that this select subcommittee hold a hearing on this important topic we were told that the science committee is looking into it mr chairman every single republican member of the science committee signed this letter to speaker pelosi the science committee hasn't even scheduled a hearing on this subject not a single committee has indicating clearly that speaker pelosi has sent word that the house will not investigate the origins of coven 19. we are amid a long global competition with china much of the world must decide whose values to espouse and with whom to align speaker pelosi in the house of representatives should not be covering up for china's lies and potential crimes we should be coming together on a bipartisan basis to search for those answers and shine the light of transparency on the origin of this virus to the world and to do it on a bipartisan basis i urge you to reconsider and schedule a hearing on the origins of covet 19 without further delay mr chairman now let's get back to the focus of today's hearing the economic crisis chairman powell welcome back to this subcommittee we appreciate your openness and accessibility during these challenging times inflation has been defined as too much money chasing too few goods it also happens to be a nearly exact description of the biden economic plan last year congress worked together on a bipartisan basis to provide much needed relief from the government-opposed lockdowns america did not know a whole lot about this novel coronavirus and we did not at the time have a vaccine some in congress used this crisis to spend trillions of dollars on things that had little or nothing to do with covet we still have hundreds of billions of dollars from the many relief packages that are still left unspent we also learned that the revenue shortfalls some predicted state and local governments would face were dramatically inaccurate congress provided hundreds of billions in aid to states that are running billions of dollars in surpluses this is borrowed money keep in mind republicans have a clear set of policies for the economy since we passed the initial cares act last year on a bipartisan basis republicans at the national and state level have called for schools to be reopened to get in-person learning going again we've called for an end to enhanced unemployment and other policies that discourage people from going back to work we called for full from the beginning support for operation warp speed because that is what got us not one not two but now three safe and effective vaccines we've also called for safely reopening our economy and for repurposing the unused coveted funds for real infrastructure not with job killing taxes that would actually slow our economy down even more we're focused on growing our economy and increasing supply supply of workers expanded investment and for bringing back jobs to america strengthening supply chains and returning the american people to a country that is open and free 25 republican governors have moved to end the enhanced unemployment insurance program that is clearly causing so many of these labor shortages we see around the nation the biden inflation agenda of too much money chasing too few goods is causing major harm to hard-working families a 1.9 trillion dollar coveted bill that had almost nothing to do with covid but air dropped more borrowed money into the economy while restricting supply canceling the keystone pipeline siding with teachers union bosses to keep schools closed when the science said to open up the schools causing long-term damage to millions of our youngest children extending the enhanced unemployment insurance and paying people more to stay home than to work and alarmingly president biden actually wants to give away our intellectual property for the vaccine to china on top of that he's proposed a 3.5 trillion dollar tax hike that will crush american workers small businesses and family farms he wants a higher tax rate than communist china add to that he wants another 4 trillion of spending too much money chasing too few goods welcome to the biden inflation agenda the washington post lead story yesterday said quote the u.s economy is emerging from the coronavirus pandemic markedly transformed as businesses and consumers struggle to adapt to a new landscape with higher prices fewer workers and a range of inconveniences they go on to say what americans are encountering though is almost unrecognizable from just 16 months ago prices are up housing is scarce it takes months longer than normal to get furniture appliances and numerous parts delivered and there is a great dislocation between millions of unemployed workers and millions of vacant jobs the washington post is hardly a conservative news outlet larry summers top economic adviser to both president clinton and president obama has been warning since february that president biden's agenda is inflationary the consumer price index is up the most since 2008. the 6.2 percent increase in the producer price index is the highest on record milk is up 5 bacon is up 13 used cars are up 30 percent transportation up 16 percent the list goes on unfortunately housing prices are soaring and economists are warning of a rental crisis the cost of building new homes has made it prohibitive for home builders restricting supply while flooding the economy with cash inflation is outpacing wage gains the past few months in the first five months of the biden presidency 500 000 fewer jobs were created than in the last five months of the trump administration and the biden administration started with approved vaccines already in place on day one chairman powell these body inflationary policies have put you in a tough spot i have confidence chairman powell that the fed has tools to deal with inflation but those tools are harsh raising interest rates and constricting the money supply they work but as we saw with paul volcker it causes tremendous pain the job of taming inflation belongs to congress and this administration take the 4 trillion dollars in new spending proposals off the table send a message to the markets that we will do a bipartisan infrastructure bill that is paid for with unused coveted relief money there's plenty of it let's agree to end the enhanced ui drop the massive tax hikes president biden proposed shipping jobs overseas with many of his agenda items why don't we reverse that why don't we come together on a bipartisan basis to focus on getting a long and sustained recovery from this pandemic that would be a good start mr chairman without a yield back

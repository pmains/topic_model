and his vote alone want to bring in democratic congressman sean casten of illinois he's a member of the financial services committee and the house select committee on the climate crisis uh congressman thanks for joining us on this appreciate it listen senator sanders um essentially um going after his own senate colleagues because of not being able to get this thing across the finish line what do you make of it um it is it is tragic like we're sitting here looking at you know as you mentioned the wildfires the rising sea levels but beyond that we have we are being pressed to say what can you do to lower energy costs and everybody who has a solar panel who has an electric vehicle who has a more efficient home spends a lot less on energy we should be doing that for selfish reasons and at the end of the day we're stuck you know mansion is is a symptom he's not the problem the problem is the us senate that by design massively over represents land at the expense of people which means they massively over represent the interests of energy producers at the expense of energy consumers and so instead of prioritizing cleaner air and cheaper energy we prioritize the interest of people who want to dig things out of the ground and set them on fire in the senate and until the senate realizes that they have a massive structural defect we're going to continue to be an embarrassment on the world stage what about the responsibility of senator schumer and getting someone like senator joe manchin on board to deliver the votes that they need um i think it's a great question we have got to get to a point where we elect more people who give a damn about the planet who think it's more important to protect the planet than the filibuster in the senate but we've also got to ask some hard questions about why it is that leadership in the senate decided to put someone like joe mentioned in charge of senate energy policy because you don't do that if you fundamentally understand the stakes of this moment in our history and i would like to see much stronger leadership to actually view climate change as a policy problem not just a political problem to be dealt with every time for an election you know you see the united states having to dance with a country um like saudi arabia because of the oil crisis um across the world right now having to dance with a country um like russia that continues um to invade the sovereignty of ukraine i can't help but wonder as to whether or not your colleagues see one of the major reasons why this country needs energy independence and clean energy at that for those very reasons if not no other i mean i certainly do i think my colleagues on the select committee certainly do we try to remind folks all the time that if you really want to hurt vladimir putin change the u.s economy so that we don't depend on fossil fuel right help help the europeans do the same that also by the way makes us not dependent on people like mbs in saudi arabia do remember also that every single person who is claiming right now that we need to do something about energy costs how many of them were complaining two years ago when donald trump called mbs and said we are going to take troops out of saudi arabia unless you cut back on your production to raise energy costs go look that up people were celebrating donald trump in the republican party because he caused oil prices to spike how many of them complained and i think i mentioned that because that's the rub the people who are advocating for the interest in the fossil fuel industry are not advocating for cheap energy they're advocating for expensive energy no one in the fossil energy industry wants to sell their product for cheap right they want to sell it for more that's what they're pushing for that's why they're so scared about a transition to clean energy because they know that they can't compete on an economic economically equivalent ground and i wonder if this is really one of the reasons sir and this is from the new york times and just one percent of voters in a recent new york times stand a college poll naming climate change as the most important issue facing the country one percent even among voters under 30 years of age the group thought to be most energized by the issue that figure was it three percent could that be one of the driving factors i i think frankly that's don't blame the voters blame the elected officials i i spent 20 years of my career in the climate in clean energy before i came to congress i ran on climate not because it pulled well but because it is an important thing and i am under the belief that if you are in a position in leadership your job is to lead and this is what i said about criticizing some of the leadership in my own party if you look at polls and say this isn't important and you conclude that you shouldn't talk about it then what you are saying is that you are not capable of leadership if you look at polls and say this isn't something that polls well with the voters and yet it is critically important that we do it and i understand this because i have access to the briefings and the experts at noaa and nasa and the epa and you are capable of leadership then you stand up you get out front and you educate the voters and bring them along we've done that in our congressional district we need more leaders at the national level to understand and i've had this conversation with the president himself if as long as this issue pulls lower than it needs to be then our work as leaders is not done and we need more leaders to step up and explain that to folks congressman sean caston thank you

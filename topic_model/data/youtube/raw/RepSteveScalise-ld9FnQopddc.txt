thank you mr chairman uh dr fauci dr bolinsky we're going to be passing out some pictures uh these are pictures that were taken just last week during the trip that i took along with 10 of my colleagues to the southern border over in mcallen texas some from the border in mcallen at a process temporary processing center some at the donna detention facility where you can see in some of these cells they're holding people i'll let you take a look at those but while while you're reviewing those pictures i'd like to read the the cdc guidance that y'all have issued on mexico and first it says level four which is the highest level very high level of covet 19 in mexico this is cdc one travelers should avoid all travel to mexico that's cdc guidelines because of the current situation in mexico even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading covert 19 variants and should avoid all travel to mexico this is cdc you go on to say some other things then we talk about traveling back into the united states this is only if you're an american citizen all air passengers coming to the united states including u.s citizens and fully vaccinated people are required to have coven 19 test results no more than three days before travel or documentation of recovery from coven 19 in the past three months before they board a flight to the united states that's a cdc guidance document so first dr wilinski should everybody who comes in the united states follow this guidance not just american citizens but everybody coming into the united states the cdc guidance by air is guidance not just coming from mexico it's air travel from all over the country guatemala for example it's all over the globe europe everywhere el salvador should follow this guidance all over the globe if you travel by air you appreciate it thank you i appreciate you answering that because we'll get to that in a minute because on my flight back from mcallen back home to new orleans about half of the plane were some of the people that are in these pictures who were getting on these flights not being tested for covid in violation of your guidance so let me ask you and this is by the way secretary mallorcas just recently testified that he admitted that apprehended migrants were released before getting a kova test who came from mexico from el salvador and getting on an airplane is that in violation of cdc guidance the cdc is providing technical assistance to the office of refugee resettlement uh from the people who are leaving the dhs and customs so let me ask you specifically if somebody came from one of those countries that you just listed you said every country but here you're specifically talking about mexico if they came from mexico and then got on an airplane without a kova test does that violate cdc guidance this is guidance it's not law but this is the recommendation okay so does it no it doesn't say recommendation this says all are required that's not a recommendation dr wolinski that's a requirement by the federal government for american citizens is there an exemption for people who come here illegally to this guidance it's a yes or no question should everybody comply everybody coming into the united states by air is supposed to have a test of one to three days before coming in three to five years well then let me just advise you that that this the director of homeland security has testified that that's not happening and so i know y'all meet with the president more than me i've requested i know our leadership's requested a meeting with the president and he's yet to meet with us you will meet with him before i do can you let him know that he's violating your own cdc guidance and how he's running the southern border right now because look at these pictures dr fauci does this look like social distancing to you that you require when you talk about six feet no so in these cells as you just said they're violating the very guidance that you tell americans to follow a restaurant in the united states would be shut down today if they were being run like this yet the federal government the biden administration is running this facility you can see all of these young children who are next to each other six inches apart many without masks by the way does that follow your guidance that you've issued no well then why would the biden administration not go and stop this i think one of the reasons is president biden and vice president harris won't even go see this for themselves that's why i keep urging strongly that they go to the border i'd love for you all to go to the border to see this so you can at least give recommendations they're violating every guidance that americans are required to follow again you look at the cdc guidance on mexico it's off the charts saying how dangerous it is if you're an american citizen with the vaccination you have to not should have to get a coveted test saying you're negative to come back home to america yet if you're coming here illegally the homeland security secretary admitted in a hearing just the other day that they're not testing people who come here illegally dr fauci do you think that sends the right message to america who people are trying to recover and get back to the real life that if you're a citizen you follow this set of rules but if you come here legally you don't have to follow any of your rules no doubt it's a very difficult situation at the border congress do you think this should get fixed excuse me do you think this should get fixed and they start following the same rules that you and i have to follow i mean obviously everyone would like to see that situation fixed i know but it's a very difficult situation that is americans want to get back to their life but uh but they don't want two sets of rules either and that's what's happening right now at our southern border mr chairman i go back

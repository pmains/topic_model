Thank You congressman women Thank You chairman for allow me to sit in here today mr. Feinberg you know I have to share the same frustrations mother Gulf states colleagues have have expressed from congressman Bonner to congressman Landry of course I can't I can't put it as eloquently as congressman Lee injury but i'd have to say we're frustrated we're tired many of us feel hopeless in the whole process but we also feel insulted you know we have some very smart people we have accountants and lawyers that are trying to help people all along the Gulf Coast provide claims and support and documentation and as they do it they feel like you know they're given the best information given exactly what the claim center wants and it's still rejected or as there's delays and processing so the comment congressman Landry made it's like is this a stone walling is this to drag it out to not pay out the 20 billion which again was supposed to be the floor not the ceiling on making those affected by the worst man-made disaster in our nation's history whole again but people just don't they don't feel like they see inconsistencies they feel I mean perfect example as Omega protein a large company that got a 45 million-dollar payout in their first year and when you have shrimpers and charter boat captains and others who have made a living for generations off the Gulf Coast have yet to receive a first payment or the payments that are being offered or insulting they're embarrassing and it leaves them either with the option take take what they can cut their losses or go to litigation and you know quite honestly people in Mississippi litigations the last thing we would really like to go to so some people are adverse to it but some people will go to it so I guess the main thing is I'm expressing what South Mississippians and probably my colleagues all up along the Gulf states this is what we're seeing this is what we're feeling going forward look you got 14 billion dollars left uh you know give these people but I noticed you're going to allow you sent out a mass mail out if you if you've got your paperwork now come in keep communicating that to the public keep letting people know that they can receive reimbursements or they have the right to come in and do a claim but also listen to the people who have made a living out of the Gulf have made a living the fifth and six and seven generations of people and south Mississippi look if your methodology for reimbursement is not acceptable to them try to come in and find some common ground find that that place because these are the experts and I don't expect you to know how to reimburse of shrimp you probably have an idea now but if that's not what you're doing in going to the cities and municipalities I know that's supposedly not in your range but you've been you've been on ground zero for a long time the methodologies that's being offered up to our cities and municipalities municipality czar insulting you know city of Gulfport has been offered seventy nine thousand dollars you know maybe seventy nine million would be acceptable at a dollar per resident again just you know I share the same concerns my colleagues I appreciate the chairman for allowing me to come in and please take that back home and make it right

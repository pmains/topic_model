students those of you residing in southwest Minnesota and I know there are thousands of you residing in southwest Minnesota that our viewpoint University students joining us alive and in Technicolor and the faculty lounge is a gym Hagedorn he wants to be your next congressman he was here what about three months ago yes I'm like something like that and then there was this big convention thing and I thought you were done you were out it was over and i thought i'll never see or hear from him again aost i was the disappointing thought for me too yeah so what happened okay you got to bring me up to speed you want to be our new the southwest Minnesota's next congressman your Republican there's a Democrat who's got the job right now there were two or three of your Republicans that were vying for quote the nomination and they had this convention and you didn't win it and yet you're still running so what's going on yeah we took this the the lead in the second ballot the third ballot the the fellows from the Rochester area kind of got together and that's politics and we got out of the way and gave the endorsed candidate a shot but after about six weeks people I decided to get back in and people said what changed and I said well actually not much and I was kind of the point that didn't seem to be much of a campaign brewing there were some key things missing the candidate was missing key events and not putting out much of a spirited fight against the congressman so after discussions with some key leaders across the district we decided to get back in and give the people a choice to vote for a candidate in my case who wants to make this a referendum this election a referendum on congressman Walz is liberal record I believe a failed record and also offer some conservative reforms okay so you're going to face the guy who did win the convention in some primary election coming up in primary on August twelfth oh well so you're in full campaign mode well we kind of were before we just picked up where we left off going crisscross in the district going full time talking to important people like yourself and trying to get the message out about that congressman walz the most liberal congressmen the history of southern Minnesota voted for obama-care in cap and trade and dodd-frank and trillions in in stimulus and deficit spending and I want him to know that maybe it's time for him to to leave office how long has he been there this is his eighth year for terms for terms yeah yeah but that time you start making a lot of enemies wow I say Oh a politics of friends come friends go but enemies accumulate yes a too that's very very true so I'm realizing that you are now in a primary with with the other Republicans because there's just one other guy now right at this point that's correct and he'll remain nameless because it your honor he's not so we're not gonna do that so what separates you from the other Republican I know you want to attack walls I don't want to hear attack on walls what separates you from the other rehab who wants to join this is going to be a short interview because I'm not to attack the other Republican so I what's that what you have said what separate you I think that's fair yeah well I think I think the difference is I have the experience to run a campaign of this magnitude one way or another I was part of nine congressional campaigns in my life matter of fact congressman stanglin who I work for we defeated Collin Peterson twice before he actually beat us in the end and became eventually chairman of the Agriculture Committee and also the experience that wants to get to Washington to be able to make an immediate impact in the House Republican caucus a kind of the experience of a congressman in many ways I'm not bragging I just happened and been around and but I feel like still an outsider one of the few people that went to Washington actually attacked that city made the federal government smaller and stood up for conservative change and came back and was pretty much the same guy the Republican mantra is and you people obviously read from the same playbook because we've got the Senate thing going here and the every one of those candidates they they say Obamacare and and then just venom comes out just get rid of it it's horrible as ugly it's rotten um there's the Republicans in the House have already got the majority it's doubtful whether the Republicans will get enough votes in the Senate to make a difference and then of course there's the obvious veto that would be coming from the president if somebody actually did get it through so don't tell me about getting rid of Obamacare tell me about modifying it okay to make it work why I do believe there's precedent that bills like this can eventually be repealed and the catastrophic Medicare Amendments Act and late 80s for the Democrats put that through and a year later they went to repeal their own bill because the people felt it didn't like it but the reforms that I would look look for it would be more patient-centered doctor center reforms where people are holding their own money so health savings accounts as a big deal people saving investing their money shopping for their own care I think we need to tie the tax benefits as much as we can to the individual so people get the tax credits and the benefits and they can take their health care from job to job doesn't mean it would stop them from getting it through employment but it would it would open up that option certainly pools for pre-existing conditions I'm for that that's the one provision of Obamacare that I say absolutely keep get rid of the bill keep that one provision let's go from there in and tort reform you've got to go with tort reform I think that puts downward pressure on prices and and shuts down defensive medicine so those are the types of reforms that I'd before Jim Hagedorn is in the faculty lounge he's a congressional candidate from southwest Minnesota and he is in a primary which will take place August twelfth in southwestern Minnesota there's one other Republican it's a winner-take-all deal though whoever gets the most votes on August twelfth will face the incumbent congressman in the election coming up in November of this year agriculture yeah okay I'm going to make a blatant statement that I don't really believe but a lot of people do believe so I'm just going to say it okay farmers have had it too good for too long they've had all these subsidies all these supports all these special interestings on and on and on and on and on it's keeping farms going simply because it's the American dream or the Emir nightmare we're tired of it get rid of the farm bill well I come from a farm area my dad was a farmer grandfather a farmer grew up on a farm myself I i think that the farm bill the purpose of the farm bill is to help sustain agriculture and times when when things go wrong you know how farming is it's up and it's down and it's dependent a lot of times on weather and luck and everything else and and if we run little farmers and others out of the business now and then what you're going to get us a lot more big farmers and so i'm not i support the AG bill i support the programs and things that are needed to make sure that we sustain agriculture now can we move towards more market-oriented agriculture as we did it one time in the early eighties yes but i believe that those steps should be taken and phased in in such a way that it doesn't undermine what's already working now okay um another hot-button issue national/international the changing climate and i'm not going to get into whether it's man-caused or not all right because that's an interesting discussion that could take days but all the scientists government non-government are telling us the climate is changing so what do we as a society a country citizens the world need to do in your opinion to adapt to that reality well based on the premise here question the way you put it together I think I would ask this if we did everything that President Obama and Congressman walls and the what i would call extremists environmentalist types would like us to do to transform our society and it changed the way we do things and to move to other types of energy if we did all those things what difference would it make usually they come back and say that after 30 or 40 or 50 years it would make some minuscule little difference that isn't going to isn't going to do anything if you believe that man is causing this problem which I I don't really believe that if you're looking at one or five percent of all the emissions caused by man depending on how you how you look at it but here's recognize these these types of climate change procedures the cap-and-trade bill the regulations against the coal-fired power plants that congressman Walz just voted for you in the last couple of months those things that are going to transform our economy our society it's going to drive up costs for consumers it's going to make us less competitive around the world and I frankly oppose them I'm for the other side energy independence based on fossil fuel development on private on public lands for sustaining coal for nuclear for renewables and conservation and then all the infrastructures use the natural resources that God gave us and we have more natural resources in the United States than any other country in the world okay and I understand that answer and it's pretty good mama however the the coca-cola nike and some of the major private corporations in the world are changing the way they do business because of droughts floods and things like that that are affecting how they do business in various parts of the world my question is what does what does the United States government either getting out of the way or providing leadership to not necessarily change how we do things but adapt to the reality that the glaciers are in fact melting they are that is happening water is rising and you can blame whoever you want but the reality is that's happening so what do we do as human beings about that well I think you and I are just in a little bit of disagreement I don't subscribe to all those things and and what I would say is that if if we're if we're going as a country to move to energy sources that are cleaner in these types of things I have no problem with that I don't believe that the the government should push us into it before it's ready you look at wind and solar and things like that and there are there are areas where it makes sense but there's also battery technology that's needed in order to make it efficient so the cost can come down and people aren't going to be charged two or three times more for their electricity for instance Jim Hagedorn is in the faculty lounge he wants to be the Republican congressman from southwest Minnesota there's a primary in southwest Minnesota it is August twelfth you said August 12 August twelfth and so voters in southwest Minnesota you will have an opportunity to vote for him or not on August twelfth if you're a Republican do do they have an open primary over there yeah independence vote yeah we don't register by party so yeah anybody can show up and take about sweet I like that that's that's unlike what we've got grab your headphones and put those on because I dan I know wants to get involved in the dialogue here and he can't you can't hear him and less go ahead oh yeah okay yeah now we're set are you set no not exactly okay well i will keep going I'm two of the major issues that are out there in Washington DC these days the hearings over the VA yeah and hearings on Benghazi sir both hot topics that have in my opinion gotten entirely too political as opposed to substance okay what do you think well in the case of this race congressman walz is on the be a committee and he's been very tight with the Obama administration's VA matter of fact he had general secretary Shinseki in to mankato four years ago and you know what I think is what we need in Washington are people they're going to go there and try to solve the people's problems and sometimes that means you have to stand up to the establishment mostly in your own party and what we need are leaders that are going to go there and in this case I wish congressman Walz had stood up to as president on Benghazi and said this shouldn't be a partisan thing we don't need special committees I'm a Democrat you're a Democrat and i demand answers we had military men that that died there mm-hmm and and I don't you know he should want to turn his back on those military mention why I get those answers and the same thing here with the VA I think if you're there and you're part of the problem you have to accept some accountability and responsibility so are you willing to do the same with John Boehner if you if he were still the Speaker of the House and and you being a representative of southern Minnesota as a Republican absolutely whoever the speaker is you have to do that when i worked at the Treasury Department president Bush wanted to add a proposal that was going to spend about five hundred million dollars that I felt was wasteful and I talked with some people on the hill and we put a bill together and the secretary of the Treasury no less threatened my job said he'd fire me if I went up on the hill to work that bill I did it anyway because I thought it was the right thing to do sometimes when you're in a position and you have an opportunity to make things happen you just got to do it because it's the right thing should the VA secretary resign I called for today in a press release you did yeah actually recent get my press release well I said that I said that just for you I got it is what response have you had from Wow there you know the secretary himself called me and said he's afraid yeah well you know you have to accept responsibility it's under his watch I understand it's a big department it's very difficult but part of the problem is in the last six eight years that department has doubled in size it and yet the the performance isn't there so one day and I've been around this issue for a long time i'm not a veteran so i have no personal experience with me yes but it would would seem to me that that the Veterans Administration is one of those government agencies that is so big so massive that everybody is in charge of nobody's in charge and I wonder what would happen if we created this system where the state of Minnesota for instance your home state or the state of South Dakota or whatever was more responsible for administering veterans benefits then the federal government is responsible okay and I don't I don't have it I don't even know what the answer to that is I just want to throw it out as a hypothetical but I think you're onto something I mean if you're if we're going to reform government that's very important we need to right-size it and limit it in all these things but we have to be open to other sets ideas that are outside the box and as far as the veterans are concerned I've always said that we should get back to trying to have them more on a system of healthcare that mimics members of Congress and federal bureaucrats and a 75-percent subsidy and let them go pick their own doctors and else and try to open that up more to the military people rather than just protect the civilian bureaucratic force Jim Hagedorn wants to be the congressman from southwest Minnesota he's on the ballot April or choose me August twelfth August twelfth in southwest Minnesota mr. Hagedorn thank you very much oh thank you been a pleasure

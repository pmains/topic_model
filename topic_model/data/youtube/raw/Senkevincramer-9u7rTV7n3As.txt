okay so what today's ruling really does it affirms that congress never intended the federal government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions for states the statute's really quite clear so is the constitution it's this is a win for democracy for cooperative federalism for the american people and it's a big win for north dakota and it's a good day for all of us you know the supreme court decision reflects this separate co-equal roles of our government really important concepts it's it's important national policies that have to be debated and established through the democratic process by elected officials not washington bureaucrats that are unelected and there's nothing in the clean air act that allows the bureaucracy to overstep the state's authority to determine how the state will generate electricity it's up to them to them into their utilities working together similarly this case has far reaching impacts on other epa rules like waters of the u.s and regional hazes they too are built on the same cooperative federalism model so i tip my hat to late north dakota attorney general wayne stengen for laying the important groundwork for this landmark case seven years ago and to north dakota attorney general drew wrigley and north dakota's special assistant attorney general paul seabee for getting this across the finish line and getting this victory is their vision and persistence that reiterates north dakota's excellence and the bureaucracy's mediocrity good job everybody so when i uh when i hosted the epa administrator andrew wheeler here in north dakota a few years ago he promised that all regulations would stand up in court important to do that so that we don't have this ping-pong effect today's ruling goes to show that administrator wheeler and the trump administration were absolutely right they were right on the on the principle they're right on the policy i'm looking forward to a new era of the supreme court and really our entire court system which respects the tenants of congressional intent and cooperative federalism certainly hope that the biden administration's bureaucracy will stay within the confines of the law and the constitution

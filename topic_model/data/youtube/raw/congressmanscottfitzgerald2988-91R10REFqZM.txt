joining us now to discuss is republican congressman from the state of wisconsin scott fitzgerald congressman thank you for coming on today what did you think of the president's speech it was outrageous i mean the idea that the president would stand uh in philadelphia and give such a partisan speech after first promising after he was elected to heal the nation and unite the nation so the hypocrisy is just unbelievable but but i think what you're seeing is uh with 67 days left to the election that uh somebody at the white house has polling that says uh what they need to do is divide the republicans and somehow cast out a a specific percentage of them and alienate them and hopefully they won't show up and vote in the midterms or you know uh just quite honestly kind of relay a message that uh is going to somehow avoid uh the house flipping so i it's a partisan message it's a political message and it's outrageous i think the way it was presented yesterday he was in pennsylvania of course which is a battleground state we are watching closely in that senate race between dr oz and john fetterman former president donald trump also hosting a rally in pennsylvania over the weekend newsmax is going to have that covered too so just fascinating to see the location of these speeches let me pivot though because we're going to hear from president biden a little later on about an hour from now expected to talk about the american rescue plan as we head into this labor day weekend though the wall street journal is reporting the labor shortage is stalling small business hiring for the second month in a row the national federation of independent business finding lower employment despite firms wanting to hire congressman what are you hearing from business owners in your district yeah on this work break that we're on right now back in the district done a number of visits with businesses and uh the message has been the same it's really been consistent for the last year and a half and that is it's just very difficult to find anybody that uh will come to work and we're not talking about entry level wages at this point we're talking about in some instances especially in light manufacturing anywhere from twenty to twenty four dollars uh and and they'll do on the job training with these individuals as well but they just can't find the bodies they can't get people back into the labor market and as a result of that it's it's had an impact i think still on the supply chain uh it's having an impact on whether or not some of these products uh in in wisconsin here it's agriculture and tourism as well just very difficult to find people to work even coming out of the pandemic and the covet closures i mean i think back to your state sir of wisconsin the governor there very strict in sort of his coveted protocols when it came to business operation tony evers how do you think that plays into this upcoming election do you think voters are still thinking about the impact of covet and covet policies well it was uh our governor tony evers it was a a complete fumbling of of this administration on how to handle this correctly uh the mixed messages that they continued to send uh him continually uh reminding everybody that the cool the school should remain closed uh it was really a mess so it's going to take a while i think for some of these institutions to kind of rebound kids went back to school this week in wisconsin and um you know there's still a lot of parents right now that are that are asking tough questions about what happened and how far behind are their students as they go back to school this fall uh it's it's something that i think it's going to take some time to get the right answers yeah those young students suffering some major learning loss but speaking of students and education we got an update on the president's plan to cancel some student loan debt that loan forgiveness plan reports that the application portal is still not totally open essentially you could submit an email address you'll get some more information about when you'll get those loans forgiven but there also reports congressmen that republicans clearly take issue with the president's plan but might be planning some lawsuits to actually block it from happening again you hear president biden going referencing the heroes act to to essentially bypass congress when it comes to providing this financial support do you think this plan is going to work out in the end well first of all let me just say the controversy surrounding it is just off the charts again back in the district i've been approached by those that cut across even party lines that are saying this is wrong uh we know that the president doesn't have this authority and uh certainly this this level of forgiveness or the way that they're uh linking it to pell grants and and we've had these discussions in congress i'm a member of education and labor about uh what they can do once once the loan programs are restarted this this is some don't take my word for it take speaker pelosi's word for it uh we all know that this is illegal so there is there is the theory now that they're trying to push this beyond the november elections get this into court uh there's already been lawsuits filed as you mentioned and and it'll take a long time for this to kind of work its way through the legal system uh so this may be um actually a plan to simply push the entire issue beyond the midterms i i don't doubt that that that is certainly one of their goals all right well thank you so much sir for joining us this morning that is wisconsin congressman scott fitzgerald with his thoughts we appreciate it thanks emma good to be with you

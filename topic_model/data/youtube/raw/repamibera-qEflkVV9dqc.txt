Thank You mr. chairman and thank secretary I'm Stengel you know in your opening comments you talked about two broad goals that you have in terms of coordinating anti-isil message and then amplifying the voices of third parties that are trying to coordinate encounter the ISIL message like to focus a little bit on that that's that second broad goal I do think you'll broadly in the United States as well as across the Muslim world the vast majority of folks reject isil's message and and want to counter that that said you know their mechanisms of using social media and communicating in real time and building the message you know the the mons in United States may not be very adept at using social media right they may go on a blog and in our prior hearing you know we we talked about some of the difficulties that you know traditional anti-isil Islamic groups and third parties who want to counter may not be adept at you know countering in real time that message building that relationship and you know what are some strategies that we can use along with technology companies that understands how how to use these newer technologies to make them more effective encountering the message yes congressman thank you it reminds me of the famous Mark Twain quote about the lie going around the world in the time that it takes the truth to tie its shoes that the truth being these mainstream Muslim clerics who take the time to read the Koran take the time to read the hadith and don't don't necessarily have an expertise in social media the way some of the bad guys do so one of the ideas that we've discussed in the Chairman alluded to it earlier is is there a private sector foundation or NGO of content creators people who can help content creators who can help the Imam in Detroit to get on Twitter who can help some of these voices get out there because what we've seen and I've seen this in in the Middle East there's often a reticence among the good guys to be out there and and we need to get them out there and we need to give them the skill set to be out there and yeah as someone who is not a degenerate yeah when I think about my daughter think about our younger staff members they'll roll their eyes when I talk about you know how I communicate on social media because it evolved so quickly and I think it's more than just training those scholars and third party individuals but it's probably partnering with them to take those messages and in very real time continually communicate and encounter ISIL messaging in real time and using the same tools that ISIL probably is using better than we are so that would be one point you touched on something else that it certainly is of concern and came up in our prior hearing as well as Twitter starts to take down a lot of these handles as Facebook starts to take down these messages we are as you alluded to previously starting to see folks go to apps like telegram that are much more encrypted and much more difficult to to monitor that is a certainly some some concern because we're trying to counter message you know that those apps become much more difficult what is what are some strategies that you know we might be able to work on it's it's an area that we're just beginning to explore this migration on to encrypted platforms and again as I mentioned the good news about it is they're reaching much much smaller audiences but they are using it as tools of violence and violent acts not so much about persuading according to the ideology and we also know again not to be pessimistic about it that the ability to create encrypted platforms is something that has is becoming more widespread itself so that people are going to be able to do that in the field and I'm happy to talk more about that in a in a different setting where it would be appropriate but but I share your concerns great and then in in my brief remaining time and our prior here you know we're certainly talking about countering the message online but in our prior hearing we also had discussion about using traditional media tools right using Hollywood using movies to to counter narrative again you know in the Middle East as well as in certain ethnic communities they'll consume television they'll consume movies and what are our strategies to continue to put out an anti-isil message an anti radical ideology message and that that's one that I certainly think we ought to be doing a little bit more yes I mean as you know congressman the the most powerful and comprehensive platform in the Middle East the satellite TV it's not social media and just during this past Ramadan which is like sweet weeks for television Middle East broadcasting which is led by brilliant man my Ally jabber did a series called selfie to selfie one was a was a satirical comedic exploration that satirized ISIL and made fun of ISIL it this Ramadan it was the most successful and the most watched program in the Middle East this is the kind of thing that we applaud we had Ali at a retreat at sunnylands that I mentioned earlier for content makers from Hollywood in the Middle East and and that's the kind of thing that I think again will actually win this war of narratives great and I'm out of time I'll yield back

and I'm here to strongly endorse the nomination for the US Court of Appeals for the 8th circuit current district court judge Ralph Erickson but he is somebody who's done just a fabulous job on the federal bench in Fargo and is somebody that is not only well respected for his tremendous work first as a lawyer now as a judge but as somebody who is just highly regarded in the community and deeply respected because of his personal integrity and the kind of person that he is 2003 judge Erickson was nominated by President George W Bush to the US District Court for the District of North Dakota and was quickly confirmed by the Senate wait for it unanimously I'm hoping that happens again you know I've known senator Hoeven since 1975 when I used to sit on the bench and watch him play basketball against the team that I was on but I would say that we have grown at least older in the service of our country together and I have deep admiration and love for them and the service they give our country as Americans it's really important that we do not lose sight of who we are we stand on the shoulders of giants this is not the first time that the country has been divided it is not the first time in my lifetime a generation ago dr. Martin Luther King jr. told us that the arc of the moral arc of history is long but it bends towards justice the three branches of government are in some way represented here we stand in balance and in some tension those of us who are judges stand on the shoulders of other giants what they tell us is that as judges we have no politics or creed we have no constituency save the Constitution and the laws that's what being a judge in my life is all about

ladies and gentlemen the Democratic leader of the United States House of Representatives the Honorable Nancy Pelosi good morning mr. president leader Reid leader McCollum McConnell mr. speaker my colleague mr. Clyburn members of Congress House and Senate distinguished guests Thank You mr. speaker for making this day possible thank you so much one distinguished guest who is not with us or maybe has come late is a John Lewis we were on the steps of the Supreme Court earlier this morning mr. Clyburn stayed until the start of the program mr. John Lewis is holding forth over that it is an honor to serve in the Congress of the United States with John Lewis and it is a joy to be here to honor Rosa Parks when Rosa Parks was a little baby her mother sang her the hymn o freedom let it ring she would hear that him in church too as she grew up it became the anthem of her life and the mission of her her life as Rosa Parks would say years later I'd like to be remembered as a person who wanted to be free and wanted other people to be free too Rosa Parks is being remembered with his statue and in the Capitol but this is not the first time her greatness has been recognized here she has many connections to Congress she is no stranger to these halls she was recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal inscribed with the title mother of the modern-day civil rights movement and with the words inscribed quiet strength pride dignity and courage that was a great day when we honored her she had personal connection to the house as the speaker mentioned for 18 years she was an assistant to John Conyers John Conyers and they worked together they work together to advance the cause of civil rights and equality we always ask mr. Conyers to tell us stories about Rosa Parks tell us stories about Rosa Parks and one that I think is appropriate at this time is John well john conyers first met her when he was just out of school we traveled south to join the civil rights movement after law school and he met her then she would come to droid she worked in his first campaign and she would later become his first congressional hire the first person he hired on his congressional staff what a beautiful connection well pretty soon mr. Conyers found out that people were visiting the office to see Rosa Parks in naka Congress in fact she was invited all over the country to be honored and how about this mr. president one day she went to him and she said she wanted to thank him for allowing her to be honored all over the country and be wilt would be willing to take a pay cut for her time away from the office because of the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus and that of leader Reid and then speaker Hastert Rosa Parks was the first woman to lie in state in the rotunda of the Capitol of from her birth her mother had some lip letting freedom ring how proud her mama would be to see her baby you know what eulogized at her passing by two presidents former President Bill Clinton and future President Barack Obama imagine that I had the privilege of speaking at her funeral - but what can you say in the company that that greatness well what I said was that legislation had been introduced by Jesse Jackson jr. and Senator John Kerry to place the capital of Rosa Park and the capital of the United States I got an uproarious reaction to it what can you say among presidents past and future preachers from all over the country a statue in congressman I promised them that the legislation would pass and quickly now that funeral was November 2nd and on December 1st President George W Bush signed it into law 50 years to the day that Rosa Parks sat down on the bus in Montgomery Aragon 50 years to the death sir Rosa Parks's feel right at home in the capital joining Sojourner Truth dr. Martin Luther King and many other American heroes she will inspire all who walk these halls especially young people with her quiet strength her pride her dignity her courage I told you how Rosa Parks is recognized by Congress and Friends of Congress now I'd like to share with you comments from one of my advisor invited guests the baseball great Willie Mays my fellow Californian born in Alabama who saw the same in justices as Rosa Parks did as he was growing up he couldn't be here today but he sent a letter and he said I could share these rode words about her he said more than this and I gave a complete letter to Sheila Keith roses niece he said most times change doesn't happen fast most times it happens bit by bit little by little one person's actions inspiring another Rosa Parks simply did what was natural she was tired so she sat down and that simple act sparked outrage and that outrage spread and one person's actions inspired change he went on to say we will try to remember to encourage change when it serves justice and today we will remember with admiration the simple act of a brave woman we will remember we will honor Rosa Parks lovely words from a fellow Alabama all-american icon Willie Mays by dedicating the statute we honor Rosa Parks for her bravery for serving justice and for inspiring change may this statue long and be a tribute to her strength and spirit her legacy and her leadership may God bless the memory

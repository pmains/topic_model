the subcommittee will come to order without objection the chair is authorized to clear a recess a subcommittee anytime without objection members of the full committee who are not members of the subcommittee are authorized to participate in today's hearings this hearing is entitled investing in our Rivals examining U.S capital flows to foreign Rivals and adversaries around the world and uh I do want to apologize for the fact that this hearing is taking place while the Republicans are holding their leadership elections we scheduled this and then apparently in determining when to have their leadership elections Mr McCarthy didn't think that this was the most important thing to to avoid scheduling against uh still obviously we would this would be a better hearing if we had the full participation of my of the current minority party um although Mr Gonzalez is small not numerous But Mighty and will represent his party well uh I'll I it's my understanding the uh that Maxine is is coming or is not coming yes Maxine will be here so I will recognize myself uh for four minutes and then I will uh turn to Mr Gonzalez uh over a year ago we had a hearing on China Inc this peering Builds on that American it Americans are investing in Russia to some degree not much now and substantially in China there are 262 Chinese companies list in the United States and of course Americans are free to invest in Hong Kong and Shanghai including our index funds uh eight Russian firms were suspended from Trading the United States some 83 billion dollars of American Capital has been invested in Russia this raises three types of issues macroeconomic investor protection and National Security as to uh macro economic um capital is very good for a capitalist system we send a 1.2 trillion dollars of capital to China some would say well why don't we just stop well China provides 2.1 trillion dollars to the U.S economy but not all capital is equal Equity Capital does more risk Capital does more to build um a uh to build a capitalist economy we send 1.1 trillion in equity capital of China they send only 700 billion of equity capital in the United States don't take my word for it that Equity capital is more important than esteems institution the U.S Congress has decided to spend 200 billion dollars every year on our capital gains allowance to encourage Equity investment and uh but for some reason we subsidize not only Americans who invest in America but we provide that same capital gains allowance to those investing in the Chinese economy uh I just want to point out that's not on us that's another committee that's responsible for that investor protection we have the pcaob uh in Hong Kong now Congress passed uh bill I sponsored in the house the uh holding foreign companies accountable act um that passed China has agreed in principle and now work is going on in Hong Kong to see whether they will actually Implement that important legislation uh we'll know more at the end of the year second on investor protection we have the Vie structure you think you're buying Alibaba stock you're not you're buying Alibaba Cayman Islands which then has a contractual relationship with a shell company in China which then has a contractual relationship with Alibaba we've uh got to see what risks that poses for investors and particularly wonder whether index funds should be investing when they say they're investing in the biggest companies in the world Alibaba Cayman Islands is not one of the biggest companies in the world um and to say that with little uh uh investigation uh Capital should be deployed through this Vie structure is questionable and it's also a questionable whether index funds should go outside the United States invest in the Shanghai or Hong Kong exchange perhaps in Chinese companies that have deliberately avoided the pcaob by delisting from the United States um and uh we then turn to the National Security issues when Americans invest in Chinese companies that creates a lobbying interest here in the United States to support the success of those companies and ultimately China in addition it can create an incentive to transfer Technologies to those Chinese companies which are the subject of U.S investment uh we shouldn't know what uh which Chinese companies are raising money here by changing our rules to say that when there's a private placement even if they don't choose to use regulation D or one of the other safe Arbors that there's some registration in the major deals so not only SEC but under certain circumstances other U.S government agencies can look at private files and see what's coming in likewise we ought to see um when a hedge fund or a private Equity Fund already is required to file a form PF with the SEC we should know whether they are getting substantial amounts of of Chinese capital or Russian Capital uh recognize myself uh for five minutes uh a few comments I want to make first first it is this Congress and this committee that put the pressure on passed the law that is getting the pcaob access to the audit work papers right now they're in Hong Kong to see whether this agreement is actually going to be implemented and if it's not then our law will require that many of these Chinese companies need to be delisted um the second is and I think uh Miss chew pointed that out that the Vie structure is designed to evade Chinese laws or avoid Chinese laws however you phrase it but it puts our investors in a position where they think they're buying Alibaba a big Chinese company and instead they have no shareholder rights uh they have except in Alibaba um Cayman Islands which raises the issue of whether we should allow a company to sell stock in our country calling themselves Alibaba when they're really Alibaba Cayman Islands not the same thing as the big Chinese company um and we have to look and see whether it is appropriate for low-cost funds and index funds to be investing in companies either that have fled uh American markets to avoid the pcaob or employ this Vie structure because um when you're painting when you're just not when you have no money to investigate what you're investing in you're just doing on the basis of an index those are risks that you probably shouldn't subject American investors to and in particular Alibaba is one of the biggest countries in the world if you want to invest the big companies World invest in Alibaba but Alibaba Cayman Islands is not one of the biggest companies in the world and so you don't actually meet the qualifications for the index um uh Ms uh Chu um I'd like you to comment on the idea of whether um these low-cost paint by the Numbers index funds should be allowed to invest in in bies that are not operating companies but rather a company in the Cayman Islands that has a relationship with a company in China that then has a relationship with Alibaba or the other big Chinese company thank you and no I don't think that this should be an option for U.S investors least of all because of investor protections but also because of the possibilities that some of these companies are engaged in activities that are contrary to his national interests without the knowledge of again the investor the problem with index funds is that they are beholden to Due profit the index funds and the index one index provider is specifically operate using a set of Technical and financial criteria so criteria like market cap or liquidity or size when they evaluate which companies which Securities to add into an index or which ones to remove so for example Russian Securities were all removed from msci ftse Russell s p Dow Jones all these indexes in early March of this year but they weren't removed because of ethical concerns and because of U.S sanctions they're removed because they were virtually worthless and there are already policies I I I do want to move move on with my question uh Professor um should uh index funds be investing in companies that were listed on American exchanges and then delisted themselves or wordy listed because uh they wouldn't allow access to the uh of the pcobee to their audit work papers should be a full transparency I agree with the testimony in my fellow panelists and apparently the sentiment of most of the Congressional leaders here there should be this full transparency I I happen to think that the spirit of what you're asking about should also be addressed to even U.S investors which is not your purpose to know today is uh professor your mic is still up I'm sorry uh I I I share the the Spirit uh and the content of my fellow panelists I I do think that there should be greater transparency uh and uh that even sophisticated investors are representing of a lot of individual innocent people's money and I'm going to try to to sneak in uh one more question and that is in November of 2020 the SEC required that um in public offerings you have to disclose the unique in uh uh risks that investors face investing in China the Vie structure the rule of law questions uh should we also require that these same risk factors be disclosed and this is required by one of the pieces of legislation under consideration today uh that these same risk factors be disclosed to those investing in private placements yeah I think they should be I will say in the case of Alibaba came and I actually read the 500 page registration papers uh not in preparation for this but when it was when it happened I thought that the volume was misleading itself it in fact allowed uh Force for uh Jack ma the the then CEO to be Emperor for life with the exception only the Chinese government could remove him he he had found their shares that that nobody that I know in the US invest in the company realized he had uh but it was just buried in so much stuff so sometimes I will say uh Mr chairman we have disclosure and it's still not transparent it was buried in the fine print thank you my time has expired now turn to the gentleman from Connecticut Mr Himes

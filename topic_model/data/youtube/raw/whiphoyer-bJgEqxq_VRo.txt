mr. Hoyer for five minutes without objection the speaker it is now seven months since the start of 115 Congress and six months since Republicans have controlled all the levers of power of our government in all we've seen are broken promises Donald Trump and our Republican colleagues in Congress ran on a platform that included health care for everyone massive investments in infrastructure tax reform and a dramatic increase in jobs on all four of these there's been zero progress zero legislation sent to the president and zero effort to work with Democrats to achieve any of those objectives Donald Trump promised voters that he would be and I quote the greatest jobs president that God ever created yet neither he nor the Republican congressional leadership have put forward a comprehensive jobs bill instead he and his Republican allies in the Congress have proposed budgets that would slash investments in education infrastructure and research all areas that directly help our economy create jobs in fact jobs that the president claimed to have saved are in fact going overseas forecasters are now predicting slower economic growth and manufacturing average weekly earnings have only grown half as earnings across the private sector as a whole over the past six months when it comes to health care it hasn't just been the broken promise of insurance for everyone it's been a non-stop roller coaster of legislative proposals all of which would strip coverage away from tens of millions of a mirror Ekans raise cost and deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions on tax reform all we've seen is a one-page outline and a budget proposal with reconciliations instructions setting up a process for jamming a partisan tax reform bill through Congress that's a non-starter because to be successful any tax reform legislation must be bipartisan as was the 1986 tax reform under President Reagan and speaker O'Neill to top it all off we considered and are considering this week an appropriations minibus without even having had a budget on this floor some 88 days after it was due the Republicans promised regular order in fact they are pursuing no order Republicans haven't even bothered to pass a budget which is what we're supposed to do in the house before moving to appropriations so mr. speaker at the six-month mark we've only seen gridlock no progress chaos and broken promises even some Republican members and perhaps many Republican members our growing is frustrated as the American people their party is failing representative Steve Womack from Arkansas said late last month that we quote we'd better get our act together we're not governing now we're stuck and represented Tom Reed of New York said quote the fact that we're not getting to these issues health care budget tax reform is frustrating we came here to move the needle so that what I'm saying has been said by my Republican colleagues as well perhaps represented Tom Massie put it most succinctly when he tweeted about his Republican colleagues they confuse activity with progress Republicans Mr Speaker have failed to address the challenges facing the American people and they've done nothing to improve the lives of those working hard to make it in America we should be considering legislation to create jobs and grow the economy we should be working to improve and strengthen the Affordable Care Act not replace it that would be consistent with some 3/4 of Americans who believe that's what we ought to be doing we should be working in a bipartisan way to reform our tax code and promote competitiveness for American businesses that are competing in world markets growth job creation as well as fiscal sustainability that is what we should be seeking in a tax bill we should be investing in infrastructure that lures jobs back home from overseas and mr. speaker would be we should be returning to regular order and an open process that Republicans have abandoned to the detriment of legislation and to our country more closed rules in this seven months that have occurred in my 36 years in the Congress of the United States mr. speaker the American people need a better deal a better deal than they've gotten over the last seven months seven months into this Congress it is clear that House Republicans are not on the side of working people in the words of New York Times columnist David Brooks one of the most conservative columnist in The New York Times last week he said this quote Republicans offer nothing but negativity detachment absence and an axe Democrats on the other hand are offering the American people as I said a better deal one focused on helping all our people Make It in America better jobs better wages yes a better future it's what Democrats have always done when Democrats have been entrusted to lead there is a history a track record to back it up mr. Speaker I want to show my colleagues that rhetoric is cheap or talk is cheap as we say but performance is really what we ought to look to and I want to bring some charts here to the attention of our colleagues and indeed to the American people as well what Democrats have always done this chart number one Democrats perform better on economic growth now that's easy to say but this graph shows exactly under from Truman to Obama the blue you can see under Eisenhower economic growth was about a third or maybe 40 percent kennedy johnson and johnson much greater than Nixon and Nixon Ford Carter greater than either Nixon or Nixon Ford and Carter to the size of many had the same just about GDP growth that Reagan of which my Republican friends proudly talked and then what happened under Bush won and down then what happened under Clinton up GDP growth under Bush to down under Obama up that's not campaign rhetoric those are the statistics that the economy has performed better under Democrats now Democrats perform better on the stock market the stock market who mr. Trump that likes to point to today it's doing well why because the Obama economy as you just saw was doing well and the expectations were good if you look at this better on the stock market Truman greater growth in the stock market eisenhower and less Kennedy Johnson Johnson up Nixon damn Nixon Ford Nixon Ford had negative growth in the stock market and then Nixon damn Nixon Ford Nixon Ford had negative growth in the stock market and then Carter growth and yes Reagan and Bush one had growth but guess what then Clinton had better growth and then guess what Bush - again like Nixon Ford negative growth in the stock market mentor a 1ks were worth less for retired people and their security was less secure because the stock market when the tank and then yep what happened under Obama the stock market went up now lastly I want to show this statistic and this is a stark statistic because it shows that under Democratic presidents every segment every wage level in America saw appreciation now this only goes back to 1967 so we go to the lowest quintile went up higher under Democrats than Republicans every quintile and guess what the highest quintile did better under Democrats just as the lower quintile did better but what you see is everybody did better the only negative of course was under Republicans where the second quintile went down over their years in office so if you compare all these Mr Speaker it is not campaign rhetoric it is not rhetoric on this floor but it is economic facts economic statistics economic reports show that when we promised a better deal we delivered a better deal so as we look back on the past six months of Republicans broken promises and failures to govern let's remember there is indeed a better deal to be had Democrats are ready to work with our Republican colleagues and with the administration to make progress mr. speaker I've been here 36 years and one of the things I'm proudest of my Republican colleagues many of them say Hoyer will work with us in a way to compromise and make progress for our country but if our Republican colleagues continue to be unwilling to work in a bipartisan way we're going to offer a clear and proven alternative a proven alternative I hope my Republican colleagues will return from the August district work period ready to ensure that American people get a better deal and work with us constructively to get that better deal and I yield back the balance of my time the chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania mr. Fitzpatrick for five minutes

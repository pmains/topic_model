hi everybody I'm Congressman Jim Hines and I want to talk for a minute about a topic that shouldn't come before the Congress in the next couple of weeks and that's net neutrality sounds boring but really really important thing look I don't need to tell you that the Internet has changed the way we do everything from ordering books to watching entertainment to communicating with each other and wallet has done this of course it has created all sorts of brand-new companies that didn't exist 20 years ago immense amount of wealth hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs and so what net neutrality is about is making sure that that innovative aspect of the internet doesn't go away the plumbing of the Internet of course is largely owned by private companies and those private companies have done a great job investing in that internet but we need to make sure that now that they are as big as it they are that they're not actually out there squelching competition they're not telling one app that you've got preferential treatment they're not telling a customer that for whatever reason you get slower speed these guys get higher speed this content is regulated this content is not and so therefore the concept of a truly free internet is is essential at the same time of course we do want those companies to continue to invest in the Internet given all that has happened and all that might yet come from the internet so the answer is to go back to where we were in about 2015 when Tom wheeler who then was chairman of the FCC put forward a proposal it wasn't the law it was just a regulation that said that internet companies had to observe net neutrality they couldn't throttle back certain apps they couldn't favor their own content but at the same time the FCC said we're not gonna regulate you like a phone company where we have to improve rates and some of the heavier handed aspects so what you're going to see the next three weeks is a net neutrality bill that takes us back to 2015 a point where I think we would be guaranteed a truly free and open Internet but without so much regulation companies were discouraged from investing so I'll be supporting that I think that it's really really important that we continue to make sure that the Internet is a domain where somebody who wants to start a company or build an app or think rethink the way we do entertainment has the opportunity to do that so watch this because in the next three weeks or so there'll be a lot of activity in the Congress hopefully assuring the kind of growth and investment and freedom and neutrality that we've come to expect in law for the future of this country thank you

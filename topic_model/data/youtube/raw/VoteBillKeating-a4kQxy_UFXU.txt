well thank you very much for having me on jackie and and thank all of you uh for your solidarity uh i just uh left london three days ago um i think your prior speaker was right in many respects sanctions have different meanings they are longer range with the sanctions against putin himself he probably doesn't have much assets in his own name significantly the u.s announced sanctions yesterday that dealt with family members of some of the russian elite and oligarchs so that that is important as well in terms of the legislation that i put in for sanctions it actually is done in a transatlantic partnership parliamentarians in the eu have a the exact same sanction that we put on against russian parliamentarians members of the duma and it's an effort to show bipartisanship we have republicans and democrats on this in the us and our transatlantic bond where we have identical sanctions uh from each other's parliaments to the russian parliament that voted uh to actually take away the sovereignty of portions of ukraine in in an action that's reprehensible and against international law now as paul was saying sanctions can cut both ways now polling suggests there's very little appetite for the us to play any significant role in in this conflict if you throw in what everyone is saying will be huge hikes to petrol prices that could make an already unpopular president more unpopular and how long do you then take the high moral ground if it's really impacting you economically well i think our leaders and and president uh realizes that we're all going to share a burden in fact he said that he's preparing uh americans for that as you're preparing uh your leaders are preparing people in europe we will all have a bear a burden to bear now the battle isn't between uk ukraine and russia and we have to dispel that notion this is bigger than that prior to this conflict uh and this invasive terrible horrific action by a person i think has gone off the rails a bit we were facing a historic challenge of authoritarianism and democracy this is the turning point this is the turning point historically and when we left the munich security conference uh the message was solidarity but realize what a significant moment this is where we can't turn back or democracy will indeed fail so the messages are strong uh but you can't equate sanctions with putin's current current actions but that is that that is the difficulty for you though particularly for america perhaps you know you're under no illusion about the gravity of this situation you know you're saying if we fail in meeting this moment then democracy fails but we are watching armored vehicles and russian troops on the outskirts of the european capital are we already seeing that failure no you're seeing uh an action that putin has control over militarily and he's surrounded this country with 70 of his entire conventional military force and the quite harsh truth is that any direct military action by nato or by the united states would not be successful logistically in the short sense so we're doing what we are nato is for the first time in its history uh activated it's a response force it's never been done before we're bolstering the nato borders we're there for humanitarian reasons we're bringing weapons in to help uh ukrainians defend themselves and we're prepared to suffer the after effects of sanctions so we're all in as a unit and uh the solidarity is necessary and the resolve to make this last russia will become a pariah country a third-rate country uh with the weakened economy but we have to persevere it might take months it might take years and some people would point to what they would say is the brutal truth that president biden he predicted this invasion he talked about almost every step and it has happened as he predicted it and yet he and the rest of the wider world were impotent to stop it so doesn't this make the united states look very weak well no uh you know we could take a portion of canada for instance that's contiguous with the united states uh and if we chose to take that section the russian army uh and other armies would be capable of doing it because short-term military advantage that's overwhelming that he's playing that card now that could be the last card putin plays if we band together the way we are now uh he's destroying his country and as i saw those scenes just moments ago on your program we should rivet on the fact that the heartbreaking fact that ukrainians are suffering children in subways people fleeing their homes a few days ago i was with the mayor of kiev vitaly klitschko and he was describing innocent peace-loving people just wanting to go to work it's a tragedy and we will do what we can collectively in solidarity but some of the early cards putin has control over uh no one since uh the nazi era has played those type of cards in europe before uh it is uh something it's shocking and something that has to be stopped here

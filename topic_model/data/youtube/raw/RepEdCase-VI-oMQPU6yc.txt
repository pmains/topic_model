good afternoon and aloha or good morning uh in hawaii i'm saying good afternoon because this is congressman ed case and i'm coming to you from capitol hill in washington dc a little bit ahead of you and in the time zones i'm actually sitting in my my office in the rayburn house office building um and this is another uh series of talk stories in which i try to reach out to each and all of the folks that i represent for the past couple of talk stories i've i've done it a little differently uh with covid19 uh requiring us to stay virtual for now and and with so much partnership that i've been engaged in with my with my state and county government and community organization partners throughout the last year and a half i've been sharing uh my my talk stories with my partners in staten county government uh uh especially my uh my city council members um i have done joint talk stories uh thus far with council members cardero toba elefante uh and today i am just uh really really happy to join somebody that i've known for just a long long time in in staten county government that she was in before i got in so i was admiring her work in government before i even got close to government and that is council member carol fukunaga who is here with us uh today uh carol uh represents a district six on the honda city council uh that is a highly urban area that's really the center of honolulu around downtown it stretches from from makiki to to aya but just some of the communities that she and i represent uh downtown honolulu parts of makiki level heights papakalea fort shafter moanalua valley it's a fascinating district uh and um she and i share a hundred thousand constituents uh throughout uh throughout our what of course me and the us house of representatives and and carol on the hunt of the city council carol um started out really a long long time ago uh even before she was she served in the constitutional convention in 78 which is where she got her start she went on to serve in the state house as well as the state senate has served now for quite a while and under the city council focuses on on economic development she's been a leader of technology for decades uh uh in our in our in our state and and she's somebody that i really think is just a great public servant and so we're gonna we're gonna share the next hour plus with each and all of you let me just give you a run to show here uh first of all um we are going to both give you some introductory uh time 5-10 minutes to give you our overview of what's happening from our kuleana uh and then we're gonna discuss uh uh between uh carol and myself uh i should say council member from tanaga but we've known each other a long time um we're gonna discuss a couple of issues that we're already working on together and she's going to engage me in a dialogue on those questions and then we've got some then we're going to turn this over to you um so you can you can you can give questions to us either right off of the facebook page there and those will get to us or um you can email right now edcase.events at mail.house.gov mail.house.gov edcase.events.mail.house uh with that let me give you uh my report uh before i turn it over uh to the council member uh we are here on an intense day um uh in washington dc and on capitol hill we've had somewhere in the range of 12 votes already on the on the floor of the u.s house the order of the day today is appropriations appropriations is our annual uh federal funding outside of kovid19 we fund our federal government every year uh through 12 separate appropriations of bills this year um those bills total up to 1.5 trillion dollars and so a whole range of subjects right across the board defense social services education transportation foreign affairs labor human health and on and on and this week and last week um uh and really over the past month my appropriations committee where i've served since i came back to congress has been busy uh putting those bills together and and now we are putting them on the floor for a full vote before before they go to the senate um there are many many areas of the appropriations of bills that are relevant to hawaii that i've been working very very hard to to direct my attention to and appropriations attention to specific issues before i go any further and forget i would love to invite you to visit case.house.gov case.house.gov that is my central website a lot of information on what i'm up to my office um there is in the media section um um several press releases that you can go to to get into the details on appropriations so that's what we're doing today um and we will be doing uh you know tomorrow and what we were doing all week here um let me back up a second and just kind of lay the foundation that i like to lay here um first of all i represent what's first congressional district which is uh half of the state population wise my district is really hundulou proper it stretches uh from makapuu all the way through central honolulu all the way up to mililani mauka launani valley just short of wahiawa then back down through waipahu eva ewa beach kapolei ko lina aokage point that's that's my district uh and uh we have of course two representatives uh my colleague now is uh congressman kai kaheli he represents the second congressional which is the rest of oahu plus all of the neighbor islands the district that i represented previously in congress and i really look at my job in three buckets uh first of all as a as a u.s representative under the constitution i'm one vote of many in congress that tries to chart the right of course for our country overall and so those are my obligations in that bucket to our country uh what is the right direction for our country to go on covet what what how should we interrelate with you know china um how should we deal with health care in our country how should we function uh and set a a solid education foundation throughout our country these are national issues so that's my first bucket my second bucket is my obligations to hawaii how can i make sure the federal government helps our hawaii we have needs right across hawaii as we all know and the federal government has many resources of many um obligations and many uh capabilities to help um and yet sometimes um it's it's hard to um get our federal government these these large marble buildings five thousand miles away to to really understand and appreciate what we really need in hawaii because oftentimes we're different from the rest of the country uh so many of my efforts have to do here with kind of the translation of the federal government's abilities to help into what we actually need appropriations is a huge part of that uh the federal funding and where it should go in hawaii but um much of it is um not just funding and then the third bucket is my obligation to help you with your individual concerns um we sometimes call that case work like a legal case or otherwise but the bottom line is these are your issues that you need help with especially with our federal government we help many veterans for example because our federal government is responsible for veterans we help many people with immigration because our federal government is responsible for immigration obviously during covet 19 there were tremendous needs across our state and country and many many people had those needs we had many programs to help people didn't always know where to go and we tried to serve people in terms of kind of an information clearinghouse some of these programs uh were not federal government programs for example unemployment that's a state program uh but it was a huge part of my workload and we tried to help people uh to navigate through that system of course if it's directly related to federal government we can we can directly help um so that's kind of you know my district and my job in the big picture speaking of covet 19 of course covet 19 was a major issue throughout the last year and a half um and uh our efforts were devoted throughout that period to to um developing and and passing and implementing uh the laws that um provided emergency assistance throughout our country somewhere around five plus trillion dollars it took uh thus far um um to to kind of help get us through 19 at the federal level of which somewhere around 20 billion dollars now and and counting uh was received in hawaii whether it be state and county governments whether it be assistance of small businesses uh whether it be federal contributions to unemployment insurance whether it was direct payments uh to to most uh citizens from from your government to help you get us through uh that was of course um uh critical and as we all know we're not out of the woods not by a long shot uh so of late uh my efforts have been very very much uh devoted to to encouraging um everybody to get vaccinated uh because um it's very very clear from the science uh and from from the studies um that you are essentially to put it really directly at far greater risk um uh if you do not get a vaccination uh and contract covin 19 uh then any risk that is presented by getting the vaccine and so uh really my my efforts have been devoted to information to certainly federal government assistance with with vaccines and to essentially trying to carry that message we have one of the highest rates of vaccinations in our country as we all know i think we're number three um today um and perhaps that's good news of course it's good news uh but the fact that uh somewhere in the range of thirty percent of the delta in hawaii have not yet been vaccinated even though they're widely available now is a concern because until we get a higher level of vaccination we are not going to be out of the woods not by a long shot so that's my pitch on vaccinations we can give you more information if you want more information the final area that i'll talk about in terms of of kind of the the substantive areas that i've been focusing on over the last couple of months so the first one obviously being coveted 19 the second one being my appropriations process which again as a member of that committee takes just a ton of my time but if i do it right yields a very very good result for hawaii um the third area that i've been very very much focused on that you've all been reading about in the media is the infrastructure bill um this is a major generational um investment in our nation's infrastructure um the the backbone if i can put it that way of our of our communities and and society proposed by president biden um it has been um passed out in some areas in the house already um it is um very very much on all of our minds now we're frankly trying to get it out of the congress in the next few weeks um think about infrastructure as not just roads and and uh you know ports and airports and and sewers and water pipes which is kind of your traditional infrastructure but much broader than that think about um you know fixing our hospitals um our aging hospitals our broadband a huge part of infrastructure is to make sure that we're all on the net i think we all saw in the course of coca-19 how much we depended on the net um and so this bill is critical to all of us um i am supporting uh the bipartisan infrastructure agreement uh that um that i supported in the house and that the u.s senate um has now reached an agreement in principle at least to proceed which is very very good news because i think we all want our government to work and so if we can if we can if we can get a government to actually work despite this incredible partisanship that we all face every single day i've had incredible partisanship here in washington over the last 48 hours with with our efforts to understand what really happened in the attack on the capitol on january 6th to disagreement among colleagues as to whether they should follow very very clear health guidelines in terms of of wearing a mask when we assemble on the floor of the house hundreds of us all in a closed space at one time to vote so partisanship is all around us but if we can make this bill work i think we'll all feel better about ourselves and so i'm very much devoted to those um efforts at the moment uh that's a very very quick report from uh from me um um obviously a lot more to say but um i'm gonna i'm gonna stop there and um turn the floor over to council member fukunaga for her report and then we will start kind of discussing mutual issues and get to your questions aloha thank you so much congressman case it's uh always very exciting and uh fun to hear about the latest uh actions that you're taking in congress thank you so much for allowing us to join with you today i've asked my staff to join me in putting together some brief powerpoint slides just to illustrate you know some of the challenges that we have here in honolulu as sort of the local representation of you know what what we are dealing with in our post-covet times this year's legislative budget process really included very similar kinds of challenges to those that you have identified you know as many people are perhaps not aware the city's budget is a relatively small number compared to congress but at the same time it's a very vital part of our basic emergency services as well as infrastructure requirements uh the city's 2.91 billion dollar budget is roughly uh one slightly less than half of the state 7.425 billion dollar budget but the key area for us is really in in terms of capital improvements and here's where you know the congressional infrastructure legislation is of really uh tremendous importance to the city and county of honolulu the largest portions of the county's budget really go towards sanitation streets and highways transit as well as public safety so we are watching very closely and working hard to support congressman case and our congressional delegations efforts you know in more recent times as we talk about climate change the other big area for the city and county of honolulu is not only the traditional forms of infrastructure but also dealing with sea water sea level rise as well as extreme weather as a result of climate change so a big portion of the next several years of the new administration are going to be focusing on how to improve on flood prevention efforts because many of the cities storm water as well as drainage resources have been extremely limited over the last several years and i think for those who recently went through some of the haleiwa and windward flooding experiences earlier this year i think even the administration was shocked to discover that they had only one major flood and storm water drainage uh crew that they could deploy to a lot of the affected areas now as far as district six is concerned you know urban honolulu and many of the uh key areas of our alawi watershed many of our priorities are also in the area of infrastructure and basic services so this is just a quick snapshot of some of the urgent needs in downtown chinatown where we're really working hard with prosecutor um as well as the city administration to improve community policing and safety as well as really restoring sanitation and public safety in our urban honolulu areas with respect to the alawi watershed region homelessness and parks roads and drainage have also been key problem areas that we're working hard to uh deal with you know as you can see from this quick snapshot uh more and more we're looking for ways that we can partner with nonprofits in the community to work together with our state and county homeless provider agencies as well as department of health department of human services in tackling the core root of homelessness as well as providing services for those chronic homeless individuals with mental health and substance abuse issues now the thing that has me extremely excited and this is kind of where ed and i have talked a lot about the opportunities for hawaii to perhaps develop some models that may be important you know both nationally as well as globally is really beefing up in the area of green jobs and one quick example to show how you know new monies can come with coordinated city state and federal efforts is something that happened this year through the state of hawaii's adoption of act 181 which creates several temporary positions and training opportunities in department of land and natural resources at the federal level congressman case has been ardent champion for natural resource restoration and preservation so that hawaii recreational trails program set of funds is a new allocation in the city and county of honolulu we're also looking at ways that the city's allocation of some of its federal funds for sustainable agricultural products can also team up with a lot of what we would like to see in the area of green jobs creation you know this is an area that can actually help us quite a bit also in terms of city workforce requirements since one third of the city's workforce is close to retirement age or is actually has also been retiring so if you think about the opportunities for retooling a lot of the city and county of honolulu's jobs uh you know stream maintenance may ultimately become more of a public-private partnership if we look for ways to partner with community organizations and others that have been doing really uh very innovative things especially in the windward uh honolulu area with some of the fish ponds and other restoration efforts that are going on so you know the um the teamwork that hawaii's congressional delegation has long been well known for is something that we really want to uh parlay into greater opportunities for city and state partners to develop new opportunities as well so one thing that we have also discovered in the um the last 15 or 16 months that people have been cooped up at home and trying to stay safe is that parks and green spaces have become ever more critical in terms of the need for places to uh gather exercise or kind of have a respite you know from a crowded urban setting and so this is something that we're noticing more and more in the urban core where the need for and the demand for additional park amenities has become increasingly loud this recent survey that was undertaken by boston university where they surveyed mayors from a number of cities throughout the country found that there's an increased incidence of use of parks and green space areas as well as things that are also very important for public health and safety which would include biking hiking walking and you know looking for more ways to spend time outdoors so one of my pet projects and something that we have talked about with congressman case often is for areas like templars round top forest reserve this is an area where we believe that federal state and county partnerships will actually help us uh make considerable improvements if we partner with community organizations and private sector uh partners you know the um city and state did come up with a corridor management plan in december 2019 and up till now a lot of the investments that we have been trying to make have been relatively small scale because the costs are quite enormous but if you think about the opportunities and the benefits that we could develop if we were to work together this is really one example of a jewel that really um is just as important as downtown chinatown which is one of mayor blanchiardi's top priorities let's see the next slide shows you some of the other areas where you know we have been looking to expand upon community partnerships to address safety issues relating to vegetation and last thing i wanted to point out was the city council strongly agreed with congressman case's recommendations during one of our discussions earlier this year and as you can see the state of hawaii is kind of in the lower third of uh states in terms of the kinds of competitive federal grants that we have been able to obtain in the past so part of our mission is to expand upon the number of federal grants that we're able to compete for successfully and we've utilized our budget process this year to develop a grants writing team in the mayor's office of economic revitalization and we hope that this type of effort will actually begin to pay big dividends so that we can expand upon not only the number of federal and state partnerships that we can pursue but also bring about many improvements in urban honolulu and more so with that we are eager to see what kinds of questions those of you who may be participating have for us thank you thank you so much uh council member for that uh that very um um full um explanation um um i had to i had to laugh you've been you've been doing uh slideshows and powerpoints uh long before anybody else and so you're still doing them so that's that's great um i took a couple of things away from your your comments there that i think it's important for me to kind of emphasize to our our joint constituents i mean the main thing of course is that when we form partnerships across governments we do far better than if we go out there and kind of try to be the lone ranger um you know every single issue uh that each and all of us uh you know faces virtually has some component of federal state and local in it um and um you know you can you know take take uh tampa's round top that council member fukunaga i discussed and that that that i have or have been working with her on um countless rounds is a a a state a state forest reserve uh the the the city obviously has interests in in tana's roundup and the federal government has um an interest in ensuring that state and county facilities are are in good shape and the federal government has been a willing partner in that in that area for centuries now and so if we can all uh kind of you know bring what we have to the table uh in terms of tennis round top again to use that example then we can do far far better um and so you know one thing i one thing i do is routinely stay in touch with my colleagues at satan county government and the and the private sector uh to always ask you know what's on your mind what are the things that that you think you need i especially do this at the beginning of every appropriations season which starts a long time before the actual bills are developed so for example um this year it actually started um in somewhere around october november of last year we hadn't even passed last year's bills yet we were working on this year's already out there to ask everybody well what do you think you need and to and to carol's point about beautifying uh honduras having a green city uh one idea that came up was that uh we have such um you know a beautiful uh canopy throughout hanoi which is itself endangered in many um areas and i think we can all imagine without our beautiful trees that we tend to take grant take for granted you know from day to day until one of them either falls down or somebody or somebody cuts one down um and so you know one of the areas of federal funding that i was able to pursue was was simply some assistance to the to the um to the city to inventory all of those trees uh so that we actually know where they are and how to how to care for them perhaps a small project small idea in the in the in the in the big picture but nonetheless um tells you a little bit of a story about how we we do uh try to work together so that was kind of one theme that i that i took away from your presentation appreciate you making that point um you know the other area to emphasize is um what you what you covered last which was um the city and county of more formally putting together an office uh that is focused on maximizing uh federal assistance um you would think maybe that on one level federal assistance was relatively automatic the state and county governments throughout the country and that's exactly wrong um in fact it's an art it's a science um and um you can have the best congressional delegation and frankly i think that hawaii has benefited from a very good congressional delegation that punches well well above our weight uh in terms of of helping hawaii uh we all pretty much know how to how to work through the system and and um you know uh with with with very good committee placements uh senator schatz is also on the senate appropriations uh uh senator yurono and congressman kelly very good very good uh committees and and positioned well to help hawaii but still uh there are many many areas where even the best congressional delegation is not going to maximize the federal assistance um grants that come down to satan county government pretty much fall into two categories i'm being quite simplistic here uh one category are what we refer to as kind of the formula grants they flow pretty automatically they're going to come based on things like how many people do you actually have in the city or how many how many miles of roads do you have or you know grants that for example uh i try to assist uh disadvantaged parts of our community well how much of your community does fit that disadvantage and and there's a pot of money and it's kind of split up on a quite formula basis um even that needs a lot of help but then there are a whole range of grants and federal assistance out there that are competitive and and and you've got to go out there and you have to find the opportunities you have to know how to package the opportunities and you have to know how to present them and follow through and those states and counties that do that on a very systematic basis do very very well and here in hawaii we have folks that do very very well as well the satan county have done pretty well um over the years the university of hawaii is is really the leader here they they do it very very well they have a dedicated office and they um they they do very well in terms of locating uh federal support and and getting it uh we work very closely with them but um i did urge the city council and the mayor uh some months ago to go the next step and actually have an office and maybe sometimes people say well why do we need you know another office or another one or two people on the payroll well well consider that your office costs you you know two hundred thousand dollars a year uh for uh the number of people that are necessary to have a good solid office um if if that 200 000 a year gets you millions and millions and millions of dollars in federal assistance i would say that's money very well spent and so i think that the city council and the mayor made the right call on that and i'm looking forward to working with them because again it's a partnership okay uh council member um i think did you want to cover um any particular issues did you want to go back to roundtop tentless or you got a couple of other areas that i think you wanted to kind of compare notes on yes you know we uh really appreciated your office's assistance when we first started dealing with covet last year i think one of the first training sessions that the small business administration in hawaii had launched was with a group of uh ethnic organizations chinese vietnamese lao ocean and i guess vietnamese and i'm sorry cambodian groups that met with and really worked very hard you know to submit as many of their idol and sba loan applications as they could and i think it was partly through your efforts as well as many of the banks in hawaii in stepping up to the plate so hawaii was probably among the states that did far better in obtaining assistance you know when we first tried to assist small businesses however in recent months you know as we've been going through um the different level one level two level three in reopening many of the businesses that um didn't quite qualify on the small business level you know those that were shuttered venues those that were bars and other kinds of organizations have had a much more difficult time you know trying to come up with ways to survive so one question uh that a chinatown business owner had um sent us was you know what is the best way for them to kind of work either directly with the congressional delegation or you know with our office of economic revitalization we're finding that you know oftentimes at the city level uh we're no match for what the banks were able to do in a very short time and maybe your office you know has a better sense of the the kinds of institutions and organizations that can help small businesses and even some of the theater and non-profit groups in qualifying for and really being able to survive this period yeah i i appreciate that question of course you know covet 19 incredible um devastation uh throughout hawaii one of the worst economic results from kovid19 and our entire country uh primarily because of of tourism uh crashing to virtually nothing so when your number one industry goes to nothing that's going to hurt and it certainly had that impact throughout hawaii um the federal government uh going back to march of 2020 at the very beginning of kovit when we passed the first large emergency assistance package um two billion dollars i'm sorry two trillion dollars uh in the cares act uh set up programs to benefit small businesses in particular because we knew um that while perhaps uh many many of our big businesses could could survive for some period of time uh small businesses in particular were operating on a very very short time frame cash flow time frame and if their business dried up they were going to fail and that was first of all going to be very bad for the business and for over all economy but we also didn't want um to to to have a massive massive unemployment crisis uh where uh these businesses could not retain their employees which would throw it into the unemployment system um and so we passed the very first program which was the paycheck protection program uh which was um a a loan program uh small businesses um those loans were forgivable meaning they they could be cancelled under certain circumstances and condition was that that they retain employees that that money go to keep employees on the payroll the main the main reason wasn't exclusive um and that frankly carried uh many many tens of thousands of our small businesses through a very difficult uh time we re-upped that program a couple of times um and although technically it's uh still out there um many many businesses have been able to navigate through because of it however uh we um very unfortunately in my in my view um did not cover uh very specific parts of our small business community that needed extra help they were eligible for the ppp and other small business uh assistance from the federal government but that wasn't sufficient and we're talking here about our restaurants for example or particularly hard hit um our shuttered venues um so so our theaters our museums were sometimes not eligible um many of our bars were not eligible uh because of technicalities in the law that were very frustrating so we came back with very specific programs the restaurant revitalization fund was one of those programs uh we also had the shuttered venue operators on grants program which was very specific to businesses including probably the ones that you're referring to in chinatown which would which would fit this bill and we had um quite a few businesses in hawaii they were able to access the restaurant revitalization fund and the shuttered venue operator grant program at the federal level however that the demand in our particular economy was so great that those programs ran out of money quite quickly and they have not yet been renewed although i and many other members of congress are trying to refund them trying to renew them um and i think that's the right thing to do uh people are still in quite desperate uh away on on many of them and frankly some people just um weren't fast enough to apply and those that kind of were better prepared to apply right away um did get assistance but those that were not perhaps as as able to access the information or or the expertise sometimes to to a pile and we tried to make it easy did not get there in time so that's that's not okay with me and so we are trying to provide additional assistance and i'm hopeful in the next couple of months we'll be able to do some of that in the meantime what we did was we we tried to cover for some of this because at the federal level we can't anticipate everything that's going to happen in every state every county out there so we tried to give the state and county governments uh money uh for their own discretionary purposes uh we we gave um billions actually uh that came to hawaii state and county government um the city council and and and the uh city and county of honolulu as well as the other counties i think did the right thing and you provided your own assistance uh to to to businesses um so the the the assistance was massive it was used it was necessary uh it was uh sometimes not enough and there's still people out there even though our economy you know is recovering we're we're down to um you know a much lower unemployment rate than even three months ago um many more businesses are open still there are many that are that are hurting out there um so to the question carol um the first you know anybody can contact my office with questions on this first of all we pretty much know what the answers are at this point so um case.house.gov is is my answer and i'm sure um i'm sure you would you would say the same and if you need to refer people to us um that's fine with me okay great well additionally um i i did want to let people know that the city council has a hearing this afternoon between two committees you know that we'll be talking about the city's allocation of federal arp funds and how we would like to really deploy them as uh solidly as possible to assist both businesses as well as individuals so for anyone who is uh watching us on facebook live uh stay tuned this afternoon at one o'clock we do have uh the next round of discussions and we are working hard to keep up with the congressional and uh treasury deadlines because we do know that the city has to submit a plan uh as of next week and so we intend to uh you know thoroughly discuss a lot of the priorities that both congressman case and i have talked about because uh to me in a lot of ways it is hard to talk about you know recovery without also making sure that small businesses are part of that mix you know it's it's it's been a really uh tough 2020 and 2021 for a lot of different organizations and businesses so we hope that both the increased vaccinations as well as what we hope will be more testing capabilities will give us the um the wherewithal to really knock out covet in hawaii as quickly as we can we do have one set of questions that my staff has passed on to me uh from one of our constituents who uh raised a question about uh planning funds that were included in the city's budget for this year and the constituent's request is to divert funds away from planning for the proposed alawi canal bridge and favoring less expensive infrastructure projects like the mccully street bridge expansion i i would want to also point out that the the planning funds that are in this year's cip budget also paved the way for completion of the environmental assessment for that alawi canal project and given the size of that particular project i would think that uh the environmental assessment is also going to have to coincide with whatever work the city and the army corps of engineers embark upon as they pursue the next iteration of an alawi flood mitigation plan so i think all of those are going to have to work in tandem so the alawi canal bridge project may not survive in its current form given the need to also plan for uh what we hope will be a cost-effective as well as a sustainable flood mitigation you know plan for both uh alawi canal as well as the alawi watershed and protecting and safeguarding many of the properties in waikiki so uh hopefully the the timing of the recent army corps of engineers and city mou is going to help us address that question but i have another question that sort of ties in with flooding and this question was does the city have a stream maintenance schedule and this topic is something that came up very uh surprisingly during the aftermath of this year's flooding when we began to realize that the city had been operating on somewhat of a shoestring for a lot of its stream maintenance activities over the last several years and as department of facility maintenance director babcock explained it for about the last 10 years the city and state were working on fulfilling the requirements for obtaining army corps of engineer permits for ongoing stream maintenance work and so in the last 10 years both the city and state really have not done the level of stream maintenance that is needed to really safeguard many of the coastal areas as well as streams that have become fairly substantially overgrown so much of the extreme weather conditions that we experienced in aina haina east honolulu as well as on the north shore this past year also point up the need for the city to develop a much more robust stream maintenance program so council member suni yoshi had uh spearheaded bill 77 earlier this year and uh when we adopted the bill we did provide for a requirement that the department of facility maintenance include its stream maintenance schedule on its website and so my staff is putting into the chat uh the location of this link and as we kind of go forward we expect to work much more closely with the administration in providing additional resources as well as uh positions to be able to develop a much more robust program because you know that that sort of 10-year interim period during which the city and state were not doing as meaningful maintenance job as we could have been doing has made us very vulnerable to some of these recent flooding events let's see well i guess and council member let me just comment on that um that that general subject because i think again that that makes a point that i that i think we've both been trying to make and that is as we work together as partners it's just much better flooding is a real risk of course to the city and economy honolulu as well as to the rest of the state we have seen that we are seeing extreme weather um it is not some um you know um accident that this is all happening we in fact are seeing climate change uh and um that's the reality that is the reality science tells us that and we can choose to deny it or we can choose to acknowledge it and and um acknowledge the changes that it requires um of all of us uh one area is certainly in flood uh control and anticipation of flood control i i you know it's it's it's it's it's just ridiculous to to clean up after a flood that you that you that you may have uh been a contributory factor to if you didn't keep your streams up clean or or your uh watershed uh uh drainage systems up to date um you you mentioned for you had slideshows of that flooding uh when we started out including uh many parts of my district to include the wailupi of course which was uh severely damaged a couple of years ago and uh that stream um could have been maintained better uh we have been working since then um in partnership with actually all of this of the federal uh state and county government uh towards uh the flood control improvements that uh that that would that would mitigate risk for further flooding in east in east honolulu um the fed the us army corps of engineers as the that's a federal agency has the regulatory authority and and is the one that actually carries out the projects uh themselves uh the state uh often uh organizes in funds and of course the county has to approve as well and main and maintain and so you've gotta kind of all everybody's got to kind of be in sync now the biggest one of course that we still have which is a very very unfinished business uh is the alawi watershed where we have significant flooding risks it's already happened uh we do not have really a 21st century um uh system to mitigate floods and of course um not only is that a matter of all of the residential and commercial properties of olive but all of waikiki is very susceptible many community concerns were articulated in the initial u.s army corps of engineers study i think everybody listened to those concerns certainly at the federal level in the delegation we urge the army corps to step back and take another look at it and they listened and that's what is going on right now the agreement that council member fukunaga referred to as is an agreement uh in which the army corps is taking and that's next steps towards developing an alternative plan that would involve extensive uh community um input and so that is ongoing and finally i would uh mention um going back to infrastructure that so many of what we're talking about here um these are huge projects they're very very expensive uh the the loi flood control project was initially priced at 300 million dollars uh then the us army corps of engineer came back and said well if we if we address all of all of the all of the concerns and and and modify the entire plan we're up to 500 you know million plus um that's a huge amount of money uh and and and so these are these are large projects um and oftentimes the city alone or the state alone um uh very difficult to pull them off and so this federal help uh in the uh infrastructure bill that we're working on now is is really critical uh and and that and that bill which is uh i hope to get from the senate um as as recently as uh as as soon as next week um 1.25 trillion dollars uh so a substantial amount of that would end up in hawaii we've tried to leave that pretty loose in terms of how the state and counties want to allocate it and so i'm very hopeful that the bill will pass them that state and counties will make the right decisions and if they're not then i'll i'll be behind closed doors i guess trying to trying to suggest as much because certainly i have my own views on where it should be where it should be used uh going back to one other uh subject while we're at it with the us army corps um one of the um i've been able this year for the first time in over a decade to designate federal money uh funding to specific projects uh throughout my my district um community project funding very closely controlled uh there these these uh designations have been abused before um uh we've put uh pretty good guard rails around them this time they're fully disclosed on my on my website case.house.gov uh together with all of the support i have from the state and county governments uh to ask for them i mentioned one of them which is the tree inventory another one is uh a to start down the road on a major improvement to honolulu harbor by the u.s army right um and then um to you to your green um to your green uh hawaii approach there council member two other projects to note one is to one is to improve the the recreational trails on oahu where so many of us um you know want to go out and you know get away from the city a little bit and and and enjoy nature i mean the other one um is um the leeward bike trail at western council member elefantes district where we were able to fund a substantial federal match uh to that program so back to infrastructure and state and county government funding well one question i i just received is what kinds of green jobs are we talking about and how can residents begin to get involved in a job search or employment opportunity in that sector and so i'm going to ask my staff to put in the chat you know the act 181 reference which talked about positions in dlnr in areas like natural resource management agriculture conservation renewable energy and other sustainability professions that plus the uh what is it resolution that the city council adopted because i think the thing that is most uh interesting to me and uh really kind of a real bellwether for where we may be headed in the future is if we take good care of a lot of our resources our you know our natural resources this also helps to protect our watershed and it also helps us in ensuring that climate change impacts will be lessened so you know this whole notion of green jobs is something that the youth have been advocating for and uh it was kind of um very exciting to see that the uh bill that came out of the state legislature was in fact uh proposed by one of the younger members of the state house and a number of members of the uh what is the democrat caucus you know the uh the younger generation have also lined up behind uh the idea of the youth commission which was adopted by the uh voters of the city and county of honolulu during the last election and so the council members and near blanchardi are now in the process of selecting members for that youth commission and we anticipate that as we start looking at ways that we can modify our workforces and we you know focus on building sustainable types of uh industries and jobs things like stream maintenance or trash collection or other kinds of uh jobs that in the past have been treated pretty much as very uh low-level entry-level jobs are now going to be looked at as more conservation and resource management types of jobs where we we're really looking to build partnerships with community organizations and others because as we as we look across the community you know i think part of what is was most sobering for director of parks and recreation thielen when she first came on board was to discover how many parks there were and how difficult it is for the city to be able to maintain and upkeep all of them and so you know in the same way that we have uh promoted adopt a stream or adopt you know um a park types of projects you know where people come in and help clean up help beautify parks on an ongoing basis we said we should really be looking at ways that we can develop longer-term partnerships where we're really looking to encourage stewardship in a way that department of land and natural resources you know has um been focusing on in the past but you know has never really had enough money to do it from a state perspective and so now as we start looking at green jobs we're looking at ways that we can take that that whole range of different kinds of positions in state government county government and other areas and turn them into stewardship types of positions and i think that's where the federal government and our congressional delegation are going to be tremendous partners we have on the federal level been very involved in along with the state and county governments and the private sector for a long long time in various workforce development um programs and efforts to support people that that essentially need to either you know train up for really new jobs or switch jobs uh where they are in dislocated industries meaning industries that that were severely impacted from a from an employment perspective where you really needed to acquire a different set of job skills in order to stay in an industry or advance an industry or for that matter i switch over to another industry and i and i as we have as we have seen in spades in cogot 19 those programs are are critical for folks that were that were uh severely impacted uh by colgate 19 uh and their jobs may not exist uh as as they existed before proven 19 and and um i guess i guess some people out there think that while that's their tough luck they can go do it themselves that's not the way i look at it nor for the matter uh over decades uh in general as our federal government felt that we have felt that um we should collectively uh try to help ourselves collectively uh to to to develop the workforce to retrain it to to retain a a skilled and capable workforce for our own uh family purposes but also to maintain a strong economy and so this is this is also one of those areas that i that i focused on in terms of my directive funding my community project funding uh where we uh got about a million dollars very specifically uh to the state of hawaii to some specific workforce development council uh uh programs and um of course there's a lot more money that comes down uh on a general basis but that money helps with their with very very um specific needs for workforce development we can help folks um in this area to find appropriate uh positions uh but as as councilmember fukunaga is pointing pointing out it's it of course there is the element of retraining uh folks um but we've also got to foster new industries new economies new new um areas that they can be employed in so part of it is creating the right conditions for a green economy but the other part of it is making sure that we have uh employees to staff it right well that's especially um encouraging when we look at ways that uh the tech industry in hawaii has actually been um uh doing quite well during during these last 15 months and one area that i'm kind of excited about is ways that uh companies like oceanette have been working closely with state department of transportation and finding new solutions for ongoing transportation problems for example in one of their projects in nanakuli they were trying to address speeding on a stretch of highway in nanakuli that had often seen a lot of traffic fatalities and as they worked with department of transportation what oceanette i guess technology crews did with the students from waianae and nanakuli was they installed what they call artificial intelligence sensors to accompany the race crosswalks that department of transportation installed to measure both uh the number of vehicles traveling over those uh crosswalks as well as their speeds and what they're beginning to find is that it is a very valuable problem-solving exercise to involve the youth from an area as well as technology government agencies and solutions that you know people may not have thought about as ways to really uh reduce traffic fatalities and accidents so i'm hopeful that uh you know some of the new projects that have been proposed by state government or some of our federal partners for example there's one called the red light pilot project that is scheduled to be underway fairly soon in urban honolulu where people who run red lights will receive citations you know as a result of technology installed uh traffic cameras that will be monitoring a lot of this activity so in some respects you know maybe the use of technology can help us divert human labor into areas where we can come up with many more opportunities for conservation and stewardship in ways that we haven't been able to utilize before okay um let's see i'm i'm looking at a question here um from the hawaii youth chorus and i just read it um we have we have a sustained significant income laws for what now appears to be months and and um they don't say this but um how can you help um please call my office um i think we can uh first of all take a look at whether you would be eligible for any of the specific programs uh that i mentioned earlier and we are we are happy to try to line you up but you should also again look at the state and the county government level who are administering their own programs from federal funds uh uh to help um dislocated uh businesses and and other um organizations such as yourself so case.house.gov um let's see i've got one here um um to both of us which is um the summary kind of expressing uh great uh concern and even despair at uh high housing costs uh rental costs and homelessness um this is a critical problem for all of us um the high housing costs in hawaii are ridiculous at this point i think we can all agree to that um uh certainly um that has led to great in the dislocation the rental market when we've because high housing costs rents tend to follow up the cost of housing uh and as a result more and more people uh cannot stay in in housing and it's a it's a huge problem has been for a long time is worsening throughout our country but especially in in our in our in our state and in the city and county of honduras um so i could comment on a lot of different levels from a federal level on this i would say a couple of things uh and then turn it over to carol um first of all of course our federal government is deeply involved in trying to provide for affordable housing through a variety of mechanisms we we try to incentivize the development of affordable housing by giving developers a financial incentive to develop affordable housing rather than market housing uh through tax credits uh there aren't that many of those developers in hawaii because frankly they can make a lot more money uh developing um market housing but there are some uh that that have made a specialty of it and we try to help them out at the federal government we also try of course to to help folks in finding a place to live through the section 8 housing voucher program which is a long-standing program under which the the federal government tries to contribute uh to the difference between um the rent and what somebody can afford to pay um that program has kept a lot of people with a roof over their heads but it's got its own issues um um in in many ways it it it works very very well uh in a in a um a market that that where housing and rent is not very high to start with but when you start to get into some very very high high housing and rent markets like honolulu or san francisco would be another example it just doesn't work as well and so it's a constant struggle to try to fix that program and and and have it adjust to to um um to honduran and to hawaii and then of course the third area is that through many many federal programs so we do in fact provide funding to state and county government and to our non-profits who are engaged in trying to help those that are without housing many many of whom have mental health concerns and needs um and would and find it difficult uh to to live in you know with a roof over their head even if one is available uh for for various reasons i've been on i've been out on the annual uh homeless account that is conducted once a year by our federal government and and been into the communities and and talked directly with folks and in other ways um and very very hard to reach our veterans have a homeless issue many of our communities and so these federal government programs always need to be strengthened we were able to plus them up during covet 19 with emergency assistance because we did see a spike in homelessness um but they they need to be constantly supported i will say uh maybe i'll put you on the spot slightly uh council member but um many many of the of the um options uh to address high housing costs and homelessness lie with state and county government because you have control over how land is used in hawaii you have control over how many market units developer can actually develop as opposed to requiring affordable housing units you have control i'm over rezoning of land uh that enhances the price of land so high if if it's unconditional so um this is again another area where uh every part of government has to kind of uh you know contribute in order to in order to uh try to get to a good result but i'll i'll turn that over to you to see what you're up to this is on everybody's minds right well i think for the city you know very clearly the um the focus on homeless services and housing is uh one of the biggest areas because the traditional model in the past you know shelters and facilities that housed a number of people in fairly close quarters became uh you know unworkable and so part of where we are looking forward to the new initiatives that are being rolled out by the city administration include recommendations that office of housing director kraki has made where they are also looking at some relatively short term but almost like i guess you would call them kahale or village-like clusters in different regions and neighborhoods as as ways of at least getting people into something that is safe and sanitary so that they have a roof over their heads you know there's a number of models that we have seen in recent years in waianae as well as on the windward side where different kinds of either pallet shelters or structures that have been contributed through the non-profit construction and housing industry have demonstrated you know the feasibility of smaller scale housing villages for groups that were in i guess locations where they could actually make a go of it now um i know there's been one recent example of a korean church that had tried to house a number of homeless individuals that were willing to work on their farm and you know receive housing and support as part payment for that the i guess the structures that were originally uh being utilized by that church were not in compliance with um city zoning requirements but in view of the um the i guess the contribution that the church was making to the broader community department of planning and permitting has agreed to work closely with the church to find suitable ways of addressing some of the zoning requirements in a way that also will give the individuals access to housing the one area that i think is sort of a bright spot at this point for us as we're looking at ways of providing additional crisis or detox beds for homeless individuals who have chronic conditions either with mental health or substance abuse is the recent opening of the new wing at the hawaii state hospital you know as part of our partnership between governor's coordinator on housing marshige and office of housing director kraki a lot of what is very really inspiring at this point is that they're accelerating ways to bring other departments into the discussion and looking for ways to expand the number of detox and crisis beds that are available so some maybe uh you know among those that are being provided at on the new wing of the hawaii state hospital but we're also waiting to see how many additional beds are going to be opening up at lyahi and other locations throughout honolulu so i think it's it's sort of this notion of you know many hands make light work where in the past there may have been more of a focus towards a centralized type of housing solution or services solution now there seems to be an acknowledgement that we really need a lot of regional clusters to be able to uh distribute both populations as well as make it easier for people to find creative partnerships one area that we're kind of excited about is the willingness on the part of city administration to partner with social services and non-profits within specific communities who may be also able to work with homeless services providers in ways that are going to be very beneficial in particular neighborhoods so say for example kokua kalihi valley has been a very strong partner in the kalihi valley and kalihi palama neighborhood they are among those that have been working very closely with other nonprofits that have specific tire say like we are oceania or other individual organizations that uh have a particular client base that they can work more quickly with in trying to assist them into housing and services so that's kind of another bright spot i think overall though we are just going to have to look at infrastructure rebuilding as part of our mantra and as we look at the areas where the state and county have a lot of land available in the neighborhood of existing tod districts or transit stops whether we have transit coming to those locations or not and you know the the question is how how quickly can we mobilize around affordable housing developments that we can build on state and county lands and so i think at least for the areas you know where train stations have already been completed many of those locations also are good locations for us in terms of affordable housing so whether kapolei waipahu uh also in the area that is close to pearl ridge there are a number of properties that we have been uh encouraging state and county agencies to move more quickly on you probably have been following the progress on the aloha stadium site where you know there's a lot of discussion about affordable housing in that uh location and with transit or other kinds of transportation alternatives that would seem to be another area where we could make a big dent in some of their our affordable housing needs okay um another area of necessary partnership um i've got a i've got a i've got a question here uh council member two weeks ago the department of health uh concluded that the navy had not been its burden of proof that it can safely operate red hill um water security is undeniably on the line and we cannot wait for our proposed secondary containment system or until 2045 what steps will you take to protect the primary source of drinking water and shut down red hill um very very difficult very controversial um issue um that i've tried to be very straight with everybody that i've talked with about and uh to anna who wrote me um if you will contact me at case.house.gov or ed.case mail.house.gov together with anybody else that um is interested in in kind of an update on on red hill um in general and on my and on my thoughts and my efforts uh on red hill uh we will send you a pretty long letter that i've been sending out to everybody uh that tries to sort it through i take it extremely seriously um as as you pointed out this is uh currently the subject of a contested case hearing over a permit uh by the navy to continue operating red hill which which is a critical uh part of our of our national defense infrastructure here in hawaii but which is is also a fuel storage facility uh sitting over our aquifer uh with um with attendant uh risks that is is going to be decided by the hearing officer in in presumably a few months and so we will know a lot more once a hearing officer sorts through everybody's arguments uh what you pointed out was an argument by the department of health which i take very seriously but the navy has a different view of that and so i i personally would like that hearing officer to reach that conclusion off on that permit uh from my perspective i've devoted a lot of time and attention in the appropriations committee to red hill uh hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent um in monitoring in recent years in monitoring and upgrading both the tanks themselves and the infrastructure around the tanks um you you referred to secondary containment which is uh the possibility that we could develop a technology that would essentially add another um tank layer so that any leak from the first tank would be captured before it got through the second tank and frankly um i think we should pursue that because uh all those although some people perhaps yourself uh don't don't believe that that's a feasible alternative i don't wanna i don't wanna roll it out yet uh i want to see if it can work uh eventually if it cannot work the navy has already said they're going to close those tanks down in time and i think if it can't work and safety concerns cannot be uh satisfied uh to to you know uh scientific uh uh high standards uh then that it should close down uh but um um for myself uh pending that uh that um my commitment is to is to accelerate that process and to see what the hearing officer has to say um that's of course in both of our districts uh council members so it's of concern to everybody well certainly for uh the city county of you know the honolulu board of water supply has taken a very um uh proactive role in many of the discussions you know the city is part part of the contested case hearing and the council has uh endorsed the board of water supplies position throughout the last three or four years since the earlier spill in 2014 so we would support you know whatever steps we can take to either find alternative locations for above ground solutions as well as a secondary containment but i think it is something that the city the state and our federal uh delegation and agencies are going to have to partner on we do know that in some states you know there have been uh successful efforts to relocate underground tank storage into above ground tank storage and that has you know attracted a lot of attention here in honolulu so uh i think at this point the state department of health is uh looking to conclude its um evaluation fairly soon and i think once that happens then you know we we owe it to um our community to all move forward together okay all right i got one or two more questions do you have any on your side uh we have a question about let's see homelessness i i think we've covered some of that um one of the other questions that we had was whether or not we have done enough to um take precautions to prevent further covet infections i i think today's afternoon hearings are going to have a lot more detail you know on that topic so i'm going to encourage some of the viewers to stay tuned for our one o'clock uh committee meetings and hopefully we will uh cover some of that during this afternoon's hearings let's see well you have a question that would be great uh well that well first of all i i i think the answer to your question is is is no uh we're not doing enough uh as as reflected by another triple digit day today in fact in the 200 range 240 something today um after months and months and months of being down under 100 and uh what we know about uh uh covid is uh and the infection that are going on now although we would like to perhaps uh blame it on the tourists and after all we're seeing substantially increased number of tourists uh coming here um the reality is that from all indications uh the the most of the infection rate is us uh uh people that uh 98 of the coveted infections are unvaccinated people um and 99.5 percent of the deaths of cocaine throughout our country are from people that were not vaccinated um parts of our uh state are doing very very well in terms of vaccinations uh but uh parts are in the 30 percent still 30 to 35 large parts of our of our state and um with the delta variants that are that are hundreds of times more infectious than the initial uh coca-19 and which um also uh can infect you in just a matter of seconds uh versus uh the original over 19 that you know you recall the initial advice you had to be around somebody for 15 minutes to really run a substantial risk of being infected those rules are out the window and so that's why i'm kind of back to the the the urging um to to to re to to to comply with um safety guidelines and to wear masks for example congress um as i mentioned earlier just just yesterday went back to a masked mandate um you have to wear a mask if you're in inside an office and around other people um we have to wear a mask when we go to the floor floor of the us house we have those mandates still in hawaii i think we did the right things by keeping many of those controls in place when the rest of the country said well it's all power ready and the rest of the country was wrong um today one of the questions here was what do i think about president biden's um initiative to to to require federal workers um as a condition of work to either uh demonstrate that they've been vaccinated or to or to uh require them to to test negative for cloven i think it was inevitable that we needed to move in that direction we have already seen that that has happened in parts of our federal government for example the veterans administration uh we have seen that happen in some of our schools we have seen that happen in our health care facilities um and the fact of the matter is that perhaps at one time there was a there was a question about whether vaccinations were available or not but now they're completely available um and so um although i although people people can people have a choice as to whether to get vaccinated or not i don't believe they should have a choice to put other people at risk uh whether it be in the in in the in the workforce or otherwise and so um i support president biden's um initiative along these lines i don't think anybody likes to do this but i don't see a better alternative out there to to get kova 19 under control um and so those are my thoughts on that um well um councilmember fukunaga i have a question on a a subject that's near and dear to both of us and that is um helicopter over flights of our district and i actually just got off the phone two hours two three hours ago with a group from east honolulu who was very concerned especially at the military uh over flights uh the fact of the matter is that in central and that's as about as bad as it gets and it really was far more prevalent um from a military overflight perspective during coven 19s because we didn't have hundreds of tour helicopters over overhead at all hours of the day um and so we have we have uh i've been in a great amount of contact with um parts of our military where we have seen those uh helicopter over fights from not just the kind of the normal helicopters but uh the ospreys which are the tilt tilt wing uh planes that act like planes and helicopters and when those things go overhead like helicopters they just rumble the ground as as everybody knows and and so we have very consciously tried to tell our military hey if you're not good neighbors you're going to lose support in our communities so don't fly over um residential communities unless you absolutely have to and certainly when you run the ospreys around don't fly over especially them don't fly over at low altitudes it's been some improvement but it's a it's a constant uh vigilance and then as to the tour helicopters um you know the fact of the matter is they have overrun our state um here's my blunt assessment they really don't care uh about the disruption on the ground they just want to run their business uh they want to fly wherever whenever however they want and if the best way uh to get the the passenger a thrill and and get more passengers is to fly over residential neighborhoods they're going to do it and so the only way uh really from all indications are not going to voluntarily uh adjust their their business model to take care of hundreds of thousands millions on the ground who are impacted by their operations i am trying to change federal law to allow you at the state and county government level to have a far greater level of regulatory power uh to limit uh their disruption i'm not trying to wipe them out but i'm trying to get them to pay attention to the consequences on the ground uh we need everybody's help on that the city council has been very very helpful you have supported my efforts and others our neighborhood boards have done the same many residents have done the same we need you to continue to do that by where you can and are willing to do so when tour helicopters or any helicopter disturbs you there are noise complaint lines that you can go on and we encourage you to do that well thank you so much for that update because we recently received two more complaints so this is something that that uh pops up with regularity you know throughout the year so if community participants can activate uh you know the support levels that would be great okay well i think we've kind of winding down your council member [Music] we we've had a bunch of i think that's it for my questions um do you want to say a few things in in conclusion and and then i'll i'll wrap it okay happy to kind of identify some of the ways in which this is um kind of a demonstration of new technology that we're very interested in pursuing further in fact one of the things that i was mentioning to your staff is that the city council is finally on the brink of embarking on a pilot project where we would be using similar kinds of legislative workflow software to help us better serve our constituents and you know through this virtual town meeting type of format we're also looking at ways that we can more uh directly communicate with people in a way that's safe for them as well as promoting greater levels of accountability so thank you you've been a great demonstration for us and uh we look forward to be able to undertake a lot more partnership activities together councilmember how can people reach you if they need to oh at uh i'm sorry i forgot the uh it's wwe or my email address is ca fukunaga at honolulu.gov okay great well it's been such a great uh partnership with you and and yes we've gotten used to uh talk stories uh as we're doing it uh over the last year and a half unfortunately uh with kovitt coming back i was hoping that i could go back to uh you know in person uh talk stories which was what i most like to do um but um we'll probably have to put that off for a few months and hope that we get a little bit more uh stabilized uh but uh you know for me again um um trying to trying to help however i can hear in congress from from the national issues uh from the issues of how to help our hawaii and of course your individual issues and so uh certainly uh hope that as if and as you have questions about your government especially your federal government or needs that you will you will think of me um and think to contact us again my my website is uh case.house.gov and and my email address is ed.case mail.house.gov and council member i'm going to conclude because as you talked earlier about how you've been working on the new economy for a long time i remember that one of our mutual friends just sent me a picture of this of the two of us together with some other characters i think this was vintage uh 22 years ago or so i'm sorry it's not going to really show up very well but i'll give it a try anyway and uh on the left on the screen that is uh governor kiki in the middle yeah sylvia luke and leslie [Music] we were what is called uh the new economy legislators uh and we actually got an award for for our work in trying to develop a new economy especially in the information technology space and uh to some extent uh some of our efforts uh then are are still alive and so um we've been partners for a long long time all right thank you so much to our audience any follow-up questions you have our contact information uh thank you so much for spending a little bit of time with me and aloha teaching all of you aloha you

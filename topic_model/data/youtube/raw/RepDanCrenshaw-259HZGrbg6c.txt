so here's the truth on HR 3 this is a complicated one because it's about lowering drug prices seems like something we should all agree on and we do that's the end goal but it's complicated on how to get there so I am here with an expert representative Greg Walden and you're the ranking member on Energy and Commerce and you've been working on this for quite a while so I want to ask you a bunch of questions about our HR 3 so this bill it basically it instructs the the Secretary of Health and Human Services to they say negotiate but it's not really negotiation it's it's there they're basically setting a prices and then based on international price setting yeah within six countries internationally they say whatever you sell your drug for there then it has to be within a certain range of that and then the secretary negotiates who it's on its face sounds okay that sounds good right look right wrong with that these are these are countries in Europe and then okay fine well there's a lot of things wrong with that what's the main problem we keep we keep hearing if there's gonna be fewer cures because of this side is this cycle innovation well we knew no from the Congressional Budget Office that if half a billion to a trillion dollars is taken out of the system which some say could happen here there will be 8 to 15 fewer medicines developed there was another interesting study done in California which showed that of 25 fda-approved drugs over the last 10 years under these rules only 3 of them would have actually been approved that's kind of scary and but there's more to HR 3 than just the I think the misconception that is a no good negotiation it's really price setting and all the problems that that creates with your hairs but it's also it's sort of vindictive in a way it's something about the tax there's a there's a potential 95 percent tax if they will in fact refuses to negotiate yeah let's just start with the term negotiation yeah all right everybody loves the IRS this this makes the IRS look like a because negotiation is Dan here's what I'm going to pay you for the drug within this range what you sell it for some in some other country oh if you don't agree to what I tell you I'm gonna pay you for it within that range then I'm gonna tax your revenues starting in the first quarter your revenue sixty five percent you mean am i visiting profits no revenues the non profits and I was a business owner for 20 years there is a big difference between revenues and profit and so they say sixty five percent in the first word and by the third quarter of that year I'm at ninety five percent of your revenues so you know even said that what you have to do anything use a big question who does this really hurt you know is it hurting big pharma because this this you know it's pretty popular to hate on big pharma but is this really hurting them because what they're what they're doing nowadays is they're they're seeing innovation and in the in the the biotech industry small startups it's a really good system that's who it hurt I want those biotech those small startup scientists working in simple happens them some university or or some small company to go what we try this nobody's done that right my exactly that's where they find a cure for dr. Brian Druker to Oregon Health Sciences University developed a drug called Gleevec that deals with stomach cancer I've talked to him several times he's everybody said don't go down this path so I went down that path guess what he discovered this cure for certain type of stomach cancer I want to make sure there's competition I'm a private-sector person and I believe in it and and I think competition works and if you put the consumer first and drive the policy to make it what's best for the consumer then you should get innovation competition if you have competition that helps drive pricing right now the only force that's ever driven prices down I'm not sure of any price setting that has ever occurred in the history of the world which has created more supply and lower prices right and yeah where is the innovation coming in front of the world important high tech that's here drugs it's here it's what we want to do is clean up the system yeah so that new innovators can come around and so the competitors have a fair shape right now putting a competing drug out there there's way too much in a market created and things begin to dry but uh and so the question is do we do we change the entire format of the market do we take a sledgehammer to the drug market or do we take a scalpel to it you know so you in energy commerce there was a bill to fix the problem with insulin specifically right right so one out of five seniors and this is what we're dealing with here one out of five seniors are diabetic and so when it comes to insulin we wanted to take the savings that are already in the system or would be negotiated in the system and make sure when you go to the counter at your local pharmacy to get your insulin mm-hmm all that savings went to you Verizon your consumer we also think there ought to be an out-of-pocket cap yeah on seniors on Medicare Part D so you know so you've got that security you know the limits and we lowered the limit right there's a lot of these things you can do and none of that by the way put a spike in innovation like their bill would do so let's get prices down in the rockwool way that doesn't spike innovation and let's help consumers when they go to the counter and talk to their pharmacist to get the savings for themselves

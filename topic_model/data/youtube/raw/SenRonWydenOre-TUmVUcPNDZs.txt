Thank You mr. chairman mr. chairman in beginning I want to commend you for what I think folks need to understand is really what's at issue with your agenda today what you're essentially doing is giving us an opportunity to lay out the digital rules of the road and the fact is if you look over history it's always been this way with the economy when you have new technologies and new developments you got to update the rules of the road I mean you did it for the railroads mean all through time we've had to do it so I want to commend you for the agenda the way we're looking at these issues and I'm looking forward to working with you senator soon talked about one of our bipartisan bills and laid out the digital goods and services tax fairness act and with Senator Snowe here I thought what I do is take a couple of minutes to talk about our other major bipartisan bill the wireless tax fairness act and here's the reality folks here's my smartphone and what we're dealing with is we've got smartphones today and dumb tax policies tax policies that have not kept up with the times and so we all remember the days of them you know the mobile you know phone these big old things and essentially we've got the same tax policies for smart phones and smartphones of course or how millions of Americans access the internet there really a lifeline for some of the folks with a modest income the Urban Institute does a lot of wonderful work for and so what senator Snowe and I want to do is make sure that for the next five years these smartphones are not subject to what amounts to multiple and discriminatory taxes multiple and discriminatory taxes on wireless communications and if you look at the last few years and all the taxes that have been heaped on wireless technology we now have many states with taxes above twenty percent the national average over sixteen percent so what I'd like to do is first get on the record mr. Sammartino we had the CBO analyze the tax implications of our legislation and remember this is a bill what senator Snowe and I are advocating is something that would be prospective it's not something that looks back in time it's part of laying out the rules of the road the digital economy for the future and it's my understanding that CBO has said the most recent analysis of July 28 of 2011 that our legislation in the words of CBO is that it would have no significant cost to the federal government and then at page two of the analysis CBO did not identify any costs as well to state local or tribal governments so here's an opportunity as we move in the committee of jurisdiction for laying out these rules as it relates to the digital economy to take a major step forward in something that is literally a lifeline for millions of Americans and I want to kind of trace the history from those big mobile phones to these wonderful smartphones that are Jerry by millions to access the net and we can do it without any net cost to either the federal government or the state and local governmental authorities and I just like to get your a confirmation that that is the latest analysis by CBO that the bill that Senator Snowe and I are talking about will not generate new costs to either the federal government or the state and local authorities is that your understanding mr. Sauber Tina that's my understanding cetera okay then for you mr. henchman we've done a lot of work with you all that the Tax Foundation why don't you give me you know your thoughts and and we're certainly going to be talk about the marketplace you know Fairness Act and in the days ahead and having followed this since the days when I was a co-author with sunderson nudists and McCain the internet non-discrimination Act we've always tried to come to grips with how to handle a new emerging technology isn't the heart of it trying to help have policies that have the federal government first of all do no harm and to ensure that there are not multiple and discriminatory taxes that come about from these thousands of jurisdictions when I first listened to some of the issues surrounding the Marketplace Fairness Act I looked out at the scores of taxing jurisdictions more than 5,000 of them and some of the stuff just defied common sense you'd have jurisdictions that might I remember there was one that would treat a chocolate bar one way and a cookie another way right I mean aren't these some of the issues that we're going to have to deal with as we try in this committee to write these digital rules of the road correct and as I as I specified a it's important that simplification be kept in line because right now we're up to 9600 sales tax jurisdictions growing a couple hundred a year we added 400 last year so we're moving away from uniformity and away from simplification in terms of number of rates definitions and how complex it is and there's a lot of things Congress could lay out and as I mentioned some of the bills offer some very promising simplification options my time has expired mr. chairman but again i want to i want to thank you and i hope people understand what is really at issue here and that is you're updating what are essentially the rules for the modern economy the economy where the jobs are i really appreciate your leadership

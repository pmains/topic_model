hey good afternoon i'm representative scott franklin from central florida florida 15. uh well here we are again uh taking an exception to another gross overreach by the biden administration and thank you representative keller for your leadership on this vaccine mandate issue just to be clear i'm not opposed to the vaccine had saved countless lives and it's enabled us to turn the corner on covet 19. given my personal circumstances you know i weighed the risk and the benefit and i decided to get the shot but for others i also respect their right to consult with their doctors and do what's best for them i've met with dozens of businesses back home in my district in central florida and not a single one of them supports this biden mandate it puts them in an impossible situation with their employees at a time we need everyone back to work many told me that if it's not rescinded it could literally put them out of business i also have an example of one employer with 124 employees who's directly across the street from a competitor with 87 employees what do you think is going to happen when he has to lay off 20 percent of his of his workforce he's going to go right across the street and go to work for his employer it makes absolutely no sense i consider it a blessing every day that i hail from the free state of florida just last night the florida legislature passed hbo house bill 1 which blocks the biden administration's vaccine or test mandate it does so by offering a package of common sense exceptions like medical or religious exemptions existing immunity and others just a little while ago governor ron desantis wrapped up a press conference in brandon florida part of the district i'm proud to represent i could really sorry i couldn't have been there but i promise you the irony on the choice of locations wasn't lost on any of us who are sick and tired of the policies that continue to spew forth from the binding administration to my folks back home i just say let's go brandon

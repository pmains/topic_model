you're joined now in a fox business exclusive with Senator Tom Carper Democrat from Delaware he served 23 years in the military retired as Captain and he is joining us now with ideas of where to cut and this is a sensitive subject senator thank you so much for joining us this isn't as I would imagine you'd say it's not about patriotism it's about finding areas that can be cut and where would you look first well actually we need to look no further lives than the general Accountability Office every year they they do a rundown a lot of departments in our federal government cluding the Department of Defense and last year they told us that major weapon system cost overruns were about 400 billion dollars up from 40 billion dollars ten years earlier we're told by the inspector general's within the Department of Defense it is I think you may have mentioned before the break we're spending a not eight dollars for for spare parts for a helicopter but about 30 times out of mount for a door park on a helicopter spend about five times more than we should be at a time when we actually have those spare parts in supply a guy named Vince Lombardi break the football coach used to say if you're not keeping score you're just practicing another way to say that it what we don't measure we can't manage we don't do a very good job in the department of defense of actually running what we call auditable finances to actually have clean unqualified financial reports were supposed to for the last 20 years we passed a law we still haven't done that in Department of Defense but I tell you is going to change that and it's going to be Leon Panetta former Budget Committee Chairman former OMB director former chief of staff he is all over this stuff and that's what he is very very good thing he'll be a change he is but he is said senator that if we cut more we might hollow out the military which nobody wants to do obviously but let's just give an example Sikorsky which makes helicopters there were some charges that became very suspicious to the inspector general we can throw them up on the screen it was a hundred and eighty one dollar a plastic wiring box that we were charged I say we as the taxpayers 2393 dollars there was a rotor that should cost 1500 page seventy eight hundred dollars for and overall when you look at the eleven plus million over charcoal 51% overcharged that some people were looking at and saying this is too much now igor sikorsky back in the 1800s when he created the helicopter I mean obviously I'm sure during your three tours in Vietnam you flew in some of these but that's a little bit of too much for the American taxpayer is it not so how do we get our contractors just start charging fairly first of all we need inventory systems that are accurate so that we can go up paying $1,500 or seventy five hundred dollars for a door part for a helicopter if we have them in stock we don't have very good inventory systems we don't have a good accounting systems one of the things Leon Panetta has laid down the law we had a hearing about a year ago and whether or not the Department of Defense's make any progress toward having auditable financials you're a year ago people came and testified before us the controller and others said mmm I don't think we can get there by 2017 this is not to be audited with clean financials but this is to be audible said I don't think your I think we will get there Leon Panetta the empanada took over about two three months ago they had we had the same witnesses before us last one and they said we'll be there in fact will be taught 2017 deadline when you hear that some of the contractors are saying that if you cut that will and i love this was interesting to me that will have adversely affect mission success boy that strikes at the heart of a lot of Americans nobody wants to do that can we cut the required amount do you expect the super committee will do it before Thanksgiving without hurting mission success well let me use an analogy here we don't want to cut necessarily cut benefits and Medicare and Medicaid but there's a lot of fraud improper payments and Medicare a lot of in efficiencies and Medicare and Medicaid we have to go after those so that we don't have to cut benefits and hurt people similarly in the Department of Defense there is a lot of ways there's a lot of fun there's a lot of overpayments improper payments and we don't measure we don't have decent accounting systems don't have inventory systems that are reliable we have huge overruns and weapon systems and like four hundred billion dollars last year that's just up tenfold from where it was just just ten years ago these are areas where we can do better in to the extent we need to do about because we have to find ways to continue to ratchet down the deficit we don't want to hurt readiness we don't want to hurt our our men and women in uniform we don't want to hurt their families there's a way to do that there's a way to to go after the deficit without hurting our warfighters and without hurting their family and that is almost it take as a as a playbook the general Accountability Office is a major major faults that they find the aiji's there is a high risk list of Gao does every that convention be out to do list it should be the to-do list for the supercommittee need to get to what news of the day Senator Harry Reid of Nevada had proposed today the five percent extra tax on millionaires if this word come to fruition would you vote for it senator yeah I've never talked about you about taxes on billionaires and millionaires the idea of actually required of a deficit-reduction plan to have a surtax for at least a period of time on income over a million dollars that's something that I can support I've never been one to say we ought to tax millionaires and billionaires they some of them pay a lot of taxes as it is but part of an overall deficit reduction plan where most of the reductions on the spending side and we need some evidence debt that would work what would you would you say you'd vote for it if it were temporary or either way you would vote for this what I would like to see it as part of an overall deficit reduction plan what I actually supported bowles-simpson you know three dollars of deficit reduction on the spending side for every one dollar in revenue side we do we do entitlement reform the same time we do tax reform that actually generate some additional revenues three dollars of spending reductions $1 revenue Senator Tom Carper 23 years three tours in Vietnam Navy captain we salute you we thank you and we appreciate your perspective thank you so much Thank You Liz thank you very much

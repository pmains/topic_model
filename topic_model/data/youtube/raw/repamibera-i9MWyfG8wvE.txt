yeah I couldn't be prouder to be a Democrat today now if I were asked if I had a chance to march with john lewis in selma in 1965 i have to say i was only three weeks old at the time but i don't want that when i talk to my daughter tonight she said dad where were you when John Lewis we standing up for justice standing up for all those victim here I want to say I was doing the right thing fitting with them sitting with that art for food for justice although now you know I'm a doctor and it was a young doctor I used to work in the mercy room used to take care of patients in the intensive care unit and you go into medicine because you want to help you want to try to change things we want to try to relieve that separation but it doesn't always work and the worst thing was when you have to walk out there and talk to that mother talked to that bothered that's and I stood on the steps of the house today with our colleague Bobby Rush and he talked about that primordial scream of that parent that has lost a son or daughter that son or daughter that's lost their parents and you don't forget that strange and as a doctor you feel like you failed well we are hearing the stream of America the sons and daughters who lost 49 of their loved ones in orlando the thousands of others i wish i could tell them as a doctor I can turn the clock back and I can save their pain their their sons and daughters their loved ones and bring them back home we can't we fail and we can't keep failing yes because we're failing the American people we can't turn the clock back and bring those lives back but what we can do is make sure we save your next life make sure we learn from the tragedies that we based and we save that next son or daughter people expected us they expect us not to do the easy things they expect us to do the hard things the necessary thing they expect us not to sit around they expect us to save that next life and to certainly try that is why I am so proud to be here as a Democrat with all of you but let's this is not about Democrats and Republicans this is about doing what's right for the American people because that terrorists doesn't look at this as Democrats versus Republicans so mr. speaker let's do the right thing let's prevent that expat let's save that next life because that next crafting that next victim is someone's son or daughter some little wife someone's loved one let's not look back and say we didn't do anything let's act today let's get this done and let's prevent the next tragedy let's have a boat

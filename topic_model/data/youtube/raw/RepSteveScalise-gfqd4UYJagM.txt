thank you mr chairman and uh at first just i know it's been talked about a lot on what percentages should be or shouldn't be vaccinated i would not i'd push back on the suggestion that uh americans only get their liberties back if a certain percentage of members of congress get vaccinated i would like to use the science i'm talking about medical science now not political science on this let's start with schools dr welinski you've talked about this a few times but you were quoted as saying quote safe reopening of schools does not suggest that teachers need to be vaccinated in order to reopen safely and quote cdc since put out guidance that talks about the things that need to happen to reopen schools it's really focused on social distancing and wearing masks i don't even think you'll mention vaccinations you know and teachers should be prioritized in most states are prioritized for vaccinations but the cdc guidance doesn't mention it do you still stand by the statement that you made that say free opening of schools does not suggest that teachers need to be vaccinated in order to reopen can you acip recommends teacher and educator vaccination but you're the c2c director what's your recommendation do you stand by what you said the cdc guidance specifically let me ask specifically about what you you said that statement i just read do you still stand by that statement yes or no you do okay and dr fauci you've also made comments about the cdc guidance on schools you were asked about school reopenings and you said quote i would back the cdc recommendations because that is really based on data and you just heard the cdc director said that's safely reopening schools should really be uh conditioned upon the social distancing and on masks do you stand by that as well i can't hear if you can turn your microphone on please yes so you do stand by that so again vaccinations should be available to all teachers most states are doing it those that aren't should prioritize teachers but reopening schools should really be based on that science right the medical science that social distancing and mask protocols are what drives that is that correct yes and i would imagine you acknowledge as i've seen i've seen so much medical data that shows the damage you know we've talked about cova deaths and they're all tragic we've seen a lot of other deaths in america deaths tied to depression because people can't go about their lives that's a real factor we've seen so many young kids millions today that still can't go back in the classroom not because of medical science because of political science that is destroying these kids lives do you recognize that it is causing depression drug overdoses drug abuse from for kids tied to some of those decisions the psychological effects of keeping children out of school are well known it definitely is not something that is favorable for children it is much to their advantage to be in school well i appreciate that and i hope that that all of the school systems across america follow the medical science and stop this political science destruction of kids uh trying to hide behind science when in fact as the cdc director just said dr fauci just said schools absolutely should reopen the cdc guidance is very clear on what it takes to reopen and it's social distancing and masks follow that medical science now i want to get back to the pictures that i showed earlier about the donna detention facility and so now you've both had a chance to see them you both look let me just ask if it's a restaurant in any state if a restaurant is set at 250 person capacity and there's a thousand or four thousand four thousand people in a restaurant that set for 250 person capacity dr fauci would you consider that a major concern and probably wouldn't that restaurant be shut down it would be a major concern yes so you go to the donna detention facility today and i was just there friday morning six days ago in dona texas at that detention facility rated for 250 people border patrol told us there were over 4 000 people young kids in that facility that day six days ago not six feet apart as you can see in most cases six inches apart many without mass do you consider this a major concern yes so again and i would i would urge you because you have closer access to president biden than i do i would i really want president biden to go see this he ought to see this he won't see it vice president harris won't see it you've seen it you know what the science says the medical science could you please urge president biden he can fix this right now there are three major things he did the remaining mexico policy was working every border patrol agent tells you that president biden got rid of it it's caused this magnet of these young people being exploited abused exposed to coven they say at least 10 percent of covet these kids are coveted positive if you look at these conditions and ten percent of the people in this room are covet positive do you think ultimately more than ten percent will get coveted and then get on an airplane without a covet test as they're being done uh sent around the country is that a major concern dr fauci yeah that would be a major concern yeah it's happening right now it needs to end president biden can end this today he needs to stop this national health crisis and a super spreader covert event that he's created at our southern border i yield back may i just add one thing representative and just for the record to show that our school guidance does in fact speak to vaccination we have layered mitigation strategies we say it's not conditional upon safe reopening of schools the guidance clearly socially distance wear masks reopen schools today thank you for that thank you

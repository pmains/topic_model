communities well we're bringing two communities Jewish in a narrow community to partner in that way building from the grassroots the connection between citizens in Israel give alkaviva is a place for

in any event and I'd like to introduce our panelists for this session starting with its radar radar villa wasabi is a certified organizational development consultant in a co-founder in general

international peace and conflict resolution in Washington DC and director of the peace building and development institute which I bother man is currently a member of the Knesset for the Labour Party

jdi tours in the co-executive director of the center for world religions diplomacy and conflict resolution Aziz is a columnist of their codes newspaper in 972 magazine and has published articles in the New York Times pirates The Jerusalem Post Columbia and others and now I would like to turn this discussion this afternoon to the moderator Aziz thank you for I start i'll just mention something how many of you are here yesterday in the same room this room nice so for a second of this panel to something else is after the speeches are then ended up writing an article about the palestinian perspectives and i was amazing to how much support again how much criticisms at the same time so I'm just warning my Palestinian colleagues here you know your your email will be flooded with some nice messages for the fact of it speaking here calculate my email I think this is why it's important for us to be here it is surprising to a lot of people that Palestinians are speaking here that Palestinians are present here and that's why it's it's important to make a point that we are here and we are talking to each of them we are learning about each other this panel my opinion is the most important panel in j street because not many times we hear about the palestinians citizens of israel we talked about the Palestinians in the West Bank a lot we talk about Gaza we talk about refugees we talk about Israel security the little attention is often given to people who live in Israel to those Palestinians who are twenty percent actually over one and a half million people who live in Israel now not much attention is given to them but talking about them is often we hear a lot of Israeli politicians talk about them we hear about negotiations that happen between Israelis and Palestinians that bring them into the issue and they not in the easiest situation because Palestinian is raised on one hand they have Israeli citizenship there are Israelis but then the second hand they also Palestinians and they have this dual identity they kind of between a rock and a hard place because while it's a great thing it also can be problematic and the Israeli side they suspected people can call them the fifth column here and there they not equal citizens in many situations systemic problems that they go through with the government and also in the Palestinian side I mean for for 20 years after 1948 they were cut off completely with communication with their families and friends and Palestine and that relationship took many and still taken many years to being repaired they live in Israel they speak Hebrew but in the same time this weakness is also their strength because Israelis and Palestinians have a hard time communicating with each other and we often talk at each other not with each other but there is only one group that I know that understands both communities like no one else and it is the Palestinians at our citizens of Israel there's so much both sides Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Israelis Americans can learn from them and very little is given for them to actually teach us about their role and what they can help with see they understand the Israeli culture they understand the language they understand the political sensitivity they understand where the fears where people coming from a TV who's for example often considered is a controversial at least figure did one of the most amazing speeches in Knesset a couple of years ago about the Holocaust that even the most right-wing Israeli said this was something why because he's living there he understands the culture he understand the fears the same thing with the Palestinian community they are Palestinians they come they understand that the Palestinians really understand the people who went it through and nakba they understand what does it mean to be under occupation they lived under military control after nineteen forty a they understand what does it mean and that's why they can offer us what nobody else can and I'm great it's a great today to hear from them to hear from member of Knesset brotherman as well and to hear the dialogue and the conversation that they can offer us on the two-state solution and the role of the Palestinian citizens of Israel in the peace camp and the peace of process and what what can be offered why they not and the negotiation table a table what does the whole Jewish Democratic state means for them does it work does it not work how do you how do they feel being part of Israel so I'm going to stop talking and pass it to my colleague Rida maybe you can see me a little better because I'm not told okay good the good afternoon my name is rey de orina hobby and I live in Nazareth that's in the Galilee of Israel I was required to ask to to talk about one state versus to say solution what I would like to present a little bit more about our own palestinian-israeli community in regards to any future a solution between a is raya land the Palestinians the Palestinian Israelis do not speak in one voice on the issue of two-state solution versus one state solution the israeli-palestinian conflict we do not speak in one voice as well in our community we have people that still believe in the two-state solution we have young people that are starting to believe in one state solution and we even have a minority among our own a community that believes in the revival of the Islamic state the origins of the one state ideology in our community were developed in fact by the establishment of a small but still very active and very loud political party called ABNA el balad who believed in a secular democratic state for Jews and Palestine from the sea to the till the Jordanian river but the trend of one state solution started to be more dominant and two and took more modern come back after the failure of the Oslo agreement and the Second Intifada and was more a much more intensified after the disengagement from the Gaza Strip and after the israeli war on gaza in 2009 the rationale behind it says that as long as israel maintains to be dominated by its zionist ideology there will never be an ending to the occupation in our community the internal debate over one state versus two state solution is a cross-cutting await within the Arab political parties and movements and also within a very large portion of our community that do not vote for the Knesset member for the Knesset Israeli Knesset if we would understand in depth the roots of the revival of the one state trend in our community we should go back to the Oslo days where we were given we we were given we didn't decide on that we were given a role to be produced to be a two-piece by both Israeli decision makers and Palestinian decision makers our own community leadership at that time during the 90s were very happy to take that role mainly because it meant for the first time a recognition from the Arab a world that we exist you see before the 1990s before the Oslo process before the satellite TV before Al Jazeera Al Arabiya and all this revolution and also before the internet most of the Arab world didn't know that we exist we I remember myself during the 80s going with my family to to a tour in in Egypt and my my father's name is Ahmed and they you know they said what am I you're Israeli it doesn't it doesn't fit so most of the Arab world did not recognize and didn't want to recognize in our existence after the Second Intifada in two thousand and the killing of 13 young protesters from our community by the Israeli forces we as a community realized that we do not have any backup not from the Israeli state not from the Palestinian Authority and not from the Arab world in 2006 the palestinian-israeli issue the future vision documents which were we for the first time I call it we got out of the closet we stated in public for the Israeli government and for ourselves what do we want from ourselves as a community as an indigenous minority or do we want from the state and for the first time we said yes we want to be citizens of the state this was also this was very very criticized by by the Israeli government at that time of course but also it was very very criticized by a lot of Lamech movement voices because these documents held a very liberal democratic progressive values another life changing event of course it was the Arab Spring were we for the first time felt a proud to be an Arab as I think most of our people outside of of Israel and within was in the Arab world during the last three or four years a shift has happened in our political map it is a still not translated into a elections but we will see that in the coming a five or six years a new generation is starting to feel free to think outside of his or her a political affiliation suddenly you can hear more and more of a public criticism to the conduct of the political leadership when I talk when I refer to the political leadership I talk mainly of political leaders of our own Arab political parties whether they are representative in the Knesset or not the rise of the Islamic movement has contributed surely mainly because it refused to accept the traditional Israeli ground rules the Islamic movement is very very popular in our community but they choose not to be presented in the Knesset of Israel the Latin the last recent years there has been an the additional elements to the effect of this freedom of criticism the strengthening of the anti-democratic legislations and the relatively zero effect of the other members of the Knesset to stop it the Arab Spring as I said affected our our people a in relation to the political leadership you can oppose your political leadership and you can stay alive take for example the Assyrian case where the internal debate in our community over a width or against the Syrian regime is being held in two different public spheres the more traditional sphere of newspapers and internet sites reflect more the cautious not so much criticizing the Syrian regime and it reflects the pull traditional political leadership cautious means mainly that you do not state any position with or without was are against the Syrian regime because you don't want to take sides with or against America and and saw dia and the other sphere this Facebook and YouTube sphere it is a totally different story because they are still under the radar of the traditional political leadership the debate there is less diplomatic and more free and people are talking about the crimes against humanity that the Syrian regime is conducting against its own people they are also talking about the silence of our traditional Arab political leadership back to the question of one state versus two state solution I can identify within our community three groups one group that is the traditionalists that still believe in the two-state solution mainly because it is the official opposition of the political leadership the second group is the much more pragmatic people that believe that although this solution is the justice solution they acknowledge the fact that it cannot be achieved because of of the map of the settlements legal or illegal and there is the third group of revolutionist that are mainly young people that are connected by the facebook to other Palestinian groups calling for one state solution my personal view is that we are having a very narrow window of opportunity due to all regional changes in regards to adjust a sustainable solution for the israeli-palestinian conflict I'm a pragmatic I believe that the Palestinian people as the Jewish people have the right of self-determination but when I look at the current settlement map I understand that getting back to the borders of 68 is not realistic I do believe that there could be a creative updated model of a two-state solution that can be achieved in order for this to happen we need some pre conditional terms one first of all when there is a will there's a way and I'm not convinced that the Israel decision-makers not only the current government are willing truly to pursue the ending of the conflict to I think that real change in the Palestinian leadership told inclusive a much more younger leadership within within its its role okay I must must be I I think that for the traditional Palestinian leadership and D and they were spying in Gaza if if the if this leadership I want to maintain its relative pneus I relative pneus I think that they have to include much more of a young leadership the third pre conditional term I think that there should be a more proactive approach in the international community including Jewish Americans to put pressure both Israeli leadership understand the necessity of the action now and to convince the Palestinian leadership to make these internal changes as for our community I think that and I wish that we could contribute to the post-conflict Aaron and building constructive relations between the two people I will end up my presentation by saying that for me I see us our palestinian-israeli community as a product of both narratives the National Palestinian narrative and the Civil Israeli narrative thank you very much Salaam alaikum thank you I really impressed by this conference because first when I was called to go and you know I got so many phone calls I shouldn't come here and felt like that I came and are not only I participate that I speak beside my meeting in Washington I listen and I'm I wish we had more conference like that also in other places it's very very so and second i want to share with you i was very much i like to enjoy the presentation of either and i would like to listen yesterday already i got something very nice with Professor a polymer because i had when i was in washington i left Washington to be present Megara 99 to have a good friend in America university professor Abdulaziz I haven't seen since and the hitch told me that is one of his close friend there are calling this afternoon that's also the nice things to come and beat this panel now I want to come to the issue and tell you first my personal story and while still there is a narrow window I still as a Jew and a Zionist that hope that we can achieve the two-state solution but I want to be with you totally honest about what the relationship that took place between Israeli Palestinian Arab and Israeli Jews until today and my own experience as some of you admin day yesterday I grew up and director who the tools I never met any Arabs well I go in Israel I was born 48 until I was in Gaza in for a couple of weeks I didn't I one in the wall when I came to Stanford then I had many offerings and then I came to the World Bank and my closest friend same gentleman by the name of shakib al guti is a cousin to stop eval guti that I'll never forget at one time were in the World Bank we came to visit Israel we've been interviewed by Israeli newspaper and under the photo of Xiao kebab booty to put brotherman available guti and you cannot sue because in exhaustion are so it's not completely make the difference and then I came to Bangor on and I when I was in the World Bank i walked also in Morocco in Egypt power walked all over but in ben-gurion I had the privilege to open the university to the bedroom community and essentially I know any play every place individual community and I'll reflect later on the mistake that Israel does also towards the bedroom community and then in my short career in politics I was offered when I was offered to be a minister since I was not supporting of Barack so the last minute not to break the coalition i was offered to be minister in charge offered to be in the World Bank IMF and I said that to fly to Washington I don't need a ticket from the government and i was offered to be minister of minority which i accepted because i thought the arab issue is the most important issue they have been decorating the two most important issue for the long term Israel long-term survival and if I look from historical level the Israeli leadership totally neglected this subject with the exception of one leader it's horrible that gave respect to the Palestinian Israeli Arabs toward terminus resources and the support was enormous for robbing what he did I tried as a minister with the backing that they are in the beginning to have a couple of plans that are articulate but I want to come to for me which can be another minor tragedy the tragedy that take place in this Oh Leland because most Israeli Jews don't know Israeli Arabs the presumption is that the either fundamentalist Muslims Oh fifth column or how shall I stay that of different mentality you know when you say different mentality means i am this mentality and is this mentality you know total ignorance and my experience and of course the Israeli Arabs Palestinians wanted to be part of this real estate so much and we didn't do what we're supposed to do not only because it's just a human because it's good for the Jews which goes from security it's good for economics because the power in the future as I say a lot of the artists with all the dogs in herbs ken in life you repent and start again I believe every day you can start but of course the mistakes are tremendous I'm still hopeful and you know want to come to the proposition when I was a minister and we start developing I put capital plans for economic development in certain cities in certain municipalities for 800 million shaky land for higher education and for certain new programs was volunteer and I came to my greatest over towards then mr. Netanyahu start listening to him Lieberman start to pass laws that all totally stupid for no reason for example the citizens law of course it is really publicly say why not a new citizen the joint Israeli state should swear alliance two Jewish democracy you know the truth of the matter you know how many people are joining as new citizens not in the simple law of return you know many couple of hundreds from them i don't know maybe 250 hours and if you you ask anybody of them if you're swell Alliance if the moon is for blue cheese they'll do that so what should be a citizen but in order to get this idea Lieberman that is advised by how to Finkelstein hear from you how to go in the polls knew that is a very good subject and all of a sudden a lot of Signet we did on progress there was total alienation because many of these very upstanding here is Lieberman want to transfer and you know perception is reality and everything we started essentially that was not enough but started we left the government I think we have an option and the option is the following I don't believe in the one-state solution because it will be held all this idea of new consciousness I don't know if the Messiah intends to come any day nobody of us Christian unfortunately no I I don't believe in the Messiah I believe the Messiah is a collective consciousness when people are ready the Messiah arrives so therefore I think right now the consciousness is so low in the holy land so there is no place for the Messiah and no place for once take it will be like in the Balkans it will be a total chaos and tragedy we still have the option for the two-state solution but and what we should do we fear more power and if I had more power in Israel you should give more allocation of resources because Israel of course Palestinian Israeli Arabs of higher income per capita and their families brothers Jordan in Egypt in Syria and more democracies and Syria and Egypt and all of these places but as for the point of comparison when you look at the comparison in the income they vote in the election as well I wish either the participation rate will go from 50 to 70 because of course the parties go down it will go down too far i'll talk about that it's very dangerous now but when it comes to allocation of resources by the governments of the State of Israel the Palestinian Arabs don't get the fair share not an infrastructure education etc and that essentially Robin started I initiated but it's not done with clarity and the people at right now involving done doing it not because they believe in it they're doing it halfway not enough before IDEs but I want to talk about economics and I talked to the question of their two states yes the future of the Jewish state economically is based very very much on the Arabs and I think there are apps contrary to the hotel to dogs won't participate so much in the labor force you know I bought all deaths of his Valley cooperation to meet me in the Prime Minister the Jewish won't ask how many of you how many Arabs to you I oh not much one of the issue is that many of the Arabs that finish engineering move to be teachers because in many of the companies they don't get essentially the position and what we have to stop we have to stop because the Israeli economy needs many of the Stalin Ted have a professional I just give you one example in Bangor on where I started was five female between students and 20 men now there is about 300 female caravan Mel but six profits of the six that will be appointed channel sauna finished with excellency we send it to Canary finishes excellency came back is one of the world leaders in computer graphics will get a professor and started the school of excellency because all this idea this is we have to open opportunity and do that we didn't do that not enough wall start today I hope we can change this government and do more but this is the interest of all of the Palestinian Arabs because of course as I said they're in a very complicated situation many of the people that I say that are not very ideological say weren't very much to be part of Israel you see what happened in Syria deceive 11 palaces they don't want to be part of that they want to be part of democratic Israel but they say we want to get the fair share and one of the thing is about the fact that many people don't know I'm so glad with a guy called st. kasuya but I know what a great satirical right that all of a sudden he stopped putting a show and Israeli TV and everything his incredible guy the way you remember long time ago it was Cosby that was you know about the black in America all of a sudden there was the movies about the black middle class and I was a bamf vaulted we have to get to know the Israeli Jew stuff to go to Notre herbs and now do the other question I'm very much worried now if indeed you know this Arab Spring is a big big problem democracy doesn't emerge because people go to the street the question if there are institutions that will do that and I'm I don't know what will happen I wish that will be a democracy but this filter also the demand for all the social protest initial started I think because of the Arab Spring in Cairo and the same time Israeli Arab see that as well but it will be a terrible mistake for my I at least Im said my point of view for the young Israeli Arabs to join extreme movement many of the parliament members that represent them they are very good on TV but like many Israeli politicians Jewish politicians they don't really do beside being a short person do what's good for the community I think we have to create an alliance beside the two-state solution that are necessary alliance that many of you for the wall for serious Jews and Arabs in Israel to work together in order to get to know each other whenever we have been more power to allocate more resources because this is the only solution inside equality outsides two-state solution thank you very much good afternoon my name is mohammed abu nimmer and i am as mentioned by aziz and also a proverb and i'm a professor at the America university and i teach peace and conflict resolution so I'm supposed to be expert on these things actually I'm in a dilemma here because of the last speaker I right there and also professor government already took 75 percent of the political analysis that I'd like to do and I thought that he did they great segue for me because he said I'm gonna start with a personal story so I think that would be more appropriate for decision to start with this example and I spent 20 years at least 15 years doing this thing called dialogue between Arabs and Jews in Israel the main job and I started as a junior in the Hebrew University and my colleagues who were in the political movement at that time found it very strange that i will leave a good path toward the israeli parliament with some of the political party that i was member of at that time and go to this thing called dialogue and they said the guy went crazy and in some way i did i think because after 10 or 11 years of three dialogue meetings every month about 99 days a month i will spend listening to Arabs and Jews regardless their age whether they are a young or teachers or older men or even sometimes politicians playing the same game and the game is to test each other on their loyalty and to test each other in their ethnic and the religious identity basically it was a game that lasted for three days we're at the end they both will say both sides say oh we didn't note you are so similar to us if this was kindergarten or politicians they both will reach the same conclusion except the politician will do it in a more sophisticated way and we'll take them usually more rationalistic and with less probably tears and emotions regardless the outcome was the same I got burned out from this after nine years i said i'm going to leave the Arabs and the Jews and go to America the land of the opportunity and in some ways they did work because you know I have a professor now any American University respected the program I have published written and really did lots of fantastic work and interesting i think i just came back from Erbil Kurdistan I work in sri lanka and philippine in nigeria chad the bosnian northern ireland basically I have an addiction to conflict zone area and I like that and it's not bad i think you get to learn lots about a human when you see them in the midst of their suffering and you can transfer knowledge from one place to the other so i really get a wider perspective on this thing called arabs and jews in israel and i just came back sunday third Friday I came back from Tel Aviv visiting my family in the Galilee when I was introduced to this thing relationship between Arabs and Jews in Israel I was introduced through a very specific grandfather who went to Mecca in 1914 to fight the with the Turks against the British in mac mahon battle and he went walking and he did his first polygamy Jew and he went back to Palestine in 1917 they told the community I am houses now I went to Mecca and they declared them as a leader and he built the first mask in the village in the north of Israel and since then he became a mediator for 60 years his a mediator in the small community and he was very very strong man and I had to live with him about eight years and my childhood sharing the room with him and I remember some stories and I remember many of the stories that my parents will talk about this thing called Israel of course we got in a different story in the school in the school we studied Hebrew we studied the the Torah we trotted be a leak and which we studied all the Jewish history his scientists history and I was I mastered the Hebrew language and I knew that the Navy him I knew I knew more than many of the American Jewish students and the adults even about Judaism and history of the Jewish people but at home I also received a totally different story I received mahmoud darwish i received a meal habibi i received the nationalist narrative and i left with this duality but I anew for me to survive I need to please the Israelis and they please don't mean that you have to master the language and you have to pretend that you know the culture but you never lend your emotion to the full attachment it's detached loyalty and that's the reality of many of the Arabs in Israel Arabs and Israel are up of 1948 and all of that anyway the story with my grandfather one of the sitting says what talk about dialogue so I said you keep talking about Palestine you know he said yes he said Palestine is like a house where somebody came and took your first floor and he kicked you to the second floor and then after 10-15 years he comes to the second floor and he kicks you to the third floor and now we live in the third floor and this was like early seventies which means the West Bank and Gaza and then also the 1948 and I see said you have no way to go you have to fight and reclaim the house I was young and then I said why can't we split the house in the middle they get half we get have a signal or you still too young you don't understand and that was my two-state solution metaphor and again you know you continue with this and that's the generation that wanted first state solution one state solution and then our generation was inducted eyes with the necessity for two-state solution because one two state solution will give us rides inside Israel two-state solution will solve our national identity because it will give our brothers and sisters from the Palestinian nation a place to be to be in and that's the illusion I think and that's what we were told by all the time it was a clear that this illusion is that is that accurate because there was no way that we can achieve a policy of two-state solution that give us the full rights inside israel because i think the crux of the problem between the Arabs and the Jews in Israel that holding us so far from a genuine reconciliation that means I accept you and I accept your national religious collective identity it's not really two-state solution it's really the issue of Jewishness of the state see when I fly into Ben Gurion Airport there is every sign in that airport that tell me you coming to you're not coming back home however when I fly in Dallas Airport when the guy stamped my passport but do you they tell you welcome home there she gives me the look and she debates should my american passport with the stamp of pakistan be sent to security or not and you look at the sides and you listen to the announcements and listen in Russian so you wonder you landed in Moscow we landed in Israel and Palestine so inside your heart you're debating is this place really I belong to and that's I think were the crux of the problem so absolutely agree with the previous speakers it is an issue of civil rights but civil rights is not the entire story because maybe I thought against kahana in the eighties many times and arrested and injured and did all my duties in that one gahanna said something like that Jewishness of the state follicle or inherently contradict with the Democratic nature of the state and he found the solution he said let's expel them I went actually to be expelled I went to one of his offices in Jerusalem to come to see how much he will offer me to be expelled and then I the I ran away actually I couldn't make it to the third floor because I was so scared that I'm not going to go into my hanya Hooda to see how much money I'm going to be paid so he figured I think the wrong wrong solution to the contradiction and what I think would allow Arabs and Jews in Israel the fully reconcile is to solve this issue is to find the different formulas and arrangement political institutional economic cultural social educational that will allow the National Jewish collective identity who truly exists with a Palestinian national collective identity also inside Israel and not to say the Palestinians only in the West Bank and Gaza the one who's going to have national identity you can't convince somebody in sign in to say look if you want nationalism and national identity and symbols you have to go to Nablus that's artificial and I think that's part of the problem until Israelis and Jews and Arabs understand that a relationship that's built on fear dishonesty distrust and domination there is a system of domination in Israel in everywhere you go there is systematic attempt since nineteen forty eight till today to cover up any element of national identity for the local Palestinian indigenous group living in Israel for a Palestinian it's like American Jew living in the u.s. 365 days in Christmas I mean can you imagine that because everywhere you go you're going to see signs of the Christian culture and here I can we take it here right Muslim and juice that you take it here for 10 days ok starting sometimes too early by November by Thanksgiving but an Israeli fury Palestinian who interested in national identity in in connection you cannot find the connection to the state because the entire state institutions are built on alienating you from that system and that's our problem with the state in that sense it's set with the people I'm in the business of em in the industry of dialogue and I give me three days with the group of Arabs and Jews and i can give you maybe forty percent of them kissing and hugging each other and liking each other and change their perception at least for six months they will last it's not a matter of relationship building we can build relationship and if you go into my village you speak to my brother they all have some speak Hebrew and they know the music they know the culture they know the sport they know all these aspect of the cultural connection they have managed to establish that cultural connection but it is artificial the only way we can build a relationship that's sustainable in a way that Arabs and Jews in Israel will live regardless if it's one state to state 3 state four states it doesn't matter it matter a genuine reconciliate the conciliatory relationship that's built on trust genuine partnership policies and institution that welcomed the two in their dualities I'm not built on fear and alienation we can play with with one state or two states but I think that's the issue that we have to deal with equal rights are necessary condition will it be sufficient I don't think so equal civic rights I think what we need to do is to open a dialogue on that dilemma where when when people live together they feel that they are building a joint entity and that entity doesn't have to be only Palestinian or only Jewish I had six pages I heard nothing from them but I said it's my heart thank you will have questions soon as i'm going to just ask one question which dr. animo touched on already in israel the two-state solution comes with a idea premise that Israel is a democratic and Jewish state so how can those contradictions in your opinion and maybe professor Braverman can can start with this so say I was testing you sir that's what you do to your students I assume to how how does the State of Israel you were ministering the government deal with that contradictions between 60 years when Israel poxet as a condition at least in the last few years the israel needs to be recognized as a Jewish state first Democratic Jewish estate how can the Palestinians in Israel and the Palestinians in the West Bank deal with that contradiction is that really possible giving equal rights to the Palestinians and being a Jewish estate the question what's possible and what's impossible is difficult to answer but I'll tell you essentially and I was so taken by Professor Abu nimmer that we already have a day tues even easily so great you know hey as you say there are two narratives here and people you know I can say for us is the state of the Jewish people from the Bible etc the Palestinian live there you know I muscles give a beautiful speech I still believe is too we can change that given what takes place given our history is the state of the Jewish people and I don't define it anymore and essentially in this place the palestinian-israeli up should be equal citizen with a full aspiration now as well state but later by less pathetic answer for me it's in totally unimportant what the tan yahoo say that we have to emphasize that israeli jewish democracy i mean you know we don't know what's a Jew and the question was democracy when some people talk about democracy to speak about democracy like all the east european formula colonies you know of russia so I still believe that this impossible situation is tough one and I said you cannot change history if we did behave all of us differently it may have been different but so what I will try and that's the reason I staying positive and try to obtain more power that pit me and other people that believe that is different that we sieved which I have many friends that Israeli Arabs you know not in my party there is a somebody admire from a very leftist parted ohana sweat one of the most vulnerable per person he happened to be a Christian that is there I have so many a Muslim faith at work together we have to create alliance of serious people and go to some of the out of the matter unfortunately government run by people that want to win election immediately and in the short term for juice is good to be in a way vocal aunty I have been away and get votes many of these Raya of the Arab Parliament member have to be you know very vocal to be a anti-jewish and both of them gets a constituency and what is mrs. what is missing is people like like you listen heal that realize we are seeing twins stuck in this crazy only place and I think given the history of us I believe I don't believe in one democratic state I believe yes it's the state of the Jewish people I know it's difficult for either another to him but given this part of your life is paradox we have to have the full aspiration of the Palestinian expressed and that can be only if they ever once the world state in the West Bank and Gaza and changing totally not only the location / shows a civil right but what Professor Abu Newman said let's start talking about each collective consciousness and great truly be brothers again which happened to many of us when we work together but most people as I say have no understanding and knowledge of each other so I'm optimistic because I'm optimistic but I still believe that we cannot move to this concept of a fully one state maybe the time will come it's not now I have two nodes to dr. Robin nimir I think that the discourse the current discourse on the issue of the Jewishness of Israel as a state is a little bit dangerous because it takes the focal point on off sorry a occupation I think that the issue is occupation and nobody is talking about occupation ladies and gentlemen occupation occupation occupation I think that this is the issue nobody is talk not even Palestinians from the from from Gaza and the West Bank are talking about occupation they're talking about managing the future a Palestinian state but there there are facts on the ground and the facts on the ground are that there are settlements that I don't know what what should be done with that so this is one thing I agree with you that there is an internal discourse that should be done over the how much Israel would be a democratic or would be Jewish but it's an internal discourse that that can be developed as for us as the palestinian-israeli community I believe that we once we have empowered ourselves as a community build our own institutions build our own democratic institutions we other then go a once every couple of years and voting to the Knesset portrait percent of us vote for the Knesset we do not know what what how to act in in democratic approaches what do what do I mean by by by being listened and in plain and simple a word I want for my kids to walk in the state of Tel Aviv and to feel that they own the place to feel that they are part of the decision-making system that is in Israel I don't want to go to to to live in the future a Palestinian state no I want to stay and to be a citizen in Israel but I want Israel to to be democratic really democratic and I want to translate this democracy into our it into my citizenship and I will stay I will stay a Palestinian because this is my history this is my narrative my my father who is a physician was a refugee Nana Hillary mm camp in in orange in Lebanon and he got back with his family so it's it's very natural to be Palestinian I want to pursue my citizenship this is what I want so what we'll do now is take some questions but I want to do it a bit differently is say your name state your question and we'll take three questions at a time and we'll go and round so we can get a few of you I don't think we have that much time so let's just say your name your question and we'll take three questions and then we'll move on each round hi is it on ok my name is Gil and I have a question for the whole panel but especially to mr. Braverman as a policymaker you portrayed two challenges one is the separation you told us you never met an Arab Palestinian until you went to Gaza and the second problem he describes then I told you that all my life was yes of course report were elected minister what quoted by the vendor community defense battery minister in his released oh ok I just said that you know when the Jerusalem report came to interview me when i was elected I was on my bed win friends in the room and the headline was the first bed with Minister elected ok so in order to finish the question so one was this about separation and the other was about a unequal allocation of resources you portrayed a very nice vision about an equal allocation of resources but nothing about separation and I would like to specifically address separation in the school system and in the educational system growing up in Israel and bit and living in Israel I did not even think for a second that it was weird or against my values that I don't see Palestinians in my school although they live around my school and coming here I realized that one of the biggest struggles of the civil rights movement was in order to end separation they they used a more harsh and charged word of segregation so I would like to ask if you have any vision about that and it's an open question to the whole panel not just to you I'll send you I think I answered that host a shallow be offered better hi my name is mike i miss a graduate student at UC Santa Barbara this question is about trust in negotiations and in popular consensus did Mike Schwartz and so this summer I had the opportunity to travel with an organization called the olive tree initiative to the Middle East and in speaking with negotiators from yossi valence and nabeel shot there was a perception that in 2008 negotiations under all merit as prime minister were incredibly close to the succeeding but they were cut short for his his political um crap but I not related to the peace process I and so there's a sense that the negotiations were very close and Trust was there so I guess that part is inspired by something that I said and the other part is that many other people that we spoke two ambassadors policymakers cited surveys that show that Israelis and Palestinians both as a people I'm a majority sixty seventy percent are in favor of a two-state solution but about sixty seventy percent also think they don't have a partner in the other side so if there is a two-state solution this is the Palestinian azizi so nice to you but if I was the outside asked your question and don't talk too long I asked okay so the question is is there really trust for peace is there really trust between leaders and what will be the reaction of the people I love especially the vocal minority is against the two-state solution thank you this is a question for the Palestinian and Palestinian Israelis members of the panel your name my name is a mighty I want to raise the issue of a country of all its citizens and its importance in the context of the J Street conference how important is it to insist on a country of all its citizens thinking about true cultural and national dignity for Palestine and Israelis so yeah what do you think about that thank you I would mainly try to address the issue of trust if I understood the question correctly I always try to to to answer a question regarding what is my responsibility and what my community's responsibility over changing our own reality and I think that I was very very clear about it we need a lot of internal building in order for us to start negotiating our own future a situation with the Israeli state but on the other hand the trust issue is is not on our side it sits on the Israeli decision making a side because what happens is that up until now and even after a professor government even after the OECD report and the decisions that came after that Israel decision-makers still manage our community mainly because they don't trust us mainly because they basically think of us as a fifth column so I think that on our side we need to build up our own democratic institutions and on the Israeli decision making a side one well professor Braverman your 11 of them you need to stop thinking of us as as as a fifth column so this is very important I think I think that the issue of trust is a mutual and both sides have to seek to earn the trust of each other obviously the minority inside Israel is a minority and brunt of the the grant of that the burden comes on the group or side that has the dominant aspect I think within the Israeli society that our number of leaders and forces that have already started and realized that change of policy and you heard that from Professor government very clearly about the ravine and other policies that needed to be changed and he's been very vocal on the issue of the bid win in there in the south which is really really tragedy so trust can be earned through change concrete change of policy and I believe there are also social programs cultural programs that trying to create a space to compensate for the total separation in school system I think this is one of the major tragedies that we have in Israel that the fact that the in the entire country the two or three schools bilingual it testifies to the existing structural separation in this in this community that institutionally aim to segregate the two and if even if you live two miles away from the Jewish issue or kibbutz in your neighborhood in your village and you have no access they have no access to your narrative you will grow up alienated from them and the same for for it so definitely I education integrating certain school having that opportunity is definitely it went quite the opposite i evaluated knavish alam the only bilingual school in the country i evaluated it with my actually L her master from George Mason and our report was mentioned there and they talked about how hard and difficult the Ministry of Education in Israel fought them for two decades to close them as the only bilingual school in the country that's I think the major threat to the democracy of Israel that fighting that type of schooling is definitely a problematic I just want to clarify here the issue of the Jewish state it's it's not about slogans here also to vidor and others who I think shy away from tackling the issue it's about the institutions it's about a tangible concrete policies and arrangement in the state of israel since nineteen forty eight that have been devised to serve one community because they looked at the minority from one prism the prism of enemy the prism of of security and after 40 after 60 years of living with someone in the same house it's very hard to maintain that especially if that one has contributed so significantly to building the state it's our generation our parents generation who built many of the Israeli ties the the Jewish sporadic were the managers and the Ashkenazi were the engineers the one who built the state the houses the infrastructure were Arabs until we occupy the west bank and they brought the Gaza and those bankers so not to recognize this this history this joint is a tragedy and I think until we learn to appreciate these things there is no genuine reconciliation base for it so it's not about slogan it's about changing that institution we don't need to call it youth I want to thank so much writer and professor a believer because they speak the truth the speaking eloquently and the spooked at from the heart and I'm not represented Israeli government when I was a minister I try to change and it's not easy now the question is what do you do today I think we have a generation of people one of the changes that would try to do I try to do to open position this railing government because most Arabs didn't get many positions and then all of a sudden you start bringing people and people come in and then you see great lawyers great engineers it's starting the question is the pace given what takes place outside and inside this very society and the fact that his raley society is getting so dominant by anti-democratic extreme line queen people that for them is the Jews only Jewish state and the other don't exist and part of the danger for the democracy is coming out of this fear and ignorance that eventually will certain boss Israeli Arabs and his religious and you left to demise my answer is only one for the question of gale I definitely what I said that is not all resources one of my recommendation now that people will go before you get to say that you have joint school as professor of animals I know well live a shalom there is a place in the cafe cara in others legs first ever situation where students and pupils from Jewish schools that are five two kilometers from Arab schools still meeting each other before they study together let's meet each other if you want something that I wanted to advocate let's have a all movement that the movement get to know your neighbor if you start with that and its ongoing because as Professor would even say this loving workshop that I think mr. Purvis teeth and many people that make any story that that people come couple of them to America and spend a couple of time together and they change the world it does make a bit of a difference in steps up couple of people are doing anyways fun for that the issue is to do it on the ground and do it in a massive way and for that part of the thing that I'm trying to change the god of israel because you can change so much by attitude when i spoke about his hawk rabbit only did and what you will basically for professor Aziz and riders is did attitude the first thing if people I remember something and I I comment not to his anger when the when I was a minister the Prime Minister organized and I'm not blaming all of them do that there was a 1200 Shoshanna there was a meeting of people in the Prime Minister and the government and it happened to be Ramadan and there was several Muslims with me that work with me and others and there was mention only about the Jews so the point of sensitivity and openness is to recognize we have twenty Twenty twenty five percent eventually Israeli Allah Palestinian that are different and the good thing that happened right now that I would say very clearly most of their leadership was co-opted there was a lot of issue there's a lot of changes that takes place there the way taking the Jewish community but this young leadership that emerges my Holyoke that together with Israeli leaders unity marriage won't go to the extreme would but we'll go to the opening of schools the opening day and trying to do the unimaginable before we talk about because if we'll go to the extreme situation would have essentially a tragedy that is in the making unfortunately when we have a place from one question so go ahead thank you my name is sherry I wanted to make one comment that I just I think for myself as an American Jew growing up the that I was more sensitized first to the issues of inequalities of Palestinians and Israel even more than Palestinian state issues in terms of fundamental equalities and have you know not known how that can be resolved I mean you are the speakers are talking about institution building and I'd like to know if there is any other model that the speakers are aware of in other countries but I want to name two things in particular house demolitions and the Jewish National Fund as you know two of the methods or you know the instruments of creating some of the real fundamental you know inequalities and abuse against the Palestinian population and Israel and wondering if there's any movement around the Jewish National Fund which still is functioning to try and take lands or control lands or prevent building you know by Palestinians so I do wonder if you're aware of any other models in any other countries of some you know similar kind of situation because it seems very bleak to me how that can be resolved true equality within a Jewish state would okay because it is used as a ferry to be listen I I tell you I'm a great admirer of Leonard Cohen is one of my heroes there any safe else we take Manhattan general take Berlin before we change all the current Calumet and Jewish nation fan let's do some of the basic sticks and allocating resources blink people have different leadership and then thankfully merger I I think there is often what we want me to do why am I stopped the Jewish nation fun who I am yeah okay I am I'm doing it I'm doing it I am okay so you know one of the thing that you have to know I understand your anger and you pain you point of view but try to point the finger in the right direction I am NOT I'm coming here because I try to do my best in accra said that I have a lot of disagreement those most of the member in the government and I try to do the best I can under the limitation it's not so you know okay dissolution I respect but again I know that the air is pain and you think he can change the world in a second one of the thing when you go up a little bit and you fight all your life to change is that when you change it's not that simple so go demonstrate try to help and I support you and down that's what I can say I I think I think I met I I understand your name Roy yes i think that the other hip and the other 40 unrecognized villages around the palestinian villages and areas are also on one of the core issues and the whole land control of land 93% being controlled by the state and very little by the jewels and it also Arabs but particular Arabs not having access to that is part of the institution that we need to tackle it's part of the policies that we have Arabs and Jews in Israel need to speak about it honestly in professor government view this is a long term maybe because he sees something more immediate civil rights and others but from the Palestinian perspective this is something very painful particularly from Allah raqib and other who've been destroyed 28 times in the last year at least in the south and I'm sure your your native people that you've been in touch with in the bedroom no know about these issues but again the issue of the land is similar to the demography similar to the internal displacement this whole thing lies on the principle that we either agree that this so-called government state is a partnership or it's yours and you're letting me in with some some privileges that my parents and others in the West Bank and other places cannot get so I need to be thankful for you I think this approach has been 60 years and it's about time that we challenge it and look for a genuine partnership inside Israel regardless regardless whether is to state three states forces 20 states there is occupation it will end and we need at from now to look at this type of partnership in order to address all these issues I wanted relate a bit about the question of budget allocation and equality we don't want that we don't want money from Israel please just understand where we come from the issue when I night or when I talk about that we as a humidity want to be a part of a decision making in the State of Israel as citizens I don't want to talk about money and budget allocation I want to talk about building a new frame of citizenship something that wasn't done before who can guarantee a my and my kids lives and and citizenships after these anti-democratic legislation that are a bill you know starting to develop in the last two years this is something that is for us it is crucial and and we're not talking only about how can we be more of you know our municipality have have more have more budgets we need to be more citizens of over shared partnership as dr. preferable never said but this is something that has to do with us and has to do with the Israeli state

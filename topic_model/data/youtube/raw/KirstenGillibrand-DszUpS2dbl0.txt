the reason why we need publicly funded elections which is why I am number one not taking corporate PAC money not taking federal lobbyist money not having individual super PAC the reason why I've made those commitments is because it's a first step and the reason why you need to get money out of politics is the way Washington works and this rival earns in ten years is that the powerful have unlimited power and money is the name of the game so when the NRA doesn't want any gun reform they funnel money into campaigns of candidates across this country to make sure they don't vote for common sense gun reform if you believe health care czar right and not a privilege where you have to be willing to take on the insurance companies because they will funnel money into Washington with the most sophisticated lobbyists in the world to make sure we don't have Medicare for all to make sure they aren't cut out of the system because you know what the insurance companies do it's a middleman they take a lot of money out of the system and doesn't actually provide you value so that's why we have to fight against that when you're suffering from the opioid crisis like they are in my state in your state states all across the country what we have to do is take on the drug manufacturers who purposefully made these drugs stronger more addictive and now that we have the documents we know they did it because they wanted record sales

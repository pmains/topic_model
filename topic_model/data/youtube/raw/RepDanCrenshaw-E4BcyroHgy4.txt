alright let's clear some of the chatter here Iran is a bad actor it's a nimac 'el to the United States it's a bad actor in the region period for a long time this general that America took out was considered a terrorist for good reason the question is was this done the right way and does that matter going forward congressman Dan Crenshaw knows the importance of clear Intel and he knows the reality of war in the region okay he is a veteran who served with honor the Republican from Texas joins us now Happy New Year Happy New Year Chris thanks for having me it's good to have you I wish I had you on for a better reason but in truth you know what this matters this is good reason thank you for making the time you heard me off the top there is no discussion about whether Iran is inimical to the cause is a danger to America nor with this individual my question is about process here especially as someone who has to pay the price in the past for political decisions right you were a fighting man or do you have any concerns about the president and the people around him doing this the way they did without Congress on the basis they've provided so far yeah well that's an important question to ask I certainly don't deny that but upon looking at the facts and being in the briefings I've been in yes I do believe it was the right decision and I think they made it as well as they could okay we have to look at this in context in the context of history and the escalation and violence that has occurred against the United States over the past few years so even as the Iran deal was getting signed the the the Iran the Iranians were embarrassing US Navy sailors by capturing them boarding their vessel and putting those pictures all over the internet then we move into putting limpet mines on oil tankers bombing Saudi oil facilities yes downing a US drone rocket attacks on our bases exporting funding terrorizing Hezbollah al with Yemen doing stuff in Syria even feeding into the North African problems all true my question to you is that also informs us that this was a long-standing thing that marries to the idea that the Secretary of State reportedly was being the president on this for a long time that was not such an eminence II know but well it was imminency but it also culminated into an attacks that killed an American citizen yes and then I think and then orchestrated an attack against a US Embassy so the the escalation had occurred and then there was good intelligence that show that it was going to continue to escalate and that escalation ladder needed to be disrupted was when I hear somebody like general Milley and the CIA director and the in the DNI directors say that this is some of the best clearest intelligence that they have seen I think we should take that into account and believe what they're saying well we wouldn't believe it more quickly by the way if we hadn't had a president for two and a half years pounding on us that you can't trust us Intel but let's take your point because I want people to trust Intel but I want them to trust but verify we should have proof that's the media's job Senator Mike Lee had a different take Republican Utah not set up to be against the president for no reason here's what he said drive-by notification or after the fact leymah briefings like the one we just received aren't adequate every time we got close I'd say well we can't discuss that here because it's really sensitive we're in a skiff we're in a secure underground bunker where all what electronic devices have to be checked at the door and they still refuse to tell us Rand Paul went on to say they couldn't give me the details they couldn't give me the proof of imminency that they had to do it now they're relying on an AUMF that has no bearing to what's going on right now I believe Congress for that not the executive branch by the way but why does this senator come to or two senators come to such a different conclusion than you yeah well first of all the eight the 2002 AUMF is sort of an added justification meant to demonstrate that the attack happened in Iraq and the counter attack happened in Iraq we already have an operational presence in Iraq the real justification is article 2 of the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution which clearly states that the president can take immediate action to protect US forces especially when we just had two significant attacks on us four they are working him for so long to do this and why wasn't it worth bringing in Congress and trying to get people like you into the leadership position who have such expertise to talk about whether it's right the way they're doing it cuz really this is your job in Congress I'm not aware of Secretary of Pompeo conversations with the president but but the the other part about the intelligence that the senator Lee was was complaining about is Alyssa day I understand it I do but having come from the world of intelligence I also understand that these are extremely sensitive sources and methods yes and when you say what you know you you you by nature are revealing how you got it and that is of extreme concern especially if we're still getting that intelligence and you know and I don't think it's headed the question to say or out of bounds to say that the you know the the director the CIA is not sure whether these members of Congress will go out and say what they're saying the easiest thing in the world by the way is just to know that that say the CIA and the DNI can't reveal those intelligence sources and then go say well we don't believe it these aren't Democrats they're Republicans so it's not like it's a political play the gang of eight wasn't even talked to before this happened which is a mechanism that's in place for a reason the president who is said again and again and again I'm not blaming you for this day and I'm bringing you on to talk reason to it he said so many times US Intel can be deep state nonsense confidential sources and classified forget it declassify at all it should all be out there so you know now he doesn't want to do that now he's told the American people nothing why should we believe it was such a clear case because we have so many again again we have general Milley we have the dark of the CIA director the DNI saying the same things as well so you know the valid criticisms you know you can make a valid critique that that members of Congress could have been notified at least as the strike was happening but that doesn't take away from the the overall picture here which is that this is a good thing it's a good strategic decision it was a good technical decision seeing strategic decision but they have 24 hours but they haven't articulated a strategy yet I'll articulate a strategy right now which is we are the United States of America and when people attack us we can't not respond we have to respond we have to disrupt the escalation ladder what's happened in the last 24 hours is I believe that has happened I believe we have restored deterrence in an effective way because how do you know type a well because you look at the type of attack that happened last night you look at the indications that the Iranians actually let the Iraqis know beforehand so they were complete were completely prepared for it that there so that there would be no casualties the Iranians can tell their people that they did this great thing where they were they where they took out Americans in reality that didn't happen and we don't have to escalate it anymore if you think it's over has a curve you think it's over I think there was this current there was definitely an off-ramp now as far as the the long-term skirmishes with surrogate forces say you know she and militias I think smaller things like that will happen but we have clear indications that that the Iranians wanted to escalate this dramatically okay and that is that is funny you don't think that'll happen stopped no it's so it's already stopped as it appears right now how do you know what's gonna happen a week from now what will they do with their props i scandal curse I can't know it's by would you say would surround a that it stopped of course I can't know what's going to happen a week from now but it certainly appears that way based on all of the information we have now base what the Iranians have said but the Iranian Foreign Minister and what he tweeted out sarin can't be believed yeah well as of before the Iranians were committing attacks where they actually took credibility you have to understand how different that is from years past where they used surrogates and they and they tried to make and they tried to make their role in it unattributable understand that that and that changed recently on us changed recently and now they're walking that back they're in a much weaker position and the president is outlined exactly what his red lines are and and more importantly than that the light at the end of the tunnel wants to renegotiate the jcpoa go to the table he's setting out a path for peace but he's also set out red lines and deterrence whereas before we never had that and that is really important to note and I think we there is there is a there's more reason to be hopeful than there was before listen I'm all about being hopeful I don't want to see any escalation I'll be very clear I am biased here I don't want to see men and women like you fighting fights for political decisions that may not make the most sense I'm all about keeping it about talking he sent red lines Iran crossed it thankfully that didn't trigger any further action he wants to go to the table every expert says this may go in at the table less likely but Dan Crenshaw I'm with you I hope this cools it down I hope this allows for more I just hope that people like you and Congress fight for your right to have a part in decision-making processes that may lead to war and the sacrifice of blood forget about treasure so thank you for being with us

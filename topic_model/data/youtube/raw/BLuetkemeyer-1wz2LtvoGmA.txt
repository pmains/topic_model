hi this is congress luke tomorrow with another edition of blaine buzz thanks for joining us this week i want to talk just a little about the special day is coming up shortly that's the fourth of july independence day a very special day in our country's history as we go about our way of celebrating it normally in this country it's with fireworks and all sorts of barbecues etc uh and there's been some fireworks around the capitol the last few days here this past week with all the different activities going on but let's remember who started the fireworks display and that's the folks who put our country together who made the sacrifices to get us going our founding fathers back in the seven in 1776 when they risked for their families and themselves pledged their honor and sacred duty to sign the declaration of independence that they knew was a treason sack from the standpoint that if they were caught they'd probably be hanged because of the uh act uh being one against the you know their the king and so for them to risk everything they had for us to have what we have today is something we should reflect on and remember their sacrifices and what we need to do to be able to continue to protect this great country and the wonderful things that we have here um you know i think it's something that's inherent on all of us that we don't just celebrate the day and reflect but we pass on to our children and grandchildren the respect of what those individuals did and how important their acts were and that they never be forgotten they continue to be remembered and that way we can honor them and their efforts and sacrifices so with that enjoy the day have a great fourth of july shoot those firecrackers off and watch those roman candles go i know it's a little hot and dry around missouri right now so be careful what you do when you do it but at the same time reflect on the importance of the day and enjoy it and remember to impart on your your family members importance of the day so they can remember and honor to our great founding fathers thanks see you next week

Thank You mr. chairman Thank You general Kneller and to your family congratulations on a wonderful service thus far a few questions I want to go back to you talked a bit about gender integration earlier and where I want to kind of get your full ah your take first on how it's going and then the kind of philosophy that the Marine Corps is undertaking to to carry out that that mission if you could talk about that a senator wit when the secretary made the decision to open up all occupational fields the service chiefs and the services were getting or a certain amount of time to take a look at how they might do this we've we've worked hard to work in a way to figure out how we will integrate we've opened up MOS is we put Marine female Marine officers staff NCOs and NCOs and units where previously women weren't allowed to serve they've done well we're going to continue to do that and then to determine the last part whether we would based on a standard allow women to serve in infantry artillery tanks light armored reconnaissance amphibian tractors and reconnaissance we formed a task force of volunteers and we put them together as a unit they trained up and they went to 29 palms into the mountain Warfare Center and did a series of tests those tests are complete the data has been collected it's being analyzed and it'll provide information that will inform the Commandant about whether or not he will request a waiver for any of those mo s's so I have not seen all the data I've seen some of it I've been involved in this process for some time when we first sent volunteer female Marines enlisted to the infantry training battalion to try to gain data and determine their ability to complete that course of the number that went about they had about a forty 36 percent completion rate and again you know we were still looking at this we are we have not made any sort of pre decision and so again whatever we do it is about individual standards it is about the capability of the unit and that unit becoming better or at least as good as it is now so that decision is going to come I believe we had a good process we've got information it's fact-based we're working with the army we're sharing the data with them and and I'm sure the general Dunford has spoken I know he's to poke into general Odierno and and work with general Milley if he is confirmed as the next chief of staff of the Army can I ask a question about the standard kind of the philosophy and setting the standard as you as you set the standard in the areas that are not yet gender integrated is the standard setting just describing the current functions the way we've always done it or is the standard setting a new analysis of what are the attributes that are the most needed to do the best job in this particular MOS I have not seen all the different tasks condition standards they will be functionally based they won't be I mean there may be a screening process for any Marine male or female but it'll be not lift so much weight as if you have to load the load the tank main gun I've kept the load the howitzer I have to prepare the charge I got to carry the the the projectile I've got to drag the cannon I have to carry the load I have to go this fast as far with this much weight it'll be those types of things and so that's the data we've got and what the data says about how men and women did I went out and saw the unit that did the test it was a very hard test mm-hmm it was hard and regardless of whatever happens I'm you know I can tell you that the Marines out there particularly the women Marines they they did a great job it was pretty motivating I'm gonna switch gears to an area of the Marines that is incredibly important I'm not sure everybody focuses on them they train in Virginia and it's good to have a UVA grab before us the marine security guards who trained at Quantico everywhere I travel if I'm ever at a US Embassy I always stick my head in host one to thank these important members of not only the embassy family but important members of the Marine Corps this is a job that is getting more attention this is a job where I think on Armed Services we've devoted more resources to it how familiar are you with that unit and especially in terms of kind of do they have the resources they need are we training enough because we sure need them around the world senator I'm not completely conversing in their entire training program of instruction I like you when I go to embassies I talked to the Marines they're very high quality they're very highly screened it's a great retention tool for us to keep Marines in I do worry because they are so capable that that we don't we don't get a lot of them to stay after their service they have they've got options and I always ask them how many of you are going to stay and if there's any of us say they are I immediately volunteer myself to be their career planner so I can convince them to stay because they are some of the very best and brightest young men and women we have but I think they're trained well I think the resource well I've never been to an embassy where they told me they were wanting or lacking for anything or the regional security officer so I'd have to get back to you in any more detail but my my basic rudimentary response is I think they're in good shape great thank you very much for Testament thanks mr. chairman

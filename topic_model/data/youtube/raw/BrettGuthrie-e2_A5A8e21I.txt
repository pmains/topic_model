his bill thank you to the Republican leader for yielding i was the proud to introduce three bipartisan bills today the modern labeling act will modify how certain generic drug labels are updated the safeguarding therapeutics act will protect American consumers from counterfeit medical devices like my friend dr. Burgess I was floored when I was at JFK Airport and realized that we just returned counterfeit devices and by law we can't destroy them so we'll fix up phillipe it's that this session and then the continuous manufacturing bill will expand our work on 21st century cures to increase their search and development on continuous manufacturing I'd like to thank representative Matsui Matsui firms of Engl and chairman plumb for working with me on these bills and I yield back thank you very much a couple of these bills are so common sense and it's hard the questions have already been asking since moving forward but when I was at the JFK coming forward I wish people could sit there and see that because you see counterfeit drug gene see I'm standing in front in front of it sitting in front of you and people are if they're going outside the normal distribution chains and a lot of times people are doing it because of access to affordable prescription drugs and hopefully we as a Congress can get back to focusing on that and get a bill the president can sign but but in the meantime it's just not safe if you're going to go on websites and try to and you get counterfeit we got an investigation beginning on counterfeit tickets to events if you buy a bat of the counterfeit ticket you have a bad night if you buy a counterfeit drug you have can ruin your life and and so it's important and I just want people understand and I was standing there and watch them I if it was a it was a drug that could destroy it but if the drug was packaged with a syringe so therefore medical device they couldn't and so mr. Kaiser can you explain under current law what happens when a counterfeit products are discovered what what's an example of a combination product which cannot be destroyed and why hr6 63 would approve the ability of federal government to stop the supply of counterfeit so first question was what the first question is under current law what happens when I counter their current law for medical devices combination products those are typically shipped back to whoever sent it so the cipa clear means in the supply chain and many times it comes back through so that represents a significant risk yeah so bought but why wasn't it destroyed because it doesn't fall under the current law right so that what we're what you're asking for in the new law would allow us to destroy medical devices and combination products under $2,500 do you understand I just wanted you to bring that out and then so what's an example of a combination product I mean I saw us syringe with a vial of I guess it was insulin yeah that's the and they couldn't if it was just insulin they could have destroyed it because it was packaged with the they couldn't my law what's this that's a great example another one might be coronary stents drug drug eluting coronary stents you know stent creates the scaffolding to keep an artery open if it's coated with a drug Ellucian a drug that would emit to help us cell proliferation so I think those were a couple of good examples those combination therapies well I had a boarder one of our age FDA agent say that JFK that they literally have packaged opened it discovered it they had to ship it back because they couldn't destroy they can store it but then they can ship it back and it come back to JFK exactly as they wrapped it up and sent it back so it's somewhat people are actually ordering these the people who even their sinem to not even who knows that they even put I mean somebody could have changed the whole product inside and send it back to this is how bad these people are who are trying to slip just put this stuff through and while we have to fix this and and it should not it should be absolutely against a law to move forward on the labeling I think we've discussed a lot of the reason for that when I first started looking at that it was the label on the container but that's not what we're talking explain what labeling actually is because I think ever all of us think matter of fact the time we need to fix if you get over the counter seems like we have so much stuff required I can't even find oh I take one or two is it every six or twelve hours because you got to keep pilling things back to to be able to safely take out over-counting we have too much but your labeling is different you're talking about you just explain that it generally refers to the entire package of information that is submitted and associated with the drug that often evolves over time it includes things like the package insert that that you've mentioned here I think that's a good point with with the bill that you've introduced here will allow some of these older drugs to actually conform to a new format of labeling that the FDA put forth in 2006 some of these drugs don't even conform to that at this point they can't be changed but by doing so the intention there was to allow the drug label to be more accessible and more usable for the consumers so so currently if it's not labeled updated label like it could be what's happening to the patients currently all our physicians are they not able to use in a prescribed way that they think could be the in many instances particularly in oncology there is the accessibility to expert develop guidelines things like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network has regularly updated guidelines but those are typically accessible to to expert oncologist perhaps in an academic setting so still the most accessible source of information would be to look up the drug label around things like different doses and those doses can change over time depending on the context of use oncologist may not have access to the best information for a specific drug for a specific patient not on these outdated labels they would have to look elsewhere than the label in order to access it thank

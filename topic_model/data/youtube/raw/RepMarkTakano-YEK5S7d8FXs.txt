production gentleman from California is recognized for one minute Mr Speaker I rise today to show my support for America's middle class currently government rules allow only eleven percent of salaried workers to be eligible for overtime pay contrast that to 1975 when the income threshold for overtime pay covered 65 percent of our salaried workers this is because Department of Labor rules prohibit workers who earn more than twenty three thousand six hundred thirty six hundred and sixty dollars a year from earning overtime pay recently I was joined by more than thirty of my colleagues and calling for this administration to raise the income threshold to sixty nine thousand dollars at this level we could cover the same amount of workers that were eligible in 1975 for 35 years American workers have increased their productivity yet they have not been rewarded let's remember that it is a strong middle class that drives economic growth be bold mr. president your administration can help middle-class families raise the income threshold for overtime pay thank you and I yield back the gentleman yields back

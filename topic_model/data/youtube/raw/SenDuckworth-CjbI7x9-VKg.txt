I also believe that mr. wheeler has far too many conflicts of interest to be running the EPA as a former lobbyist for Murray energy mr. wheeler has worked closely with the industries he would regulate as the leader of the EPA it is well reported that mr. wheelers former firm lobby the EPA on efforts wheeler now oversees even after he took temporary reins at the EPA he made no secret of meeting with former clients and fossil fuel industry representatives CNN and Reuters have both reported that wheeler is heavily prioritizing meetings with industry over anyone else and has attended more than 50 meetings with companies or industry groups the EPA regulates if this news doesn't alarm you it may be because corruption it is because corruption is becoming routine under this administration after all just earlier this week The Washington Post reported that assistant administrator for air and radiation bill Wareham has been routinely meeting with his former clients in the fossil fuel industry from his not so long ago lobbying days I placed a hold of mr. Webb's nomination because I did not think he could be trusted with our nation's air I feel the same way about mr. wheeler leading the EPA according to the Sierra Club every third day during his first 100 days as Acting Administrator mr. wheeler either one wrote back a new climate policy to ignored or contradicted science 3 met with big polluters for limited the EPA's ability to protect us from pollution or 5 gave in to corporate polluters demands all that in just his first three months and change imagine what would happen if we gave him the reins for good

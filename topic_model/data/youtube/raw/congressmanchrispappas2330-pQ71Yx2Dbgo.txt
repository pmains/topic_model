I rise today in support of the respect for Marriage Act growing up in New Hampshire as a gay person I wasn't sure if there would be a place for me or if I'd be able to have a family of my own but I was lucky to be surrounded by people who embraced me for who I am and to live at a time when Hearts minds and laws were changing for the better next year I'll marry the love of my life and it's Unthinkable that if the Supreme Court heeds Justice Thomas's call that our marriage might not be recognized in New Hampshire where we might be recognized in New Hampshire where we live but not across the country that's the reality that many couples fear one that would jeopardize their ability to visit a spouse in the hospital or access all the benefits that couples do one that would strip millions of Americans of their rights and their dignity that's a threat that we can't ignore so I hope my colleagues will heed the calls of their constituents in the call of history and cast a vote in favor of the respect for Marriage Act to say that love is love and to respect people's individual freedoms in this country thank you and yield back

thank you very much mr. chairman good to see mr. beacon thank you for your interest in continuing to serve the ranking member referenced in his opening round of questions the absolutely earth-shattering testimony that we're hearing today from ambassador Sandlin testifying that under the president's orders he and others were engaged in an effort to try to get the Ukrainian government to investigate or launch investigations connected to the president's political rivals in exchange for access to the White House and the release of security aid this is a really really serious moment when we're learning that many if not most of the people at the top of America's national security leadership we're asked to do things that they knew were wrong but they did them anyway and they are now testifying to that in droves before the committee and so I don't want to dwell on this with you but I don't think it's sufficient for you to avoid sharing with this committee your judgment on some of the most egregious events that are being detailed and upon the principles that are at stake because you're going to be in a position in which you may have to deal with similar instances if not identical instances especially if there are no consequences handed down for this behavior so let me just ask you two questions one is a principle based question and one is a question based upon at least one fact that has unequivocally emerged the first is a principle based question is it ever proper to withhold access to the White House or security aid as leverage to secure political help for the president senator I take my lead from senator from my home state many years ago Arthur Vandenberg who suggested that politics best stop at the water's edge and I think that goes into the conduct of our foreign policy worldwide and and that's that's the that's the dictum that I'll abide by the answer would be it would be that it is not proper would it's not something I would recommend second a fact-based question you acknowledged that presidents have relied sometimes on outside advisers both for domestic policy and foreign policy and I don't deny that there is certainly a history of relying on outside individuals to help advance the goals of the president United States but Rudy Giuliani was and still does openly advertised himself as representing the political interests of the president he does not represent that he is helping to effectuate the national security goals of this country he is unabashed in his representation that he is there to represent the political interests of his client Donald Trump and so do you believe it was proper for Rudy Giuliani to play a role in u.s. Ukraine policy senator I don't know what qualifications an individual like that would bring to these issues and as I said earlier to Senator Menendez I don't have first-hand knowledge of of what role he played or of what he was telling the president or what the president what opinions the president formed based upon what he was telling him I will tell you in my experience hmm and and all ultimately I can be judged upon as my own the record of my own experience of my own reputation I understand we will be challenged I will be challenged both on policy issues as well as issues of propriety and that would happen in any administration senator I have a a record of not interjecting politics into the foreign policy of the United States I work with a team of a dozen professionals of the State Department I don't know their politics and I don't care using somebody for any purposes other than to advance the policy is not something that I intend to pursue or would recommend pursue a listen I don't think of any other choice than to take you at your word but we have had plenty of other nominees for important posts at the State Department who have sat in that seat and testified the exact same thing to us but and then when they were confronted with these requests to put the political interests of the president before the national security interests they mate have complained privately and now they are complaining publicly but for the most part they implemented those I understand your skepticism and I understand the degree of concern you bring senator and and I want to but I will say these are more than words this is also my my my background in my experience and I did model that I followed I appreciate it let me just I won't ask you to give a long answer to this question but you and I have talked about the really damaging de munition in US diplomatic presence in Iraq we had 2,000 diplomats there in 2012 which is a very dangerous time today reportedly we have 15 State Department officials working directly on core diplomatic functions and it is not coincidental that Iraq is beginning to unravel as the United States has pulled out it is no longer justified based on security threats to have this minimal presence because we had even greater security threats confronting our diplomatic personnel for long portions of our time in Iraq we need to find a way to get our folks back into Baghdad before we lose everything that we have gained in that country can you at least today just commit to me I mean there's news that this is permanent that the secretary has made a decision that we are just out of Baghdad and that would be disastrous for US national security interests can you just make a commitment to give a very hard look at our presence in Baghdad and see if there is a way to get our people back in I do I will sir thank you thank you mister

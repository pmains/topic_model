really great i appreciate that so much we're hearing reports of seniors that rely on the postal service to get their medication normally that medication comes in 24-48 hours now it's taking up upwards of a week to two weeks additional to get those medications i don't need to tell anyone on this call the difference that time difference can be a matter of life and death for a senior that relies on that incredibly important uh medication uh seniors that need to get their social security check they rely on a social security tech that could be a lifesaver as well if that's check coming a week to two weeks later um that could be a huge difference particularly on the issue of housing in terms of losing their uh uh their housing uh if this uh uh continues and i did want to talk we i mentioned earlier we have the great hopi chairman on the on the call i don't think a lot of people understand here in arizona or across the country uh how important the postal service is for people living on the travel reservations and when there's a delay in the mail to everyone how that will disproportionately impact tribal communities so mr chairman maybe you could talk about how delays in the postal service would impact members of your tribe thank you congressman stanton and congressman o'halloran and i do want to thank you for the i'm humbled by the kind introduction that you're able to give me as well um it does definitely have an impact the trump administration has made it clear that they want to defund the united states postal service i i'm unclear why because it provides such a critical service to indian country and many other rural communities across america and when we're talking about the funding we're fortunate to have you know the postal service out here that you know for our tribe has been reliant on for as long as i've been alive out here on hopi and if we come across this and i i just want to note that i was you know happy to have participated in the indian country preview of the democratic national convention yesterday evening and uh all across the board it was uh uh just a consensus on you know everybody speaking to the fact that this is the most important vote that's probably going to be taking place in our lifetime right now so when i look at the vital part of the postal service and you know if that's impacted you mentioned it earlier that it is under attack and for us out here in rural uh arizona it makes things difficult because we don't quite have that infrastructure to you know navigate around certain uh times with our executive orders and our mandates in place uh that's one of the outlets in order to get that done so in a sense you know this nation was built on those very freedoms those constitutional rights that we have in place to voice uh our opinions and you know uh being able to vote for our elected leaders and that's going to in a way silence us you know so it has a huge impact on here you mentioned the fact that we um about medication we have the reliance on you know the postal service to provide that so it really does come down to a matter of life and death when you're waiting on specific medications that is your lifeline to you know making sure that you're moving forward the next day so overall overarching you know this just has a huge impact in i i'm really concerned about the direction it's going so very happy to hear uh what the speaker pelosi has done here to initiate that and i appreciate the support from uh all your colleagues engaged in this as well because this is a huge uh position that the democratic party is taking here to make sure the funding is provided across the board um and i appreciate uh postmaster clark's uh comments here and i just need chairman i'm i'm just a letter carrier 36 years the postmaster would be uh a title of postal management um i'm a working man a letter carrier a mailman the man delivering the mail but i appreciate that then i wish i would get that rate of pay as a postmaster thank you well in my eyes everybody out here is a vital component that you know really needs to carry that uh you know a particular title for themselves and i i reference that because i am you know i just want to note our postal carriers out here uh through whatever weather conditions that they have and out here in uh hopi it's definitely challenging so if you haven't had an opportunity to see what our postal delivery employees go through it's it's definitely eye-opening but all across america i think you know we'd probably have a consensus among indian communities on how this is definitely going to have an impact on you know those that are reliant on a lot of these you know to the services provided by the post office so uh congressman stanton um that's just uh you know a quick broad overview on the impacts to hopi i we still use them today it's still a big part of our daily routine to check the mail we have bills that still come in so if that's delayed um gosh you know i mean where is that going to leave us with you know the additional fees on top of that for having to take care of some of these things for the simple fact that the postal service is a vital component out here on hopi and we want to support um you know the movement in getting the additional funding and you know put things where they need to be it just alarms me that um louis de joy is you know has taken a different position and uh we do support our postal uh service and we want to be supportive of that and that's the reason why i'm here speaking to that as well i appreciate that so much uh this is ultimately i oh go ahead tom go ahead please i just wanted to ask the chairman uh is there a real need for postal service now because you have such good broadband out there that rural america and rural the tribal lands have broadband that they don't need the postal service anymore right yeah yeah yeah we're trying to keep that under the wraps the congressman congress not out of the bag but i i appreciate your humor and in a perfect world we'd have both to lean on but uh you know that's a whole nother another issue but uh most definitely the postal service is a vital component you know part of that heartbeat is you know that service that's given to our community certainly democrats are pushing hard both for full funding the united states postal service and for 80 billion dollars so that we can get broadband across rural america and our tribal communities but neither of them are partisan issues because guess what both republicans and democrats like getting their mail on time and both republicans and democrats like to use the internet and want high-speed internet so they can run their business or have their kids get a better education through online learning etc so i don't know some of these are treated with partisan issues but this really is a nonpartisan issue everybody wants their mail on time and on the issue of voting of course uh i don't know a lot of people don't realize you know some of the hopi and a navajo people live you know not in large clusters of people they live far away from voting locations and so the mail realistically is the way that they're going to participate in the election so not having timely mail can make all the difference about whether members of the hopi tribe actually participate in the election yeah congressman if i could just respond to that real quick you bring up a very important point because of the covet 19 we still have our executive orders uh with the stay-at-home mandate which is limiting our movement out here and there is some flexibility in that but our people for the right reasons are still afraid of you know going outside their respective communities and uh you know that does you know put that reliance on the mail and ballot as an option opposed to you know yeah the the distances we have to travel in order to get to uh polling sites um and that's even been limited out here right now so it puts that emphasis back on the importance of the postal service for not only hopi communities but our sister tribes that i would imagine are sharing some of the same concerns yeah because this is a very important time to be putting in that vote so that's a very important uh fact that you bring up

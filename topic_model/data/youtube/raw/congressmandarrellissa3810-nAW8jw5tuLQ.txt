this week Californians used the ballot box to vote to go back to work in California's 25th congressional seat a seat held by Katie hill until her disgrace and resignation they went from voting nine points for Democrats to voting double digits for the Republican Mike Garcia he was inspirational and he believes as I do that getting safely back to work is something we should be doing now not three months from now as the governor has suggest as we speak the governor is breaking his promise and delaying a return to work I call on the governor to stop the slow walking and the suffering of Californians more than 25% of our workforce is unemployed even more virtually all of our workforce are going to earn far less this year than last year and yet governor Newsom has spent most of the time talking about his budget problem and demanding that the federal government print money to make up for lost revenue that is primarily being lost because of his inaction take for example Tesla up in Fremont California here is one of the best-known industry leaders who says I can safely put my people back to work let me show you how and instead the governor has said oh I can't order the county to send you back to work the reality is it is the governor's stay-at-home order and has continued pushing and threatening all throughout the state counties who don't comply with his demand that they in fact keep people unemployed it's time to get people back to work to the greatest extent possible protect our seniors and others by using protective masks and the like but let's get people back to work we know that's what they want we know they voted this week for just that

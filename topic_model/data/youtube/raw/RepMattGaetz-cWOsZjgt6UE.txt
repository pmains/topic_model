I'll just share with you the story of why I don't have any confidence in Jeff Sessions it was July of 2017 and after taking just relentless incoming from the Democrats regarding Oh Trump rush Michael Flynn all the stuff we now know to be nonsense after all that was going on you had a desire from House Republicans to actually start punching back Jeff Sessions calls a meeting he calls you know those of us like Jordan myself over to the Department of Justice it was my first time going over there so that we could talk through what he believed was the right use of the department in in bringing people to account and whether or not there would be a double standard you know one for the President and one for you know those who were viewed as untouchable because they were part of permanent Washington so we go over there and I mean it was just like you know how you just walk into a room sometimes and you could tell who's in charge and who isn't and almost all of us to a person on the Congressional side like got the sense that the inmates were running the asylum over there that the Department of Justice the Jeff session wasn't the leader that he was like you know an employee over there I mean as some of the deputies and as some of the bureaucrats and as some of the permanent Department people were lecturing us about why they weren't going to do what we asked and apply the same standard to both sides of the 2016 presidential election jeff sessions was literally standing over in the corner asking if people wanted sugar with their coffee and tea now again kind southern gentleman good guy but like that is not the person you want running the Department of Justice especially at a time when people were trying to weaponize elements of the FBI in the Department of Justice against the duly elected president the United States

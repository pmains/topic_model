. THANK YOU. JOINING US NOW WE HAVE THE CHAIR OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK  CAUCUS, CONGRESSMAN STEVEN  HORSFORD OF NEVADA. THANK YOU FOR BEING ON. I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS TRYING  TO GET THE ARMS AROUND WHAT  HAPPENED HERE. THERE'S TALK ABOUT THE CULTURE  OF POLICING IN MEMPHIS ITSELF. NOT DECISION AGREEMENT ABOUT  WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT VIDEOTAPE. THAT IT WAS A MURDER. QUESTIONS ABOUT IF IT WASN'T  JUST FIVE OFFICERS BUT OTHERS  FAILING TO DE-ESCALATE. SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT  POLICING. WHAT DO YOU THINK CAN BE DONE IN CONGRESS ABOUT A PROBLEM THAT  SEEMS TO RUN SO DEEP, IS  COURSING THROUGH THE VEINS OF A  POLICE DEPARTMENT? >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND  IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD  AGREE BAD POLICING IN THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT EXIST. IT DOES GO TO THE ROOT OF THE  CULTURE OF POLICING BUT AS YOU  JUST NOTED IN THE PRIOR SEGMENT  THEY DISBANDED THIS SPECIAL UNIT IN MEMPHIS WHILE DATA SHOWS THAT THAT UNIT AND THE DEPARTMENT  ACTUALLY HAD THREE TIMES AS MANY STOPS FOR EXCESSIVE FORCE  AGAINST BLACK RESIDENTS THAN  THEY DID AGAINST WHITE  RESIDENTS. THAT IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF WHAT  WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AS A  CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND  OTHERS. YES, IT IS TIME FOR CONGRESS TO  ACT. THAT'S WHY I SPOKE TO THE  NICHOLS FAMILY YESTERDAY. I MADE SURE THAT THEY KNEW THAT  WE ARE STANDING WITH THEM ON  THIS IMPORTANT MATTER. WE SEND OUR CONDOLENCES FOR THE  LOSS OF THEIR SON TYRE BUT WE  ARE GOING TO TAKE ACTION. IT IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE PRESIDENT KNOWS THAT THIS IS AN  ISSUE TO TALK ABOUT AT THE STATE OF THE UNION. I HAVE INVITED THE NICHOLS  FAMILY AS THE GUEST OF THE  CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS SO  THEY WILL BE THERE TO HEAR FROM  THE PRESIDENT AND THE MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS ON HOW WE'LL TAKE  ACTION TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY  SAFE.  >> MR. CHAIRMAN, AS YOU TALK  ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS,  THE STATE OF THE UNION AND THE  BLACK CAUCUS' ACTS FOR MEETING  WITH THEM BEFORE THAT, CIVIL  RIGHTS LEADERS ASKING FOR THAT  TODAY. EIGHT ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORKED  TOWARD THE GEORGE FLOYD BILL AND MET WITH HIM WANT TO SEE HIM  BEFORE THAT. I WAS ON THE CALL WITH YOU AND  THE FAMILY LAST NIGHT AGREEING  TO COME TO THE STATE OF THE  UNION. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT NOW TO GET  THE CONGRESS, THE HOUSE AND THE  SENATE, TO DEAL WITH POLICE  REFORM IN A REAL WAY THAT CAN  PASS SO THAT WE DO NOT END UP  FRUSTRATING PEOPLE AGAIN BY  GETTING ALMOST THERE AS WE DID  WITH GEORGE FLOYD? THE WHOLE WORLD SAID THIS WAS A  MOMENT OF INFLECTION AND WE CAN  MOVE FORWARD AND DIDN'T HAPPEN. HOW DO WE AND YOU AND THE  CAUCUS -- 58 MEMBERS. HOW CAN YOU IMPACT YOUR  COLLEAGUES THAT WE MUST PASS  REAL LEGISLATION IN THIS MOMENT? >> THANK YOU, REVEREND SHARPTON, THANK YOU FOR HAVING BRING US  TOGETHER WITH THE FAMILY FOR  THAT IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND  TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW THAT WE  ARE STANDING WITH THEM. THEY SAID WE WANT ACTION,  MEANINGFUL ACTION. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? FIRST IS REACHING OUT TO SENATOR TOM SCOTT TO INITIATE  NEGOTIATIONS ON PRINCIPLES  AROUND THE GEORGE FLOYD JUSTICE  AND POLICING ACT. THE PRESIDENT, THE WHITE HOUSE  HAS REACHED OUT TO INDICATE  THEIR DESIRE TO MEET ON THIS  IMPORTANT ISSUE AND WE ARE  WORKING WITH OUTSIDE GROUPS TO  MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS  NOW IS THE TIME FOR ACTION. THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE BEING SAFE. TYRE WAS A SON. HE WAS A FATHER. HE HAD A PURPOSE AND A PASSION. HE LOVED SKATEBOARDING AEN THE  SUNSETS AND PHOTOGRAPHING THEM. HE WAS ONLY 80 YARDS FROM HIS  MOTHER'S HOUSE AFTER LEAVING A  SUNSET. HE SHOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. THERE IS NO ACTION THAT CONDONES WHAT HAPPENED IN MEMPHIS BUT IT  IS NOT ONLY WHAT HAPPENS IN  MEMPHIS BUT WHAT HAPPENS ACROSS  THIS COUNTRY VIRTUALLY EVERY  SINGLE DAY. WE'LL WORK IN A BIPARTISAN WAY  IN HIS LEGACY AND SO MANY OTHER  LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST. IT IS TIME FOR ACTION NOW.  >> CHAIR OF THE CONGRESSIONAL  BLACK CAUCUS, CONGRESSMAN STEVEN HORSFO

thank you for your comments about wanting to get information to Congress and answer our questions Rex Tillerson you're the secretary secretary was here on June 14th and of course we only get five minutes and a lot of us have a lot more questions than that that's why we have questions for the record but the questions for the record for the June 14th hearing haven't been answered yet I wonder if you could commit to having the June 14th questions answered the vast majority of them by October 15th and all of them by October 31st well I think I can do better than that congressman Sherman I believe I heard this morning on my way up and it is strictly a coincidence I assure you that those questions those responses were provided this morning so if there if there are any that are outstanding I will make sure that they're I am eagerly awaiting one of those and that is I asked your submitting a budget that involves drastic cuts and the secretary agreed to say what he how he would propose spending 10 or 20 or 30 percent more money than the administration was was asking forks because that would give Congress the the expert view or the at least the executive branch view of not only how to spend the amount of money you're talking about but if we decide how we would allocate more and I hope that you can commit to answer the the qf RS for this hearing within 30 days can you do that absolutely this reorganization plan I hope is not a cover for cuts or a reason to delay filling posts you know others have asked you about that delay and when it comes to the the administration has a muscular tone in its foreign policy sanctions are an important part of that sanctions are very labor-intensive it's not a matter of just giving a speech at a rally it's a matter of convincing a Danish or a Dutch bank or government on this deal or that deal and I would hope that you and and the secretary would convince the president that a muscular foreign policy requires a fully staffed State Department we Tom Lantos was our Chairman here he pushed forward legislation that created the glow the special envoy on global anti-semitism I know your department is committed to filling that post can we count on that being filled fairly soon you have my word on that congressman if I don't it's it's it's a it's my it's my fault and I assure you it will be filled promptly okay now there has been a report of a plan to transfer the bureau's of population refugee and migration and counselor Affairs to the Department of Homeland Security can you put those rumors to rest I can you know that's not under consideration it's not under consideration that is a great answer we have all around the world counsel it's the council it's report to the embassy and the embassy reports to Washington the one exception to that is our councilor in East Jerusalem and I wonder whether part of your reorganization could be to have the same policy there as everywhere else and have the council in and East Jerusalem report to the to the embassy well the issue of our embassy in Israel is you know yeah I'm not asking that a bigger question about moving the embassy to Jerusalem I'm just assuming we keep the facilities that we have now would the council at in East Jerusalem report to the embassy which is currently located in Tel Aviv we would sir I would certainly take that under advisement congressman the department you know not everything that relates to foreign policy can be in the State Department I would hope that you would provide guidance says you have a process of doing to the BBG the broadcasting Board of Governors about the importance of broadcasting in the regional languages of Pakistan I don't have to tell you that this is one of the while North Korea has one language Pakistan has several and if you're trying to reach the population of this important country with over 100 nuclear weapons you can't just broadcast it or do and and and Pashto and finally I'm gonna ask you to convey to the secretary of the Treasury or the assistant secretary for Tax Policy the importance in they have to allocate their time and where didn't negotiate a tax treaty and they've been doing it on kind of a paint-by-numbers basis how big is the GDP of this country or whatever ignoring the geopolitics and there are places in the world who are having a tax treaty furthers the objectives of the State Department and your assistant secretary of Europe testified in a smaller hearing but having a tax treaty with Armenia is is it is important geopolitically and I hope we can get that influence over to the Treasury Department okay we'll go to Joe

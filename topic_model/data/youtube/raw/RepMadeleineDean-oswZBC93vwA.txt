well here for more is democratic congresswoman madeleine dean of pennsylvania congresswoman thank you very much for joining us a month ago there was real panic about whether or not congress could pass another relief bill you haven't where has the sense of urgency gone well the sense of urgency is not gone and i'm talking about my constituents who are saying please you must send us more relief uh we passed you know the the house passed on may the 15th the heroes act a much needed robust more than three billion dollar bill uh that would send relief directly to our state and local governments to our territories uh and yet uh the senate has sat on its hands negotiations have been ongoing i uh learned from uh senator schumer and speaker pelosi today they have broken down yet again because this president is not interested in sending more relief he simply does not see the pain of others he does not take any responsibility for more than 191 000 americans dead from this virus and in fact we now know uh he's lied about it publicly to us congresswoman you mentioned the senate but it was democrats in the senate today who killed the latest attempt i know you want to go big but surely at this point something is better than nothing what was left out in the skinny package as the senate senate's package was called uh was any support for state and local government that is simply unacceptable what was left out was support for the postal service in a cynical move this president has tried to dismantle the postal service in order to try to steal this election i think it's ill-advised it's cynically corrupt so it it was proper that i believe senate democrats said no we won't pass a whiff of a bill and pretend to go home having helped our state and local governments we simply won't do that talking about the um postal service there is real concern that election night is going to turn into election week possibly election month how does joe biden handle that if on november the 4th there is still no result but it's possible because of the way people vote it looks like a trump win i think and know that vice president biden will handle it with ease and calm and with confidence uh this will not be the first time that an election was not called or decided on election eve and now with a pandemic with male invaliding it will take a while to count these ballots so what i'm trying to tell my constituents and ask everyone to message is number one have full confidence in your ability to vote and be sure to take that responsibility very seriously and number two we have been here before wait for the tally we will get it done you can look back to the kennedy nixon election you can look back to gore v bush in 2000 and before my time you could look at truman dewey so we have a system that will count these votes we will get an accurate tally and we will have a declared winner i believe it will be bush excuse me biden and harris your state of pennsylvania voted for president obama um and then president trump in 2016. i was in bethlehem a couple of weeks ago i spoke to a lot of republicans who say they still will vote for president trump in 50 days time how worried are you i'm not worried i believe what we have to do is continue to get the message out and and sadly the president helps us with that with the revelation of his lying to the american public about a deadly virus i wonder if those all those same republicans in bethlehem will feel that that is the appropriate vote so i i'm not worried i do believe that biden and harris will be here in pennsylvania an awful lot as they should be this is really his second home state and so we prize him as one of our native sons and when we lost in 2016 that is when hillary clinton and the democrats lost it was by 44 000 votes statewide what i hope we do is that pennsylvania becomes the keystone state again and we have such an overwhelming vote tally uh for our vice president to become our president biden that pennsylvania will be an incredible deciding state we shall see congresswoman madeline dean thank you very much indeed for joining

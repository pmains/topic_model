mr. speaker four days ago on july 4th a young man was murdered just a mile from here in broad daylight on a crowded subway that young man was kevin joseph Sutherland 24 years old he was my campaign volunteer my intern and my friend maybe that's unremarkable violence seems to be a part of who we are and all to present with us but I want to tell this house that Kevin was in Washington because he believed the best of us each one of us he believed that we could come together he believed that we can set aside our petty prejudices he believed that we could bring our voices together in this chamber and make a better world I think there's a chance that 20 years from now Kevin might have served in this chamber now that's not going to happen but Kevin spirit of openness of optimism of possible that spirit must live on in this chamber and in our hearts thank you Kevin

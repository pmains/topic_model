Durham former prosecutor he now will look into the beginnings of all of this the FBI's ties etc etc in this case also we have the inspector general Horowitz we have John Huber his report the Attorney General's longer investigation and deeper into the investigation into both the rigged in bet rigged election of Hillary and for rigged investigation of Hillary the FISA abuse and the abuse of power that happened thereafter never mind the well intelligence community surveilling unmasking American citizens and leaking raw intelligence well look I think it is a good development that the Attorney General has assigned a US Attorney to investigate the the origins of the Obama administration surveilling the truck the the Trump campaign it is a very dangerous thing when law enforcement or the intelligence community is used as a political weapon when it's used to target your political adversaries I'll tell you as I travel Texas I hear from Texans all over the state how come there's no accountability how come the Obama administration was able to weaponize the Department of Justice and the intelligence world the FBI I'm very glad Attorney General Barr it is demanding some accountability we need to investigate it we needed to investigate how politicized it was and in particular we need to see what were the roles of the political appointees who signed off on it was was it Loretta Lynch was a John Brennan what was it Joe Biden was it President Obama himself that kind of accountability we need to know when the public deserves answer senator let me let me pick your legal mind for just a second you you with the national debate champion and I don't think anyone can really we've we watched you debate before or you can tell it was one of the cool kids in college yob viously i was not a part of the club but on a serious note you convinced the Espionage Act was violated by Hillary are you convinced the intent of destroying those emails was to cover up an underlying crime and and eliminate the evidence are you convinced the FISA courts that a fraud was committed by omission and using the fake phony dossier the Russian dossier and you convinced it was an effort by deep state operatives to undo a presidential election after they tried to rig it listen there there are serious and concerning evidence underlying every one of those that those issues you laid out when it comes to Hillary Clinton and her use of emails her violation of the the laws concerning keeping classified documents classified that there appears to be even James Comey as politicized as he was called it gross negligence but there's also very deliberately an effort to destroy evidence an effort to smash phones with hammers and using bleach bit as you mentioned just a minute ago to erase hard drives I mean that's typically conduct that that events is a guilty conscience trying to hide criminal conduct and we need to have accountability we need to have accountability for each and every person who violated the law law enforcement should be nonpartisan it shouldn't be a political weapon used against those who happen to be on the other side

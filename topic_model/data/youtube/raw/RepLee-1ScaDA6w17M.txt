as we turn now to Washington DC as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are calling for a pause in the u.s. program accepting Syrian refugees I want to bring into the conversation Congress member barbara Lee of California your response to the crackdown now twenty seven governors are saying they will not accept Syrian refugees in fact your theory Peter Boogaard around the finding of the Syrian passport the false passport in one of the gunmen in Paris I think Isis one at that passport to be found they hate these refugees more than anybody in Europe because these refugees are fleeing from their self-declared caliphate they would love it if we shut the door on these refugees it's pure propaganda value for Isis if we do so Congress member barbara Lee what is being called for in Congress your response to the house speaker well there's some who are calling for a halt I believe speaker Ryan wants us to as he said put a pause in our refugee policy and resettlement policy but I have to just say this moment really tests the character of our nation Amy when you look at the vetting process the investigations the screening the background checks that occur as it relates to refugees especially Syrian refugees this can take up to two years Homeland Security is very thorough I am on the Appropriations Committee and we'd support and want to work to make sure Homeland Security has all the resources that it needs but I have to say that to put a halt into allowing people to come in who are widows who are children who are fleeing horrific circumstances that's not who we are as a country and there many of us who are not going to accept this type of move to really put a halt in this program this is the mo when we have to step up as a country and demonstrate to the world who we are and we do have to issue I mean we do have excuse me our overall national security issues and difficulties that we have to address but we must step up as leaders and address them in a way that is American that's the american way to do this and congresswoman Lee your response to the fact that the this huge refugee crisis the responsibility of the United States giving that the refugees are largely coming from Syria Iraq and Afghanistan precisely the countries that our government was involved in military interventions and occupations of and and had now has led to this chaos and extremism in their own lands well 14 years ago I voted against the blank check that authorizes the use of force that created the conditions for what we see today this was the wrong approach I believe we see that the military actions have not made the world any safer and in fact we need to really begin to look at our overall strategy and look at what is what are the underlying causes and reasons for all of this chaos and all this violence that does not mean that we do not intend to deal with Isis and any other terrorist group we can't look at the world through rose-colored glasses we have to have a comprehensive strategy that's going to dismantle and defeat Isis but that doesn't mean we create war and more violence and more conditions that cause people to continue to flee so we have to go back to the drawing board i believe and really come up with a reasonable rational strategy also let me say that we have not had a debate we have not had a new authorization to use force we have not done our jobs as members of Congress to authorize these new wars and so we need at this point I think a full debate on the options the alternatives the costs and the consequences but minimally we should not prevent people friend from from countries that are war-torn from coming to our country we have very strong strict veste gated processes we do background checks Homeland Security if they need more resources of course I would support more resources I think many members would but we can't allow the character and the values of our nation change under such a terrible crisis that's taking place Congress member barbara Lee we want to go back to that moment 14 years ago when you cast the sole dissenting vote against the US invasion of Afghanistan let's go back to that speech three days after September 11th attacks September 11th changed the world our deepest fear is now haunt us yet I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States this is a very complex and complicated matter now this resolution will pass although we all know that the president can wage a war even without it however difficult this vote may be some of us must urge the use of restraint our country is in a state of mourning some of us must say let's step back for a moment let's just pause just for a minute and think through the implications of our actions today so that this does not spiral out of control now I have agonized over this vote but I came to grips with it today and I came to grips with opposing this resolution during the very painful yet very beautiful memorial service as a member of the clergy so eloquently said as we act let us not become the evil that we deplore that was California Congress member barbara Lee speaking on September 14 2001 three days after the 911 attacks Congress member Lee you're now calling on Congress to repeal the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for military force saying they've been used blank checks for endless war can you talk about who's joining you in this call when you made that speech 14 years ago you got death threats you had to get security around you Amy those were very difficult days we had been under a terrible attack we lost many many people my chief of staff's cousin Wanda green unfortunate was on fight 93 we lost Wanda and all of the victims of the horrific attacks of 911 we still think about pray for and wonder how this could happen and so believe you me during that moment we had I believe then the chance to really step out continue with our morning and anger but as members of Congress try to come up with some rational approach to address terrorism in a way that did not cause more Wars more terrorist attacks and more violence having said that then the rock resolution came forward the next year with this resolution as the basis for the Iraq resolution and at this point we asked the Congressional Research Service last year and Amy to conduct a survey for us it's unclassified to determine when and where these authorizations have been used well over 30 sometimes they've been used in Somalia and Yemen all around the world for the use of force or for other types of indeterminate detentions Guantanamo wiretaps you name it and so we need to go back now this is a new day this is another war that the United States is in and in fact I think the public is demanding that we debate this look at the costs and consequences debate whether or not we should authorize another use of course I'm not saying we should or should not but minimally our constitutional responsibility warrants that we do that now we have many members of Congress who have supported this effort I mean we sometimes I have amendments to the appropriate bills and I that would say let's repeal these authorizations congressman McGovern congressman Jones others by pardon in a bipartisan way have stepped up and offered these amendments and we probably get between 150 and 170 votes well you know in the house it takes about two hundred it takes 218 votes and we have not gotten to that point yet but I believe the more we talk about it the more the public is going to demand that they understand what is taking place and engage in and make us engage in doing our jobs the proper way and engage in a debate because three days after the horrific attacks of 911 I think we had a one hour debate Amy on the use of force that to me was just wrong it dicated our responsibility we should have waited we should have assessed what took place and come up with a comprehensive strategy in our response to 911 so I think we need to really go back now and have that debate that we never had before quite frankly and the congresswoman Lee yours your assessment of how President Obama is dealing with the situation currently obviously he came into office vowing to end the wars in the Middle East he's now extended the troops ground troops in Afghanistan through the end of his term and reinserted 50 more or 50 ground troops now into Syria your sense of how he's dealing with things well first he certainly has shifted direction from the Bush administration of course I am extremely concerned about the additional troops I don't support the use of ground troops we understand this has got to be a regionally led commitment to dismantled and disabled and and rid the world quite frankly of Isis but it's got to be regionally lit so I think the president is is trying to calibrate this in a way that and he has said he's not going to send ground troops in but I don't want to see this mission creep occur on his watch and he did send forward a resolution Speaker Boehner last year for us to debate and to vote on and Speaker Boehner never brought this resolution before us and so we've never even had a chance to look at what the president has done is doing and really have Congress either back it or not back it and so I think what the president is saying now though is very important when he talks about the refugee crisis and how we should not shift our policy and how we need to continue to step up and do the right thing as Americans and so the president I think it needs to have Congress weigh in on on his strategy because if we don't weigh in we've abdicated our responsibility to the administration and you know then the public will never know what Congress is will which would be there will would be as it relates to the escalation of the use of force in the region which we have not authorized the US is just sealed the Obama administration yet another arms deal with Saudi Arabia in the last year signed the biggest arms deals in the history of the world with Saudi Arabia the Saudi Arabia behind a lot of the militant activism from al-qaeda to Isis can you do you condemn these sales well first we need to reduce the sale of arms throughout the world also I think when you look at the friends example trying to rid Iran of of the ability to develop nuclear weapons we engaged in a strong robust diplomatic effort many years ago I introduced the first resolution calling for the end of no-contact policy for a special envoy and for us to begin to negotiate with Iran the the elimination of their program of developing nuclear weapons so far those negotiations and that Iranian deal has worked and so I think that we need to move in that direction in terms of diplomacy in terms of trying to seek global peace and security without selling arms to all countries because what you will have is and arms build-up throughout the world and then weapons will be pointed at each country will have weapons of course nuclear weapons the ultimate weapon appointed in all directions and and so we need to determine ways as the president has done with regard to Iran ways in which to engage to reduce the threats and to reduce the the sale and the use of force and armaments and military weapons because these can only make the world more dangerous and I'm wondering what advice you might have to parliamentarians in France now as Frances going through the same kind of crisis that this country went through after after the attacks of 2001 the the president is now seeking authorization for the French parliament for extraordinary measures in his country what what advice might you give to the parliamentarians of France but first my thoughts and prayers go out to the people of France they're really in a moment of sorrow and pain we feel the tragedy and the pain that they're suffering through of course Frances one of our oldest is our oldest ally and and we have many many connections many relationships our foreign policy we have many similarities to the French people and so we have to really feel what is taking place and support the French people throughout this this terrible difficult moment my only suggestion would be to debate this to listen to look at all of the alternatives and to not rush to judgment whatever the Parliament decides I think it takes a method methodology and strategy that really will keep the country safe and they will ensure that the violence is reduced rather than engage in actions that would create more havoc and more violence but I tell you that's up to the French parliament and the French people to determine how best they want to respond as country if War were not an option Congress member Lee the u.s. spending actually trillions of dollars on war when you look at all of the costs including soldiers coming home deeply wounded and being cared for for the rest of their lives not to mention the havoc on the ground in the middle east from Afghanistan to Iraq and Syria what is the option what is the foreign policy that you would design foreign policy that I would design and I have legislation that sort of sets out for example what a road map to a strategy in the Middle East would be as it relates to Isis and that's looking at not the military option as the first option Amy that's always going to be there but looking at how we can support and enhance a regionally lead strategy that would lead to a political and diplomatic settlement people have to be empowered they have to feel that that their countries are including them in the government and in all of the development and and the fabric of their governments that's not happening in many countries in the world and so we have to have a regionally led strategy and my legislation lays that out of course as I said earlier the military option is going to always be there we can't say that the use of force or the military action is never acceptable but we have to try other methods first if we really want to achieve global peace and security and I think that's what many members of Congress are saying regardless of the extremely right-wing responses we have to as leaders really lay out a vision and an alternative and hopefully have a debate on what those alternatives are because our veterans have come home many can't even get a job many are homeless I'm the daughter of a veteran and Amy I'm telling you we our veterans have paid us a very heavy price they served this country well they've done everything we've asked them to do yet we cannot seem to figure out ways to ensure their health their mental health their security of course we've done much better under this administration and when of course as I have to say when speaker Pelosi was speaker during those years we did invest more in our veterans and in their security economic security health care and mental health we haven't done everything we should do and we need to do more for our veterans we need I'm on the veterans subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee and believe you me we need many more efforts and many more resources put it

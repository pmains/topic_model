I recognize the gentlelady from Ohio mrs. fudge thank you very much mr. Chairman I thank you all for being here and for your testimony I want to of course recognize our young people who are here today for foster care day thank you for being with us wanted to say that this is really kind of personal with me my uncle was a letter carrier for 42 years today I have a first cousin who's a postmaster it worked her way up through the system so I just want to put that out front for you right now director how're in your testimony you stated that the rate of compensation creates a direct disincentive your words to return to work are you aware that in this hearing room today there are letter carriers who have suffered significant traumatic injuries to their legs as they were crushed between vehicles performing their regular duties yet they have managed to return to work I don't think that that supports your proposition that they have a disincentive to return to work on page five of your testimony you state that in fiscal year 2014 fewer than 13,000 claims involved a significant period of disability you suggested eighty-eight percent of those claimants return to work within the first year of the injury and a full ninety-one percent return within the second year in fact you state that less than two percent of the 119,000 new injury cases remain on the long-term compensation rules so it does not appear to me that your statement would run in direct contradiction to your claims it just doesn't make any sense mr. Watson do you agree with the department's assessment that injured workers are looking for a disincentive to return to work I do not agree with that my experience has been that the big problem letter carriers face is convincing the pulse service to let them come back to work when they remain disabled from their letter carrier job that's a huge problem for us it's not my experience at all what you said as well could you tell us what role fika has played in assisting the workers that account that accompanied you today and others like them mr. Watson I'm sorry would you repeat that they could you tell us how fika has played a role in assisting the workers that you brought with you today yes as the law exists right now there are restoration rights to injured workers who partially recover as well as fully recover from their injuries but Department of Labor does not exercise authority over those restoration rights instead it's OPM who has authority over the restoration rights so for example if department of labor issues an adverse decision regarding a claim an employee can appeal within OWCP within Department of Labor but if an employee disagrees with an agency decision regarding restoration they cannot appeal to a wcp they have to appeal to the MSPB the mayor systems protection board and so there's this separation between OWCP Zathura T and injured employees trying to get back to work unsuccessfully I think that Congress could look at that that discrepancy and considered doing something about it now it's just so interesting to me that we have employees who want to go back to work and they will let them come back very different from everything that we've been hearing in these reports I just want to say to the letter carriers who are here I appreciate what you do every day you know people talk about they want to privatize the postal service there is no other group of people who are required to deliver to every house every day but you so we appreciate what you do I thank you and I yield back mr. chairman

, MR. PALLONE? THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEB IS RECOGNIZED. MR. SMITH: I WANT TO BE BRIEF IN MY REMARKS HERE. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE HEARD SEVERAL CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. I WOULD CERTAINLY SHARE THOSE CONCERNS. I DO THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE THAT IS IMPORTANT ACROSS AMERICA. AND THINK THAT WE SHOULD NEXT TIME AVOID THE FACT THAT THIS BILL WAS BROUGHT UP SO QUICKLY, SECRET, OUTSIDE THE COMMITTEES OF JURISDICTION ALL THIS TAKING PLACE. NEITHER OUTSTAYED STAKEHOLDERS NOR MEMBERS WHO WORKEDDENCE TENSIVELY ON TELEHEALTH POLICY WERE CONSULTED AS FAR AS I COULD TELL. THE CLOSED RULE UNDER WHICH THIS IS BEING CONSIDERED HAS PRECLUDED ANY OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE OR AMEND THE BILL. AN ISSUE THAT'S IMPORTANT DESERVES AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT FOLLOWS REGULAR ORDER. ALLOWING MEMBERS TO OFFER INPUT AND HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT NEEDS WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED. WE CALL THIS LEGISLATING F WE WORKED TOGETHER ON THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE WITH OUR ENERGY AND COMMERCE FRIENDS, INCLUSIVE OF VARIOUS IDEAS AND INNOVATIONS, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A TRUE AND REAL BIPARTISAN BILL. AND THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AS WELL. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE TELEHEALTH EXTENSION WE ARE CONSIDERING SAID TODAY WOULD BE BETTER AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUES. BACK IN MAY I INTRODUCED A BILL, BIPARTISAN BILL, ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THIS ONE, CALLED THE CONNECTING RURAL TELEHEALTH TO THE FUTURE ACT. THAT BILL EXTENDED ALL THE PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN F.Y.22 OMNIBUS THROUGH AT LEAST 2024 AND ALSO INCLUDED PROVISIONS TO ENSURE CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TELEHEALTH SERVICES TO THEIR PATIENTS. IT ALSO CORRECTS A FLAW IN THE CARES ACT WHICH SHORTCHANGES FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINTICS WHICH OFFER TELEHEALTH SERVICES. I WOULD LIKE PERMISSION TO INTERINTO THE RECORD TWO LETTERS FROM THE NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION ANTI-NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF RURAL HEALTH CLINICS EXPRESSING THEIR SUPPORT FOR BOTH THE AIMS OF H.R. 4040 AS WELL AS THE NEED TO EXTEND CRITICAL AND RURAL HEALTH PROVISIONS FROM THE CONNECTING RURAL TELEHEALTH TO THE FUTURE BILL. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. SMITH: THANK YOU. THESE ORGANIZATIONS FULLY UNDERSTAND THE VITAL ROLE THAT RURAL HEALTH CLINICS AND CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS PLAY IN ENSURING ACCESS TO CARE FOR THOSE IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED AREAS. EVEN WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL, THE FUTURE OF TELEHEALTH AFTER THE GOVERNMENT DESIGNATED PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS UNCERTAIN. MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ASSESS WHAT HAS WORKED WELL OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED, AND WHAT CAN SAFELY BE LEFT BEHIND. WHILE I DO ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL, I HOPE IN THE FUTURE WE CAN WORK IN A TRUE BIPARTISAN FASHION UNDER REGULAR ORDER TO ADDRESS THE GAPS THAT WE KNOW EXIST IN POLICY AND SET A LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE COURSE FOR TELEHEALTH WELL BEYON

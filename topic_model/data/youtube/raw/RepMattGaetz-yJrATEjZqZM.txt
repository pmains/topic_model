I'll tell you gate she'd you've been something he's he's out there Devon right he's out there fighting Thank You Matt your team is here we're ready to work and we are inspired by our president I have observed your willingness to work with anyone I saw the Democrat Governor of New Jersey categorize the administration's response as extremely responsive I've noted on our calls that our Democrat colleagues in the house like Tom Suozzi and Jimmy Panetta have made contributions reflected in the great work that Jared is done on testing and the secretary minutiae is done that the chief has done as well but I have to say mr. president I'm deeply concerned about what we're seeing from the Democratic leadership because in the last several days they have been caught in a terrible lie not only was there no collusion we not now know that the leaders of the Democratic Party knew that there was no collusion at the beginning and willingly lied to the American people anyway now we see that they're reverting to their old playbook as we want to work together to provide provision to our people and take good ideas no matter where they come from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer just want to set up new committees to investigate rather than working together I know that even before being president you talked about the importance of the president being a great cheerleader for our country and for our economy I know it and I know in the jobs report today we can see that even the people who have been furloughed or her on unemployment now they're optimistic that this is the team that will bring America back what advice would you give us to try that half our Democrat leadership behave more like the governor's you've worked with and some of the rank-and-file colleagues who've made helpful suggestions rather than just reverting to their hatred and their lies to cover their tracks for their last settle eyes I think they've been doing it so long and gotten away with it for so long long prior to us they had that eight years the Obama eight years that have been absolutely terrible if you look at the Justice Department or what's taking place you look at the FBI and what's taking place and frankly prior to that a lot of bad things went on all we could do is keep winning and if we keep winning eventually they're going to come around one way or the other may not be in that form may not be them because I'm not sure that you could do that with them tremendous dishonesty from Schiff and from others and they know it's gonna they know these are not stupid people they know was a hoax they know better than anybody in this room it was a hoax they set it up they're not aggrieved oh I watched Schiff shifty Schiff nine inches around the neck and I watched this guy uses the world's smallest collar it but I watched him - I guess this morning talking about it he act so aggrieved so aggrieved he knows it was there he got caught and not only caught if he weren't in the halls of Congress he'd be in jail because he made up phony stories and phony speeches and phony every everything was phony he's a sick man he's really a sick man he's a corrupt politician so I wouldn't count on somebody like him but I think overall we have some really good support I've had great support from Democrat governors I would say almost all almost all and in some cases are lucky andrew cuomo the other day said that i we have done a phenomenal job that's a nice statement phenomenal that's a good word it's true but we've had great support and they gavin newsom the same thing he said something the equivalent of that so we can work with them but I think this group is perhaps beyond repair they're sick there's something wrong with them

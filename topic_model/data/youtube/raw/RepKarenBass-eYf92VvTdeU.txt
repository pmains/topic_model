good morning and welcome to the tom rook on news center here at universal city i'm conan nolan with us now is congresswoman karen bass of the 37th district of california including culver city and parts of west and south los angeles so congresswoman thanks for taking the time you're the author of the george floyd justice and policing act which passed the house and is now being negotiated in the senate one of the key provisions is to get rid of something called qualified immunity which would make it easier for someone to sue a police officer individually in civil court for alleged misconduct why is that so critical to your efforts well the bottom line with qualified immunity and a couple of other parts of the bill is the need for communities individual families to be able to hold officers accountable when their actions result in great bodily harm or death and qualified immunity is actually not a law it's a court decision it's so messy that it has come before the supreme court a couple of times in hopes that the supreme court would clarify the law and since the supreme court has not a couple of times we need to we have to do something that changes the behavior of individual officers and individual departments and so one of the things that we saw with the torture and murder of george floyd is that derek chavin was looking at the cell phone he knew he was being recorded and he didn't even care and i think one of the reasons he didn't care is because he didn't think anything was going to happen to him so senator tim scott republican of south carolina has suggested a compromise make it easier to sue the officer's police department instead of the officer himself will your side accept that well we don't know i mean right now we are definitely having discussions like i said what is most important to me is accountability and changing the culture and individual behavior of officers and so if he has some ideas we're willing to hear them but as of right now we want to make sure that qualified immunity uh stays in the bill as it passed the house well police departments are changing in a way that frankly isn't getting a lot of attention departments across the nation philadelphia portland chicago here in los angeles are seeing a surge in the number of officers who are leaving and nobody's taking their place the lapd has canceled academy classes how do you recruit for this job while at the same time telling those new recruits hey we're going to make it easier for someone to go after you in civil court and in criminal court in case you screw up no but you know what first of all if an officer is doing his or her job the way they should the way they were trained then they don't have to worry i mean that's like any profession and what one of the things that we want to do in the bill is to really elevate the profession of policing so if you think about it can you tell me another profession that has the ability to take away your freedom and take away your life with that kind of power you would think that transparency and accountability would be absolutely critical so if you go to a doctor and a doctor does something that harms you well don't you expect to have some type of recourse for that and some type of transparency so if you have a doctor that's out there that's always uh being sued or always committing malpractice you can find out about that because that's publicly known and so it's about elevating the profession of policing and i think when that happens the public opinion of police will change and people will be interested in in joining the force one thing i know for sure is if police around the country resist reforms and do not improve and elevate their profession then i won't be surprised to see people not want to come into the academy and not want to be police officers no one wants to be in a profession that everybody has disdain for let's move on to another topic california for the first time in history is going to lose a congressional seat because we've lost uh population do you believe the census was accurate oh i have no question that the census was not done accurately and but you know we who expected to be conducting a census in the middle of a pandemic and so what i wish and we actually looked to see if we could but we couldn't i thought the whole senses needed to be canceled and done over again we know that it was done poorly and i'm not saying that in terms of california but nationally the census was was done poorly and the administration the trump administration did everything they could before they left office to slow down the reporting to make it difficult remember they cut the funding we tried to put the funding in and so i have no doubt that the census is not accurate uh and finally the president talked about raising taxes on the wealthy uh to pay for his infrastructure plan saying they need to pay their fair share but billionaires are significantly taxed in california franchise tax board says the top one percent pay 50 percent of all income tax the state depends on taxing profits from investments capital gains as well so if you raise federal taxes on top of that plus because state and local taxes what's called salt can no longer be deducted from your federal taxes you could have a burden that could be the tipping point for the wealthy changing their address elon musk left larry ellison of oracle's left is that a concern well i'm one that supports us addressing salt at the same time because that hurt everybody in california to not be able to have the full deduction that we had enjoyed before and and you do remember now it's important that was only done in a way that hurt states that were majority democratic so it was just a punitive thing to do to punish us and we need to make sure that we have that back and i'm hoping that that helps representative karen bass democrat of los angeles thanks for taking the time always thanks for having me on again

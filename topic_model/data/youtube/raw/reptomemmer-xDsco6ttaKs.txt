yeah thank you my friend Chad peregriam at the Capitol with us right now is Congressman Tom emmer the Minnesota Congress he's also the House Majority Whip very big cheese in uh in Washington we're delighted to have him um thank you very much Congressman I I'm wondering now you when you're looking at a lot of the spending waste attached to coveted relief and the like uh where does it go and how do you claw the money back if you find proof of it well first you've got to figure out what happened Neil by the way thanks for having me thank you where does it go uh this is the job of the uh the Congress is to oversee what the executive branch has been doing with these different agencies have been doing in in terms of administering policy and funds that were appropriated or directed out of the the legislative branch of government uh by the way Neil this hasn't happened in four years there has been literally no oversight in the last four years so where's it go I we got our work cut out for us we're going to have to get to the bottom of this and several other issues that are pending do you know what was disturbing Congressman I know you're in the early throes of investigating this uh businesses maybe even some individuals who lied with made-up Social Security numbers and all to get the aid and the money they got it I don't know what they did with it but that's going to be a double of a time getting that money back isn't it no it it will be but again it's too early to say yes or no Neil right uh really you uh you don't even know the full extent of the problem it appears that it could be tens of billions of dollars but this committee look four years overdue uh two years overdue I guess when we're talking about these programs but at least we're getting to work uh Republicans will lead the effort I expect Democrats will come along because nobody wants to see this Fraud and Abuse taking place with taxpayer funds now for a lack of a better term uh Congressman the covet emergency we're told is over I think Republicans wanted to make that effective now the president was going to put it off I believe until uh the March 11th but bottom line it's over uh whether it's now or in in some weeks what if it reignites again what if you know covet cases start spiking again it seems unlikely but we have had these sporadic sort of spikes what do you think well I hope we've learned a lot from the last couple of years Neil I think uh you know a lot of people didn't understand what we were dealing with uh two plus years ago I think again as we start to look back as Congress starts to do its work and peel back the onion see why certain decisions were made which ones were good Neil which ones were bad I think the more important thing is we've got a president who has told us the pandemic is over and yet he's not willing to roll back the emergency declaration until May 11th Neil House Republicans actually are voting to uh to end the national emergencies based on the pandemic because it is over but again like any other public health issue I hope we have learned from the past I hope that we are better prepared for the future that's significant later than even I thought thank you for correcting me Congressman Tom emmer we'll see where that goes he is the house and majority with he has his work cut out for him to put it mildly uh in the meantime jacket Angelus on the big

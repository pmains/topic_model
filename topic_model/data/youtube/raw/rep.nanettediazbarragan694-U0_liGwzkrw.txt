miss van rosin rosin you last fall my office received a letter from your organization signed by over 100 local environmental groups calling for hearings into FERC shortcoming in reducing fossil fuel projects and how that is impacting communities across the nation this really resonates with me because communities in my district are frontline communities oftentimes black and brown that are bearing the brunt of the nation's reliance on fossil fuels can you please speak to the environmental justice issues from proposed pipelines that your organization and the communities it fights for has encountered absolutely it's a it's a very big concern that those with lesser power those that are minorities those that are from black and brown communities from indigenous communities frequently get targeted get targeted for highly polluting industrial operations including pipelines frac gas infrastructure and LNG export facilities also low in low-income communities get targeted there needs to absolutely be a reform to the process to take into consideration the very important environmental justice issues and I would say that many from the coalition that you heard from called the voices coalition that my organization Delaware River keeper Network helps lead they really would like the opportunity to come during an expanded hearing to be able to speak with the members of Congress more directly about the experiences they're having and the solutions that they've identified

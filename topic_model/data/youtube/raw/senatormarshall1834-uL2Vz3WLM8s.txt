welcome back to gma 3 on the eve of his 100th day in office here you see president biden addressing a joint session of congress in a socially distanced house chamber laying out his ambitious ambitious plan proclaiming america is ready for a takeoff and joining us with his reaction is the junior senator from kansas republican roger marshall senator marshall thank you for being with us today so i'll start off with a broad question you can answer how you like what were your big takeaways from last night's speech from president biden well you know it's no it's no fun being in the minority right and just it was a very somber night being socially distanced with mask on it just felt really really different but i'm always sitting there reaching out you know what can we agree upon and i i think that president biden and i agree on this big picture of america that we want a stronger economy we both agree that that middle america built this nation we just sometimes disagree on how to get there right so always looking for that opportunity to work together uh so where are those opportunities i mean things like expanded child care universal pre-k free community college expanded family leave some of those things it seemed like everybody could get on board with so i guess besides that is the issue really the disagreement is how are we going to pay for it well i think just the issue of how much money we're going to borrow from our grandchildren right so we're up to six trillion dollars that typically this nation spends about four and a half trillion dollars a year and we're going to attack another six a trillion on that and just frankly i don't think that the economy can take it and and just to drill down for a second we've got incredible community colleges and technical colleges in my home state of kansas they're not broken and i'm afraid if the federal government took them over and started funding them it would decrease the quality of that the preschool stuff though i'm very concerned about that i'm an obstetrician delivered you know thousands of babies and i'm very concerned uh those so many single moms out there unfortunately right now and so we do need to keep reaching out there helping those young moms helping with child care that is a huge issue and again how do we pay for it and who controls it right yeah a lot of questions and we heard from president biden last night addressing the gridlock that he faces on capitol hill and he spoke specifically about the infrastructure negotiations let's take a listen i wanted to lay out before the congress my plan before we got into the deep discussions i like to meet with those who have ideas that are different they think are better i welcome those ideas but the rest of the world is not waiting for us i just want to be clear from my perspective doing nothing is not an option senator are you all going to be able to do something are both parties going to be able to come together and get something done do you believe that i hope we can and certainly we're very sincere we put out a 600 billion dollar infrastructure plan with what we would consider very traditional infrastructure roads bridges waterways a high-speed internet that type of thing and i think we could get to some somewhere positive on that situation so we will we'll be in there fighting working together um well one other thing we want to ask about your your state how are you all doing with the so-called now vaccine hesitancy we've seen declines now and and folks who are out there trying to get the vaccine you joined some fellow republicans who also physicians with medical backgrounds and trying to encourage people to go out there and get that vaccine so what's what's behind it why are people hesitant and i hate to even bring up party but yes the polls do show a greater percentage of republicans don't necessarily want the vaccine what's going on there well i i am afraid we hit a wall and we actually hit a wall in kansas two or three weeks ago we saw this coming down the pipe and we tried to dive into this scientifically and see why and who are these people um i think that that there's a large number of folks that have a libertarian streak down their back and they happen to be mostly republicans but i think that this is their libertarian tendencies and then frankly they just don't trust the government right now they feel like they've been talked down to and just frankly not taken serious right now and really my encouragement for everybody is that if you want to live as free as you did before to go ahead and take the vaccine so we can all get back to our usual lives and and by the way we're not going to have a vaccine probably for our children until later this fall so it's for to to protect your children to get our kids in school to keep them in school we need to all get the vaccine please yeah that is all incredible encouragement i know that we feel our freedom here too once we were all fully vaccinated it's a game changer kansas senator roger marshall thank you very much for your time today we appreciate you coming on the show you bet thanks god bless all right up next right

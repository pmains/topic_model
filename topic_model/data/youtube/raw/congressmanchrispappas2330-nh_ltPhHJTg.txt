  CHRIS PAPPAS FROM NEW  HAMPSHIRE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. PAPPAS: THANK YOU, MR.   SPEAKER. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING  CHAIRMAN TAKANO AND RANKING  MEMBER BOST FOR THEIR WORK IN  PUTTING TOGETHER THIS  COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF BILLS   TODAY TO SUPPORT OUR VETERANS. INCLUDING THIS BILL. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS  LEGISLATION, THE IMPROVING V.A.  ACCOUNTABILITY TO PREVENT  SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND  DISCRIMINATION ACT, A BILL I   INTRODUCED ALONG WITH  REPRESENTATIVE HINSON. THIS BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL BILL  WILL TAKE CRITICAL STEPS TO  COMBAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY  UPDATING V.A.'S ANTI-DEBATED   POLICIES AND STRUCTURE, IN   ADDITION TO CREATING STRONGER  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  WE KNOW AT LEAST ONE IN FOUR   WOMEN AND ONE IN 10 MEN WHO  SERVED IN THE MILITARY ARE   SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,   HARASSMENT, OR ABUSE, AND AT   V.A. WE KNOW AT LEAST ONE IN   FOUR VETERANS, AND ONE IN FOUR   WOMEN EMPLOYEES EXPERIENCE   SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN HEALTH  CARE SETTINGS. IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT  SOMEONE WHO HAS PROUDLY SERVED   OUR NATION IS SUBJECTED TO   SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THE  INSTITUTION WHOSE CHARGE IT IS   TO SERVE THEM. IT IS LONG PAST THE TIME FOR US  TO MAKE SYSTEMIC CHANGE AT V.A.  THAT WILL HONOR THE SERVICE OF   OUR VETERANS AND HEALTH CARE   PROVIDERS AND KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.  THIS IS COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION  THAT CAME OUT OF AN OVERSIGHT  INVESTIGATION SUBCOMMITTEE   HEARING THAT WE HELD LAST JULY.  WE HEARD FROM G.A.O. AND V.A.  ON THIS ISSUE. AND WHILE IMPORTANT STEPS HAVE   BEEN MADE BY V.A. IN THE RECENT  PAST, THIS IS IMPORTANT  LEGISLATION THAT IS GOING TO   CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THIS   SITUATION AND MAKE THE KIND OF   LONG LASTING CHANGE THAT IS  LONG OVERDUE.

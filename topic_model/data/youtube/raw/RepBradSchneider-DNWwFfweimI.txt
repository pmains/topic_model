big day tomorrow for Attorney General Jeff Sessions he will testify before the House Judiciary Committee this comes as there are new questions about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election and what jeff Sessions knew about it a member of the House Judiciary Committee joins me now Democratic congressman Brad Snyder of Illinois thanks so much for joining us congressman you among others wrote a letter to the Attorney General saying warning him essentially you're going to ask about inconsistencies with answers that he has given mostly to the Senate over the last several months in regards to some of the Russia issues what do you mean by inconsistencies well John thank you it's good to be here this is an important hearing tomorrow it's long overdue but I'm glad the Attorney General is finally coming to the Judiciary Committee I think this is an important opportunity for the Attorney General to set the record straight there have been a pattern of changing stories changing narratives of what happened how many contacts have been between the Trump campaign administration and the Russians I think news reports are showing up to 30 documented contacts we need to understand what's there this is a chance for the Attorney General to set directed strikes set the record straight and restore his credibility he has said that he didn't know of any other contacts besides his meeting with the Russian ambassador between the Trump campaign and the Russians he was in a meeting with George papadopolis who says he suggested at the time that the president meet or than the candidate meet with Vladimir Putin also said that he had been talking to Russians do you think that the Attorney General has been telling the truth well I think that's what tomorrow's hearing will help shine a light upon that the Attorney General has changed the story multiple times already what he needs to do is set the record straight and lay out everything he did know we Nena knew it and what contacts this administration and the campaign before it had with the Russians I think that's very important Congress has his hands you know tax cuts the tax reform the Republicans are putting forward could come to a vote in the house this week the president in the Philippines just put out a statement on that and I won't read it to you he says I'm proud of the Republican House in Center for working so hard on cutting taxes and reform we're getting close now how about ending the unfair and highly on popular individual mandate and Obamacare and reducing taxes even further cut the top rate to 35% with all of the rest going to middle-income that's actually two big changes to the Republican plan if they go ahead with it getting rid of the Obamacare individual mandate and cutting the top rate from thirty nine percent to thirty five percent what impact do you think that this new statement from the president might have well I'm just hearing about the statement now but I think you see in there a consistent pattern of this president to try to undermine and take away health care for millions of Americans he's doing that again and within his proposals on the tax code is trying to give tax breaks to those who have the most and put the burden on Americans who are working the hardest and struggling the most I think that's the wrong track to go I think everyone agrees that we need tax reform but it's got to be tax reform that supports the middle class gives the middle class a break grows our economy and doesn't put our children's future at risk by increasing the debt i I think it's fair to say you weren't gonna vote for this tax plan as it was anyway so the president statements on ur are gonna make you any less likely to vote for it I just wanted to get your reaction on that I also want to get your reaction to some political commentary from Saturday Night Live that took place over this weekend now we can smile a Saturday Night Live but it's really speaking to the current state of the Democratic Party and those who are leading the party so watch this senator if you can you love our fresh new ideas delivered by fresh new faces like me Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein and me Chuck Schumer your side team came and we learned our lesson from the last election we can't just appeal to coastal elites we need mouth breathers from Wisconsin and window liquors from Ohio as well it's the first part of that statement congressman I I promoted you to the Senate you're a working member of Congress in the House of Representative so let's make that clear but the first part of that from siring live is very interesting it does point out right now that this is a there might be a generational issue right now for the Democratic Party do you think there is you know John as I travel around my district I'm talking to people who are sharing with me concern about their future their children's future they're looking for government to work to help create job opportunities that are going to raise American standard of living educational opportunities that are going to make sure our kids learn the lessons and skills they need to compete in a global 21st century economy they're looking for a message I think the Democratic Party is really delivering that we are the party of the American dream but congressman they're also looking for messengers and the question is you know are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer the right messengers right now well I believe we have a lot of messengers and Nancy Pelosi is the leader I think she has done a good job over the last year if you look where we are a year ago after the election in 2016 I think the expectation was that the Affordable Care Act which is not perfect but a step forward providing insurance to millions of Americans was going to be on the chopping block in January here we are in November and a millions of Americans still have insurance we need to address the issues address the problems stabilize the markets is a group I'm a part of called the problem solvers caucus has put forward ideas to do that but I think the broad democratic message is that we're fighting for all Americans for working Americans to have the opportunity that our parents and grandparents sacrifice to give us making sure our kids have even a better opportunity in the future you must know somebody because you're on to go committees judiciary and Foreign Affairs how would you grade the president's Asia trip as he is on the home stretch right now well I think it's too early to give the president a grade I would watch closely as he traveled to the five nations I breathe a sigh of relief that we didn't create any new crisis the president incriminated crises but you know the world is a market place not just for Commerce but for ideas and leadership I think what we're seeing with President Trump and this administration is seating in the marketplace of ideas in leadership to countries like China and Russia we need the United States to lead I believe the world is a safer place when the United States is at the front I think everyone benefits including the American people congressman Brad Snyder we look forward to watching you tomorrow in the House Judiciary Committee hearing which will take place at 10 o'clock a.m. Eastern Time right here you can see it on CNN thanks

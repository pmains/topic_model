O YIELD ONE MINUTE TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM LOUISIANA, MR. CARTER. MR. CARTER: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YIELDING, SIR. LOUISIANA HAS A SECOND HIGHEST DIABETES MORTALITY RATE, BUT ONLY THE 11TH HIGHEST NUMBER OF CASES. THE RATE OF DIABETES AMONG BLACKS, HISPANICS, AND NATIVE AMERICAN ADULTS IN THE STATE IS DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH AS COMPARED TO OTHER POPULATIONS. INSULIN IS A LIFESAVING MEDICINE. ALLOWING PEOPLE TO LIVE HEALTHY LIVES, RAISE FAMILIES, AND DO THEIR JOBS. HOWEVER, MANY CAN'T AFFORD THIS LIFE REGULATING MEDICINE. MANY LOUISIANANS HAVE TO PAY OVER $100 A VILE AND OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS EVERY SINGLE MONTH. AND SOME ARE FORCED TO RATION PRESCRIPTIONS. RISKING COMPLICATIONS OR DEATH. THE PEOPLE MUST ALWAYS COME BEFORE BIG PHARMA. TODAY WE ARE FINALLY TAKING ACTION TO CUT THE PRICE OF INSULIN. THE AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW ACT WOULD CAP OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS FOR INSULIN FOR MONTHLY SUPPLY AT $35 AND REQUIRE PLANS TO COVER DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSULIN. THE -- THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED. MR. CARTER:

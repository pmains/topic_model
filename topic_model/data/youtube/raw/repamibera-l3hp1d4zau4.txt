thank you I'd like to thank my colleagues and I'd also like to thank my colleague and fellow physician dr. Phil Roe from Tennessee for partnering with me on the disposed responsibly of pills at the drop act as a doctor I've seen firsthand the devastation of misused prescription drugs can have on families Deb cincin from Sacramento County shared her family's story with me her son became addicted to prescription medications he found in the family's medicine cabinet and by the time Deb realized what was happening he was already addicted thankfully through help and rehabilitation facilities her son recovered but far too many families suffer the tragic loss of a child and a loved one we can easily prevent this let's make it easier to dispose of medications and let's support this simple amendment thank you and I you back

. AND I KNOW YOU HAVE IT. SO I WELCOME TRACY MANN FROM THE FIRST DISTRICT OF KANSAS. MR. MANN: THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING SUCH A CHAMPION TO CONTINUE TO RAISE THIS ISSUE WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF THE MIDWEST, THE WEST COAST, THE EAST COAST, OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY. VITALLY IMPORTANT. ENJOYED THE TRIP TO WEST TEXAS THE OTHER DAY. YOU GROW MORE COTTON THAN WE DO WITHOUT A DOUBT IN KANSAS. WE'RE MORE THAN $30 TRILLION IN DEVMENT WE'VE ADDED ALMOST $6 TRILLION IN THE LAST 2 1/2 YEARS. MOSTLY IN THE NAME OF COVID. WE SPENT MORE IN THE NAME OF FIGHTING COVID THAN WE SPENT IN WORLD WAR II. IN INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS. LET THAT SINK IN. THE DEBT IS NOW $$92,000 -- IS NOW $92,000 PER AMERICAN. MY WIFE AND OUR FOUR KIDS, OUR FAMILY'S SHARE IS $552,000. AND WHEN YOU RACK UP THIS KIND OF DEBT YOU ONLY HAVE TWO CHOICES. YOU CAN EITHER PASS IT ON IN DEBT OR YOU CAN RAISE TAXES. I'M CONCERNED WITH THE POTENTIAL TAX INCREASES THAT THIS OUT OF CONTROL SPENDING WILL LEAD TO. THAT'S WHY I RISE TODAY. AMERICA IS FACING AN ECONOMIC CRISIS AND DEMOCRAT LEADERS ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH ANY REAL SOLUTIONS. INSTEAD THEY'RE JUST MAKING THINGS WORSE. TWO ASPECTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM TO THE ECONOMY AND HEALTH OF RURAL AMERICA AND HOUSE DEMOCRATS FOR THEIR PART WANT TO DISTRACT THE FEDERAL RESERVE WHILE INFLATION IS AT A 40-YEAR HIGH. WE GOT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY DECREASING SPENDING, NOT BY INCREASING TAXES. IN AMERICA TODAY, FARMERS, RANCHERS AND AG PRODUCERS ARE COPING WITH PROBLEMS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CAUSED. RAMPANT INFLATION AND LABOR SHORTAGES. NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS THREATENING THE STEPPED UP BASIS AGAIN AND SEEKING TO IMPOSE NEW CAPITAL GAINS TAXES ON PEOPLE WHO FEED FUEL AND CLOTHE US ALL. WHEN THE ASSETS OF FAMILY FARMS TRANSFER TO THE NEXT GENERATION, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULDN'T JUMP IN AND IMPOSE TAXES ON THAT TO CONTROL THE OUT OF CONTROL SPENDING. PRESIDENT BIDEN WANTS TO DISMANTLE THAT TO PAY FOR ALL THIS SPENDING. ADDING INSULT TO INJURY, THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET IMPOSES CAPITAL GAIN TONGS FARM THAT WAS BEEN IN FAMILIES FOR MORE THAN 90 YEARS. THINK ABOUT THAT. IN 1940, THE AVERAGE COST OF KANSAS FARMLAND WAS $50 AN ACRE. NOW IRRIGATED LAND IS OTHER $4,000 PER ACRE. IMAGINE THE CAPITAL GAINS IMPLICATIONS ON THAT HISTORY OF OWNERSHIP. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD IMPOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN NEW CAPITAL GAINS TAXES ON FARMERS, KILL MOTION FARMS OVERNIGHT. IN MARCH, I INTRODUCED A BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION ALONG WITH OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT SUPPORTS THE PRESERVATION OF THE STEPPED UP BASIS AND OPPOSES EFFORTS TO IMPOSE NEW TONGS FAMILY FARMS AND SMALL BUSINESSES. THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET IS AN ATTEMPT TO EXTORT MONEY TO PAY FOR HIS PARTY'S BIG GOVERNMENT SOCIALIST SPENDING SPREE. THE FARM KILLER TAX AND ELIMINATION STEPPED UP BASIS AREN'T GAME CHANGERS FOR AMERICAN FAMILY FARMS BUT GAME ENDERS. CONGRESS OWES UNWAVERING SUPPORT TO AMERICAN'S FARMERS AND AG PRODUCERS. THE LATEST INFLATION REPORT WAS THE HIGH NEST OVER 40 YEARS. HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE FORCING A VOTE ON A BILL TO HANDCUFF THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND FORCE THEM TO FOCUS ON SOCIAL POLICY IN ADDITION TO THEIR STATUTORY MANDATES OF FIGHTING HIGH INFLATION AND DEALING WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, THE MISSION FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE WAS CREATED. AS IF THE ECONOMY AND THE FED DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT, HOUSE DEMOCRATS WANT TO ASSIGN THEM THE TASK OF SETTING SOCIAL POLICY. PRESIDENT BIDEN AND WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON THE ISSUE OF INFLATION AND OUT OF TOUCH WITH ETHEDZ NEEDS OF RURAL AMERICANS. THEY NEED TO WAKE UP TO REALITY AND GET TO WORK ON PROVIDING REAL SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT MESHES ARE FACING. RECORD SPENDING AND DEBT WILL LEAD TO AMERICA'S DEMISE AND WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN UNDER O

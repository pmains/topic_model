i rise today to honor the life of my friend mike meyer of wheeling who passed away earlier this year besides being a loving husband and father mike was an incredibly gifted editor at the ogden newspaper chain it was a personal friend over the years mike and i had lively discussions on politics the fossil fuel industry and what would make west virginia better he was both a pragmatic and authentic editor and cared deeply about the livelihoods of men and women in the coal and natural gas fields of our valley and out of frustrations mike would repeatedly ask why members of congress would intentionally inflict harm on so many of these families his passion was his community and the people who lived there our thoughts and prayers are with his wife connie and their two children and two grandchildren as we all mourn mike's passing mike you made a difference you're already missed mr chairman i yield back

ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. MARC: THE HOUSE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING THE JANUARY 6 ATTACK HAS HEARD FROM MORE THAN 300 WITNESSES AND SUBPOENAED AT LEAST 50. JOINING ME IS CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF. FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON THIS DAY, AND DO THOSE NUMBERS SOUND RIGHT TO YOU, AND ARE WE GOING TO SEE MORE? REP: SCHIFF: YES, THEY DO, AND YES, YOU WILL. WE'VE BEEN BRINGING IN HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TO BE DEPOSED. WE HAVE OUTSTANDING REQUESTS FOR INTERVIEWS AND SUBPOENAS TO COME. WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE MULTIPLE LINES OF EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. IT WAS NOT JUST ABOUT JANUARY 6. THERE WERE ATTEMPTS TO COERCE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS. EFFORTS TO COERCE STATE LEGISLATURES TO SEND ALTERNATE SLATES OF DELEGATES THAT DID NOT REPRESENT THE POPULAR WILL. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE OUR INVESTIGATION IS ABOUT MORE THAN JANUARY 6, WHAT LED UP TO THAT DATE, ITS AFTERMATH, AND HOW WE PROTECT THE COUNTRY GOING FORWARD. MARC: YOUR COMMITTEE HAS ISSUED CRIMINAL REFERRALS TO THE DOJ FOR FAILURE TO RESPOND TO SUBPOENAS FOR SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE REFUSED TO TESTIFY. DO YOU EXPECT TO ISSUE CRIMINAL REFERRALS INVOLVING INFORMATION YOU ARE LEARNING FROM THE PROCESS OF THIS COMMITTEE? REP. SCHIFF: WE MAY, AND I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF OUR FACT-FINDING. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO WAIT ON CONGRESS. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MOVES AHEAD QUITE INDEPENDENTLY OF CONGRESS, AND INDEED, THEY GENERALLY ASKED CONGRESS TO HOLD UP WHILE THEY CONDUCTED THEIR INVESTIGATION, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. IT IS IMPORTANT, AS MERRICK GARLAND UNDERSCORED, THAT THEY MOVE AHEAD AND HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE, NOT JUST FOOT SOLDIERS BUT THOSE WHO ORGANIZED THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITAL, BUT ALSO THAT JUSTICE INVESTIGATE ANY CRIMINAL WRONGDOING SURROUNDING OTHER EFFORTS TO DEFRAUD PEOPLE, SUCH AS THAT BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO GET THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF GEORGIA TO FIND OVER 11,000 VOTES THAT DID NOT EXIST. MARC: I'VE INTERVIEWED YOU SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST YEAR SINCE THIS EVENT, AND ONE THING I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO ASK YOU ABOUT AND ASK YOU NOW -- YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE CONFEDERATE FLAG BEING BROUGHT INTO THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL BUILDING? REP. SCHIFF: THIS WAS TO ME ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING ASPECTS OF THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. DURING THE CIVIL WAR, WE NEVER HAD A CONFEDERATE FLAG PARADED THROUGH THE U.S. CAPITOL. WHAT IT SAID TO ME, ALONG WITH THE OTHER ALL SCHMITZ T-SHIRTS AND OTHER SYMBOLS OF WHITE NATIONALISM, THIS WAS NOT JUST A TRUMP INSURRECTION. THESE WERE NOT PEOPLE UPSET OVER TRUMP'S FALSE CLAIMS OF ELECTION FRAUD. THIS WAS WHITE NATIONALIST INSURRECTION. THAT IS WHAT WAS DRIVING A LOT OF THE PEOPLE TO COME TO THE CAPITOL. ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR WAS THAT THEY LIVED IN PLACES WHERE THE WHITE POPULATION WAS IN DECLINE. THIS IS A PROBLEM AS OLD AS THE COUNTRY THAT HAS REARED ITS UGLY HEAD, AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BIGOTRY IS TRAGICALLY JUST BELOW THE SURFACE. MARC: THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING U

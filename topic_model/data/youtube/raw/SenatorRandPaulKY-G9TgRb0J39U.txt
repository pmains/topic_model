joining me right now is kentucky senator member of the senate foreign relations and senate homeland and governmental affairs committee's rand paul senator it's great to see you this morning thank you so much for joining us good morning maria what about those higher numbers at some point debt is going to become an issue right what what what if it were if it were true that we could always just print out print up money and give it to people why wouldn't we do it all the time no there are economic ramifications to doing this we've accumulated you know nearly four trillion dollars maybe five trillion dollars in debt in one year some of us remember when we were unhappy with george w bush accumulating five trillion in eight years now we're doing five trillion in one year no there's a great danger to having so much debt added at one time it makes no economic sense the other thing is is what's killing the economy and what killed the economy was government shutting it down largely democratic governors if you give them money they will keep it closed so you can't if you want an incentive to open you have to tell the democrat governors guess what no free money and then they'll have to open the economy and that's what has to happen well well that's what joe biden said the other day when asked he said look i'm going to look at the science that would shut it all down i mean there are people and and and businesses that have lost their livelihoods are they going to get it back there are many industries in fact senator that won't make it out of this i think that that's true but blame that on the people who shut your government down not on those who of us who said we shouldn't have done it here's the interesting thing when you look at the science the left says look at the science well here's the science on the mortality of this virus in the united states we now have a per capita mortality that exceeds sweden sweden did very little of anything and they wound up with about the same mortality as us so it could be that all of the government shutdown did nothing to stop the virus we got the virus anyway look at new york new york has had incredible government intervention in their economy they're still closed in many ways and new york had three times higher death rate than any place in the world so maybe government did the wrong thing by shutting the economy down and maybe we should have protected our elderly something that government cuomo seems to have forgotten in all his edicts well you're right and many of the critics of the president and yours on the left continue to uh fail to disavow the unrest in our cities you you dealt with this firsthand i'm talking about the damage from riots and looting across the america following the death of george floyd reportedly estimated to be the costliest in insurance history between 1 billion and 2 billion dollars senator when you were there at the white house and you were with your wife and these writers and and and anarchists coming right in your face can you tell us about what was going through your mind and and what uh what happened that day you know i think that we would have met with a violent end at the police not been there i i truly believe that the police saved our lives i was able to thank two of them you know with the note the other day i haven't yet been able to meet them but i still would like them to be able to come to the white house and be honored for their service they would have killed us had the police not stop them one of the policemen was attacked shortly after we got into the hotel received stitches in his face and the d.c judicial system let him go i mean they they arrested him but he's released on his own recognizance we cannot let people who assault policemen go if not well if we do what happens is you encourage people that then go one step further and decide to shoot the police we have to punish these people and the people who are accosting people if you were invading a restaurant and throwing someone's food on the ground you were invading private property that is a crime and you should go to jail for it if you were impeding someone from moving if you were surrounding people screaming at them and not letting them move and threatening them that you should go to jail for that but if you if you put no one in jail like in portland you get more of it they've had three months of it now and i think the election ultimately will hinge on this people are gonna have to decide do you want all of america to look like portland and i think people are gonna say no we don't we want law and order we don't want to defund the police and absolutely joe biden has not disavowed that he says oh i'm not for defunding the police but he's for reallocating the money away from the police that's the same thing so yes they're going to have to disavow this movement on their left but i think the election could hinge on it well senator i've got to thank you for the courage that you've shown i mean you are a sitting senator and what you have had to deal with from your neighbor to now getting accosted with your wife and and and and really thank you for your strength and your courage i i really i'm just in awe of what you've had to deal with personally if anybody knows if anybody knows about political violence it's me i was there at the ball field when steve scalise almost died one of the young staffers was ten feet from me was shot i had six of my ribs broken by somebody who hates the president wished violence on the president and myself you know then we were surrounded by a mob our country needs law and order we do need a president who will stand for us but really law and order primarily comes from mayors and from governors and in every one of these states and every one of these cities where there's mayhem they've been run by the democrats for 50 years and really people in those cities who have their children being shot need to think about why do we keep voting for the democrats who don't seem to care about the little lives of our children and the other people being shot in our neighborhoods what what's your take on a g bar telling the nation's federal prosecutors to be aggressive when when charging violent demonstrators with crimes including potentially prosecuting them for plotting to overthrow the u.s government uh this is from the wall street journal sedition what what's your take on what bar apparently is telling prosecutors you know i think we do have to draw the line my preference is always that law and order for the most part disrupting the public people mobbing people not letting them move would be local crimes and should be adjudicated locally but there's sort of an abdication going on on the left they've decided that you know it's a summer of love and everybody loves each other and this is the first amendment the first amendment does not allow you to go into a restaurant and assault people you know remember the woman where everybody's shaking their fist and she's in a dc restaurant sitting outside that that is a crime and those people have to be arrested they're not being arrested so we're getting more of this and restaurants can i discover this also who's going to want to eat at a restaurant outside in d.c we can't eat inside because of the virus precautions we can't eat outside because of the mob that's not a good thing for restaurants absolutely and it's completely ignored by the media once again senator also ignored by the media is this incredible historic peace agreement between israel and the arab nations first united arab emirates now bahrain as the u.s commits to withdraw its middle east footprint in iraq iraq and afghanistan senator your reaction to what we've seen here are there more countries behind uae and bahrain that will recognize israel and move to normalize relations yeah i have to say i was taken kind of off guard and pleasantly surprised by this because it's kind of thinking outside the box the tradition has been that we need a grand middle east peace agreement that the palestinians and the israelis agreed to but really this is going in another direction but still a useful direction and a constructive one to get peaceful trade and relationships developed between israel and our neighbors so i think it is a step forward on reducing troops in afghanistan i encourage the president every time i see him let's end the war the american people are tired of the war it's incredibly expensive 50 billion dollars a year not spent on our soldiers spent on building roads and gas stations and hotels over there we don't have enough money we need to spend that money here at home but we also need to end the war the mission is over the military mission in afghanistan is long since over all right senator it's great to get your insights on all of this thanks so much for joining me this morning senator we'll see you soon thank you

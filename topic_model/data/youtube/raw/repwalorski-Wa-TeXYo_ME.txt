thank you mr chairman i believe every human life is precious and absolutely should not be for taxpayers should not be forced to pay for the destruction of life that's why house republicans have been united in our efforts to protect the unborn and prevent taxpayer funding for abortion a majority of americans nearly 60 percent agree that tax dollars should not be used to fund elective abortions the height amendment has been in place for nearly half a century with bipartisan agreement saving the lives of more than 2 million innocent babies and protecting americans conscious rights my amendment will preserve this important pro-life safeguard by adding long-standing high protections to this subtitle this will make clear that a tax payer subsidized cobra plan won't be used to pay for elective abortions it would also give issuers the chance to instead provide cobra eligible plan options that comply with the height amendment we should acknowledge the reality that there is a broad consensus that taxpayer dollars should not fund abortion i urge my colleagues to join me in protecting innocent life by supporting my amendment with that mr chairman i yield back the balance of my time

mr secretary as you know the usda natural resources conservation service the nrcs assist state and local bodies with flood mitigation and water quality improvements erosion control and several things related to that through the watershed and flood prevention's operations program which is really important to a state like mississippi like many rural communities and landowners across the country mississippi and its people have been hit particularly hard in recent years by excessive rainfall flooding and other problems caused by natural disasters the watershed and flood prevention operations program has been invaluable in allowing small towns to recover from these events and importantly to prepare for the next one because we know the next one will be coming as well but all along with my staff and many constituents we have a great respect and don't know what we would do with the nrcs and we appreciate the many services that they provide but mr secretary what is the status of the watershed and flood prevention operations funding provided in that fy 2022 omnibus and i'm looking for some feel good news that it's you know being put to very good use but please share any updates that you may have as to how the funds provided by nrcs and mississippi are or will soon be utilized to help rural communities and landowners addressing flood water and these issues that uh i've just articulated specifically the 8.4 million dollars the nrcs folks are working with the local sponsors of the projects uh that were identified uh to basically work through uh the implementation plan so that process is in place in addition uh the state of mississippi uh was the uh recipient of 47.8 million dollars of additional resources under the bipartisan infrastructure law of the 500 million that was allocated under that law for for watershed and flood prevention operations mississippi receiving 47.8 million dollars of additional resources so nrcs is working on a variety of projects in mississippi my staff will be able to give you the list of the projects that were identified in that 47.8 million um you know we are working on uh for example a big project uh with madison county um on a stream bank erosion issue we know that a lot of the the sediment issues in mississippi are not a result of you're losing your topsoil it's a result of the banks basically eroding and over time uh creating some some challenges and so i think you're going to see significant activity in this space in the mississippi because of the money and resources that have been provided through the appropriations process and through the infrastructure law wonderful i appreciate that answer and i've got a few minute a few seconds left rural communities across u.s we will always be faced with these weather-related challenges and i was pleased that the fy 2023 budget request for usda included the wfpo funding in it as well should congress provide funding to address project or watershed specific challenges through the wfpo and fy23 how confident are you that the nrcs can put those funds to good use well i'm confident they can as long as we continue to increase the staffing levels i think the key here is not just increasing the resources but making sure that you've got the staff on the ground that can implement these resources in a proper way great thank you madam chairman thank you

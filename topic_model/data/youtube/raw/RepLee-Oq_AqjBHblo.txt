help madam Speaker I rise in strong opposition to HR 7 this discriminatory bill would undermine a women's access to abortion care which is a constitutional right as affirmed by Roe vs. Wade 44 years ago by making the Hyde Amendment permanent this bill would restrict access to reproductive health care for millions of women and disproportionately harm low-income women and women of color as if this isn't enough HR 7 comes on the heels of a dramatic expansion of the Global gag rule which denies life-saving health care to women around the world not to mention continuous Republican attacks on contraceptive access comprehensive sex education and Planned Parenthood madam Speaker now was a staffer on Capitol Hill when the Hyde Amendment was first passed and I remember the days very clearly a back-alley abortion clearly Republicans are trying to take us back to the days when women died from unsafe abortions in this country that's why I offered an amendment that would have recognized that women not employers or politicians have the right to make their own productive health choices shamefully the Rules Committee refused to make it in order and allow for debate madam Speaker women should be able to make their own decisions about reproductive health care including abortions without members of Congress are employers interfering

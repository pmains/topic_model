I would yield now to one of the authors of this uh co-sponsor of this legislation the general lady from the state of Florida Miss camic three minutes the young woman from Florida is recognized for three minutes thank you madam speaker I rise today in strong support of H.R 26 the born alive abortion survivors protection act and this bill does exactly what the title says which in this town is a novel concept I'd like to thank my colleague Ann Wagner for her tireless efforts I'd like to thank our Majority Leader Steve scalise for his efforts on this issue and of course chairman Jim Jordan of the Judiciary Committee for being such an advocate for the pro-life committee community today we are not talking about abortion we are talking about children we are talking about children who have been born and are fighting to survive despite an abortion attempt in some cases when a woman receives a late-term abortion the baby can be born alive following the procedure federal law currently recognizes these babies as persons but fails to outline any requirements of care after the infant is born alive H.R 26 would Rectify this by requiring Health Care practitioners to treat any child born alive after an abortion as they would any infant and requires that the infant be immediately treated with life-saving care and transported to a hospital I honestly do not understand what is so controversial about that this bill establishes criminal penalties for any health care practitioner or abortion clinic employee who fails to comply with the requirements established by this bill because let's face it no one can deny that a child who survives an abortion attempt who is outside the womb breathing and struggling for Life despite all attempts to end it doesn't deserve equal protection under the law and under our law murder is illegal that shouldn't be a controversial position eight babies in Florida alone just last year eight babies were reported to have been born alive during an abortion attempt the stories are horrific one that sticks out in particular an NBC report in 2006 they told the story of a 23 week old baby boy that was born alive at an abortion clinic in Hialeah Florida when he began breathing and moving the abortion clinic owner belkus Gonzalez reportedly cut the umbilical cord and zipped him into a biohazard bag where he then died it's hard to read those words but as has been stated here on this floor in this chamber this isn't about pro-life versus pro-choice this is about protecting those most vulnerable it's about who we are as a society who we are as a people and who we are as Americans I hope that both sides of this chamber can agree that accountability is a good thing protecting these children is a good thing it's time to put the Party politics aside and the talking points aside and give these children wanted or unwanted a Fighting Chance a chance that they all deserve with that I yield back

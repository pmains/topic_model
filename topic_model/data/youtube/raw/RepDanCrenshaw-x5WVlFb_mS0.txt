all right folks buckle up because this is gonna be a long one but an important one [Music] all right the reason this is gonna be a long video is because i need to explain what reconciliation is and what exactly is in it and why it's bad and too expensive i also want you to understand that the infrastructure package is separate from the reconciliation bill now i'm still against the infrastructure package but that doesn't mean everything in it is bad it just means it's about three times too expensive for my liking we don't need to be spending that kind of money but keep in mind for the sake of this discussion these are two separate items so what's in this reconciliation package why is it too expensive and why is it so bad for america so like most things that bernie sanders does they're bad and guess what he wrote this bill too so it's massive increase in spending and massive increase in taxes okay both things are bad let's just go over some of the basics 4.3 trillion dollars in new spending 2.1 trillion dollars in new taxes this increases yearly governmental spending by over 73 percent every year for the next 10 years putting it together this is the most expensive bill that's ever been considered by congress now if the spending isn't bad enough the policy is even worse on a fundamental level it kills jobs the bill imposes 2.1 trillion dollars in tax hikes which is the largest increase in history it imposes a 26.5 corporate rate the second highest rate in the world common sense and basic economics tell us this is going to drive out millions of jobs and for the jobs that we don't lose this kind of tax increase will reduce wages by an estimated 1.1 percent and that's on top of the fact that real wages have already suffered as a result of inflation and this bill is just going to depress them even further well dan democrats say they're just going to tax the rich and that's how they're going to pay for this well turns out even liberal-leaning think tanks estimate that about two-thirds of these tax increases will be borne by lower and middle-income class this is bad for business growth this is bad for investment see by raising the top individual tax rate to 39 percent many small businesses that are organized as pass-throughs or sole proprietorships they're just going to close their doors as soon as they're about to open if you care about your electricity prices and energy prices in general well this isn't good news for you because there's going to be a tax on natural gas consumption which would be the final nail in the coffin on the american energy sector this could destroy about 90 000 jobs according to most estimates and increase energy costs per family by about 242 dollars per year uh but don't worry a lot of the money being spent about 80 billion dollars is just going straight to the irs so they can double the amount of agents out there looking for you let's not forget the green new deal lucky for all you green new dealers out there there's about 630 billion dollars for green new deal sub cities they look something like this seven and a half billion dollars to create a civilian climate corps which is basically just a bunch of activists to promote green new deal stuff another five billion in environmental justice tax credit for universities to support climate change studies so that's just the government bankrolling liberal propaganda in our universities oh and here we go 27 billion dollars to set up a national climate bank slush fund this national climate bank is especially infuriating because wall street is already bankrolling green projects all over the place in fact there's probably a bubble brewing there you don't need another 27 billion dollars of taxpayer money to do it go and get this if you're a family making up to 800 000 a year you're eligible for an electric vehicle subsidy for up to twelve thousand five hundred dollars really sticking it to the rich hung democrats and you know who this is intended for right it's elites on the coasts that love their electric vehicles and want to be subsidized for buying them and don't forget they're also the same ones that donates democrat campaigns it's not just energy and economics that's in this bill it also affects your health care and again bernie sanders wrote one of the most egregious things in this bill is hr3 which is the democrats drug pricing scheme this is such bad policy that even democrats had to vote against it in our energy and commerce committee and yet nancy pelosi still stuck it in the final versions what does this do well they call it a negotiation right which is fine that would be good if that's what it was except it's not it's a hostage taking where the government says if you don't take the price that we want to give you we're going to tax your revenue 95 the problem here is that there will be no more innovation there will be no more new drugs cbo estimates that there'll be about 30 less new cures over the next couple decades other organizations estimate far worse than that so look you can't control the price of a drug if the drug doesn't exist in the first place and that's what this bill would do prevent drugs from existing in the first place spill also spends about 300 billion more dollars expanding medicare especially for things like dental vision hearing and by the way 95 of medicare beneficiaries already have those benefits because of medicare advantage which is a republican idea by the way but they just want to spend more money on it and by the way medicare is already insolvent you can't just keep adding more taxpayer money to it without reforming the program and of course like good democrats they added mandates in there to make sure that you have to pay for abortion coverage too so now your tax dollars are paying for abortion coverage now that's all not enough for you the democrats also tried to sneak in amnesty for illegal immigrants into this bill they wanted to spend a hundred billion dollars for amnesty for about eight million immigrants luckily because this has passed the reconciliation the senate parliamentarian struck this from the bill because it's against the rule all right bottom line this is a lot of spending a lot of taxes and a lot of overall bad policy it's really unclear how this would really help americans it's clearly an attempt at bribing you and then they lie to you about it so joe biden recently says that well it's free it costs zero dollars okay first of all it's not paid for by the tax increases it's about double what the tax increases are but hey by the way even if it was it doesn't make something free okay if i go buy a cup of coffee and pay for it it doesn't mean the cup of coffee that i get in return is now free it cost me something just like this costs you something more importantly this is costing your kids and grandkids something because they have to somehow pay off this debt the last thing americans need right now is runaway debt we spent a lot of money because of covet a lot of agreement on spending that money it was necessary now it's time to rein it in people want to go back to work people want to open up their businesses so what can you do to stop this monstrosity of a bill well you can call your democrat representatives they're barely hanging on here they need every single vote and if you call your democrat representatives and you let them know what you're against and why you're against it you can list all the things that i've been talking about this may fail and we may get a much more reasonable bill on our hands

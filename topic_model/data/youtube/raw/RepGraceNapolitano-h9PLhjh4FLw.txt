mrs. Napolitano gentlelady from California is recognized for two minutes I thank the gentleman and I would like to say I agree with my colleague is if not now when we've been asking that for many many generations the mass shootings American families are demanding Congress to act the one action book Congress has not hurt any bills they refuse to hear them there is nothing being given an opportunity to have the light of day or to have some transparency to it the last meaningful Gun Violence Prevention bill was in 1994 and that was the brady handgun Violence Prevention Act now shootings as was pointed out are now an everyday occurrence and it's commonplace so people are becoming numb except for those that are immediately affected and are asking us to move and pass legislation give it the light of day to discuss it bring it up start some methodology to be able to understand what this house is looking at doing for our American people for our children for our families now a collective action we need a transparent discussion is necessary and much needed but enough of skirting this issue yes what's more important gas and oil or the lives of human beings keep guns away from people that should not have them and our would use them to harm others HR 1217 mandates universal background checks for all purchases it's a step in the right direction and would move our country forward and beginning the process of addressing this epidemic that we're facing we need real constructive legislation we need to prevent unless in violence we must keep guns out of the hands of people that should not have access to them such as the dangerously mentally ill now domestic abusers and people with violent histories also should not have access to them and they currently do now without stigmatizing those with mental illness because then you have a problem on your hands we need to inform educate and help young people with families educators those who are exhibiting emotional disturbances and some kind of exhibition is helping them learn how to access information and assistance and with that I yield back the balance of my time from Alabama

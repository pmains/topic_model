uh thank you chairman and i appreciate the discussion today um i think a lot of it obviously is centering around the need for energy independence not just here in the united states but abroad particularly with our allies um and my question revolves around the eastern mediterranean gas pipeline this is a project that had broad diplomatic support in the region it had bipartisan support among members of congress and the decision by the byte administration um i believe to pull its support uh undercuts european gas alternatives as the continent looks to wean itself off of russian oil and gas and empowers regional troublemakers uh like turk like russia and turkey and diminishes america's reputation uh in europe my question is do you believe it was appropriate for the state department to make this change in policy without consulting congress and also um what is the state department doing to help bring eastern mediterranean gas online quickly so we can serve as an alternative to russian gas if we don't know what they're doing maybe you could say what you suggest that they do i feel like i'll just make a very quick point because i think we've been speaking a lot about this issue and focusing on the climate uh goals i will say that when it comes to these med gas pipeline even though i do not think i don't know but i do not think this was part of the administration's goals it has been a source of tension with turkey and part of this conversation has also been about how to bring turkey uh you know to be a more constructive player in eastman dynamics and so i think it's important to highlight that this has been a positive development at least in ankara's engagement with other actors in the region um in terms of other uh means uh alan and and um support for you know efforts to pipe gas instead and to egypt by from israel potentially from cyprus and export it via lng terminal is certainly the quickest way uh to try to get new supplies to europe so no i appreciate you touched on something um what i would say it's called you know turkish appeasement um you know turkey has been illegally occupying a third of cyprus um and for for decades now and uh just recently the united nations denounced and condemned the decision by turkey uh to reopen a residential section of it was abandoned area named varosha they warned that it would it could raise tensions on divided mediterranean island um and i have serious concerns about whether turkey is acting in a in a as an as an as a as a good actor or an adversary i mean we see this time and again we saw this with the the s 400s purchasing from russia uh we see this now trying to come back into americans good graces by uh wanting to purchase the f-16s um and what the role that they're playing currently with ukraine and russia i mean do you believe that nato united states should be a little more firm with what we expect from turkey in the eastern mediterranean they've shown aggression as of late um in in and around the islands uh the the exclusive economic zone um they violate international law i just i just i guess what i'm trying to say is they are a nato ally but sometimes they act like an adversary they are illegally occupying uh cyprus what should we be doing as united states to try to hold them accountable and get them to do the right thing not always just appeasing uh what uh erdogan wants if i may um i i think that um the amount of pressure that we put on or for that matter the amount of inducements that we we offer it uh really depends on what sort of opportunities are out there in the case of turkey right now i don't think that either uh uh inducements or pressure is going to get much from them uh and that's uh in large part because we have elections coming up in june 2023. what i would suggest is that if the elections uh produce either a mixed government or a government that uh led by the opposition there's there's a lot of ifs and buts to get there but if that's the case we can we can assume that whatever uh new government comes to uh power will be very anxious to uh uh work with the european union to work with original partners to sort of normalize relations for the time being i don't expect uh turkey to to uh to back down off of cyprus because it's such a consensus issue within turkish public opinion thank you i've run out of time i know it looks like alan wanted to comment but it seems i ran out of time good uh mr mikowski you can respond thank you chairman you have to unmute yourself uh alan apologies um just regarding cyprus uh turkey has taken a couple of particularly unhelpful positions uh in recent times regarding as you said opening for and also insisting on a two-state solution um i think one of the things the united states should do is and this may sound very bureaucratic but we used to have a special cypress coordinator based on the issue and also means for pushing the decides to negotiate uh i think that position ought to be re-established um by the administration i think that would help uh i think the current turkish position on cyprus is something we do strongly need to oppose thank you uh thank you ms molly takas uh and mr

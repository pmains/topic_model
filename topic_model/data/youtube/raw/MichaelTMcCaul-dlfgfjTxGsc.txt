Texas congressman Michael McCaul chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee my guest today from his home state sir welcome back Thank You mortar deals newsroom I watch you on Sunday and you said repeatedly we need to pick the American side in this fight what is the American side explain that the American side is is making sure these chemical weapons are secure and destroyed there's been a lot of talking about Assad and the rebel forces this administration has had a failure and foreign policy in my judgment and that's why we're in the mess we're in today they drew a red line previously they cross that line now he's drawing another red line he has no credibility unfortunately with our international partners but as the chairman of Homeland Security the number one objective and threat that I see are these chemical weapons stockpiles sitting there in Syria that could fall into the hands of al Qaeda and why do I say that because the rebel forces that are in Syria right now fighting the Assad regime now the numbers have ticked up to about fifty percent al-nusrah which is the al Qaeda faction within Syria Syria has become a bit of a mecca for jihadist and every day when I get briefed every day these jihadists are flowing into Syria and I think the last thing we want to see is no we all know the situation over there but the last thing we want to see are those weapons fired at Americans you set a lot there but I want to know what's possible militarily when it comes to chemical weapons you can fire a cruise missile in a Damascus but how is that going to take care of a chemical weapon stockpile it's it's extremely complicated that the administration had an opportunity about two years ago to support the moderate forces to topple the Assad regime now those moderate forces have been hijacked by al-qaeda so you have a very difficult complex foreign policy issue cruise missiles can't take out the delivery devices but if they are fired at the chemical weapons themselves you can cause grave destruction and I don't think we want that kind of result either we need to build up an international coalition if we can take out the delivery devices then to secure the stock pot miles of chemical weapons and ultimately destroy them but bill this is an issue this is a very very complex difficult indeed it is and you mentioned the president there on Friday he said we have to avoid being drawn into a very expensive difficult costly intervention that actually breeds more resentment in the region do you agree with that you know I agree i do not think the American people as i said on Face the Nation now I want troops on the ground here we don't have an appetite for we don't we don't want that but if there's a way to surgically take out these chemical weapons stockpiles that would be in the best interest not just a Syria but what I'm more concerned about the homeland security interest of the United States I don't want to see these weapons brought into the United States and turned against Americans and that's my number one goal I know the military has warships off the coast of Syria I know they are giving the president all sorts of targeting of planning you know briefings and I will defer to that but if there's a way to take out these chemical weapons without putting boots on the ground I think that's the better scenario one more point here and this really goes to the heart of the matter Doctors Without Borders inside Syria now they report 3600 patients displaying these symptoms that could be tied to the use of chemical weapons of that 3600 355 according to this group are reportedly dead what can you confirm if anything based on that report well look the prevailing wisdom in the intelligence community is that these are chemical weapons nerve agents which you know is mustard gas is one thing nerve agents very debilitating and damaging and the videos we've seen and the pictures in the first hand that eyewitness accounts we've heard from demonstrate that these are our nerve agents that were used against his own people I think the saddest thing bill the most tragic things look at those children who were killed by their own president it's really sad sir thank you for your time this morning we will be on top of it as well you Michael McCaul when there is more to talk about and there will be will bring you back thank you sir for baking

there's collided with a garbage truck joining me now is dr. Roger Marshall also congressman from Kansas dr. Marshall you tried to save the life of the driver of this truck after the accident can you just you know take us through a little bit what it was like to be on that train when when the accident first happened what were you worried about and I had heard that you guys had to do a little bit of convincing of the Capitol Police to let you off well in my situation I was in one of the middle cars sitting beside my wife having a very friendly visit and there was kids running up and down the aisle some other members children and boy we we hit something it was a loud thud like a clap of thunder it shook us and obviously we knew something was wrong the kids went flying my wife went flying so after we you know stopped I looked around and I saw the little girl that have fallen her daddy picked her up and I asked if she was okay and by then I saw Capitol Police scurrying everywhere so the first thing I thought is my gosh are we gonna be boarded next you know was this something serious or not so I assessed I mean that military guy my dad was a chief of police I always taught me to be wearing my surroundings so I was watching the capital wave please take their positions and I heard the helicopter above us to make sure that we were secure and once you were able to to leave to leave the train can I've talked to us a little bit about what you faced and what you all tried to do so finally you know got off the train the Capitol Police grabbed us we went down to the scene there was obviously two victims that were down the first looked dr. Michael Burgess was there with that patient attaining to him dr. Winthrop dr. caste was there as well doing CPR on this first and tried to control an airway I looked beside him and the other person was was obviously not breathing in real bad shape I saw dr. Rowe there trying to get an airway I went quickly over there I couldn't get a heartbeat so I started CPR on him just give our viewers a sense of what kind of medicine you have practiced in in your career is this the kind of thing that you've encountered or or you know what was it like for you as a physician yeah so I'm an obstetrician gynecologist and private practice and rural Kansas which means we get to take care of everything that into the are the the babies the ectopic so I certainly been in life-threatening situations many time where a baby's dying a mom's dying someone's dying in the ER even at some military experience in a military that's a mass unit as well so even took me back to some of those days in training and this is something I mean I I spoke to Senator flake right after the accident I mean the Republicans have had several and some in the Congressional baseball shooting and other and other things I mean this did do you feel like you and your colleagues are shaken up at all about these turns of events I think that these events have made us grow closer when when Steve was shot our wives just formed a circle love and prayer around everybody it just made us all grow close to each other even this situation within minutes after learning of this Kevin McCarthy's wife Janna Ryan was calling and making sure everybody was okay the Vice President making sure everybody was okay reaching out to each other and even just the ones there seven or eight of us physicians doing CPR it was like we'd all work together for decades and none of us have ever worked together as physicians but without even talking we all knew what our position was what we needed to do you get the airway I'll do the the cardiac massage you know where's the defibrillator let's get that set up let's get a blanket here we got antifreeze leaking over here let's get something on the antifreeze and cover it up so I think it's made us grow even much closer certainly a heroic effort on all of your parts sir while I have you here I'd like to be one quick question about the pressing issues facing the Congress coming up this week and that's immigration we had this the Senate Majority Leader has said he'll put an immigration compromise on the floor if you guys don't have a broad deal by Thursday where do you stand in all of this if there is an immigration bill that can pass the Senate with overwhelming numbers do you think that the House speaker should put that to a vote on the floor of the house you know I think realistically is that we'll have a bill done before they do we're really close to having one ready to go and I just want to reassure people we want it to be fair we want long-lasting solutions so I think we're really close to having one we've already had one come through the committee through a committee already we spent a lot of time this weekend talking about it but a nice what I hear from the Senate I've seen nothing in writing from the I've heard them forming committees and praying about it but we're ready to launch one and I think that it'll be a good solid bill congressman Roger Marshall thank you very much for your time tonight I really appreciate it and for all of you who want to know how to help there is a GoFundMe page set up in memory of Christopher Foley who was killed in the crash we will tweet out a link to that page from our official KCDC Twitter account there is also a GoFundMe page set up for Denis Eady and Dana

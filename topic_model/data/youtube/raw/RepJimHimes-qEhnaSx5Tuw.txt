from the senate joining me now is democratic jim heintz on the Financial Services Committee Republican Marsha Blackburn vice chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee welcome to you both if you start with you Jim Himes I mean there is a rising sense of tension now if not outright terror that because of this intransigence particularly the part led by Ted Cruz and these 40 renegades and Republicans as many see them that there may not be a deal that the debt ceiling deadline may come and go and we could face a former financial Armageddon it is likely well it's hard to say at this point look we're at the tail end of a 15-day period that was kicked off by senator Cruz with you know around this idea that he had any probability that the Republicans had any probability at all of repealing the Affordable Care Act was never going to happen set aside the question of whether should happen it was never going to happen today this morning we actually had a deal being hammered out between the two Senate leaders the House Republicans stepped in and said wait we've got it we've got a bill that we're going to put forward and of course that came apart as the day progressed and into the evening so now we're back where we should have been all along with a very clean deal we don't know what it looks like yet but that would raise the the debt ceiling and avoid the prospect of default and of course get the government started again so we just have to keep our fingers crossed and in the Senate that deal gets struck Marsha Blackburn let's talk about Ted Cruz for a moment because he's the man at the moment good or bad depending on your view is clearly it seems to most impartial observers making a bit of a dash to be a frontrunner for the Republican nomination behind in 2016 and that's his real agenda here but what's good for take Cruz and his personal political career might be disastrous for the American people if not his own party but what is your view of his behavior well I think that one of the things we all should do right now is not talk about personalities what we should be talking about is how we make certain that we get this nation on the track to fiscal health and responsibility and one of the things we cannot do is continue borrowing two billion dollars a day to keep the lights on and regardless of whether we like someone or don't like someone what we have to realize is we've been through a process of people who are elected by their constituents to come to DC and it's the point of view and so many of us have constituents who say look jobs the economy getting us on the road to fiscal health returning us to where we are going to see jobs growth where we're going to see economic growth that is item number one dealing with the impact of Obamacare on the economy that's an important thing to do in Pierce we come everybody bringing their best ideas and their best thoughts and what we have right now is the trouble we weren't here but we are the master black but the problem is it may be the best idea in the best thoughts for you and for take crews but like I say these best ideas and thoughts might be absolutely catastrophic here are some of the American people and the global economy at what point does the outright selfish self interest of Ted Cruz and his colleagues outweigh the American interest in the global economic in there again I think that what we don't do is talk about personalities no matter what we have to do cautious about / gonna see what is very feeling logic Ted Cruz doesn't yes dealt with we didn't want a government shutdown we don't want to have a default on the debt what we are doing what House Republicans have done is we have passed for different continuing resolutions and a budget and you know people like this semester ? we have passed since they you you be unbelievably responsible which is what the government's been shut down for two weeks let me ask you this we wish it weren't shut this I know you don't know you do but tightly bound to take let me ask his boss about bird yes obviously you didn't want the government shutdown but it has shut down but it already has for two weeks do you want the debt ceiling to running fault are you prepared to pay that really not so what would absolutely be doing as a policy to avoid that I continue to work with other republicans in the house to see if we can find a resolution to this issue we did not want to get right here to the last minute what I want to see is us work through a plan so that we're dealing with our long-term fiscal issues borrowing the amount of money that we are borrowing every day is not a sustainable let's let me go back to Jim Rice economist around here tells us that every economist around here tells me what is going on is utter nonsense and should never be to get this off the borrowing is a part of that nonsense so there are many there are many issues to do with Obamacare the American economy and all sorts of things what you don't do is shut the government down over what is a law let me turn back to Jim Heintz I mean look you know you can take of you about is this all Ted Cruz's board and so on or you could say politically for him and the tea party element of the Republicans he seems to be holding all the cards playing them very adeptly making himself extremely famous and probably as I say a frontrunner for presidential run but how do we get to a stage where President Obama who so far has not managed to stop this shutdown is on the brink of this awful debt ceiling deadline of Lansing how is he going to get into a room and make people see sense at the moment you have to say he is not shown great leadership because if he had it had got assaulted look it's the president doesn't legislate he signs laws that are sent to him by the Congress of the United States and despite what Marcia is saying you know there has been nothing salutary about what has happened in the last 15 days it has been devastating for our economy throwing people out of work the economist will tell you that the kind of you know management by crisis that the republican party in the house has demanded for years now has probably cost the economy a million jobs far more jobs than they can point to credible source as suggesting that the Affordable Care Act is is damaging and by the way forget about the jobs and everything else out there that is hurting the American people it's devastated the Republican political fortunes seventy-four percent of Americans disagree with how the Republicans have handled this so if we're really going to talk about what the American people want the American people don't want this country to be managed from crisis to crisis with government work or head start programs or military contractors being used as negotiating tools in some absurd political fantasy soccer game and send them to the center wait a moment if we play yourself let me play me play you a sick from President Obama talking about Speaker Boehner today Speaker Boehner for example him negotiating with me isn't necessarily good for the extreme passion in his caucus in weakened ssin so there been repeated situations where we have agreements then he goes back and it turns out that he can't control his caucus this is the problem isn't it Marsha Blackburn is that President Obama doesn't know who to talk to does he talk to Speaker Boehner the de facto representative of the Republican Party or should he go straight to take crews cut out the middleman go to the guide is wielding the power is shut down the government is threatening the default well it's amazing to me that the president would think that he should not be talking to Speaker Boehner and it is up to the President as the commander-in-chief and the leader to assemble people at the negotiating table I would remind you pierce that over the last 40 years or so we've had 53 lifts to the debt ceiling 27 of those have yielded spending cuts to what our nation spends all of those have been negotiated with some type policy reform and we have talked about this previously on your show standard operating procedure in deal two budgets and continuing resolutions and debt ceilings has been for one side to take their plan the other side to take their plan to beat it's a negotiating table and to work this out it has been a blatant lack of leadership that has been on full display for the world to see that we have a president who has chosen that he would rather see a shutdown then go to the table who isn't waiting until the last day to meet everyone at the negotiating table that is unfortunate it is something that I wish had not happened we have continued in good faith to pass a budget every year to send it to the Senate the pass appropriations bills which is the way we fill out our budget send them to the Senate it is the sin if it chooses not to take the action that is Harry Reid's choice and decision okay all right not a final words of Jim Himes is all the Democrats for nothing to do with take cruise nothing to do with Republicans in fact later will the house of the white house's it's all there for no look it's absurd and not there's just there's very few Americans who believe the story that this is the president's fault John Boehner at any point in the last 15 days could have opened up the government by passing the clean Senate CR and the Republicans and look tonight Marshall is talking about the dead in a long-term deal and by the way we agree on that we should negotiate that but remember two weeks ago it had nothing to do with negotiations of the long-term debt it was about a repeal of Obamacare and then it was a two-year delay of Obamacare and so every day as the Republicans have realized that their position is increasingly untenable and untenable it is they have changed their positions so even if the president were in Pat you know even if the President had any ability to control the Republicans in the House of Representative which by the way the Speaker of the House does not have as evidenced by the failure of his idea today even if the president could control the House of Representatives what would he be negotiating on I'm gonna leave it there jim Himes and masha pepper you're both pretty much indeed thank you tell me next time is running out what if Washington fell you

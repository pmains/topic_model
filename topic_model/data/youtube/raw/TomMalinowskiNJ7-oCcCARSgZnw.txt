joining me now is congressman tom malinowski democrat of new jersey who sits on the foreign affairs and homeland security committees and served as assistant secretary of state for democracy human rights and labor in the obama administration congressman thank you so much for your time contrast this for us a little bit has the biden administration made the right moves in your opinion in resetting united states foreign policy from the decisions made under donald trump my goodness yes and not just in my view but i think in the view of millions of uh people around the world and our allies it is so refreshing after those four years that i want to forget to have a president who is not in love with a north korean dictator doesn't seem to have a desperate desire to be liked by vladimir putin a president who's rebuilding our alliances with democracies and our national competitiveness at home to meet the the threat of a rising china uh and and someone who's just competent and and not crazy we don't have to worry every single day about what joe biden might do to throw the world into turmoil one of the areas though that president biden is advancing that was also advocated by president trump was afghanistan u.s troops began leaving afghanistan on saturday you have been critical of this decision saying uh secretary of state anthony blinken's suggestion of moderating the taliban with recognition and aid is a story we tell ourselves to feel better about leaving do you feel any better about this decision than you did two weeks ago well so overall i think i think president biden has made all the right calls this is this is one where i i did disagree with him i understand why after 20 years both he and so many americans would say it's enough um the status quo in afghanistan is uh it's not great there's corruption there's chronic violence uh i just worry that the the situation after we leave will will be far worse there there have been actually remarkable gains in afghanistan despite the problems over the last 20 years millions of afghans enjoying freedoms that they never before uh enjoyed we have a counter-terrorism partner in the fight against al-qaeda and isis i don't want to lose that the decision has been made this is what we're going to do i'm focused with the administration on how to make sure that this turns out better and not worse for us and for our many many friends in afghanistan speaking of our friends in afghanistan do you believe the united states has an adequate and acceptable plan for protecting afghans who for the past 20 years have been working alongside with the americans we're going to have to develop one there are thousands of afghans as you mentioned who risked their lives to work alongside our troops and our diplomats we have a moral obligation to them we have a self-interest in making clear to others who might work with us elsewhere in the future that we're not going to leave them behind are also many other afghans civic leaders women's rights activists uh teachers professors who bet on their country's freedoms and their alliance with the united states and if and i fear when the taliban gains greater power in the country they are going to be targeted in fact the taliban today is waging a campaign of assassination uh against these folks uh all over the country and so we're going to have to develop new mechanisms to enable these people to leave and and should they become endangered to come to the united states it's easier said than done as you may know uh the the way to to get refugee status to come to the united states can be years and these folks don't have years so i've been speaking to the state department about how we can how we can make that system work better for afghans in the coming months congressman let me ask you about the building behind me i know the president's speech is also expected to talk about the storming of the capital you are sponsoring legislation i understand to remove part of section 230 that is protection in hopes of social media companies will stop promoting extremist groups explain to us the argument that you're making with this legislation the the riot on january 6th would not have happened thousands of ordinary americans would not have believed that assaulting the capital was a normal thing to do if not for the fact that we get most of our news through social media today most of our information and social media platforms are literally designed to create a kind of individually tailored version of reality for every single american and in fact everybody on the planet so that if your tendency is more conservative you're going to get more and more and more content that pushes you further to the right if you're more liberal you're going to get more and more and more content that pushes you towards the left if you're susceptible to conspiracy theories you're going to get a lot of q on that is a design feature of facebook that's the problem we're trying to solve it by saying that these large social media platforms shouldn't have absolute protection from legal liability if they are amplifying promoting content through their algorithms that leads to an act of terrorism or an assault on our values like what we saw on january 6 because we want to incentivize them to change basically how they design facebook how they design youtube um and right now the profit motive is just too great an incentive for them to keep doing what they're doing are you getting a bipartisan support on that so it's it's interesting that there's a lot of uh partisanship around social media right um a lot of conservatives and republicans think that when facebook or twitter bans donald trump they're censoring conservatives and yeah and so there's a lot of polarization but actually my bill i think is more appealing to people on both sides of the aisle because you know let's say you're you're you're somebody on the right and you believe that antifa is the biggest threat to america yeah i think you're wrong but you should still love my bill because what we're going after is that kim it's this design feature of social media that pushes everybody whether we're on the left or the right to our respective extremes um and so if you believe that we need more sanity and moderation in america as as my more reasonable republican colleagues do then this is i think an approach that has a lot of appeal we got more co-sponsors than any other social media reform bill in the congress so all right i expect this to go somewhere this year all right congressman tom malinowski thank you so much sir for your time greatly appreciate it

  GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. SHERMAN: I ASK UNANIMOUS   CONSENT TO PLACE IN THE RECORD   A LETTER AND STATEMENT BY  CORETTA SCOTT KING FROM 1986.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. SHERMAN: THANK YOU.  LAST TUESDAY SENATOR ELIZABETH   WARREN SOUGHT TO BRING TO THE  ATTENTION OF THE SENATE SOME   MATERIAL ABOUT AN ATTORNEY   GENERAL NOMINEE, JEFF SESSIONS,  SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS AT THE   TIME.  SHE WAS SILENCED.  SHE PERSISTED, BUT ULTIMATELY  THE RECORD OF THE SENATE DOES  NOT REFLECT THE REMARKS SHE WAS  TRYING TO GIVE.  IN PARTICULAR, SHE WAS TRYING  TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION OF   THE SENATE A STATEMENT AND   LETTER OF CORETTA SCOTT KING   FROM 1986. YOU SEE, IN 1986 THEN JEFFERSON  B. SESSIONS WAS A U.S.   ATTORNEY, FEDERAL PROSECUTOR,  WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED FOR A   POSITION AS A U.S. DISTRICT  JUDGE. AND AT THAT TIME CORETTA SCOTT   KING WROTE TO THE THEN CHAIR OF  THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,  SENATOR STROM THURMOND, AND  WHILE THE SENATE MAY NOT   ENTERTAIN THESE REMARKS, WHILE   THE SENATE MAY STIFLE A UNITED   STATES SENATOR, THIS IS THE  PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND IT IS   APPROPRIATE THAT THE RECORD OF   THIS HOUSE AT LEAST REFLECT THE  COMMENTS OF CORETTA SCOTT KING.  AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO USE THE   TIME REMAINING TO READ PERFECT   COVER LETTER -- HER COVER  LETTER FROM MARCH SP, 1986, AND  TO READ EXCERPTS FROM THE  STATEMENT SHE ATTACHED TO IT.  DEAR SENATOR THURMOND. I WRITE TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE  OPPOSITION TO THE CONFIRMATION   OF JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS AS A  FEDERAL DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE   SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA.  MY PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL   ROOTS IN ALABAMA ARE DEEP AND  LASTING. ANYONE WHO HAS USED THE POWER  OF HIS OFFICE AS A U.S.  ATTORNEY TO INTIMIDATE AND   CHILL THE FREE CHER SIZE OF THE  BALLOT BY CITIZENS SHOULD NOT  BE ELEVATED TO OUR COURTS. MR. SESSIONS HAS USED THE  AWESOME POWERS OF HIS OFFICE IN  A SHABBY ATTEMPT TO INTIMIDATE   AND FRIGHTEN ELDERLY BLACK   VOTERS.  FOR THIS REPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT,  HE SHOULD NOT BE REWARDED WITH   A FEDERAL JUDGESHIP. I REGRET THAT A LONG-STANDING  COMMITMENT CONVINCED ME FROM   APPEARING IN PERSON TO TESTIFY   AGAINST THIS NOMINEE, HOWEVER I  HAVE ATTACHED A COPY OF MY   STATEMENT OPPOSING MR.   SESSION'S CONFIRMATION.  I REQUEST MY STATEMENT AS WELL   AS THIS LETTER BE MADE PART OF   THE HEARING RECORD.  I DO SINCERELY URGE YOU OPPOSE   THE CONFIRMATION OF MR.  SESSION. THE STATEMENT ATTACHED TO THAT   LETTER IS FAIRLY LONG AND VERY   CONVINCING.  I ARE READ PARTS OF IT HERE. MR. SESSIONS HAS USED THE  AWESOME POWER OF HIS OFFICE TO   CHILL THE PREEXERCISE OF VOTE  BY BLACK CITIZENS IN A DISTRICT  HE NOW SEEKS TO SERVE AS   FEDERAL JUDGE. THIS SIMPLY CANNOT BE ALLOWED  TO HAPPEN. MR. SESSIONS' CONDUCT AS U.S.  ATTORNEY FROM HIS POLITICALLY  MOTIVATED VOTING FRAUD   PROSECUTIONS TO HIS  INDIFFERENCE TOWARD CRIMINAL   VIOLENCES OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS   INDICATES HE LACKS THE   TEMPERAMENT, FAIRNESS, AND   JUDGMENT TO BE A FEDERAL JUDGE.  A PERSON WHO HAS EXHIBITED SO  MUCH HOSTILITY TO THE  ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE LAWS AND  THUS TO THE EXERCISE OF THOSE  RIGHTS BY BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD  NOT BE ELEVATED TO THE FEDERAL   BENCH. THE IRONY OF MR. SESSIONS'   NOMINATION IS THAT.  IF CONFIRMED HE WILL BE GIVEN  LIFE TENURE FOR DOING WITH   FEDERAL PROSECUTION WHAT LOCAL   SHERIFFS ACCOMPLISHED 20 YEARS   AGO WITH CLUBS AND CATTLE  PRODUCTS.  -- PRODS.  THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY MR.   SESSIONS IN REGARD TO THE 1984   VOTING FRAUD PROSECUTIONS  REPRESENTS JUST ONE MORE   TECHNIQUE USED TO INTIMIDATE   BLACK VOTERS AND THUS DENY THEM  THE MOST PRECIOUS FRANCHISE. IN THESE INVESTIGATIONS MR.  SESSIONS AS U.S. ATTORNEY  EXHIBITED AN EGGERNESS TO BRING  -- EAGERNESS TO BRING TO TRIAL,  ALBERT TURNER, DESPITE EVIDENCE  CLEARLY DEMOCRAT STATING THEIR   INCENSE. HE SOUGHT TO PUNISH OLDER BLACK  CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS,  ADVISORS AND COLLEAGUES OF MY  HUSBAND, WHO HAD BEEN KEY  FIGURES IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS  MOVEMENT IN THE 1960'S.  THEREFORE, IT IS MY STRONGLY   HELD VIEW THAT THE APPOINTMENT   OF MR. SESSIONS TO THE FEDERAL   BENCH WOULD IRRAP PRAABLY  DAMAGE THE WORK OF MY HUSBAND,   AL TURNER, AND COUNTLESS OTHERS  WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES AND   FREEDOM OFERTE PAST 20 YEARS TO  INSURE EQUAL PARTICIPATION IN  THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. CLEARLY IF THESE CRITICISMS SET  FORTH IN THIS STATEMENT, THE   ENTIRETY OF WHICH WILL BE MADE   PART OF THE HOUSE RECORD, IF   THESE STATEMENTS INDICATE, AS  THEY DID TO THE UNITED STATES  SENATE IN 1986, THAT MR.   SESSIONS SHOULD NOT BE A   DISTRICT COURT JUDGE, THEY ALSO  ARGUE THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE  BEEN CONFIRMED AS ATTORNEY   GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES.

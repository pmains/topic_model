hey so we are here at the downward stroke sanitary district where we have just um handed over a cartoonishly big million dollar check um for improvements to the the sanitation district and i want to let my much smaller friends and colleagues here introduce themselves and talk a little bit about what the projects are doing i'm amy underwood i'm the general manager of the dumbest growth sanitary district i'm bob swarsky i'm the service system maintenance supervisory share a little bit about what we're going to do with this money and what's on the challenges that you're facing in the damaged sewage treatment research flows well what we're going to do is we're going to rehabilitate 42-inch new concrete pipe sewer line carries the majority of the gravity flow all the way flow from our service areas in downwards road and west mountain and we're going to rehabilitate that extend its life [Music] and help us maintain an expected level of service for all our customers all right so you gotta you gotta dump that down what's up what happens if we don't maintain an expected level of service to the good people well these planes are critical into the plant yeah and if they become if they fail or become clogged we could have storage overflows into the creeks and we could have backups into basements and sewage sitting on the streets when i first went to downers grove when oakwood was flooded i was [Music] by this line okay how many folks are directly connected to this improvement i don't know for sure okay um okay and uh i suspect the answer is as soon as we're finally with you but we think we'll be starting in construction [Music] yeah we're ready to go okay but you're not like a seasonal is there a seasonal [Music] sock that's inserted in the line the resin likes cooler temperatures so you know if all goes well fall early winter even when the ground is frozen just for excess issues being beneficial okay okay and just share with you what you were saying about the age of these lines and what you expect to see when you're actually in there before you put this line on there oh okay well the agent signs one of the lines was put in in 1954 it's and it's now the total length that we're looking to rehabilitate is a little under 4 500 feet so half of that is the 1954 line the next line was put in 1987 parallel to it and so they're both suffering from degradation from chemical attack hygiene sulfide and sores is common tree intrusion so it's um it's it's one of those things that we use a assessment of standardized pretty much stabilized assessment to gauge the criticality of these pipes and this pipe um being a critical you know being in where it is it's um you know it has an increased um you know feather would increase the difficulty thank you both for all that you do happy we were without and everybody watching flush with confidence

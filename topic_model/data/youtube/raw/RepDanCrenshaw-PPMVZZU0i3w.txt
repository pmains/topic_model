we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw the angle has landed welcome back folks uh it's a pleasure to have here brigadier general amir avivi and we're going to keep talking about the situation in israel uh as it is ongoing although we had some recent news uh that uh there was a ceasefire so first of all general thank you for being on and um you know you're retired service i appreciate it amazing resume oh yeah yeah really appreciate your your service for your country we fluff it up a lot you know um so you when did you retire from from service you recently retired well i started four years ago i served 30 years in the idf i joined the combat engineers and i served in the core of uh combat engineers from a simple soldier to battalion commander and afterwards i was appointed ada camp of the chief of general staff of bogey alone then i had the chance to see things you know on the more strategic level cabinet meetings prime minister minister of defense and so on and later on uh i commanded an infantry brigade on the egyptian border which was a very very busy border at the time without the fans and the movement of terrorists from gaza into the senate peninsula and into israel so i had a very busy two years fighting terrorism on the southern border and from there talking about gaza i became a deputy division commander of the gaza strip okay it was very interesting i got to be also a combat engineer officer in the gaza strip at the time the the division was still inside gaza and then i returned as a deputy division commander when it was the division was already out deployed outside of gaza and i went back to the corps of engineers i commanded the school of uh combat engineers and the brigadier general i was in charge of the auditing the whole israeli defense establishment all of the idf the ministry of defense and the military industries and so this was fascinating by the way and um when did you retire four years ago four years ago me too um so there was a there was a ceasefire recently announced uh what what do you think about that can we should we have some hope there and what would it take for that ceasefire to hold do you have do you have concerns that it won't hold well we have to understand first of all what is gaza and what's the history of gaza we the past for a long time since the six day war we controlled gaza and then in oslo we left the cities inside gaza there were still communities there jewish communities in gaza but the cities we completely left them and and didn't operate them at all so like the moment we left they started building a rocket factories mortars it's important to note too so so what what year did israel completely pull out of gaza and you're literally removing jews from their homes to leave gaza correct yeah so so it started first before we moved jews from their homes if we first of all we we we didn't want to control the the palestinians themselves so in oslo in the peak of the peace agreement we left the cities and and the control pass to the palestinians and the whole idea was let's see what goes in gaza first and then proceed from there but what actually happened is that the moment we gave the fatah the cities the first thing they did is started building military capabilities started developing rockets it took them something like six years to reach a a a large amount of focus and capability and 20 years ago still with the communities inside gaza and still with the the idea of controlling the egyptian border between gaza and in egypt they started shooting thousands and thousands of rockets on cities in israel and it's amazing this is at the peak of the peace process right it was supposed to be you know their chance to show that they really want peace and they chose to shoot rockets say on jewish towns and end their cities in the surrounding of gaza this first the second stage at the time i was eight to come was sharon's decision to completely disengage which means to kick out six thousand jews from their homes what year was that connect that was in 2006 okay and connect uh gaza to to egypt now at the time i was at the camp we heard about it the chief of staff heard about it in the news we heard about the decision to disengage in the news really it's it's it's it's inconceivable listen i mean this is you you ask me about things that are different between the states and israel i'm sure that decision making in the states doesn't go this way well yeah i don't know who knows a lot of people found out they were fired over the last four years from a tweet so yeah but but nothing that big no that's true i mean you're that is correct there's no way that our military i'm telling you now i told this story for the first time in prime time in israel a week ago while there were rocket shooting in tel aviv wow and and and everybody in israel was shocked because this time what i'm telling you now a week later there was a cabinet meeting and in the cabinet meeting the sharon said i was sitting there he said okay i decided to disengage tell me what's your assessment what will happen and the chief of staff told him listen if you just leave gaza like this while they are shooting rockets from the cities and all the situation and you connect them to egypt in one year gaza will become hamastan al qaeda and hezbollah meaning the land of hamas the land of hezbollah and the latter land of al-qaeda then he asked the same question to the head of the shimbat answered the same question and still he decided to go forward with this plan we disengaged from gaza gaza got connected to egypt there is a 15 kilometers that's something like nine miles a border uh between gaza and egypt and these nine miles through them an endless amount of munition know-how terrorists scientists from iran are flowing all the time since then into gaza and this is how you have tens of thousands of rockets tunnels the anti-tank missiles drones everything inside the iranians are investing billions in the hamas and in this reality till now uh the idf couldn't stop this process because we are outside they are connected to egypt and they are all the time continuously improving their capabilities from time to time and so uh does this does that mean that your answer to my question is that you don't have a lot of hope for uh for how long the ceasefire lasts so i will say this uh basically we have two choices both of them bad one is very bad and one is bad there is no good choices in this situation one choice was conquering gaza obviously it's something we can do we can conquer gaza and we can destroy all the capabilities we did that in uh when we we took over again areas in judah samara because we have the same problem there um but conquering gaza um we think it's not a good idea for many reasons one of them is that the idf needs to be prepared mostly for the iranian threat we are very worried about what's going on with iran the race for nuclear weapons and we are worried about the fact that maybe sanctions will be lifted and they will use the money again to terrorize the whole middle east and destabilize it we are worried about the northern border hezbollah which is much bigger than hamas syria so going into gaza and and operating there it seems to us that it's not a good solution what the idf did now is destroyed basically i would say like 80 maybe more of the capabilities the hamas has their infrastructure it was very effective the idf showed amazing intelligence uh very good work of the air force and navy and the good defense that basically didn't manage to do anything along the border and but now it's the big question what now and and what we suggest my organization i founded a year ago a new organization called israel's defense and security forum enabled it's called the bitcoin esteem and today 2000 israeli high-ranking officers commanders operators joined this organization and it's growing by day every day and we're a very very dominant voice today in in israel what we said we said listen this time we don't need an agreement we we don't need any understandings between us and hamas we need an open ending which means at the moment we finished our missions we are stopping to shoot they obviously want to stop because they're pretty much hurt and now we're going to hunt every single commander of the high ranking commanders of hamas which ordered shooting 4 000 rockets on israel i think these guys need to be on the run i think that these guys should be taken out um and we need to do something completely different from what we did till now we need to work like we do in syria if they try to build forces again we need to keep destroying the capabilities we cannot let once more a situation where in five years they will have 50 000 rockets and then what might happen is and it almost happened by the way that we won't deal only with hamas or inner insurgents but our overall war also is uh hezbollah and iran we're not far away from that so so we need a different approach it's not about conquering gaza but it's about really a pinpointing the the leaders because these guys you know people say in gaza that um people don't have anything to lose and this is what they are fighting but the guys who decide the decisions there they're all millionaires they fly in private jets this is the greatest startup ever there for millions of dollars in their bank account and these guys don't really want to die they have no problem sending others today do you think um talking about the millions of dollars one of the conflicts we have in the us is whether we should um pause or not be aid to uh fatah the palestinian authority president trump stopped it biden uh has reinstated it you know do you think that money is going to some of these operations some of these uh terrorist operations half of the money or even more uh that the fatah gets goes to payment to terrorists and their families and it's also for the terrorists in gaza this money is used to pay all these terrorists that they were killed now in gaza their families will get payment from the u.s money that you are sending to fatah in ramallah what what is different about um there's been some reporting that this is idf took a somewhat different approach there was a really interesting deception operation that happened that got hamas fighters into some tunneling systems and uh you know that was you know being put out in the news that there was going to be some kind of invasion can you walk through that how have so how has the idf learned over time what was different about this operation many things uh first of all i think that in the idf today there is a digital revolution the ability to process information and to distribute it very very fast and very relevant information even to the level of company commander certainly to all the tools that shoot you know the air force navy they all share they are interconnected they are sharing a information uh the intelligence is itself improved dramatically listen the fact that we were able to reveal all the tunnels all the underground tunnels exactly where they are in all of the gaza and and destroy all of them we destroyed 150 kilometers of tunnels which which is pretty meaningful they built it for years they they invested three and a half billion dollars to build these tunnels and this was destroyed in 10 days now they felt that these tunnels are they're a safe heaven you know they felt really that they have a place they can be safe all these terrorists so what the idf did we brought some ground forces we operated as if we are maneuvering their drill is at that moment to go into the tunnels and then once they went in not all of them unfortunately but a certain amount of terrorists a 150 planes orchestrated one attack on these tunnels and and they collapsed with the terrorists inside interesting you know what one of the one of the conversations we have in the us i don't think it really goes anywhere but the idea of of universal service and um we look to countries like yours uh colombia also has universal service a lot of people get out of it but um you know how does that as as a commander so you're you know you're a lifelong commander and you've got a lot of people that are coming in for just that two-year stint and now it's hard to compare to the u.s because i mean you're a tiny tiny country compared to how many people we would have if we were to do that but um just i'm always curious from a mill just as a military guy you know i don't necessarily want people to work for me who don't want to be there do you ever run into that or is there just is the culture just so well attuned to this mandatory service that it just works i think that the strongest thing we have in the idf is the fact that the most talented resourceful intelligent people in israel joined the army and this is this is huge because when they joined for three years you have three years to convince them to go to officers course and to choose a military life and you are choosing from the best of the best that the the country has so uh the i think that uh in discussions i had with different armies in the world maybe this was the the main problem that uh when it's only professional army and people choose it as a profession many times you know some people do it because of values and people in service and so on and some people say i know i can't find another job i might just you know join uh join the military and many very talented people don't go to the military yeah but then that's why in israel they do and the level of the people is incredible you know when i finish 30 years of of a army and they said to me okay 30 years summarize it in one sentence what's the most meaningful thing you can say about your service what i said was the endless amount of uh talent that i that i i saw in in this 30 years it's it's it's inspiring it's amazing yeah that's a good point um one of the one of the things we want to take a step out of you know the the tactical ground situation what's been going on you know is is the you've mentioned it a couple times the issues with iran and your and your fear that iran is racing to a bomb and your fear that sanctions might be lifted and that they'll continue that they will then fund terrorism around the middle east just like they did last time i mean yours your intelligence showed that our intelligence showed that it was fairly obvious we don't want that to happen again um i guess one question would be are they already doing it did and the reason they might already be doing it is because there was indications from our administration that they might lift those sanctions they haven't done it yet but certainly they're signaling that they're open to it is that a problem does that embolden them does that lead to additional uh supplies uh you know funneled toward groups like hamas and hezbollah of course i mean first of all we have to understand the iranians the iranians are completely committed to nuclear weapons everything they are doing is is deceiving the west yeah he's lying we've seen it from the moment the former agreement was signed already when it was signed they were cheating and you know building new installations and and so on uh look no country in the world would suffer such heavy sanctions for so long for nuclear power and still insist that they are you know on their way i mean any any normal country just the world's sanctions would stop if they don't claim it right oh that's so true i mean nuclear power is nice but it ain't that nice you know i mean for them to for them to claim like no we want we want it this bad that we're willing to uh suffer the sanctions and it's a really great point it just doesn't make logical sense yeah i mean i mean listen they are in a stage where they have only four billion dollars left okay this is actually the break point and it's the second time that when the iranians actually get to a break point comes an administration and saves them yeah i mean is it naive i don't get it no i don't get it either and and i can tell you that the sunni arab world feels betrayed and they feel this is an existential threat and they feel that the only country they can rely on today is israel in this sense and this is why by the way they are inclined to to sign peace agreements with israel and get closer and have a greater cooperation um and they iran these are bad guys you know that they build the hezbollah they are terrorizing the sunnis in in syria they are terrorizing yemen and this this is this is not partners i don't know why why this negotiations are going on at all what um you know going back to internally in israel maybe we'll we'll end with this because on the last podcast that we i did deep dive into the differences between fatah and hamas and the political conflicts there and the west bank versus gaza so my audience should have like a good overview of where things are in israel i mean you got to look at a map this stuff is very complex but all of this is going on in gaza right that's that's southwest gaza strip that's where hamas stronghold is what is during all this time has anything been going on in the west bank where the palestinian authority reigns and um you know this is what people commonly refer to as like the refugee camps they're not camps they're just neighborhoods um right but you know this is where ramallah is the capital um what has been going on there has there been conflict there at all is it normal what's going on the biggest problem we had before talking about the fatah in judah is that inside israel within the israeli arab society we had a huge level of rioters at such a big level that we haven't seen since the independence war really crazy attacking jews pogroms in cities and there so on unfortunately within the israeli arab society you have a group and it's not that small uh that is very islamistic and these guys basically don't really recognize israel's right to exist as a jewish state they they are muslim brotherhood they are ideologically affiliated to hamas and hamas managed to really uh affects them in a way that they you know it was it looked at a certain stage that they were going through some kind of civil war yeah and what we saw is that first of all citizens had to defend themselves and then you know you are from texas when i visited texas last time i saw nice church with you know the state of texas and it says here we don't die nine one one in israel they actually died 9-1-1 but nobody came so the citizens had to defend themselves and they and the police was really having a hard time to control this and now it's getting better we're getting more control but but but the lesson learned is we need much more forces talking about homeland security yeah and different balance between homeland security and the military overall so so this wasn't even in the west bank or this is in the west bank oh no this wasn't this was inside israel not okay inside israel and this is this is what this is while the conflict is going on there's this additional unrest right in those neighborhoods yeah so so you see a connection and it's it worries us because you see a connection between arabs in in the west bank arabs in israel valley cities and to enjoy everything israel has to offer 40 000 gdp and you know part of the israeli flourishing democracy and yet they choose to side with hamas and the fatah not all of the society god forbid but you know part of them and then and also with the hamas now talking about fatah look um mazen was supposed to hold elections a month ago when he found out that he's going to lose the elections to hamas because the fatah is divided into four different fractions nobody believes anymore in abu mazen just be clear for the audience he's a he's the leader of fatah right but in israel you guys all call him right and uh basically you know he's 85 years old uh he has been governing the the fatah for many years hasn't been doing any elections it's basically a you know one-man show and once he he decided once again to not have the elections he needed to push attention somewhere else so they usually the usual thing happened immediately it's a blood label about the temple mount it's always the same thing we always take care of keeping the status quo when they want to start attacking what they do they send rioters to the temple mount they started start rioting and throwing stones then the police needs to go into the temple mount to restore law and order because it's a place of prayer and then they say the jews are taking over the temple mount and so on and from there onwards that's it i mean incitement and there and this time there is weapons being stored in al-aqsa mosque too yeah too i mean rocks weapons molotov bottles and so on and then i don't know you know it's such a sacred place i don't see how they really believe it's sacred when they behave like that it's hard to say well look thank you so much for taking the time and um and and helping us with some insight here look we've got a lot of misinformation to correct in the us you see the demonstrations there was one in houston for a pro-palestinian demonstrations we have a member of congress who would who is far more passionate about the palestinian cause than uh her own constituents in michigan rashid ali and she's also a liar i mean a full-on liar and uh constantly presents lies um to make her case this is it's just it's fascinating how these narratives have spread so wide and deep and and young you know naive people are very susceptible to this because they love victims they they they want to you know and i'm giving them a lot of grace here you know the best side of of humanity is rallying around a disenfranchised victim but there's been a there's there's been a false narrative surrounding this for a long time and it's just important to educate people on it yeah definitely i mean look basically palestinians are completely ruling themselves it's the palestinians who chose a terror organization to lead them in in gaza although we you know completely disengaged from there they controlled the whole land they could have been singapore long ago yeah yet they chose a terror organization and they chose to continue fighting and the reason is simple these guys want everything they don't simply don't want jews to exist that's that's the story that's a good question so so somebody on the other side would say no you're keeping them in a prison right that's what that's what shoot it to leave says they say that gaza is a is a prison you're keeping them there you know what so what what do you say to that well that's it's a completely false argument because first of all gaza is connected to egypt how can it be a prison i mean they have a border with egypt and it's open we're not controlling this border we're controlling our border the only thing we are doing is that since there is the endless amount of weapons pouring into gaza and the sea we try to control that at least through the sea these weapons arrive through the sea to gaza but basically a ship can come to a large like a few miles from gaza bring to a rush anything they want and then take it into into gaza to egypt and it's really sad by the way considering the fact that we have peace with egypt that endless amount of capabilities are all the time moving from egypt into gaza this is what's going on because they are completely open to the world we are not controlling gaza in this sense and they are connected to egypt and the other thing is that listen we gave the area they were supposed to simply live in peace they chose to be a terrorist state with tens of thousands of rockets and we need to defend ourselves against that so you know we're doing the best we can to defend itself they are the aggressors and we are defending ourselves well good talk general thank you so much for being on you're welcome thank you very much for having me no it's good an informative episode people will love it appreciate it

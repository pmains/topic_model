I thank my good friend from the Pacific Northwest and I heard we worked it out so I could talk a little Medicare and taxes later and I'm very appreciative before he goes I just want to tell senator Enzi and I see him over there that day in and day out senator Enzi is somebody who gives public service a good name and we have spent a lot of time working together on a variety of issues tax reform and particularly this idea of transition rules so I just want to tell him how much I appreciate the way he approaches problem solving and say to colleagues what I have not been able to figure out for really the ten years this debate has gone on is how we're going to make this work for America's innovators and small businesses and let me give just a couple of examples and be very brief what concerns me most about the bill as it's written today is state revenue collectors under this legislation in effect will be outsourcing their jobs to America small businesses America's innovators and if the bill passes in its present form those small businesses our innovators are going to spend their time trying to figure out how to collect all these taxes across the land rather than creating jobs and I don't think that's anything any of us want to do Democrats or Republicans that's point number one second I want to talk about the international implications of this bill senator murray and I and others senator Baucus we're very close to the border and what concerns me especially after the legal analysis that I received from the Congressional Research Service is I think the way this bill is going to work people are going to end up calling it the shop Canada built or maybe the shop Mexico bill what's even more ominous the shop China bill and I want to describe exactly why that's the case using the legal analysis from the Congressional Research Service the proposal of course quires american businesses to collect sales taxes on behalf of 45 state revenue collectors but it imposes no such burden on foreign retailers that sell into the United States so an Oregon business would have to collect taxes for a New York but Chinese firms wouldn't have to collect taxes for any state washington state businesses would have to collect taxes for Idaho but Canadian firms are under no such obligation and I would just say colleagues what is fair about sacking these American small businesses these entrepreneurs which are adding so much value to the new economy to make it even more difficult for our small businesses to compete with Canadian sellers and European sellers and Chinese sellers this bill as written is going to be a huge boon for example for the idea of setting up online businesses in Canada small businesses all across the country especially those that are near the border in my view would have every financial incentive to incorporate there for the life of me I don't see how that could be good for the American economy or fair to American firms that for a variety of reasons are not capable of moving senator Alexander was spot-on in terms of talking about how we should look to states rights I'm certainly interested in that but let's not do it so that in a globalized economy we make it even tougher for American innovators to compete mr. president at this point I'd ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a legal memo that was prepared for me by the Congressional Research Service that describes in great detail the unfairness that the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act would create for American firms in a global economy without objection mr. president I'll just wrap up with this some madam chair as colleagues look at this and we're going to have plenty of debate on this let's think through the implications of what the administrative water torture is going to be all about for small businesses and why it doesn't make more sense for state tax collectors to do their job number one number two let us not make it harder for American small business to compete in tough global markets it's plenty tough as it is as president I yield the floor

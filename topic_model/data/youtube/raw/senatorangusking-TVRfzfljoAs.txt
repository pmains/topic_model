let's bring in right now independent senator angus King who talks about protesting with dr. Martin Luther King 60 years ago and he marched again this weekend for the same cause senator King joins us now he's a member of both the intelligence and Armed Services Committee so senator I'll ask you we saw Mitt Romney go out a Republican we saw you go out as an independent why did you decide to go out and March this weekend well it wasn't a long considered decision Joe I woke up Saturday morning and said you know I've just got to do this I was at the march on Washington in 1963 as a 19 year old college sophomore I ended up sitting in a tree with a young black guy at the Lincoln Memorial and heard the I have a dream speech it was one of the most moving experiences of my life so I woke up Saturday morning I knew there was a protest and I said you know I've got to go and I walked up the hill and walked by the Supreme Court building on the way to where people were gathering at the Capitol and there up above the entrance of the Supreme Court is all you need to know about what's going on equal justice under law nobody's asking for anything extraordinary or new or special in these protests all they're asking for is for us as all Americans to honor the creed that we all grew up with equal justice under law equal protection of the law all men and women are created equal you know all of that Crown thy good with Brotherhood from sea to science shining sea that's really what this is all about and that's why I wanted to go and and I'm glad I did I didn't want to look back five years from now and say you could have taken part but you didn't so I was there and it was a very important and moving experience I I know you're on the Armed Services Committee I know that you were obviously concerned like so many other Americans in all parties concerned about what you saw on June the 1st when the president cleared had violently cleared park of peaceful protesters to go over and strangely lift up a Bible backwards I'm curious though if you were heartened by the response that you have heard from former chief of from Admiral Mullen former chairman of the Joint Chiefs from the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs : Powell former SEC def James Madison MacRay vain' and also of the news that the active troops have been taken out of Washington DC show that was a a really serious moment our military has never been political and they shouldn't be political in that you know the founding fathers talked about a standing army that was something they were worried about so if we're going to have people that are ready and we do we need to have them prepared and ready for some attack by foreign adversaries not our own people but we've got to be careful and I think one of your guests earlier this morning said said it correctly this is not only a risk for the public it's a risk for the military they've worked so hard to build up their reputation they're one of the most well respected institutions in our society and to the extent they become used in a political way as props or as actually the worst would be to have them out on the streets of America active-duty military that would just be a huge setback and it would undermine everything the the the military has tried to to do in terms of of gaining the confidence the American people the other piece that really bothered me about that was unmarked call him unmarked cars forces out on the street that nobody could tell who they were not only not their names but even what organization they were with that's not America that that's just not appropriate and I think there that's something that ought to be cleared up right away number one we all know who they number two in the future anybody that's out there enforcing the law Otto ought to be clearly identified that is a total breach of political norms and should not happen I hope Congress gets the answers about who those plainclothes officers in riot care were if they were in fact even officers The Associated Press is Jonathan Almir is witness and has a question for you senator Jonathan senator actually two questions for you about the corona virus pandemic first tell us what you want to see now towards the small business loan program the PPP what sort of changes or updates are needed and secondly the president was in your home state on Friday he visited a place where the swabs for the corona virus tests are manufactured but there were reports because he didn't wear a mask during that visit all the swabs that were being made and in the background while he was there had to be destroyed so I want to get your reaction on that as well as the PPP well let me take the second one first I've read I've seen the press reports I don't have I think the company has confirmed that yes in fact they had to destroy the swabs made that day this business of not wearing a mask I mean masks not only will control the pandemic but it's also a matter of personal responsibility you're you're not beautiful you're self that's the danger you're you're endangering other people and and his unwillingness I mean there you see the shots everybody else has a mask on it's it's a it's a it's a terrible disservice to the country to have made wearing a mask some kind of political statement because it's it's it's really the appropriate way to go as far as the PPP the Paycheck protection program there were some good mid-course Corrections taken last week on a totally bipartisan basis of 417 to 1 in the House unanimous in the Senate to try to make it to fix some of the the unintended consequences and I think I think that's appropriate but the overall question of the pandemic though here's what really bothers me there was an implicit contract with the administration back in February in March and that was we the American people will make huge sacrifices stay home not go to work shut down the economy so you can take the steps necessary that we can safely get out of this at a reasonable period of time we kept our side of the bargain the administration didn't I saw something last night where they said proudly three million tests a week it ought to be two or three million a day in order to safely reopen and I did a little calculation last night of four four states of four countries Germany Japan South Korea and Canada generally the same population of America 17,000 deaths versus 110,000 deaths that's an apples to apples comparison the first death in South Korea was the same day as the first death in America we've had a hundred and ten thousand since they've had 272 our response has been inadequate and and that's what really bothers me I'm really worried that we're going to be right back in what amounts to early March in September and we won't have taken the steps on the national level in terms of testing contact tracing and a really concentrated effort to deal with this short of having a vaccine and all of all that we've going through is for naught yeah senator angus King we really appreciate you being with us thank you so much for your insights

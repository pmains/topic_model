thank you mr speaker i rise in support of h.r 4996 the ocean shipping reform act i thank mr johnson mr garamendi and others for joining me in raising the alarm back in march in a letter to the federal maritime commission about the empty container ships leaving american ports this bill follows on that effort offering necessary reforms to federal regulations overseeing the ocean shipping industry in order to address problems alike have been discussed agriculture exports are critical to not only feeding the world but to the livelihood of the producers i represent in nebraska we cannot do that if container ships leave american ports completely empty this bill prohibits foreign ocean carriers from refusing u.s exports unreasonably and gives the fmc more tools to ensure these carriers are held accountable and held to a high standard trade only works if exports reach their final destination in a reliable and affordable way this bill is a great step toward facilitating exactly that it's a reasonable bill i urge a yes vote and i yield back

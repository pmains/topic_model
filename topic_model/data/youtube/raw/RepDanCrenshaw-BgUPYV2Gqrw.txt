we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw hey folks welcome back to um your favorite podcast and today we've got a special guest a friend of mine david bonson and uh i'm going to introduce you real quick david first of all thanks for being on uh it's honored to have you we met um i think we've met a couple times but i just recently was out in um an event with you in uh in california so thanks for having me and thanks for being on the podcast well it was great to have you in uh california and it's now great to be a guest of yours on the podcast so david i'll give you a quick bio background here your managing partner and chief investment officer at the bonson group it's a bi-coastal private wealth management firm with offices in newport new york city and over 3 billion in assets and you're consistently named as one of the top advent of financial advisors in america and uh frequent guest on fox business cnbc bloomberg a regular contributor to national review um i think you're on the board as well for national review institute and um there's actually a long list in your bio uh i won't i won't go too far into it but i think the point i wanted to get across is you know what you're talking about when it comes to financial markets when it comes to what's going on with inflation what's going on with the economy you regularly write and talk about these issues and so look on today's episode i just want to i just want to hit all of it um you know what's going on in the economy what's going on with inflation you've written a lot about the financial crisis of the past and and what what the right narrative about that is and what the wrong one is and it's important to hit on stuff like that because it does inform our policy decision making of the future and of the present so we're going to hit all of those things um what's probably the most pressing economic question though if i were if you were to say dan this is what you should be asking me about right at this moment uh what would that be i think it is the challenge of getting the american economy back to a trend growth and so that makes have a few words in it that sound like it's a little hoity-toity but i could restate it by just simply saying the biggest challenge for the economy is how in the next 10 and 20 years it's going to grow the way it grew in most decades since world war ii and so i'm a gen xer you now have millennials and gen wires that are getting up there in earning years themselves baby boomers are going well into retirement everyone's kind of lived through certain decades of experience economically that has almost entirely been positive in terms of real gdp growth we've had some recessions along the way we have the great financial crisis which i'll talk about later we had competition from japan in the 80s there's talk about competition from china now but it hasn't been a straight line up but we have averaged 3.1 percent real meaning net of inflation economic growth per year for 70 years until we got to this last decade and i believe that we are in a complete cluster as to how to figure out the recovery of that real gdp growth we got one year right touching three percent it was basically a hair below trendline growth during the four years of the trump presidency but the fact of the matter is that there's something broken economically and this isn't a recession we're having economic growth year over year i'm not referring to something related to the pandemic this was going on long before cove but in fact right now our economic growth coming out of covid is going to be the highest growth of that we've had the highest growth year we've had in decades but basically the trendline number is way too low and i consider it an unbelievably important issue morally because it speaks to the opportunity that will be there for my children and their children this is a generational issue you cannot have 30 years a subpar economic growth and be a world superpower yeah okay so if you if you had a magic wand what would be the top three policies that you might implement um to achieve that growth or or policies that you would reverse yeah i mean i think i have to cheat and and before i go into what i would do to fix it we have to diagnose what's caused it yeah and what's caused it is excessive debt and and just like any 12-step program people know you can't solve a problem until you first acknowledge you have it um this is too disputed for us to do anything about it there are too many people that believe that the solution to our economic woes is more debt and because i believe that excessive debt and living above our means societally is the cause of sub trendline economic growth i most certainly don't believe that the solution is in more of the problem any more than i believe the solution for a hungover drunk is more booze so explain explain why why debt uh creates that that sub-economic or sub sub-optimal growth uh first and foremost debt is pulling into the present growth that you will get into the future so this is a tautology this is inherently true that what you have done is borrow against future growth so whatever growth you're going to get into the future will now be lessened by the benefit you got up front now there are productive uses of debt that might give an exponential return a greater boost to productivity for a period of time this is especially especially true in the corporate sector and even in the household sector someone may borrow money personally and then end up getting a greater uh uh use from that you use about funds it is very rarely true in the government sector and even john maynard keynes himself argued that the multiplier effect on government spending was optimal from a point of equilibrium when you start off already far behind the eight ball when you start off with a significant amount of indebtedness you have a diminishing return and so again the first thing we have to do is not so much answer why it is but just make perfectly clear we know that it is and we can measure well it's important to know why i i do want to hammer it out a little bit is it because the money is going into say buying bonds and that money would be better utilized in in private hands instead of tied up in government debt is it because the government just doesn't spend it correctly well yes the second part is very true we the government is not an optimal allocator of capital and the reason for that is twofold a incentives and b knowledge so i'm borrowing directly from the great friedrich hayek here the government doesn't have the knowledge to optimally allocate capital they're not on the ground they can't see the things close up this is very much like a doctrine of subsidiarity people that are most intimate to a transaction are most qualified to allocate resources or to unallocate resources to it based on their intimate level of knowledge and optics they can see things that affect them they have skin in the game they have more awareness it's the genius of a decentralized economy very much so very much so but i also believe that it comes down to an incentive structure where the incentives of the private allocator of capital are very much aligned with growth and productivity and it enhances quality of life for those people who are allocating their own capital when they allocate it well where in the government's case at best they have objective a preservation of capital but at worst they have just simply catering to the instincts of the voters trying to give special interest groups uh what may be needed in particular cases so you get an economy driven by transfer of wealth as opposed to the creation of wealth but i think that we have to measure and actually look at how the diminishing return of government debt has worked over the years it is one of the most violent charts an economist can look at to see the declining return in productivity the less gdp growth you get for more government debt over time and when you start at a position of um 50 percent debt to gdp versus starting at 130 percent debt to gdp that we are now you're talking about an entirely different situation and what's interesting is the left knows this the left is right when they say that when we moved marginal income rates from 70 to 28 percent that was very different than us now trying to move from 39 to 37 you know you get a diminishing return when it's a much lower marginal decrease now i can still believe we should do it and in fact i do but i would acknowledge that there's a diminishing return at those different numbers yet somehow they miss that basic math when it comes to these elevated levels of debt to gdp you have a significant amount of waste a significant amount of malinvestment poor allocation and most importantly congressman you have private actors that are not willing to borrow invest and take risk because the economy has now become run by rent seekers instead of risk takers that's an important that comment you just made is an important reason as to why government debt results in less growth because it does crowd out investment and it's hard to make that it's hard to like prove that argument you know because it's it's not like you can find a case where it happens right you can only find in the aggregate and in long-term trends that it does indeed happen and now it's it's also intuitive it's it's intuitive for the reason that you just said but it's difficult to say like you can't find you know proof that coca-cola didn't invest in this company because you know what i mean it's it doesn't it doesn't work like that there's not like a silver bullet example but in the long term we absolutely see that to be the case and i like what you said about incentives i mean there's this belief on the left that that for some reason the people in government are just better people and that the people in corporations are just worse people and i don't know why so many believe that since so many people work for corporations and not government and so it's almost like you're calling yourself evil it's this sort of this faceless this faceless villain that we make up in our minds but in in the end i don't think either are bad people but i do think that people working in government have very little incentive for for these things that you said for growth and productivity uh very little incentive at all the military tends to be the best place for that because it's inculcated into the culture but even then you really got to get into like some of the more elite units and then it's where this mentality of we must be working at 110 all the time is really inculcated into the culture now that's because you're part of the mission you're part of this elite group it's it's a very different mentality that you just you can't transfer over to other institutions very effectively um you know corporations are always trying that's why they hire x seals to go teach them leadership principles now does it really work i don't know they seem to like it and people make money off of it so sure but uh but it's it's difficult because you're not really part of this trial by fire uh group of people that all went through suffering together and then have a common mission it's just a different environment but at least there's profit incentive in a corporation the government doesn't have any of this so you know it stands to reason that they're not going to be able to accomplish what they that they say they'll accomplish the other point you made which is which seems to be true on the left too is is usually this if if one dollar spent on a on a program is good then 10 must be better and that's always the mentality of the left and if one regulation must be good then 10 more must be better and and so so you get the so you get one hindrance to growth which is the debt because of this notion that if one must be one dollar must be good then 10 must be better you know and they'll say well how could you you have to believe that otherwise you're not compassionate you're not a compassionate person but i would say another hindrance to growth is is you know if you look at our tax code if you look at our regulatory code from 50 years ago compared to now it's much much bigger so how much does that have to do with with some of our our low growth well i think that we are able to use a couple periods in modern american history to prove that it has a significant amount to do with it and that is the growth that was unleashed out of the supply side tax cuts of democrat president john kennedy and the world changing growth that was unleashed of the skyside tax cuts of ronald reagan that what you got to see was a positive illustration of the principle of incentives that on the margin when people were able to keep more of the fruits of their labor there was greater productivity there was more importantly than just the fact that people would go work harder because they could keep more of their income i think a lot of people characterize supply-side thinking that way and it's difficult because i actually think it's true but it is not the heart or essence of supply-side economics what it does is incentivizes investment and see you cannot get a dollar of investment if you don't have first a dollar a savings and this is a an algebraic truth our national savings has to grow for us to have more dollars into investment from which we can go create more productive enterprises investments in factories plants technologies etc every dollar of government spending is what a dollar out of national savings this is so true that they actually write it in the damn gdp formula yeah okay this is algebraically true so every dollar we take out of the national savings to go into government coffers is a dollar that is removed from the productive growth of the economy uh historically we have ample precedent that we get more productivity not just be in the keynesian sense the demand side sense i can't stand this sort of animal spirits talk partially because it goes so against what i believe theologically i don't believe we were made to be consumers i don't think we're here on earth to go eat of someone else's labor we're here to produce and to me the incentives to produce then allow for consumption and they do it in two ways i can't consume unless i first produce i have to make some money so that i can spend it but i also can't consume unless someone else produces what am i going to go buy if someone else didn't make it right so there's two parts production one part consumption in any healthy virtuous cycle of an economy and that's what i believe is the biggest need of the next 10 20 years economically is to for us to get back to a more productivity-minded economic mindset well and to produce also means to pursue some sort of meaning i mean it's it's and i think that maybe gets into your christian faith right the purpose of life is to pursue some kind of higher ends and i mean so i'd like to let you unpack that and how your belief system and your and your faith informs your your economic philosophy but also i mean what do you say to the left because what the left says is well capitalism is that horrible materialism that just turns you into a mindless consumer and but that's but i would argue it that's almost exactly what socialism is uh well in a lot of ways it's literally what socialism is it's literally what marxism is it is this notion that by the transfer of wealth which is a in the material realm that we can generate happiness that the worker the proletariat can be satisfied by having their material means met where i subscribe to you dr arthur brooks kind of popularized this notion the language of earned success i believe there's a reason why almost every lottery winner i've ever met is an alcoholic because okay there is nothing that is so uh feeding about being handed money now for a starving person who was handed a meal i understand i am not unempathetic here and i don't usually go on a personal biography but sometimes i think i need to as a defense mechanism because i am a big donor in the republican world i am an affluent guy and i run a successful business in manhattan and newport beach but i came from nothing my i i had i did not grow i could only buy one pair of shoes a year my my parents went paycheck to paycheck my dad died very young and so for me i truly mean it when i say i have a heart for people struggling the my belief though is that every person can have the life that i've ended up being being able to have by god's grace because what brought about the life i have is honestly exactly what you're describing at what we call a telos a purpose i love working i love having something to work towards and it happens to have produced material prosperity but when you say unpack what my faith has to say about this the irony is the notion of the capitalist being devoted only to ranked materialism is the exact opposite of the creation message that not only do we know that god said i'm making you man in my image that we were to go be co-creators with god we're to go out and participate in productive activities but he couldn't even get out of the first book of the bible without this pro-growth message when he said go subdue the earth rule it name the animals there was a idea for creativity and it was this idea of stewardship to me it carries out throughout the whole biblical story but it carries out in a modern life as well the happiest societies have always been the hardest working ones the most productive and then you create a virtuous cycle you have not only people are happy because they're working hard but they do have material prosperity that is then reinvested and you get the benefits our entire american society right now and every kid at a socialism demonstration and at their college campuses that pay sixty thousand a year for tuition sitting on their 1100 iphones tweeting uh on a 60 on a billion dollar company social media platform about the evils of capitalism every one of them is living off of the the benefits right that have been provided to them by our country's heritage that was so incredibly pro-work and and pro-market well i mean what what is it about this sort of promise of utopianism and this this idea that people everybody else owes you something that some injustice has occurred even though your life is good that there's this belief that some injustice has occurred i i don't know why it's so compelling i suppose it's always been compelling throughout history um it's kind of irresistible that this this notion of utopianism and this this notion that something is just not your fault that any that any uh any lack of or any any sub-optimal situation must be somebody else's fault and not your own the sort of lack of of personal responsibility well this is a subject that's near and dear to my heart my first book i wrote was called crisis of responsibility and that's exactly what the thesis of the book is i think that there is in in post-enlightenment years there was a very popular economic and political philosophy called marxism that i believe essentially teaches that all human existence is uh a narrative of an oppressed and an oppressor and and i think that you go back even into more ancient of times the whole way we got a king was because the israelites were so dissatisfied they felt that they were being ripped off these other nations have these greater things give us a king that will come take care of us and provide these things and really the first samuel uh historical record about how the israelites got a king is kind of the story of where statism came from it's dissatisfied people uh not taking responsibility for their lot in life looking for someone else to come make it better for them and i believe it is primarily a moral and spiritual issue but even if i didn't i think that the historical weight is overwhelmingly clear that people who refuse to play a victim or people who become disinterested in how things got to be this way and more interested in how they can fix it and make it better those tend to be very happy and yes very productive people talk about uh this is not a term i'm familiar with uh but it's a term you're familiar with and it relates to how again how your your faith uh informs your professional life that what are the tenets of kuperian calvinism yeah so abraham kuiper was the prime minister of holland in the 19th century he had started uh the university there he was a very renowned theologian and so kuiper in uh 19th century holland uh who was himself very much trained by the protestant reformer john calvin so it had a lot of roots in calvinist theology it was very um acceptable across much of western europe at the time was this idea that god was engaged in the universe that god cared about the activities on earth but we were now living in the lockheed liberal order there were different spheres so really a great doctrine of church-state separation comes down to sphere sovereignty it was never the idea that the state is separated from the concepts of morality or virtue or law but rather that the state is a separate entity from the family from the church from the individual so kyper kind of popularized the idea there being different spheres in society and yet all of them being of the interest or the purview of god and it is very much my belief that the god of the old and new testament cares about the political world that you work in the financial world that i work in the ecclesiastical world that churchmen work in but what a lot of christians have done over the years is separate the sacred from the secular and they kind of look at the sacred is church work and that's importance to god that's heavenly minded but then you know there's this political and financial and other stuff it's mostly pretty dirty and seedy maybe hopefully you get a little evangelism going on or something but god doesn't really like all that stuff and i think that was largely a byproduct of christians rejecting kuiper and rejecting calvin and instead kind of just surrendering to the forces of the enlightenment surrendering to the forces of darwinism into the 19th century so modernity kind of kicked christians you know what and and throughout 20th century christians became more and more marginalized and where the church now has tried to come back with some political engagement it's unfortunately been almost as sort of a protest movement against just a very narrow set of issues important ones abortion and life and and marriage and other issues like that but they were doing it from a point of playing defense yeah which is understandable but they were they were doing it without a lot of um they were doing it without a lot of i think theological sophistication without a lot of foundation or world view that in fact all of these things see i look at the sixth commandment is also not kill seventh commandment not commit adultery and christians have always said okay the murder side and the marriage side we get we like that but then you get to the eighth ninth and tenth commandments uh thou shall not covet and and steal economic ethics then that's kind of been a little shady or i like to see us embrace the whole thing yeah i think it's an important point it is it is fascinating how you can find truths from the bible that definitely inform economics um it just inform generally how our government is structured and i don't think we appreciate that enough uh how how the bible started with the just the even the idea of rule making for a civilization which is again we take it for granted um and and and you can get those rules really really wrong and you know it's important to have a basis for that and i think i think the bible provides a lot more of that than people realize if you're willing to look for it um talk talk to us about inflation everybody's worried about inflation right now probably rightfully so um in high inflation your money is worth less your savings become worthless it's not a it's not a great place to be uh you want you want a generally speaking you know economists try to shoot for about a two percent inflation uh target right now we're much higher than that so what caused it um and how do we get a hold of it well i have a view on this that i think is very important and i'm very concerned about a lot of my friends on the right who think they're going to score some political points on this issue i think they're going to go into the midterm year and possibly and totally unintentionally deliver an incredibly helpful talking point to the biden administration because when we look at inflation as rising prices and you see prices rising right now there's a few different things going on and for us to jump into kind of a narrative that i think it makes for pretty good talking points on like a fox news interview and i'm on fox news all the time i'm not critical of that but i don't think it allows a full nuance around what's going on a whole bunch of prices have gone up because they went down so much during the pandemic so the big move higher is largely related to what they call base effect secretary yellen has referred to this term a lot some prices have inflated because they had previously in very short-term memory deflated that's not inflation it's not sustainable but it's also not the whole story now what a much bigger story and also a complicated one or supply chain disruptions prices go higher when you're unable to get less of the goods and services you need to run your economy so again we have to start with what is the definition of inflation and i do hold to milton friedman's definition although i add the nuance that he also added it's too much money chasing too few goods and services he codified that in a time where there was a very constant level of velocity meaning the money turned over very consistently in the economy you bought something they took it and bought something we have been living now since the financial crisis and it started even before then with utterly collapsing velocity that money does not turn over and this is what creates inflation greater money supply that's the easy part times velocity money turning over my view is that velocity cannot go higher without loan demand and loan demand cannot go higher with excessive government indebtedness that people borrow less money to invest in new projects because of the same thing we spoke about earlier so many conservatives hear me give this spiel and they say oh so you're saying everything's okay we don't have to worry about inflation i'm saying that's kind of true i'm not saying we're going to have an earthquake but i am saying we're going to have a hurricane because i consider japanification or disinflationary forces or extended decades of low slow and no growth to be worse so in a lot of ways what i'm saying is not a positive but i believe it's a different economic problem than one just seeing prices going higher and saying oh that must be inflation well so how do why do i get away with saying i don't think this is inflationary um look lumber prices went up huge now they're down 50 in the last month we know that's all screwed up there's supply-related anomalies around lumber um used cars going up seven percent in a month there's supply chain issues it's not normal what is the judge and jury of inflation it's the bond market trillions and trillions of dollars of people acting in their self-interest are right now loaning the united states government their money for as of today that we're recording 1.35 percent for 10 years when we started talking about inflation four months ago it was 1.8 percent the bond yield has dropped even further when president reagan left office we had 900 billion dollars of national debt and the ten year was at nine percent we now have 27 trillion dollars of national debt and growing we'll run a three trillion deficit this year and probably close to two next year and the bond yield is one six of that one-seventh of that i don't understand that i don't understand that incentive i i wouldn't tie my money up for ten years for one point three percent so who does who's doing it i don't know you have you have other countries that are also overly indebted that have to uh take their dollars or their uh their own currency and put it somewhere and on a relative basis the u.s treasury looks better than a lot of european sovereign debt or or japanese sovereign debt but what we have is this exact same story having played out in japan since the late 1980s 30 years of disinflation 30 years of low slow and no growth they've had no real gdp growth for decades yeah they've had some nominal but not much what what do you think the fed should do do you think the fed is on the verge of raising interest rates to deal with inflation or do you think that they they they think it's temporary and will keep interest rates low no at a 1.3 percent 10-year the fed can't raise the short-term interest rates they'll invert the yield curve and push us into recession i think that they view the short end of the curve they will use the rhetoric of helping the job market as long as they can but they know that they are stuck at the zero bound which is the term for being bound with the interest rate down near the zero percent range and congressman i don't think there's any precedent for a central bank getting off of the zero bound when they're set for whatever reason i vehemently disagreed with them when he did it but when the president uh was yelling at uh fed chair jay powell back in 2018 you know lower rates lower rates he was trying to get our fed funds rate the r the only interest rate the federal reserve can control up to about two percent they got it down to zero at the financial crisis and they left it there for seven years and then he got it up to two percent for about a minute yeah then the credit markets threw up in the fourth quarter of 2018 the president was tweeting at him every second and on january 3rd 2019 he said okay i surrender we're not going to keep doing quantitative tightening and we're going to be cutting rates they you can't get an economy dependent on low interest rates and undo it yeah that's that's the challenge that they have now does that mean the fed just has less tools i mean because that's one of their main tools is i'm not sure what other tools they have really um and does that mean that in if we have a serious crisis of growth in the future we can't really rely on the fed to do anything about it yeah one of the really interesting things during the covent moment was that they still had 150 basis points 1.5 was where the the fed funds rate was generally they like to be you know every time greenspan was cutting rates he was at three four five percent so he could move the needle when he went to cut rates one and a half down to zero wasn't a lot but it was something but when you're at zero you can't cut further now we learned after the financial crisis never to underestimate their creativity what other tools do they have well the next tool became quantitative easing so they buy bonds hand over fists with money that doesn't exist it's not a very efficacious tool that money doesn't end up into the economy it just sits at excess bank reserves but it helps create a little liquidity in the financial system and it signals to markets that the fed's there to accommodate thank god in our country you guys limit what the fed can do the fed cannot go buy stocks the fed cannot inject money directly now they found really creative ways with the cares act and out of tarp to kind of get around some things and some of them by the way i think were effective yeah but you know them buying junk bond etfs and things i mean it's just highly distortive to markets and it's a tremendous moral hazard but japan their central bank owns 60 percent of their bond market our fed owns less than 20 of ours so um can they issue a trillion dollar bill zero coupon uh and buy it from the treasury and and just sort of use that as a back door way to monetize fed debt legally they could but they have to maintain some credibility and i know people say the fed's shocked credibility but that's a tough sentence to utter because it's all relative to other central banks our feds still have some credibility relatively speaking they start doing shenanigans like that it will fall apart very quickly i think the public gets really frustrated with with this subject because it just feels like a shell game i mean it's hard for me to understand to be perfectly honest about like how this money is moving around if it's real money if it's not real money um i promise you you understand it i promise you you understand it more than 90 of your colleagues yeah that's a scary thought um one one question i know people have is when we say the fed is printing money what does that actually mean like because it doesn't mean they're literally print i mean sometimes they might be literally printing it like well the fed can't only treasury can but yeah i mean all it doesn't mean anything it's an old talking point from the right in the 70s that they've never got rid of and so i am really sympathetic to a simplistic use of that language with quantitative easing the fed is using a computer entry to buy bonds from banks so they're crediting the bank cash and they're taking the bond and they're doing it with money that prior to the computer entry didn't exist does that sound like printing money yeah it sure does but the problem is that the treasury still owes the fed that money the fed has an asset called a bond and the treasury has a liability called the bond yeah right it's a it's it's an even transaction in dual entry accounting the bank has the cash that was credited to them so now how does that become printing money loan demand you and i can take any money we have and put it in our bank all we did is take money that already existed and put it somewhere else if we move it from wells fargo to city all we've done is transfer we've created no new money the only way we create new money is by borrowing more money borrowing money gets the bank to send money that the fed had created from a computer screen out of thin air and it then comes into the system i see most borrowing the guys like you and i do is refinancing of debt so we're not creating any new money you buy pay off one loan and buy it take a new one or something most loan demand comes from companies corporate america is already so re-levered that this is why i'm i'm not in that inflation camp because all the good borrowers they were really um needing to kind of reflate after the financial crisis and they borrowed and put it to productive use if they're borrowing at three percent and putting it in projects that generate 10 percent they're doing well but now their leverage limits are realized their debt to income ratios are maxed out the good borrowers so either you get you're pushing on a string because you can't get much more borrowing out of the good borrowers or you get bad borrowers and we don't want that so you kind of get stuck that's what happened it was maybe a good segue to the financial crisis of 2008 that's what that's what happened basically um you you call it predatory borrowing yeah so yeah yeah so in that case go ahead no i said hey so go ahead and unpack it you know just tell the public what what happened there yeah i mean my my thesis you know to give context i was a managing director at morgan stanley throughout the financial crisis and had built a successful business at one of the country's largest wall street firms and lived through it it was an extremely existential moment for me not only professionally and economically but i was intellectually determined to understand what the hell had happened okay and what i found was that more or less there were some really good books written after the crisis there's plenty of material out there but very quickly things fell into a narrative of either the government did it fannie mae freddie mac the fed did it that might have been a few more libertarian types and so forth and then certainly there was a very large movement of wall street did it and the greed and the lack of regulation and things like that and whether one was blaming the big investment banks of wall street or the credit agencies or the mortgage brokers or they were blaming um government housing policy and all that type of stuff all of it had a really big problem for me is that all of it was a little bit true there was some truth to each of these points but every single one whether the right was blaming government or the left was blaming wall street all of them still held main street out as the victim all we disagreed with was who the bad guy was but the good guy was definitely main street and the whole question was was main street screwed by the government or were they screwed by wall street and it's just patently false and and so as i uh covered throughout my research i i really was blown away by what a moral and cultural crisis it was folks uh living outside of their means and looking to to be bailed out at the end of it uh that's not to say that plenty of bad actors on wall street didn't facilitate it uh it's most certainly true that a lot of the equity holders of wall street received bailouts now citigroup stock to this day is down about uh 85 percent from where it was pre-crisis fannies and freddies were blown out lehman's gone aig had to totally recapitalize but um look they still were allowed to live to fight another day and people can disagree about those decisions forever i think the way in which a lot of it was done was reckless totally responsible but we have to remember what caused those financial positions were people that had borrowed money that couldn't or wouldn't pay it back right and the most common form of default was a strategic default and it was in non-recourse states states where they couldn't go after your personal assets so ground zero financial crisis was california florida arizona nevada there is a reason those four states had the lion's share of these defaults that kind of bled into the financial crisis is those states all do not allow recourse financing uh people would not have walked away from their home they bought a home that they thought was worth eight hundred thousand they borrowed eight hundred thousand the homes now were six hundred thousand because they bought in a bubble and they say well i'm not going to keep making payments on something i'm down 10 20 on so they walk away and there is to me an unbelievably important lesson here about morality moral people pay their bills yeah and i borrow from amity schlei's masterful work on the great depression when i talk about what happened in the depression and we didn't have 10 unemployment we had 30 unemployment and the line you would say about the people struggling in the depression 1930s was they pay they pay they may work in breadlines and and three jobs and there was all kinds of social and economic ills but people thought it was um bad on them to not pay a bill where in newport beach california in the financial crisis if you bought six condos they go upside down you walk away from it you not only did something that i consider immoral and reflecting bad character you went to the bar friday night and bragged about it it was there was no shame in not paying your bills and then being a victim and then claiming to be a victim i mean that's yeah it's so it's important to get that perspective out there i think it's true i mean when you because because it is true none of this would have happened if people were just paying their bills and we we shouldn't romanticize the people who did this like they're not necessarily victims um and it's that there's there's there's a real consequence to a lack of responsibility and for some reason the left has doubled down on this very dangerous notion and you see it with student loan payments you know like you're a victim because you took out a student loan why like why does somebody owe you something for that you know what do you think happens if you just cancel rent i mean what do you think happens like what do you you will create another 2008 crisis for sure um well and that's exactly right because what you've done is you've treated the problem with more of the problem you you there is no attempt to explain how free exchange is supposed to work how individual responsibility um risk reward uh were there people that were uneducated uninformed and were naively duped by a very aggressive mortgage broker in the financial crisis of course there were now first of all all of those stories put together soaking wet we're not systemic right not even quite i think that's definitely true but i still believe at the end of the day that we don't treat someone who is uninformed in a transaction and say therefore the solution is we want to leave you uninformed and just simply transfer money we want to have a society that values individual responsibility that avoids moral hazard well and and i don't think we got that right now that gets into a good conversation on welfare policy um again speaking about growth which is how we started this conversation i would say that one of the impediments to growth is perhaps a a welfare system that creates dependency instead of um instead of promotes a a path forward and out of dependence and now that's tricky uh because you want to help somebody who's downtrodden you want to help somebody who truly needs it we don't have an interest in assist in a modern society that that leaves people starving that leaves people homeless and so a safety net is in order here and um but how do you get that safety net right now you know is it is it making our entire welfare system looking like an earned income tax credit is you know because at least at least you've aligned incentives in the correct way i would say yeah it probably is i would say yeah um and you know talking to paul ryan was a guest on this podcast this is something he's been passionate about forever is fixing poverty in america and it's like how many how many 80 plus poverty programs do welfare programs do we have in this country could you imagine trying to navigate that as a poor person it's terrible you know why not simplify the whole thing and and and put incentives the way they need to be and then you're not tying up that money in unproductive ways because that's again getting back to our initial principle that was laid out well and i think that for me a lot of this which i'm pretty unapologetically committed to linking to my faith worldview um i view the human being as too special and and too dignified um too important to the human being's creator to allow them to just merely be the recipient of someone else's largesse i think that at the end of the day the biggest criticism of most governmental approaches to poverty are not merely the economics and inefficiency and bureaucracy and alphabet soup of everything but they do start with a basic vantage point that views someone uh to as a dependent unit on the state not a human being created with dignity who has productive capacity as agency and we can fix a lot of these things on the margin very temporary programs safety net issues most of it by the way very localized but my point being we can do philanthropy in this country what we cannot do is start our approach to this subject by ignoring the fundamental problem which is that all people need to be treated as if they are made with dignity and i think that that's what the modern welfare system has done and unsurprisingly everything it's done since then has gone wrong yeah i think that's uh i think that's accurate and again like this what i like about unpacking it's been a while since i've done a really focused economics uh podcast but what i'd like to point out is this stuff isn't rocket science um you if you establish a good moral society it doesn't have to be perfect but it has to be generally in the right direction i think america has that a good sense of right and wrong a good a good a good notion the notion that that property right should be protected that that that the right to pursue you happiness should be protected and you allow that creativity to thrive you will get more prosperity than you could ever imagine and i think reminding people of that basic truth over the last couple hundred years is is really paramount to the next 200 years if we're going to save the next 200 years because there's just so many people who just don't believe it especially young people now again do they know what the hell they're talking about when they say they support socialism vast majority have no clue but uh and they're probably more libertarian than they even realize so that maybe would hopefully give me some hope but um it's it's it's we we have to get used to the fact that we're always going to be on defense and continue to continue to teach these ideas over and over again well i love what you said i love what you said to jordan peterson on this podcast uh playing defense is a good thing when what you're defending are the principles of the american experiment um so i think you're right we have to get used to playing defense i'd like us to play it better i like us to play it with a with a long view um but i agree we are defending things and we'll have to perpetually do that uh that issue about young people and socialism is tough because a big part of me doesn't believe that they really like socialism a big part of me just thinks that they hate capitalism and i want to present capitalism better than we've presented it i want to present i don't really like the term capitalism for one thing i think the the notion of free enterprise of a free and virtuous society um there there are things that capture the spirit of it much more i think marx would like the term capitalism to describe our worldview but i don't i don't think it is holistic enough but ultimately i think that young people hate cronyism and i hate cronyism i think young people hate in student debt that um allowed an administrator at like a c level college to boost up tuition prices to 60 000 a year when they are producing no product that would possibly be considered employable at a level to service that debt i think young people hated seeing their parents in real financial agony 10 15 years ago through the financial crisis i'm sympathetic to all that stuff but i also think there's a crisis of morality a crisis of responsibility and what you see within quote unquote young people is this top 10 or 20 percent that are just gonna take over the world they're unbelievably productive uh innovative intelligent resourceful and so that's that's that's the part that's so tricky right now is the meritocracy is under attack and i want to defend the meritocracy yet i don't i want to defend it by getting people in kind of the middle bands to up their game i don't want to defend the meritocracy by asking the productive people to take a couple steps back it just is not un-american yeah and that does seem to be the goal right it's that sort of equalization and race to the bottom and you can't imagine a worse a worse way to do it and it's hard to contend with that ideology because it's easy for them to pretend like they have morality on their side like they have some some higher sense of compassion uh higher than you anyway and you know but the truth is there's always going to be a top ten percent at any kind of game and and civilization is basically a series of games that you play against each other and competition and a utopianist might have you believe that you can you can play this socialist game but it inevitably does not work um and we've got to educate our next generation on that um and because it leads to silly policies so for you know we'll talk about worker shortage this will be one of the last questions i ask and you know what do we do about that how do we get people to get the skills that they need uh and apply for jobs so the the biggest complaint i hear from from employers over these last few months it's getting a little better depending on which state you're in but the biggest the biggest complaint is they can't even get people to to apply and they might even contact old employees and they'll say i'm way i'm just waiting until those benefits uh expire then i'll come back i mean so that's part of it but but i feel like it's it's there's a deeper cultural problem here well there most definitely is it's and it's a negative feedback loop it's a it's a deeper cultural problem that gets treated with a really bad government policy that makes a worse deeper cultural problem and then you rinse and repeat and our declining labor participation force is a societal disaster and then this treatment of extended federal government unemployment subsidies on top of the direct transfer payments and on top of the state funded unemployment insurance which are mostly funded entities providing incentives to people to not work look this is what i don't think people understand those folks that end up playing this out all the way to the end and they go look i was getting almost equivalent about 20 bucks an hour from the government plus i got a couple thousand bucks here and there in direct payments i didn't have to work now it comes to an end september i'll go back and get a job then but there is a cost that we will never be able to pay back of them missing out on those months or years of training of community of skill development of solving problems of working through conflicts there if you believe a healthy economy is a story of human action and a story of productive human activity you cannot take people out of the game and expect them to get back in the game and think that now you're just picking up where you left off you're going to be playing catch-up and those are lost productivity units that you don't get back there's no makeup here and so i think that this is a disaster economically but also spiritually and morally because it feeds the number one biggest problem in our society right now for people who still care about this alienation people feel alienated there's no church there's no synagogue there's a deteriorating family unit there's no rotary club there's no bowling night okay we have no civil society and then we want to take people out of their jobs now i understand in upper west side and in scottsdale arizona and i purposely used a left-wing city in a right-wing city that they still have yoga classes and peloton and spin that's fine they have their sort of secular religious activity that produce a community that works in their affluent kind of realm but i really believe that this is the problem we face right now is that people do not have telos purpose and then we pay them to not go work which is at least the first thing we have to be doing there's plenty to do beyond it but you have to get people into daily activity and why we don't understand this or care about it is totally beyond me because i would think this is intuitive even if i were not a political junkie they're an apolitical person i don't believe the millions of people who read hillbilly elegy related to the book and loved the book because they were political he didn't really write it politically they kind of uh identified with this story of alienation and felt empathy but you don't have empathy for people by encouraging them to not work no you don't so there's been some good um revelations i think for people to understand about personal responsibility from this show and also about just the the policy implications of inflation so i want to make sure we get that right because a lot of people are like well look we spent trillions of dollars therefore there's inflation you disagree with that and say like the a better explanation of the inflation look you can still blame democrats for this guys like because because i think the supply chain disruption which caused the inflation was from the people who wanted to lock down the economy unless they checked that one republicans so it was uh it's still democrats fault everybody don't worry but to your point we need to get our our points correct on this and um and and let's let's hopefully your optimism is correct and that inflat that inflation does sort of um level off uh here here shortly um i just thought that was a really interesting point and and the point we need to be making about debt it's still bad but it's bad because of what it does to investment uh what it what it does to uh growth so that's that's exactly right and those two are one and the same what it does to investment is what it does to growth by stifling investment at stifle's growth yeah and i think that's intuitive um well david thank you so much for for being on uh that was a one went by fast quick hour um yeah but we covered a lot i really appreciate you having me on congressman i enjoyed the conversation immensely yeah and uh we really appreciate it i think the audience loved it we learned a lot so david bonson appreciate you being on

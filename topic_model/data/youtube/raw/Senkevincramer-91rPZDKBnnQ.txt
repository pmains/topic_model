all right alarm bells on capitol hill and should be in your household too over a chinese food manufacturer's purchase of 300 acres of farmland in north dakota just 20 miles from an american air base one air force major warning any data collection from the grand forks base would quote present a costly national security risk causing grave damages to the united states strategic advantages uh north dakota center kevin kramer wants to review the purchase senator what could you tell me about the land that this chinese company bought well first of all brian it's 370 acres near grand forks north dakota which is in the heart of the red river valley in other words it's very productive farmland also importantly it's about 12 miles from the grand forks air force base which is a very sophisticated isr base they fly global hawks uh that just we just put in a new uh ground station for the first tranche of uh of uh satellites by the uh space development agency so it's a very important uplink downlink data center hit there at the ground force air force base national security concern so proximity both to important farmland and to an important air base make this particularly problematic well let me ask someone how did this come to your attention are you concerned about it you be you are a capitalist you are a successful businessman so you understand that but are you concerned i am concerned i'm concerned about the proximity to the air base but i'm i'm more broadly concerned brian about the fact that china is able to come in and continually make investments buy property you know enter into our supply chain our food supply chain right here in the united states remember during the pandemic it was discovered that china's ownership of meat processing in the united states made our meat supply vulnerable and if we haven't learned about the vulnerability of food supply energy supply other critical minerals and pharmaceuticals from china we aren't learning very quickly so yeah i'm very concerned about i've been opposed to this from the beginning quite honestly been quite outspoken about it but now we're asking for a further review by cipheus and i just imagine you can get democrats to to support you in this beth waldek from north dakota a resident uh was on with laura ingram last night she's worried about this listen they were being told hey we're going to bring jobs to your area we're going to increase agricultural production in your area and if you know anything about north dakota we're an agricultural state they're not going to come in and say hey while we're building this factory here you don't mind if we do a little spying on the side do you that i mean they just don't do they don't operate that way they just do it you know that's that's the way any enemy operates you don't ask for permission to infiltrate your enemy's backyard senator that's some legitimate concerns and i have an idea let's see if we can get some investors and buy some farmland next to a military base in china i hear they got some fertile land how would that go over yeah well we're a very open system brian there's no question about that the chinese have taken advantage of that openness in the united states we've willingly brought them in in many respects as have a lot of other countries but a lot of other countries have learned their lesson including countries much closer to china than we are we are not desperate for this investment in north dakota or anywhere in the united states but particularly north dakota we can do better than this and thankfully there are people like beth and several other concerned citizens who did sign the alarm i think when the investment opportunity first came it was not known that the chairman was a you know an activist in the chinese communist party but as soon as that concern became known we should have gotten out of it now though we are seeking further review uh from a national defense perspective i'm confident that that we'll find lots of concern in the federal government senator don't let it happen i mean i know democrats will support it and i know in the house they have a uh they are moving a usda fda funding bill uh that would ban china russia north and north korea and iran from doing the same thing so i think americans would support it and i think we just got to be a little bit more savvy and keep our eyes open i completely agree i think a strategic decoupling with china is absolutely the right move for the united states of america and we ought to be very deliberate about it and we ought to be very quick about it and the good news is you told me the right that senator warner also understands the concern so hopefully you'll get some bipartisan support here senator thanks so much

MARC: WE LEARNED A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION FROM TODAY'S HEARING. HERE TO HELP US BREAK IT ALL DOWN IS CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, A MEMBER OF THAT HOUSE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING THE JANUARY 6 ATTACK. THANK YOU PER JOINING US. SO MANY GOOD HEAD LINES FROM THIS HEARING TONIGHT. WHAT WAS THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAY THAT YOU BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO? >> AS YOU ARE MENTIONING, THERE WAS A PIVOTAL MEETING ON DECEMBER 18 IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE SOME OF THESE OUTSIDE ALLIES THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO URGED TO SEIZE VOTING MACHINES FROM THE STATES THAT HE LOST. HIS WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL AND OTHERS ON THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF REFUSED TO GO ALONG WITH THIS. IT WAS ONLY HOURS LATER THAT TRUMP RESORTED TO THE MOB. THAT'S WHEN HE SENT OUT THAT TWEET, HAVING FAILED THROUGH OF THESE -- ALL THESE OTHER EXTREME MEASURES. HE SUMMONS A MOB TO WASHINGTON. HE KNOWS THERE'S ANGRY BECAUSE HE'S MADE THEM ANGRY. HE KNOWS THEY ARE ARMED. HE HAS TOLD THEM THEY ARE ARMED AND HE STILL WANTS THIS MOB TO DESCEND ON THE CAPITAL. TO ME, THAT'S PRETTY DEMING EVIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENT'S INTENT AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO ENDANGER THE LIVES OF OTHERS. MARC: PREMEDITATION. WHAT TODAY'S HEARING DEMONSTRATE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S CONTROL OVER THE MOB? >> IT DEMONSTRATED THAT ON JANUARY 5, AS THE MOB STARTS TO ASSEMBLE ON THE MALL, HE'S REALLY EXCITED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE COMING AND HE'S EXCITED BY HOW ANGRY THEY ARE. HE KNOWS HE COULD USE THEIR ANGER, HE COULD USE THEIR SIZE TO INTIMIDATE CONGRESS. THE THING LEFT TO SUBMIT THE RESULT OF THE ELECTION IS THAT JANUARY 6 SPECIAL SESSION THAT SHE'S EXCITED BECAUSE HE THINKS THE LEFT IS CHESS FOR ASH LAST -- THE LAST DISH EFFORT WILL BE WILLING. MARC: OATH KEEPERS, PROUD BOYS. DESCRIBE THE PARTICULAR DANGER THAT THEY POSED ON THAT DAY AND WHETHER THEY ARE STILL A THREAT. >> THEY ARE VERY MUCH TO LIFT THREAT. THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S BOND WITH THOSE GROUPS CONTINUES TO POSE A THREAT. THESE ARE MILITANT GROUPS, WHITE NATIONALIST GROUPS. THEY HAVE LEADERSHIP THAT WANTS TO BE ESSENTIALLY THE ARMED MILITIA FOR DONALD TRUMP, AT LEAST IT DID ON JANUARY 6. AND AS THE WITNESSES TESTIFIED TODAY, THEY ARE WILLING TO USE ARMS IN THE REBELLION AGAINST THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU SEE IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES. WE ARE NOT YET -- USED TO SEEING THAT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THEIR IDEOLOGY, THEIR WILLINGNESS TO USE VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO POSE A THREAT. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FBI ASSESSES THE DOMESTIC TERRORISM THREAT NOW EXCEEDS THE THREAT OF TERRORISM FROM OFF OF OUR SHORES. MARC: WOW. SO MANY THINGS I WANT TO ASK YOU. I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME. A THING HAPPENED AT THE VERY END. LIZ CHENEY SAYING THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT TELEPHONED A WITNESS WHO IS SET TO TESTIFY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? THERE WAS A REFERRAL TO THE ABOUT THAT. IS THIS AN ATTEMPTED -- AN ATTEMPT TO TAMPER WITH THE WITNESS? WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? >> IT WAS AN EFFORT TO INFLUENCE THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESS. THE WITNESS REFUSED TO GO ALONG WITH IT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PRECISELY THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO TELL THAT WITNESS. BUT WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO INTERVENE TO INFLUENCE THEIR TESTIMONY. WE WANT TO CALL HIM OUT ON IT SO THAT OTHER WITNESSES NO, IF THEY GET AN APPROACH FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT PRIOR TO THEIR TESTIMONY, THEY NEED TO LET US KNOW ABOUT IT. WE ALSO WANT THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO KNOW THAT WE ARE WATCHING VERY CAREFULLY. ANY EFFORT TO INFLUENCE OR INTIMIDATE A WITNESS IN ANY WAY, WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE EVIDENCE GETS TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. MARC: THANK YOU FOR JOINING U

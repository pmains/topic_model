thank you and i thank the ranking member and i rise today to speak against h.r 2543 this bill does not address the underlying causes restricting access to credit or inflation that has eroded many americans borrowing power it's just a mixed bag of extra mandates on the federal reserve and new regulatory burdens on small businesses i don't hear my small businesses asking for more regulation additional compliance burdens or the imposition of a sweeping social agenda families are struggling to afford food and gas small businesses are struggling to hire employees and my local banks and credit unions are filling the pinch of inflation and rising interest rates every day if the majority was serious about helping americans they have made my amendments in order to examine the effects of inflation and bank consolidation on access to credit for those in low-income census tracts rural counties racial minorities women and veterans the very communities that democrat policies have hurt the most my amendments would have been a step in the right direction but the democrat majority blocked them mr speaker digging the hole deeper is no way to get out of the crisis the democrat administration and democrat majorities in congress have created i yield back

hi everyone i'm senator roger marshall from the great state of kansas and i want to welcome you to another episode of ag talk with doc for this month's episode i want to take you back to a recent trip i took to the united states mexico border it was on this trip where i met with a dozen texas farmers and ranchers in falfurious which is about 75 miles north of the border these ranchers are experiencing tremendous difficulties due to the inhumane border crisis that joe biden's policies have created falfurious is located along an area between where smugglers drop off illegal migrants and where they are picked up by others it's a hazardous area with treacherous conditions for migrants who have often traveled thousands of miles in some cases they travel two or three days without water in the texas heat it's because of these conditions that texas farmers and ranchers in the area are facing a daily invasion of illegal immigration on their property what's more they're finding dead bodies on their property almost every day it truly is a human tragedy in every sense of the word when the migrants do survive the trek oftentimes they leave behind destruction of property like you just couldn't believe texas farmers and ranchers wake up each day to find break-ins piles and piles of garbage torn down fences destroyed gates vehicle thefts home invasions and much more all that being said i hope you'll continue watching this episode of ag talk with doc i want you to hear these stories straight from the farmers and ranchers i met with in texas we appreciate you coming down to south texas to talk about this issue that affects us landowners and law enforcement in a dramatic way and we appreciate your attention on it i hope what everybody has to share today you can take home and take to dc and and share and continue to spread the word so thank you all sheriffs for being here it's just it just absolutely breaks your heart when you see somebody down here these you know they're they're human beings and uh they're trying to better their lives no doubt about it but on the other hand they shouldn't be coming across here my wife and i were driving around one time on the ranch and scouting for doves and we ran into this eight month she was eight months pregnant female she could barely walk and she was like let me go and say you're gonna die i'm gonna find you and the baby here in a couple weeks you call borcho and pick them up but you know it's getting tougher and tougher you're seeing more and more jugs trash throughout the ranch especially on our highway fence lines because that's where their pickup points are busted fence lines it's there all the time it almost sounds like it's one message to tell people it's inhumane to try to get these people to come to come here it is but usually on a weekly basis i can fill up the bed of a pickup with clothing water jugs backpacks all kinds of trash and we're in the pickup zone here and so all of them know after they get to this area they're pretty much home free so they're pretty brazen and brave about it so it's turned into a situation where uh you know any kind of an encounter with them whether it's friendly or whether you find them on the ranch could turn into a bad situation you just count all those heads and how much money that is you know we're talking millions a year of just through our property just to us you know it's probably a billion dollar industry yeah we're hearing three thousand to seven thousand dollars a person oh no that's right right so you take that 20 people a day through our place multiply that you know just extrapolate it it's it's incredible that's all it's a heck of a lot of money so you know we've been in situations where they're smuggling drugs over here while they're smuggling humans over on this side nothing compared to what happened in 2021 when biden took office in january of 2021 and part of february we had a border open and in that one border off we reported more traffic than we did the whole year of 2020 in one border off what did biden do to cause the traffic to come all his rhetoric and all of his talking about how he was going to let everybody come in here and this was when he was first running for office and then uh you know he uh he virtually uh the words out all across the planet that he's gonna let everybody come in here and here they'll come there's got to be some kind of advertising even a young woman i talk to who works in counseling at some of these centers youth centers where the kids come who are under 18 unaccompanied say their parents have sent them because they have heard it's been advertised in their countries mainly honduras el salvador guatemala anyway in those areas there's ads somewhere encouraging people to come to the day to the day of the election i mean here it comes we were back in 2014 again i mean just out of control what's going on is exactly what they want to be happening and you know washington knows what's i mean they have how many board patrol down here they're getting reports they see the numbers they know but they're not yeah they're not acting i mean you know how many people have to die out here in the desert for somebody to say hey this is kind of a bad deal out here my sole function in this county is to search fine bodies recover and bring back i have no other function you asked the question and i i've come to the same conclusion that either this administration wants this crisis or they're incompetent it has to be one of those it could be both of them the biggest difference between trump and biden is you had a feel you know it was it was never an uh no sums game but you had a feel of progress you had to feel a government working you had to feel bored for being able to do their job you had some sense of there was going to be light at the end of the tunnel and i think all that kind of disappeared right now i mean the stories are incredible they're very helpful i think it's good for my sheriff's officers to hear these stories as well uh i've said this over and over if we if we learn one thing or able to save one kansas life from what we learned from you all then the trip is worth it but i think we're learning much more than that and all i can tell you is i'm not the person that forms committees and and talks about things i'm very much an action person and i look forward to sitting down with senator cornyn and his staff i know that i don't want to reinvent the will absolutely he's a great legislator he knows his way around dc much better than i do and i'll look and he and i have a great great friendship and relationship so i look forward to sitting down with him and especially on the on the federal prosecution of human smuggling it sounds like a simple um solution so thank you everybody you

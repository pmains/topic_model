i guess you've uh heard the great news that uh it's exciting president biden has announced that by july 4th three people can get together so as long as they're related in the same family if they've all been vaccinated and they can take their mask off for a second three people after july 4th if you're related and you've been vaccinated i mean how out of touch is that i mean does he go out does he know any real people is anybody paying attention to anything he is saying does he really think that he's sort of instilling confidence in us by going on a zoom call and putting a mask on has dr fauci told him that he can catch it through the webcam somehow i mean this is insane but these are the people leading our country and telling us you know what we can and cannot do the governor's not a lot better in fact i would say the governor's worse than most of the democratic governors around the country as far as his restrictions and i think the burden should be on these people if they're going to take your freedoms from you the burden on them is to prove that there's some kind of signs i still might oppose it even if the signs were there but they need to have a burden to prove to us that what they're doing and telling us actually has some science that supports that would actually work there really isn't any the trajectory of the virus probably was unaltered by any of the things you were told to do in fact the whole idea of six foot distancing or three foot distancing they've now said probably none of that makes any sense and it can probably spread 50 feet and so there probably were times in a very enclosed setting when people hadn't been vaccinated and it was all throughout your community that being inside with other people probably wasn't a good idea but the thing is is it it kind of depends on who you are there are different risk factors based on different people if you're 25 years old the death rate is higher for being struck by lightning you're more likely to be struck by lightning under 25 than to die from covet but if you're over 70 or over 70 and overweight your risks go up dramatically and there is a real risk i don't think we should say there's no risk there is a real risk for certain people and uh so i'm not opposed to the vaccine i think people ought to take it if you're in a risk category if you're younger or if you think you've had it i think it's a reasonable thing to be tested to see if you have antibodies to it already i had it last spring and so far there's no evidence of the immunity waning and people say well you don't know you don't know how long your immunity is going to last and i was like well you don't know how long the vaccine is going to last i mean none of us know how long this will last but common sense usually tells you that when you've had a previous infection with something you have some immunity and i didn't get any symptoms last time i think i probably won't get many the next time since i already have some immunity to the disease but that's my decision i'm not going to tell you what to do in a free society everybody judges their own risk you're going to decide whether to get in a car which is extremely dangerous much more dangerous than anything you'll do in your life is a car but we don't submit to the government that the government's going to put a governor on our car that we can't go more than 25 miles an hour we'd save a lot of lives but we just sort of accept the risk i heard someone giving a speech the other day and they were talking about you know an invention and if there was this invention but we knew it would aid in commerce and we would speed up a lot of things in our life and our life would be materially better but 40 000 people would die a year if we allow this invention to come forward would you do it and most people are like no no that sounds terrible all these deaths what's the car i mean the car has all these pluses but it still has lots of deaths that we get from cars each year so we've sort of lost our head in the sense that really we should think about risk make these decisions individually and ever it's sort of teach his own while i'm a big advocate of taking the vaccine my parents won't take it they're in their 80s but they won't take it and that's you know and if you've met my dad or read about that he is going to make his own decisions and he's not going to listen to his kids but several of us are doctors and work with covet patients and have taken it after i had coveted i went to the hospital and and volunteered in the hospital for a few weeks but the one thing i will tell you is the rules in the hospital for safety's sake is if you go in a covid patient's room you wear an n95 mask you don't cut up your t-shirt and put your t-shirt on your face it doesn't work i mean they've done studies on this so when fauci first came out he said none of the masks work and he knew that that was a lie it's what plato called a noble lie he thinks we're too stupid to understand the truth but he didn't want you to buy the n95 mask because thought he thought they needed to be in the hospital first we'd run out and it's it's not a reasonable thing but we should just be honest with people and say look we're going to send we're going to ask the suppliers to send the n95 mass to the hospital first they are the best mass and they work and sydney said they you know when he finally came out and said none of them worked then three weeks later came out and said they all work that's equally not true because if you blow particles through a cloth mask the same size as a virus 97 of the particles go right through the cloth mask so the cloth masks really don't work the surgical masts are a little bit better than the n95 mass work one of the things that dr faushi could spend some time telling us but he's not telling us i'm going to tell you today because it's the most important thing we're still going to get code but it's not as active out there it's a lot less active but steve you still may have somebody who's a family member or friend who gets it in town and this is what you need to know and it can save your life if you get it you've got a bronchitis and you begin coughing there is a treatment and it reduces your death rate like 80 it's called monoclonal antibodies donald trump got him chris christie got him giuliani got them i have a family member who had metastatic cancer she got them and survived so the thing is is people can survive and these really work but there's a window of time if you wait too long i had a friend who's about 41 overweight he got it almost died but he waited too long but nobody was telling him he needed to get to the hospital sooner you can't wait and you know like most men i don't want to make a sexist argument but men resist going to the doctor they just stay home stay home stay home but if you get cove in your coughing you need to get in to see the doctor because there is a treatment and it reduces your death rate 80 percent instead you've got people like sanjay gupta and dr fauci on tv saying oh the mask is the most important thing it's more important than the vaccine well no it's not the mask really probably doesn't work much at all almost everybody that's gotten the infection in the last two months as the numbers went like this said they were wearing their mask all the time so the frankly you can get it with your mask the vaccine probably does work 90 some odd percent of the time 95 of the time so really the answer to stopping this is either natural immunity which a lot of people have gotten plus the vaccine now they completely discount it the reason why fauci's still so upset and why bashir is acting like a crazy person is that they don't count natural immunity the people have had it so 32 million people there's a website you can see how many people have had covid 32 million people have had it but the cdc which is very conservative and not tending to exaggerate estimates that two people for every one person's listed have gotten it why because a lot of young people got it and they didn't know it so if you got it one of you had the flu and you know you had covered last year and you have two kids chances are your kids may have had it and you just didn't know it if you didn't test them so there's at least two for every one which means we have a hundred million people in our country have had it that's a third of the country had it but we also have over a third that's vaccinated now there's some overlap but really we are close to the two-thirds that we kind of need two-thirds plus some and so i think we're very close to being over it and i can see by the crowd here you guys guys kind of think we're beyond this and i think we may be but uh we've got to really get to the point where we can get back to normal probably an adrian can reinforce this probably the worst thing that's happened is at the state level with the powers that the governor has assumed so we have a couple of problems in kentucky the governor assumed these powers in march they went out of session and so for nine months our legislature is completely powerless to me this is sort of reminiscent of when the king would dissolve parliament when he got mad at parliament he would just kick him out and they couldn't come back and he wouldn't let them come back in session i think that's a defect in our state i think we need to allow power for the state for the legislature to come back in session now if you want to limit what they come back in for that'd be fine you could say they only come back in maybe to to discuss or debate edicts you know that the governor puts forward but we have to allow them to have the power to come back in otherwise for nine months he is essentially a dictator so when they came back in legislative session in january there's emergency rules that were given to the governor back in the 90s when the bill was passed i think people assumed it would be like a tornado hits lawrenceburg and the national guard brings you blankets and food and water most of us would accept that as an emergency but if you want to close a restaurant down for a year and say you can only have 25 occupancy that's a policy that's like legislation that get that can't that's not an emergency that's not a three-day thing where we're helping people with water and food this is a major economic policy and to say that only one person can do that with his sole authority with no checks and balances from the legislature is awful i think this is the biggest constitutional issue bigger than i know there's a lot of important stuff in washington the issue we have with the governor and unlimited power is the biggest issue of our time it's going to be decided by the supreme court so the state legislature passed a law restricting his powers and he immediately went to court sued them got a liberal judge in frankfurt surprise surprise i don't know how you found a how he found a liberal judge in frankfurt i guess the opposite would really be true could you find a conservative judge in frankfurt but anyway the judge put an injunction and now it's going to go to the supreme court in june but the pr the governor is arguing that he has inherent power i'd say he's been anointed by god he's like a king of old he's been told and this is what he argues that he can do whatever he wants no matter what the state legislature says this goes against everything we know and care about as far as separation of powers and checks and balances this is a big deal but what really worries me is that i think the supreme court could rule in his favor i don't know how they could possibly justify ruling against the state legislature amending their own laws to limit his power but if we say the governor has inherent powers that cannot be checked by the legislature that is a recipe for tyranny i think we're already living in a form of that tyranny now but can you imagine if that's upheld by the courts if it is there are two possibilities supreme court is elected and you need to find out who your supreme court judge is justice is from this area and you need to watch closely how they vote i don't think you can really lobby them you can't really call them it's not appropriate to call them but you can write a letter to the editor of your paper and if you believe as i do that the governor should not have unlimited power and the state legislative law lebanese power should be upheld i would write that and if a bunch of you were writing to the paper and getting your letters in maybe the supreme court justice will see some of those letters i don't think you can do it directly if we lose the vote though by all means we need to become active and say we need people in the supreme court that actually will rule in favor of the constitution the other thing we can do and i've advocated this from the beginning is it probably should become a constitutional amendment so if we're going to be have trouble with a liberal supreme court in a conservative state maybe we need a constitutional amendment that limits the governor's powers emergency powers and what they did basically is they said within 30 days there had to be a vote of the legislature to approve if it wasn't approved in 30 days it expired so all of his edicts would expire right now he's saying we can't do anything until 2.5 million people are inoculated well he just sort of pulled that out of his hat because there's no science saying that you'd think if if you were going to actually talk about science it would be based on a death rate or a daily incidence rate or something but he's just said 2.5 million and so then you can be free again or sort of free if he allows depending on how much freedom he's going to allow you to have but this is the issue of our time and it's very important we get involved so watch closely that vote coming up in june adrian do you have anything to add about the debate you all had [Music] absolutely absolutely the governor needs to be reined in and the shorter the better i personally had suggested when we talked about the uh constitutional amendment that be only a few days as opposed to 30 days i would limit them to because really most emergencies would be taken care of within a week three to five days if we had a tornado or something where you're going to help people with food and water within three to five days things would normalize it has to be longer than that i think it ought to be legislation but uh that debate will happen and i think either way i think we need to get it into our constitution uh limiting the governor's powers as far as washington um it's crazy times up there too you know between uh nancy pelosi and aoc on one side now we've got chuck schumer in charge on the other side in the past when one party won typically the country didn't lurch too quickly to the other side because we had the filibuster and we still do have the filibuster but if we lose it they're already promising to do a lot of things if manchin votes with them and cinema votes with them to get rid of the filibuster what they do is there's a ruling by the chair that says you didn't get 60 votes so you don't win they vote to overturn the chair and they can do that with 51 votes it's sort of a weird set of rules that we've allowed 51 people to get rid of a 60-vote margin so and it's been done in the past they did it on the supreme court for nominees and i had mixed feelings with that but i ended up siding with letting the majority pick the supreme court but i think for law it's a bad idea to get rid of the filibuster if we do the president the democrats have promised to give us dc as a state that promised to pack the court which will end up being ridiculous if they add four democrats immediately to the court then they have a majority what do you think republicans will do when they get back in add four and before you know there's gonna be like 99 supreme court justices it'll be insane but they want d.c as a state they want to pack the court and then probably most damaging to the process is take elections away from the states and localities and do them in washington so they would federalize all the elections everybody would be automatically registered everybody would automatically be sent a ballot you might send them more than one ballot you might have people that are designated to go to everybody's house to pick up their ballot it's a recipe for disaster it's a recipe for fraud the problem with mail-in ballots is if you're not showing your identification and you're just going by signature none of us here are signature experts can we really and do you have the time to go through every ballot and look at every signature it just won't happen so i think the old-fashioned way was pretty good he showed up there was a republican and a democrat at the desk you showed your id your name was in a book you signed it you voted and the republican the democrats saw 1500 people voted in the precinct they should have 1500 pieces of paper at the end if we have to go back there's a there's a ballot a hand ballot or a paper ballot to correlate with the vote and i think we can it particularly when it's decentralized that way we can keep track of whether or not the you know the the election has integrity so i think that this is an important aspect that we get away from the mail-in ballots and back to a traditional voting again so i've advocated for election integrity reform not only here but in georgia iowa arizona throughout the united states i think if we have fair elections we have a chance of winning in georgia the next time what happened in georgia is stacy abrams and the republican secretary of state decided they would mail applications to people and they would allow you to bring in thousands of ballots the problem with one person going door to door and collecting them is one you have the verification problem of did they actually vote did you coerce their vote when you show up with ten thousand votes and you drop them in it's just i think it's much harder to verify than people one vote at a time and so i think what we need to do and what i've advocated for is it needs to be individualized if you want to vote by absentee fine you or your guardian or a family member has to apply but you can only get one application in georgia and other places what they did is the application was not specific so they just mailed applications to everybody and then if you didn't respond they lj again and again and again so it became a solicitation i think that's a mistake taxes are going to go up they're talking about an infrastructure bill but they're going to raise the corporate income tax realize that when they raise the corporate income tax that means companies that can leave will leave a good example of in kentucky about lowering the corporate income tax and having more money here was general motors added 400 jobs in bowling green on the on the assembly line there because there they saved hundreds of millions of dollars when their tax went from 35 to 21. people say oh well some of their investors got rich well who are their investors everybody works in the union has stock and gm if you own a mutual fund you may have stock in gm we're all small owners of these companies everybody sort of owns them but it also helps the workers in that we added jobs even if it helps the stockholders it also helps the workers probably worse than raising the corporate income tax though is they're talking about raising capital gains tax so we're talking about going from 20 to 43 they're also talking about getting rid of the uh step up basis for land so if you own 40 acres here you're going to give it to your kids and you bought it for a hundred thousand and now it's worth a million used to be when you died it stepped up to a million and then your family would only pay capital gains if it appreciated from a million up but not from the hundred thousand that it appreciated in your parents not lifetime that would be devastating to a lot of farm families not to not to have that so there's a lot of bad things are going on but basically it's the fundamental difference between the parties they want you to give more of your money or take more of your money we want you to keep more of your money we believe as thomas payne wrote that government is a necessary evil meaning that we want as small amount of government as we can possibly live with because we want you to be left with most of your liberty and most of your income this will be a colossal battle over the next two years if we keep the filibuster i think we can keep most of the country safe from these people if they get rid of the filibuster they could damage the country i think in an irreparable way you know if we get federalization of elections and d.c becomes a state and they pack the court those are things that are hard to reverse so let's hope we can hang on till 2022. i'm up in 2022 um the house is up again all the house in 2022 because of the census people are moving from high tax states to lower tax states so new york's going to lose a seat california is going to lose a seat for the first time ever pennsylvania's going to lose a seat florida picks up two texas picks up two their legislatures are completely controlled by republicans so they're going to redistrict it and make it harder for some of the democrats to win again so it looks like we can probably just through migration south pick up the house in two years if we hang on to what we have we should be able to pick up pretty easily eight to ten seats so i think there's a better than fifty percent chance that we win uh the house the senate's fifty-fifty i think we have to win in georgia arizona we also have to maintain a seat in pennsylvania which is hard so it could go either way reforming the election laws will help us to win i think but there's no guarantee we've essentially become a two-party state that is city versus the rural almost all the rural people are becoming republicans anderson county i'd consider to be a rural county you've gone thanks to dave and others from a democrat county to a republican county but again i think it's mostly just that the democrat party's become so crazy i was telling somebody earlier i'll bet you cannot meet someone in town who agrees with dr levine republican or democrat and i think if you were a democrat and you heard who this dr levine was you'd say there's no way i could be a democrat she's someone who has surgically altered her body to appear children can make these decisions with or against their parents uh their parents will so they're saying that a child can consent to hormones that change your appearance they don't change your sex you cannot change your sex but they change the appearance of your sex so they would give a 12 13 14 year old girl so much testosterone that she grows a beard if you stop that she never goes back to looking the way she once did she'll somewhere be in between but she's forever changed at least superficially no child should get to make that decision but that's why people are changing these people are so crazy so outside the mainstream that you won't find anybody in your community believes that i i i defy you to see if you can find a democrat in your area that believes that but that's where the national party has gone then you have aoc promoting socialism she is a socialist so i think that has scared a lot of people in the countryside unfortunately in the cities the cities have become more and more democrat we're fortunate in kentucky that our rural vote outweighs our city vote and i think we'll be fine as long as it does the one urban area that is good for us is actually up near cincinnati which is mostly republican uh louisville and lexington are a struggle they've been harder in 2010 i lost fayette county by 1 000 votes so i must have gotten like 49 i think in 2016 i probably lost it by 30 35 000 votes i think mcconnell lost it by 35 or 40 000 votes so we're getting worse and worse in fayette but we're getting better and better and anderson and surrounding counties so uh we do have our work cut out for us as we move forward i think one of the most important things that we need to express to people is that america is not a bad place we're not a bad country we're not bad people we're not a people that hate people based on the color of their skin and when the democrats try to say that that's who america is that's who republicans are we need to look them in the eye point at their chest and say democrats need to apologize for jim crow the party of jim crow were the democrats when kentucky had jim crow laws they were passed all by democrats we had a few republicans but not one of the republicans voted for jim crow when john lewis is marching across the bridge in selma he's being beaten up by democrats he's been beaten and bloodied by democrats every one of them they need to apologize for the history of their party our party william worley was a black republican in louisville in 1900 he started and founded the kentucky naacp and he fought the jim crow laws that said a white man couldn't sell a house to a black man or vice versa he was a republican he fought this all the way to the supreme court and we won unanimously in 1917. unfortunately that wasn't the end of segregation but that was republicans fighting to end democrat segregation jim crow laws so i i say push back on these people i'm sick and tired of it i don't hear from the courier journal i don't want to hear from any of these people calling us names the history of our party is a good history and we ought to be proud of our party they need to apologize for their history but it's bigger than that they're saying the whole country is terrible they're saying we haven't gotten any better that all the you know the stain of slavery has gotten worse i think it's so much better than it's ever been as far as race relations i say when i see my kids interactions with people they don't see race at all and so i think it's so much better as far as schools no schools discriminate public businesses don't discriminate i think we've come a long way so but they're trying to divide us and make everything about race four years ago nobody was talking about race now everybody's talking about everything's about race it's like did we all suddenly become bad people again did we jump back 40 years and become somehow this racist nation none of it's true it's all coming from the media so i think we should be proud of our country recognizing that it wasn't perfect and that we've gotten better but we can't let them change the narrative that somehow america's this terrible place to live i'm proud to live here i'm proud to represent kentucky and i thank you for your support thank you you need assistance

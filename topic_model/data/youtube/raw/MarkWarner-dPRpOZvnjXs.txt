on the military watch why can't the Air Force figure out what's wrong with the f-22 Raptors flying out of Langley well pilots say that they are blacking out in the cockpit worried they will crash into our homes you want answers in Titan owner Mark Warner is demanding you get them investigator Laurie Simmons has the story Senator Mark Warner wants answers as to why so many f-22 Raptor pilots are having problems with oxygen deprivation in the air in a letter sent to the Secretary of the Air Force Thursday the senator asks very specific questions about the extent of the hypoxia issue for example f-22 pilots report an eighteen percent rate of hypoxia symptoms what is that compared to other jet and what was the rationale for clearing the plane to fly again the senator now wants the branch to launch a confidential survey of pilots and flight surgeons within the next ten days to determine the scope and frequency of hypoxia cases he also recommends the Air Force reach out to NASA and other independent research labs to try and figure out the root cause and find solutions to make pilots field fly right over where my kids go to school more my house is a pilot not fully and his wits comes back and loses control or it's another aircraft or something right over where where we live that's that's my family's biggest fear major jeremy gordon and captain Josh Wilson were the two Virginia Air National Guard whistleblowers that caught the attention of the senator after their exclusive interview with 60 minutes over the weekend the Langley pilots drove all the way to DC to meet with Senator Warner on Thursday so he can hear firsthand their experience systems and for the Raptors and how it caused them to be woozy disoriented and ill after flight several times during the flight I had to really concentrate immense concentration on just doing simple simple pass since April of 2008 the Air Force confirms 25 incidents of pilots reporting hypoxia symptoms to put those numbers in perspective only 200 pilots in the entire country are qualified to fly the f-22 but after months of investigation the Air Force still doesn't know if the problem lies with the amount of oxygen that flows or a toxin that could be in the air supply the onset of this is insidious some pilots will go the entire mission land and not know anything went wrong now the senator issued this statement after meeting with the Langley pilots I have tremendous respect for the military service of captain Wilson and major Gordon and I admire their willingness to step forward under the military whistleblower act to voice their concerns about the safety of this aircraft the Air Force scientists and the air crews themselves must work together to solve this problem and we need to make sure there is a culture in which others feel safe coming forward now senator Warner will meet in person with Air Force officials next week live in the newsroom on Laurie Simmons newsChannel 3 annex clue

hi I'm small business owner and Congressman Roger Williams from Texas I would like to take this opportunity to announce my plan to reform the United States tax code my legislation called jumpstart America will put Americans back to work increase economic growth and restore opportunity for all the talk of tax reform up here is commonplace but unfortunately talk is all there is most Democrats and Republicans would agree that tax reform needs to happen but it never gets done and in fact the United States tax code has not been overhauled since 1986 jumpstart America is more than just talk it's a true business perspective on tax reform as a business owner and a small business owner I know what it will take to get Main Street businesses to hire again far too long I have seen firsthand the effects of failed Washington policies on job creators and small business owners since 2008 the federal government has tried to artificially boost the economy with stimulus dollars zero percent interest and tax increases these methods pick winners and losers and at best they put a temporary band-aid on top of a flesh wound and at worse they rob hardworking Americans of their hard-earned money make it difficult for businesses to expand and create little incentive for people to go to work even so Treasury secretary Jack Lew would have us believe that today the US economy is a well-oiled machine we need to accept reality for what it is the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because millions of Americans are dropping out of the workforce that is a fact today the United States is witnessing the lowest labor participation rate says Jimmy Carter's presidency almost 40 years ago we're in dire need of a real jumpstart to our economy no more artificial boost no more temporary band-aids jumpstart America is made up of proven ideas that have been transformed into practical legislation tomorrow I will introduce my first of seven bills that will together allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money make the United States more competitive on the global stage and get more cash flowing away from the government and into the private sector jumpstart America will cap individual tax rates for all income levels and lower the corporate xr8 to twenty percent today the US has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world it's higher than rates in the UK France and Japan and if we're in serious about keeping American businesses in America we must make the American business climate more attractive it's that simple jumpstart America will implement permanent repatriation to bring US dollars back home where they belong my plan will keep life will accounting for those sectors that use it to major financial performance and calculate taxes it will give the option to continue normal depreciation or allow for a hundred percent right off on fixed asset purchases if taxpayers choose to do so it will cut the capital gains tax and dividends tax to encourage investment government should not be a burden on job growth but right now it is the American people want to work and job creators need lawmakers who say we have your back job creators need certainty fairness and reliability from Washington and right now they're not getting any of that jumpstart America will empower businesses to spend more of their income on American workers with jumpstart America we will truly turn this economy into a well-oiled machine let's remember the greatest asset we have as Americans let's put people to work thank you for your time

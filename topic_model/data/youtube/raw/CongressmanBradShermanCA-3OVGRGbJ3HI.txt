also joining us is congressman brad sherman democrat of sherman oaks also a member of the house foreign affairs committee so congressman thanks for taking the time very simply uh is the united states doing enough to help ukraine we're doing an awful lot we're doing more every day the thing we should be doing today is agreeing with slovakia that if they transfer their s 300 anti-aircraft missiles to ukraine that we will backfill we have not been willing to uh do the same thing with uh with airplanes uh that po planes pose a a particular risk but there's no reason at all not to send these anti-aircraft missiles uh to ukraine you've said you're opposed to this no-fly zone but what what if chemical weapons are used against civilian populations would that not force us in militarily there are a host of of hypotheticals that could come up and obviously those would change things but it doesn't mean that the change should be that american airmen should be shooting at russians and russian planes keep in mind that a no-fly zone for our pilots to be safe it's not enough to just send planes over ukraine we would have to destroy uh russian anti-aircraft missiles so that our pilots are safe so we would have to be bombing russians on the ground uh and not just in ukraine because some of those defense uh those uh its russian air defense systems are in belarus so we would have to bomb belarusian territory perhaps russian territory kill russians uh in order to keep our pilots safe that may not be war with russia but it's pretty close uh how does this end this ends uh maybe in a week maybe in a month maybe in a year when putin realizes uh that um the most he can achieve is what zielinski has already offered and that is an agreement that ukraine would not enter into a formal military alliance with nato or any other anti-russian alliance and keep in mind ukraine can never be eligible for membership in nato so long as crimea and dombas are occupied by russia because the article 5 says if you are a member of nato and your territory is occupied then awareness that all nato countries including the united states are in a state of war against your occupier and that uh i i don't with all of the support ukraine has i can't imagine um support in the united states for a ukraine membership in nato if that meant immediate war with russia congressman brad sherman democrat from the house foreign affairs committee thanks for taking the time thank you

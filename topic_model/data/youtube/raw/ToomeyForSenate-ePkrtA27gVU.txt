hold on because we have a special feature that we're doing every single day and that is we are interviewing a different candidate every single day uh all across the country different races house senate races you name it and i want to introduce you somebody all the strategy rumors know who this person is pat twomey and he's a former pennsylvania congressman he's a republican and he is running uh against arlen specter so uh pat toomey thanks a lot for calling in we sure appreciate it thanks for having me now um at one point last year you were 21 points ahead of the polls ahead of arlen specter in the polls causing him many would say to flip from the republican party to the democratic party uh so how are things going there for you so far this year well things are going extremely well i've been thrilled by the support that i've got all across the commonwealth it's uh the energy and enthusiasm is all on our side meanwhile senator spector has a very tough democratic primary he's going to try to get through i don't know if he manages but in any case i feel great about where we are we've got a lot of support the parking is very strong i'll be the republican nominee and i think i think we're going to win this right i'm just looking at some of the poll numbers so far and and uh you're polling ahead of uh of joe sustak who's the the democrat who's challenging arlen specter right now so uh things seem to be going pretty well for you what are some of the issues that you are finding voters in pennsylvania care the most about right now yeah well i actually the polling data currently has me ahead of either of these guys and i know there's a long way ago so i don't put too much stock in it but but it's indicative of the voters attitudes towards what's happening in washington i mean to your question i think people think we've got a federal government that's out of control and focusing on the wrong things uh the idea that we should have serial bailouts nationalizing whole industries spending on a breathtaking level unprecedented and unsustainable deficits and debt and meanwhile by the way they're going to take over health care i mean this is this is just out of control and this is what happens when a single party the democratic party is captured by its left wing and they're off to the races so voters across pennsylvania of all stripes want a little balance a little common sense some fiscal discipline excuse me i'm sorry um it's it's going very well for those reasons i i read somewhere that even the uh pro-labor policies that um the administration has put forward have been really rejected uh in your state which is surprising uh given the makeup of the state how do you account for that well you know because the average rank and file union workers understand that it's just unamerican to deny people a secret ballot and let's face it that's what the card check bill that both our own specter and joe sestak have supported that's what it would do it's designed to deny workers a secret battle what about yours can you give us like an example of a specific jobs creation proposal that you're running on sure one of the things i've argued is that uh we're gonna we're gonna destroy jobs if we keep spending at the way we're spending so instead of all of this staggering spending for instance on the stimulus bill a big portion of that is still unspent so i've argued we should rescind the unspent portion and instead lower payroll taxes if we lowered taxes across the board payroll taxes on workers and the matching employer share we'd give every worker a take-home pay raise and we make it less expensive for employers to hire the next worker what about your feeling on the vat tax i i think it's a very bad idea to create a whole new category of taxes one of the problems with the vat tax of course is it's the least transparent i mean it's completely uh hidden it obscures the tax burden that consumers have to pay because obviously the consumer ends up paying the whole thing but it's hidden from people and i i i find hidden taxes to be particularly uh offensive okay where what's the date of your primary in pennsylvania our primary is may 18th may 18th okay so how you sound like you're in the car right now where are you headed right now i am in a car on my way to harrisburg our state capitol all right and uh how are you when you talk to voters out there if they were to rank the issues that they're passionate about you'd mentioned just a minute ago uh government spending but where does that stand compared to health care reform well i think jobs is number one getting this economy moving and creating job growth you know pennsylvania's unemployment rate is way too high and and i'm worried it might even go higher so that's got to be priority number one health reform is high but not the kind of health care reform that the democrats have been trying to inflict on us this huge takeover the trillion dollar spending all kinds of mandate taxes and that's not what we need and the voters i talk to want to see some of the modest common sense reforms we can enact to make health care more affordable and more accessible but i will say security is another issue that comes up quite frequently especially in the wake of the the christmas day uh attempt to uh to bomb an american uh commercial airline flight all right uh pat thanks a lot for for calling in pat toomey a former principal pennsylvania congressman who is running on the republican ticket against arlen specter of course we all remember uh very well that arlen specter switched parties last year uh from republican now he's a democrat and a lot of folks say that uh certainly looks like he was going to lose and that's why he switched parties so uh thanks a lot for calling in this week thanks for having me all right well and

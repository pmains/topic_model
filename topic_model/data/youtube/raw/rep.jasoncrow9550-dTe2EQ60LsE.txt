hey everybody this is congressman jason crowe uh joining you from washington dc i'm in washington for a few weeks as we vote on really important bills like the justice and policing act and we try to keep things moving forward during this very difficult time with an economic downturn in the pandemic that is sweeping across our country and community thank you for joining us now this is the next in our series of our virtual job fair uh in training series as many of you might know last year we held the first ever 6th congressional district job fair we had over a thousand job seekers and over 60 employers come together and exchange ideas and resumes and many people got jobs out of that event we were really excited to kick it off as you know unfortunately we can't do the same thing this year we can't bring everybody together on the same campus because of the coronavirus but we wanted to actually replicate that as close as we could and provide a service to the community much like we did last year so we came up with the idea of doing this virtual job fair which is kicking off the series of trainings from resume building to looking for jobs on the internet and after we go through the series of trainings then our office is going to set up a virtual job board which is hopefully going to connect job seekers with employers throughout the community uh and help people move forward because even though we can't be together in per um in person what we do know is that it's more important than ever that we provide this service and because tens of millions of americans tens of thousands within the sixth congressional district are now unemployed because of the coronavirus and the economic challenges that we're facing so it's more important than whatever that we come together and we help each other out so we're really honored to be joined by erica hines tonight with the community college of aurora who's going to be presenting tonight and conducting the training so with no further ado i want to hand it over to erica and i really appreciate your time tonight erica and the partnership that we have with the community college aurora to provide this really important service so thank you again for joining us we will get through this challenging time together uh americans and coloradans and members of the the sixth congressional district you we are at our best when we come together and we focus on what we have to have in common uh come together as one and help each other out and that's what we're gonna do and we will get through this so thank you and i will turn it over to erica hines of the community college aurora for tonight's training thank you so much congressman i'm really excited to be able to present tonight and to talk to everybody a little bit about linkedin networking um so as was mentioned my name is erica hines i am the director of career services at the community college of aurora and so i am really excited to talk about linkedin and networking and hopefully build up all of your connections and networks even while we're all still safely social distancing from home all right so today we'll be talking about making connections in the digital age and so there's four different components that we'll be talking about here which is going to be networking and the importance of that the basics of linkedin how to stand out beyond the basics and then also a couple of neat features in linkedin that maybe people did not know about before so starting off what is networking networking can be a really intimidating term for a lot of people it's something that a lot of people shy away from because they're worried about being judged and other people judging what you're doing and how you're communicating and your past experiences and that's really a place that puts us in a vulnerable position but networking in a positive frame is actually really building connections and so what that really boils down to is being able to gather information about people that can help you as you move forward within your career whether that is job search or if that is something like getting ready for a promotion or if you are still in college and getting ready to just kind of jump out in the world and just ready to get some experience um and so networking allows us to provide support and also get advice from other people it's a two-way street it's not something that is just you going out and saying please help me it is really there to be a collaboration for you to yes get some support and be able to build up your own network and connections but also to be a support for other people who might also find value in what you have to offer in your skills this also helps to establish your reputation um especially on a platform like linkedin which is very widely available to other people for them to just see what you're up to and how are you relevant and staying active within the field and it allows you to be selfish in a good way it is okay to think about yourself when you are networking and really think strategically about the relationships that you're building and the connections and partners that you're able to connect with as you are going through this process so what does that mean when it's actually in practice though and we can move to the next slide so really networking is something that can be anywhere right it's not something that is just online it's something that started originally in person face to face um going out for coffee having a happy hour meeting reading reaching out to someone whether that was going into their office and just saying hey do you have five minutes to talk i have a couple of questions or calling someone up all the way into now when we're in the digital age to be able to really connect with people online and kind of scope them out ahead of time so there's different types of networking events that you can attend or ways that you can connect with people one of those is industry related right so if you're in something like the it field or if you're in administration finding an industry related group for what you're doing there's also age group related um networking events which can be something that a lot of people find comfort in right when we have so many different populations that are working together being able to have someone who connects and communicates on the same level as you whether you are in the boomers age or if you're a millennial or gen x or now that we're getting into gen z right everybody has these different communication styles and so having those age group related networking events can also be really helpful for people also alumni connections and we'll talk a little bit about this later linkedin has a really neat alumni function that we'll be talking about but being able to establish a group of mentors establishing teachers right not just ending those relationships when you have graduated from college or letting those die but go back and find those mentors go back and find those teachers from when you were back in college or if you are still there then be able to find them on linkedin many of them have a linkedin account so that you can still use them for all the resources and that wealth of knowledge that they have within the field and then the final piece is volunteering within the groups and the events that are all out there um can be a great opportunity of course for getting experience but also to build those relationships that you already have and again do that in a less intimidating um way than just going out and asking for help next slide so again talking about the generations there are so many differences between how the different generations communicate and so just having an understanding of how we have gotten to where we are um a lot of our baby boomers right it was a lot of in person in networking and connection and just going in and you know as easy as handing them a resume or even just talking about your experiences that you've had and then we got into generation x right when the computers first started coming out when we first started getting cell phones and being able to really work through that and being able to go into things like coffee shops and having more of the restaurant bar scene type of networking events then we jump into gen y which is our millennials right which really kicked off with technology right away as they were very young growing up with technology being able to see the evolution of something like youtube and being the foundation for twitter and facebook and the very roots of how we first started to network online and how that worked and then now of course gen z who has never known anything different from this right and so they're on things like tick tock and they're on twitter all the time and they're on snapchat and all of these different platforms are ways that we can use to network and there are ways that we can informally build these connections and build up our own personality as a professional we also have a difference between reality versus reality tv right um a lot of companies on their website will put that perfect reality tv what they want you to see right this is what's great about our company this is what you know we want everyone to see and a lot of times that is accurate to a company but we're missing those inner details of okay what's what's it really like to be here what's it like to be an employee here and that's where that true reality comes into linkedin so that we can really have a stronger idea of what we're getting into before we actually jump into a new position or start making those connections and applying for positions and then we have those classic ideas for just being able to be a networker so of course handshakes are frowned upon right now but you can still do a virtual handshake which is essentially a smile a strong introduction all the stuff that comes with that handshake the confidence being really comfortable with who you are and being really willing and open for the conversation that hopefully is going to come out of that elevator pitches knowing what you want to talk about knowing what questions you have and what's important for yourself to be able to talk to others about something that we have really lost is thank you notes these are some things that generation x and the baby boomers generations were really really great at was being able to write i think you know after each interaction and we've really lost some of that personal touch lately because everything is so digital but using something like email using something like messenger and linkedin messaging to send a thank you is so important to bring that personal touch back in and be able to have that personal connection brought back in in an age where everything is touch of a button so what does this all mean facebook twitter linkedin all the other platforms that i've already mentioned we can go to the next slide it's really about the basics it's all about connecting it's all about that foundation of how do we connect with people and so for linkedin linkedin is great because it's a free networking tool it allows you to test out the different relationship and opportunities that are out there before you go and connect so you can look at profiles of people you can look at the companies and you can do some research before you actually reach out and be able to get a feel based on someone else's experience to see is this going to be a meaningful connection for me to reach out to like i said it's okay to be selfish we want connections and relationships that are going to be mutually beneficial in both directions connecting your profile and creating your profile we'll talk a little bit about this um in the next screen but we want to make sure that we have a profile that is intentional for where we want to go now when i say intentional i mean that we want to write our profile and we want to talk about our past experiences in a way that shoots us towards the future we want to be able to talk about our past experiences and what is relevant about those experience in the lens that we're wanting to go so if you're someone who worked in retail for a long time and you're making a transition into administration what are those pieces that you used in retail that are really beneficial for going into administration that customer service the detail orientation that you might have used in certain tasks those things are the things that we really want to highlight when we are creating our profiles so that people who look at your profile aren't just saying oh okay this person worked in refi retail maybe they're not the best fit but they're saying oh wow this person did this this and this and here's how that's really connected to what we're doing at our company in linkedin like i said you're putting in that employment history you're talking about your education um any certificates that you've had any additional training even if you didn't necessarily get a degree right if you did a webinar training or if you did a workshop or if you went to a event where you were able to pick up a new coding skill or python or anything that adds to that portfolio of where you want to go put that on linkedin because employers want to know that internships right just like a job internships are also great for you to be able to put those skill sets into your profile for other people to be able to see and then going back to earlier with the value that professors and previous leaders and mentors that you've had find them on linkedin and connect with them and see what they're up to and what are they reading what do they follow and that can give you some direction for places that you can start if you're getting onto linkedin for the first time and you're like i have no idea what to look at right away next slide so this is just an example of a profile so this is liz ryan and she has her summary it talks a little bit about the past but notice how it is very future oriented in this summary that she puts here she talks about her vision she talks about this is what i thought of but here's why that's important to where i am now next slide thank you um another important piece is that we want to be able to be cognizant of our own security and our own safety linkedin just like facebook just like any other um web page is public and things that are on the web can be seen by other people um whether or not we have different things private and so always be cognizant of what you're posting on here similar to facebook what you are um adding what you are sharing what you're liking on here and then just go into your privacy settings when you have your account and make sure that your privacy settings are set to something that you are comfortable with um who do you want to be able to see your other connections who do you want to be able to see your email address who do you want to be able to see your full name you can add all of these things on there if you're comfortable with that and in the same way you can also take some of those details off so that you can feel more comfortable with your own privacy along these lines if you're adding a resume onto linkedin i always encourage people to take your address your actual full street address off of your resume before uploading it to linkedin you can keep your zip code you can keep your city if you're comfortable with that but take off the physical address because again this is a public online site and we would just want to make sure that we're safe in the information that we are sharing on here next slide so here's where we start getting into the good stuff right so once you have set up your profile once you have put some of those details about the experiences that you've had once you put the information about past projects that you've had you start adding some of those connections you start following a couple of companies then you can start to do some of this other stuff so first off joining groups find things that are interesting to you find those groups that are related to what you're wanting to do and find people who are in your field that can help you with that right so it's great to build connections with people individually but it's also great to join a whole group where you have that full community of support so that you're not waiting on maybe one person to answer a message but so that you can put out a question and you have an entire group of people who are there to support and reflect and can really engage with you and brainstorm with you on whatever that question you have is and we'll look at that in just a minute um also exploring the conversation see what is in the news feed what are the trends that are happening what are important players within your field talking about and do a little bit of research on that this can help you out when you get to that um interview phase because then you're able to talk a little bit about the current events and you can start to relate that and then your employer that you're talking to in that interview can start to think oh this person really knows what they're talking about this is really important to us also let's continue to talk right and they want to continue that conversation beyond the interview and hopefully hire you on into a new position so exploring that conversation making sure that you're staying up to date and relevant with what other people are talking about and then also chiming in with your own thoughts on that to be able to be a part of that conversation rather than just an observer we also have the alumni function i love this function um especially as someone who currently works within a college and i was at colorado state university and their career services before this and it's great for four years two years it's great for our international students it's just a really fantastic function again about building up that community and being able to leverage relationships and connections that you already have right so joining these groups joining alumni functions participating in conversations you already have at least if not more than one thing in common right if you've already graduated from the same university or the same institution then you already know hey we have that one thing in common and then if they're interested in the same field as you great you already have two things in common with this person that you can start talking about so it's not just this awkward feeling of okay i'm gonna reach out to this person they seem like a great person what do i say it's more of a i'm gonna reach out to this person and i'm going to mention hey i noticed that we're both graduates of colorado state university's higher education program from 2017 let's let's talk a little bit about that or you graduated in 2015 i graduated in 2017. let's talk about that um so use those small talk conversation openers to be able to build that network in a more authentic way rather than just jumping in right away and saying hey help me please and then last following those companies again being able to follow your previous employers if they were a great company and they give you a lot of good connections follow them see what they're up to now um being able to see what impact maybe you had at that company shown through their current work that they're still doing looking at possible employers people that you're interested in working for follow those companies beyond that find people who work at those companies that you're interested in working at and be able to build connections with them so that again you have that reality tv vision of okay this is what the company wants me to see these are the great things that are happening there but then also having that realistic down-to-earth kind of conversation with someone who's actually there and can tell you the ins and outs of what's actually happening and how on the more small and everyday life does that mission get carried out and then also leaders in the industry every industry has people that it looks up to and who are kind of revolutionaries within that topic so go out and find those for you and see how they can benefit you and again keep you up to date and here i'm going to ask if i can share my screen so that we can just look at a couple of these and by the way if any of you have any questions please use that q a function and i'll be able to get to those questions that you might have or of course at the end i'll be able to also answer any questions that you all have so this is linkedin professional facebook right so it has all of these people on here it has companies that i'm interested in companies that are in my field within my pathways that my students might be interested in just all of this great information over on the right column it also has today's news and views so just seeing what's happening in the world in general and thinking about how does that affect my position how does that affect where i want to go in the future so if you click on the search bar then there are some different options that pop up here so if you just want to look for people you can look for people and you can tie it click on people and you can type in an industry or a keyword that you think relates if you want to find a specific person same thing with jobs you can type in a specific company name and we'll look at that in just a little bit content if you're interested in a particular topic or something that's happening you can search for that companies schools groups and events so we're going to start off with groups and if i'm looking for a group let's say in technology in denver then i can just type that into my search bar and it's going to give me all of these different groups that i might be interested in whoops these are positions so 100 different results for denver information technology we have denver information technology professionals we have all of these groups and so if i click on it it'll typically give you a little bit of information about the group and it'll also give you a little bit of information about are the people in this group connected to me in any way am i connected based on education am i connected based on people that i am already connected to on linkedin people within higher education which is my industry we can look at that and then if you're like oh yeah this sounds great request to join it and then you can see all the conversations that they're having and then so that's groups and then we're going to look at institutions so if you go up into the search bar you can obviously i work at cca so that's my go-to right now but if you let's say graduated from university of denver then you can click on university of denver and so on here of course it's going to have all the general information that they want you to see but over here on the left column there is an alumni box and so if you go on to this then it'll give you all of this really great information so we get to see where are these people this can be really great for people who are planning on relocating to a different place or maybe have located to denver but maybe you went to school in a different place who are people who graduated from your institution who are in this area you can also see where these people are working you can filter it by when they graduated from um so obviously du has a lot of alumni on here almost 80 000 that can be a lot to filter through and so you can also just make that a smaller population we can also sidestep and look at what they do so where are these people working look at what they studied when they were in school and keep in mind not everybody who studied a certain major or graduated with a certain degree are doing that exact thing so i tend to lean more towards what they're doing now so if we're on that i t field still and we click on okay someone from i t what they studied in it obviously a lot of them are here if you're thinking about going back to school and you're interested in seeing what people studied who are in a particular field you can look at this and it will also give you lots of information and then what they're skilled at so this can be great if you are let's say learning a new skill and you're looking for a mentor who can help you out with that um so for something like it right if you're still trying to figure out microsoft all this you can look for people who have that skill or if you're looking for something like data analysis you can look up people who are doing that but basically you go through you click any of the filters that you're interested in right if i want okay people from do you who studied it who are in the denver area i click all of these filters or if i'm not finding them you can type it in up here in the top area and then when you're done filtering and you look comfortable with that if you just scroll to the bottom then it gives you all the people who fit that search criteria for you and that gives you all of these people that you can then start looking at to see okay who do i want to be my next connection who do i want to start engaging with and it's really neat on linkedin because it tells you who's already connected with these people so on some of these i have four connections two connections three connections so i already have a mutual person who knows these people that i can either reach out directly to and say hey courtney can you help me reach out to aaron he is a child welfare welfare social case worker and i really want to learn more about what he's doing then you can have that mutual person connect or you can just look up their profile and see okay i was looking at i t i'm not quite sure how exactly this is relevant to that and you can look a little bit more about what does that look at look like experience and this is where you can see that it's really important for you to fill out your profile also because the more information you have the easier it is for other people to be able to see you and connect with you also so we can see all these things and give and get ideas for what we might want to do in the future or who we might want to follow so there's different licenses that this person has different schools that they went to different endorsements endorsements are another piece of linkedin that are really neat because essentially if you know someone who can basically vouch for a skill that you have then they can endorse you on linkedin and then the more endorsements you have it's basically just more evidence to supply to the employers that says hey this person actually does have leadership this person actually does have public speaking skills they're not just saying that they have it they actually do have it and they have shown that to all of these other people so that's where the alumni function is really helpful and i'll go ahead and stop sharing and we can go back to the slide perfect so um i do see a question here that i'll answer really quick while we get back to the slide um is it true that companies can pay money to be able to see when i visited their page that makes me very scared i don't want to look at my old employers or a new employer and let them know it feels creepy to me is there a way to avoid that so yes if a company has premium access then they can sometimes look at if you have visited their page same thing with individual people they can see sometimes if you have visited their page um this is something that you can look at in your privacy settings and adjust a little bit however unfortunately you can't 100 percent get that out because people are paying for this information and paying for this data um however being able to just look at the company and see kind of what's happening in general typically the company in general um is going to be less i guess less intensive on who exactly is looking at the company page versus the individuals um so if you're going on to an old um supervisor's page then they're probably going to see that and that's just kind of a question to have with yourself on okay is this really a page that i want to be looking at and what purpose does this serve me to be able to look at their page all right so searching for jobs there are a couple of different ways that we can do this um so one of them is just a general search as we just saw in that last screen where you can just type in whatever it is that you're looking for and a lot of things pop up or you can go in and you can do a filtered search and so in that you can see that there are a lot of different topics that you can filter by you can filter by when a position was posted um for me a lot of times i want to look at the more recently posted positions because i know that they're still open whereas positions that are older than a month i sometimes am starting to think okay is this worth it has it maybe closed has someone maybe forgotten to take it down and so i tend to look at the more recent ones but definitely definitely if you have the time and you are okay with um having that filter a little bit longer out then you can have it adjusted to beyond a month also there's the different features if you're wanting to look at the um um easy application right if you've already uploaded your resume onto linkedin you can select easy apply so that way it's basically you click a button and send your resume off rather than having to fill out an entire application on its own you can search by job type location um so location is interesting because you don't get to type in anything extra in the advanced search so this is where the top bar where i typed in denver colorado helped so that that location was specific to the denver area if you leave that location blank in the top bar then it's just going to give you major cities where there are a lot of those positions so if you're looking to relocate them that's great because they can show you kind of those hot spots for that type of position otherwise if you're looking for a specific area type in the general city that you're looking at and then it'll give you kind of those sub categories within that location and then same thing company industry job function experience level all of that great stuff next slide so again looking at relevant groups can be really helpful and be able to let you build up your network next slide all right so just some notes to keep in mind with linkedin um this is a free platform yes you can upgrade to the premium and basically what the premium platform gives you is just access to more resources it gives you access so that you can look at a few extra pages for different companies and employers it gives you the ability to use things like linkedin learning where it's basically a page of a bunch of small webinars and learning um abilities so if you are wanting to learn a new skill or if you're really wanting to focus on okay i really need to practice on my interviewing skills then that's where you can use linkedin learning to be able to watch those videos or participate in those learning activities which is included within that premium account but for most people just that pre platform on linkedin is plenty to be able to get you started and help you do a lot of different things especially just for networking um research what people can do for you again look at the company look at the people that are there especially if you find a position that you're interested in in that company do some research and try to see if you can find a connection who's within that department of the company or at that company in general if it's a small one and see if you can start building up that connection you never know who is talking to who within that company it could be something where you reach out you approach that um employee with being genuine and just curious and wanting to learn and then maybe that employee goes up to their boss and says hey i talked to this really neat person today they were interested in our company they have these different skills um i know that we're hiring for this position maybe let's watch out for them so being able to see how can these different connections and relationships help you to be able to get better at the way that you're networking and be able to learn more about the companies before you jump in with your application especially when there's so many different positions and applications and trying to figure out okay who do i apply for how do i apply when do i apply who are the people all of that good stuff also share it with your friends your friends are some of your best advocates right they know who you are they know the skills that you have and so if you tell them what you're looking for and you also add them on linkedin there are some great people to be able to tell other people within their networks hey i have a friend i have a person they're really great at this um maybe you should connect sometime so again it gets back to that mutual connection also being mindful of your time and others time um so again doing the research ahead of time and understanding okay what is it that i want out of this connection what is it that i'm looking for in a new relationship or within my network what am i lacking what do i want to look for so that way when you're going out and connecting with people you're being mindful of those conversations that you're starting rather than just kind of talking in circles and um the other person thinking okay i'm not sure exactly what you're asking what's the ask here or what's what's happening so just being intentional about that and then also understanding that this is again a professional platform so you want to make sure that you have that professional appearance that you are communicating to other people that you are responding to messages on time that you are responding kindly and courteously that you're not reaching out to people and coming across as rude again in the age of digital technology where we're very accustomed to short talk and being able to type as few words as possible things can be misconstrued so making sure that you're very intentional about saying please and thank you and just using all of those kind of good manners things that you've picked up over the years and then be careful of not getting stuck so something like the alumni function right you can scroll through that for hours and you can always find new things and new people to look at same thing with the groups you can scroll through groups for hours and you can find different things on there and it's great but just be cognizant of the time that you're spending on there just like anything else you can get addicted to linkedin you can fall down that wormhole and then come back out three hours later like oh wow it's midnight where did the time go so just being mindful of that i see i have a couple of other things in my q a still um so how do you turn off a previous search or alerts from an old job um so for that basically what you can do is you can go into your privacy and you can change your privacy settings a little bit um so that you're able to turn off the alerts that you're getting from let's say if you had an old search and you said i want to keep on hearing about these you can go back into those settings and you can just turn that off um otherwise you can go into your search history box within your settings and you can also clear that um i want to keep parking working from home when covid 19 is passed is there a way to search on linkedin for jobs that are just working from home i'm not positive if there is a way to look for just work from home jobs i know though that there are some resources that are out in the community for that um and so if i um get an email from you after this i have my email on the last slide um and just let me know the question that you had and i can send you a webinar that i actually just listened to that was specific to people who are looking for um remote work and then eileen my colleague has also just mentioned that you can search in the search bar and say remote remote work in there but again it's not going to capture everything but you can try to filter with that i'm just going to move on i have a couple more slides and then i'll answer the rest of these questions um so next slide so last few tips update your status um post in the discussion groups connect with the industry experts and then creating your own group so obtaining your status shows that you are on top of it it shows that you're there um there are a few things worse than linkedin than reaching out to a person who never responds because they're not active in linkedin and so if you are updating your status and posting and liking and commenting then that tells people that you are active that you're available that if they message you that you're going to respond and so the more that you're able to just kind of keep up that feed and let people know that you're still around and you're still engaged is going to be great so that you're not trying to pull all of the legwork and making all of the connections yourself and you're also able to draw in other people who want to connect with you posting in the group discussions again you can build so many strong relationships from those groups where there's a community and you can have those really thought-provoking conversations based on what you're putting in those chats and then having a reason when you connect with the industry experts um being intentional about the comments that you're making sharing resources can be really great if you find a link or a resource especially if you've already built a connection it can be really low maintenance for you to just kind of uphold those connections right a lot of people think okay i gotta go build out all of these connections and they do a lot of work but then they let them all just kind of stay stagnant after that and you want to make sure that you're able to connect with a couple of people every month to be able to say like hey i saw this um resource i just thought that it would be relevant for you or hey just checking in this is something that i thought of that i thought of you when i thought of it so just maintaining those relationships and maintaining um the connections that you have can be really good and on linkedin really easy it can be simple as simple as commenting on a post that they have or liking or celebrating on their posts that they have and if you're not finding something that you're looking for create your own group find other people there's always going to be other people out there who are interested in the same things that you even if maybe nobody has thought to create a group for it before so please create groups if you're not finding exactly what you're looking for and then add your network and your friends and your connections and your mentors to that group so final thoughts on here and then i'll get back to the chat how you establish yourself through networking is really important regardless of whether that's in person right when we're able to go back to coffee shops or be able to have those lunch meetings or if that's something like online which is a little bit more feasible right now um it all matters so be respectful pay attention to what you're commenting to pay attention to what you're sharing pay attention to what others are commenting to and sharing and just make sure that you're recognizing that this is still a professional community um and so just being aware of what you're posting on there what you are choosing to engage in on this site um because again it is a public site um and being able to be mindful of do i really want this out in a professional setting so here's my contact information i also have other resources for cca on our career page and i'm just gonna look at these questions again okay so i have are there any red flags on someone's profile that'll give em players or connections a bad impression what should i avoid great question so basically red flags on someone's profile is someone who is not active right so again you want to be active you want to be able to be on there and showing and engaging with other people what it is that you are motivated by what your mission is what you're excited about you want to be able to have those on there um and same thing if you're looking at another person's profile you want to be able to see that they're active um also just being aware of what are your values right not everybody is always going to be happy um with things that you're sharing and so really understanding what is the impact of sharing certain posts what is the impact of putting something out there and what population does that go out to what population does that serve when you post that content and just being intentional of making sure that what you're posting is resonating with the industry and the people that you have on your page that you are trying to connect with and engage more with i would say also just having information about yourself on linkedin in a professional life so having good information when you're talking about your employment not just having this is where i worked here's when i worked there but being able to say this is where i worked and here's what i did there here's what i accomplished there again writing in the direction that you're wanting to go um linkedin is pretty predictive in its job search and so when you are in that job search or when linkedin is trying to compile things for your feed that it thinks that you want to see um having things in your profile and having groups and having connections and following different pages that all align with that end goal for you are going to be the best for you to be able to get to where you want to go because then linkedin knows ooh okay this person is interested in um administration so we're going to give them these types of administration jobs because they have written and filled out their profile in a way that is talking about organization and communication and filing and something maybe like quickbooks um so that it can really be able to tune that and make sure that you're seeing what it thinks is the most appropriate for you rather than having things all over the place that are scattered which is great to be it's great to be diverse in your profile but you want to still have a direction and you still want to have a mission and that target of where you want to go with that i have another question on here i want to get a desk job and most of my experiences in restaurants should i put all 14 of my restaurant shops on my linkedin or should i leave some off i would ask myself is there something so i typically will start at the most recent and i'll work my way back and if there is something that is further back that adds to what i've already talked about from my more recent positions then i will add that whether that's a bullet or adding the job in general that's kind of how i approach that and so if let's say i worked at a position let's say it was like the first or second position and it was me just learning about the industry but then i was able to grow off of that in my next 12 positions and the other 12 positions were a lot more meaningful then yeah i might not talk about the first ones because i want my information to be again targeted but i also want it to be concise and clear for people to be able to get through and not just be scrolling forever especially when linkedin is written in a way that goes typically from one category to the next if you have other categories on your linkedin like um let's say your education or a project that's relevant to a desk job that you did let's say you volunteered somewhere you want people to be able to get to that other information that's relevant rather than just scrolling through all of the different restaurant jobs um so yeah ask yourself does this holder position really add to my portfolio that i have on here already um should i ask previous employers for endorsements on linkedin yes absolutely um if you still have a great relationship with the other employers or not even necessarily your supervisors but your co-workers and your colleagues go ahead yes ask them for endorsements um go on their page and endorse them also um send them a message that says hey i'm gonna give you this endorsement for this would you mind just looking at my list of skills and also endorsing me um or being able to write a really good positive summary about each other and saying like hey you were a really important person for me to work with in this previous job i think i'm going to write a summary for you this is what i'm thinking about saying do you have any thoughts on that and typically people are like yeah that sounds great thanks so much um and then they will reciprocate a lot of times and say hey is there anything that i can maybe write for you i think that you are pretty great at this also um so being able to write a summary or endorsing each other i think is absolutely great and it's 100 okay to ask other people to endorse you or to write a summary especially if you're looking for that next position and you think that there's something that they can say and that that'll be helpful for you typically no more than a paragraph is plenty for that summary um i see another one that just came in what does it mean by first second degree for email addresses being seen um on the email address i'm not quite sure exactly what the question is but as far as first degree versus second degree connections a first connection is a connection that you are directly connected with so that would be like me already connected with my colleague eileen or me already connected with my supervisor whereas a second degree is i'm not connected with this person yet we're not necessarily linkedin friends yet but there is a person in the middle who knows both of us um so let's say if i wanted to connect with um maybe someone from johnson and wales university i know that my colleague worked at johnson and mail so i might be able to ask her hey can you connect me with this other person who's working at johnson and wheels that it says that you know and then there's also the third and plus degree um connections which is basically you don't have any um mutual friends but um somewhere along the way you might in the future is the summary important yes um i like my summary to be more of a narrative so if we're thinking about our other experiences that we have so our job experience and our projects that we've done and those endorsements those are all pretty objective right they're statements of this is what i did this is what i accomplished this is the value that i served there whereas your summary is really that opportunity to write to the direction you want to go right to the future so talking about this is really my vision for myself this is what motivates me this is what excites me when i'm moving forward these are the values that i have these are the values that i want to bring to a company and here's how i use them and so being able to write your summary in um sometimes it can be a very concise one paragraph summary and some people have a couple of paragraphs and so it's really what fits you and your style but really you want that to be able to be this is who i am this is why that's important for me moving forward and where i want to go and here are the skills that i have to help me get there and one more question how do i approach your contact connections on linkedin yeah absolutely so once you've found a person that you want to connect with you can hit the connect button and then typically after you can hit the connect button then it'll ask do you want to send a message and i always send a message because basically it's the same concept of if you got a random friend request on facebook but you don't know who they are what's the likelihood that you're going to actually accept that versus if i got a message on linkedin from someone that said hi erica this is who i am this is why i think that our connection would be valuable then that gives me a little bit more to work with and i'm like oh okay yeah that's great and i'll add them um all it has to be really is that elevator pitch with a little bit of information on here's why i think that our connection or our relationship can be beneficial if you are reaching out to let's say someone who's in a company that you're interested in hi i'm really interested in working for this company and i saw that you worked there i saw that you have some really great um experience there i'm just wondering if we can connect maybe talk a little bit about your experience there or if it's a recruiter hi i'm interested in applying here i'd really like to learn a little bit from you about the company if it's someone who you're thinking okay maybe i don't necessarily want to work here or i'm not looking for a job here right now but you have a skill that i'm looking for or but you're a leader in one of the fields that i'm really interested in then hey i'm really impressed by the work that you do i'd love to stay connected and just stay involved in what you're doing and people on linkedin are very very kind in this respect because that's literally what libyan is for it's for building these connections it's for being able to get to know each other being able to build your professional network and i have never had someone that i've reached out to wanting more information who was just like no i don't want to talk to the talk about that or no i don't want to talk to you um people are on linkedin for connections and so every time that i connect with someone and they're responding back they're saying yeah what can i assist with yeah what questions do you have let's talk a little bit about that um so that you're able to have those connections and have those discussions and be able to really build and nurture those connections and relationships and then also just kind of being aware of how many connections um you're being you're making each month making sure that you have the sustenance and the ability to actually maintain those connections rather than going out and trying to connect with a hundred different people in a day there's no possible way that you can build up all 100 connections right then and there you need to kind of start off slow build up a couple of relationships at a time so that you can have those good conversations and those strong relationships that you can build up and then from there that's when you can start to add a couple more here and there um but just again being intentional about who it is that you are um wanting to make those interactions with all right i see that um we're coming up on time and i don't have any other questions but i'm happy to connect to anybody who has other questions again you can go into um our page and look at our other resources or you can email us careerservices.cca ccaurora.edu and we would be happy to respond to any questions or any follow-ups that anybody has but we're excited that you took the time out of your day to be able to participate in this and i really look forward to what's the potential of working with anybody in the future

buddy it's uh scott fairchild executive director of the dscc um really appreciate everybody taking the time to get on today um uh with three um leading lights in our party uh senator elizabeth warren uh mj hagar uh and mayor adrian perkins i'm really appreciative of all all of you taking the time to join us today um before i uh turn it over to senator warren just wanted to just give everybody a quick overview of the the larger map 97 percent of the republican spending is on defense right now we've got them on their heels and our candidates are taking it to them around healthcare we're doing this pre-pandemic and if you think expanding medicaid or protecting people with pre-existing conditions was a good idea pre-pandemic you can bet it's an even better idea now our we've had 13 races be upgraded in our direction just in the last two months and the dscc is involved in more voting rights legislation than any other organization in the country right now protecting the right to vote for for americans all over the country so um i want to remind folks that you can go to elizabethwarren.com to get involved help candidates um help help folks some as we as we work here to flip the senate um and with that i want to turn it over to senator elizabeth warren really appreciate you are you and your team organizing this for us ma'am oh delighted to do it so thank you so much scott for the introduction and for bringing us up to date with such good news and hello to all you warren democrats who are here with us this evening it is so good to be with you in community uh tonight and i am so glad that progressive champions like mj hagar and adrienne perkins are going to be joining us for this conversation in just a couple of minutes this could be really exciting you know i will get straight to the point this is a moment of crisis for our nation and across this country the fight for social racial and economic justice wages on as we fight for justice we are also battling a global pandemic and an economy on the brink of collapse the coronavirus has turned the world as we know it upside down over six and a half million coronavirus cases now nearly 200 000 of our family and friends and loved ones have died from covet 19. black and brown communities are being infected and killed by this virus at alarming rates and in times of crisis government can be a powerful force for good if competence and moral clarity rule the day donald trump's response to this crisis has been incompetent and morally bankrupt and at every turn he has fanned the flames of racism and bigotry he has ignored the warnings that came before this pandemic he has refused to lead he has let thousands die he has failed to meet this moment but donald trump has not failed alone no mitch mcconnell and the republicans have been right by his side they have enabled corruption they have emboldened trump's ego and they have eroded democracy since donald trump was sworn into office and now more than ever we need new leadership we need new voices we need a new vision for our government to uplift working families and to build an america the dungeons work for a handful of folks but that works for everyone so democrats we got a job to do in less than 50 days beat donald trump and elect joe biden but it is not enough to win the white house we need to make sure we're doing everything in our power to take back the majority and to hang on to our majority in the house and to take back the senate and i'm just going to be blunt we are not going to win the senate if we don't support candidates like adrienne perkins and mj hagar when we win back the senate we must ensure that we are ready to fight for the kind of change needed to make our country work for everyone not just for a handful of people and that's why it's so important to elect candidates that are ready to tackle these challenges on the first day so warren democrats is proud to endorse candidates who understand the importance of changing our country's approach to some of our most pressing issues from climate change to criminal justice to health care people who have plans for how their states can meet this moment so i am honored to join you today for this important conversation so let's get started mj and adrian i've got a question in order to get us kicked off here we have all seen how this pandemic has changed the way that candidates campaign nobody gets to do those face-to-face conversations like we used to be able to and nobody gets to do all those selfies like we used to do the things that are uniquely a part of running for office so i was hoping maybe you could tell us a little bit about how you've been closing that gap so that you really get a chance to connect with voters now that you've had to do this online you know mj would you like to start sure thank you so much uh it's so good to see you senator warren thanks for having me today um you know it's been a challenge but in the military you know i flew uh rescue missions in afghanistan and we were taught that when you had an obstacle you didn't just overcome it you try to turn it to an advantage and so we've taken this digital environment and whereas we were driving tens of thousands of miles across this amazing and beautiful state now we're digitally virtually going tens of thousands of miles um we've been all over the state connecting with people in person and making those important relationships and now that we're virtual the virtual environment's actually a lot less um intrusive and intimidating to persuadable voters who maybe are on the fence and who wouldn't have come out to an in-person event because that's a big time commitment and they have to plan their whole night around it but they're willing to click on a town hall um also one of my favorite things to do when you see people campaigning a lot of times we're trying to uplift the stories of the people we hear on the trail and we're like you know i met this nurse in the rio grande valley or i met this postal worker talking about this and this environment has really enabled me to have um issue based town halls where i'm actually able to invite those people and and lift them up and and help um teach the public what what the daca program is and and things like that and so i believe we have done everything we could to turn this to an advantage and we've seen that result in the polls and in the grassroots momentum here in texas um we're we're setting turnout uh voter turnout records despite the covet environment um in a uh primary runoff electorate which should be a very small electorate we had a million people vote despite all the voter suppression in texas and despite the very little vote by mail people waiting hours in line in the middle of a pandemic in july in texas to to vote um and so we're very excited about what's happening here in texas good for you it sounds like you've really met this head on and uh sounds like you're actually having some fun doing all of this which i thought i'm very glad to see for people good for you because that's what it's about adrian how about you how's this affected you and and what have you done to respond yeah very similar ways uh senator but first of all thanks so much for having me on very sure and also is uh happy to be here with uh mj as well and thank you for your service mj i have a similar background in coming from the military and what we've identified is there are pros and cons to operating in a coveted environment the pros is that i can hop around the state on zoom calls pretty quickly i've done you know town halls with chambers of commerce in lake charles or lafayette and then jumped over to to talk to donors in new orleans or baton rouge in a matter of minutes and in a non-covenant environment that wouldn't be that wouldn't be really acceptable so we really leverage technology as best as we can and as we go out into the states uh primarily on the weekends i'm still the mayor of a city uh we are making sure that people are outside that people are wearing face masks uh that we're really prioritizing public health since we are in the middle of a pandemic in order for me to be the leader that louisiana deserves they gotta we gotta be responsible on the campaign trail as well so there's been pros and cons to it but uh our our message is catching wind and people are hearing about us all around the state and they're excited good for you i'll start with you and then and then go to to mj um we've seen a lot of the republican candidates really either enable or excuse the trump administration's corruption and i just wanted to see um from your time as uh as as mayor and then what both of you are planning to to do um to tackle corruption and campaign finance reform uh if and when you you're elected to the senate yeah my opponent senator cassidy is definitely one of those leading the charge to uh insulate the president from any kind of responsibility uh but yeah overall uh to fight corruption in washington dc i think we started with action on our campaign and that action was to not to accept any corporate pac dollars so we've again just you know kind of virtue signaled out to those that are following our campaign but once in the senate uh we need to fight to pass legislation uh to turn around what citizens united ruled in the courts uh we don't have to wait on the courts to rule on it again us as legislators we can take action of that to prevent as much money that we've seen that floods into our elections and i'll say i am a i'm from a low-income household a single mother raised me and my two older brothers she made about 38 000 a year it is difficult to impossible for someone with that kind of background to make it into our political process and that's not right you know i know the values that my mother have and that a lot of other working-class people have out there and we can't have a true democracy until we lower the financial barriers that are there yeah good for you uh because you're exactly right about this this is one of the reasons i'm excited to have you in this race and to see you move forward i think we're going to have a real opportunity to attack corruption head-on i think i think the american people have had enough of this and donald trump it was bad enough before but donald trump has pushed this to such levels now and you're right uh about your opponent on this so good for you that you're in this how about you mj how are you looking at this is an issue going forward yeah people keep asking me like what are my top issues what are you know the things that i'm passionate about and i always start with this because um while healthcare is the most important thing to talk about in texas and climate change is my personal uh most important issue for our species and for our country our national security our economy and our planet um we can't get the action we need on healthcare corrupt or healthcare immigration climate change gun safety um until we we end citizens united and i think it may take a constitutional amendment and that's something i'm going to be fighting for um and citizens united is actually the first endorsement i got on my senate campaign it was the day after i announced um because they actually came to me on my congressional last cycle and said we've noticed every time you get a microphone you're talking about ending citizens united and ending corruption and maybe we should partner together um and so it's something that i'm very passionate about when i came to dc to open hundreds of thousands of jobs for women in the military i was told there was no chance i was gonna be successful because i wasn't a big corporate donor and i didn't have any political capital and um i was still able to build a broad bipartisan coalition but it wasn't easy because of the the corruption um my opponent is the perfect example of why that corruption is so bad um the specifically with corporate pak money you know he received so much money from the private detention centers um that are profiting off of the humanitarian crisis and the broken immigration system so he has consistently voted against bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform and keeping that program keeping our policies broken so that his corporate donors can maximize their profits and and and be at max capacity which is disgusting to me and it really hobbles our ability to um be the leaders of the free world and be able to lecture people like china on their human rights violations of the uyghurs um we've got to maintain that credibility and and stand for the values that our country was founded on um he receives so much money from the gun lobby and then you know 80 of texans want universal background checks and still our own senators won't support it because of that so i believe that the corrupting factor of corporate money in politics is why our government is so dysfunctional not only does it make some of our legislators legislate for profit margins instead of for working families but it also creates this gridlock of hyper partisanship because it's really difficult um i would feel bad for senator cornyn if he wasn't if his policies weren't so damaging to my state um because he's in a position where he has to look like he's serving his constituents actually serve as corporate donors and their profit margins and protect their interests and also take his marching orders from mitch mcconnell um and it's very difficult to serve those three masters um and so we're the ones that get the short end of the stick yeah boy you've got that one nailed exactly right anything else we want to do we've got to be willing to take on the corruption in order to get it done so in fact let me just ask about that because in the last few years both texas and louisiana have been directly hit by climate change unprecedented flooding devastating storms and yet republicans in the senate haven't given your states the necessary support to recover or to address this crisis so let me start this time with you mj what's your plan to tackle climate change head on and to get the relief that texas needs i've got a plan for that senator warren oh i'm glad to hear it way to go mj you have to have a plan because we're texas i mean nearly 10 of our economy is is in the energy industry um and as i'm talking to workers in southeast texas and the permian basin they want to have jobs they want to be able to put food on the table for their kids and they feel this real you know conflict because they also feel like they go to work every day and they're destroying the planet that they're handing their kids um and so you know i really think that too often people overlook i mean climate change itself is an existential threat to our children but there is also the pentagon has listed as one of our top national security threats so as a veteran i take national security threat seriously um and in texas it's an economic threat um in texas um you know through the executive mba that i got from ut taught me among other things that you cannot be a leader in business if you are going to hold on with both hands to the the antiquated technology that made you successful last decade or last century and that's what's happening in the texas energy industry right now we lead the nation um but if we're going to continue leading the nation if we're going to protect jobs which by the way we've already lost over 60 000 jobs in the energy industry this year um and and we were in an economic crisis with the oil industry before covet 19 because saudi arabia and russia were flooding the market so i would really like the texas economy to not be dependent on the actions of countries like saudi arabia and russia i want to continue leading in the energy industry and if we're going to do that we have to center energy workers in that transition they have the expertise they have the understanding they have the clarity of you know energy production and not just profit margins like the ceos that john cornyn listens to when i talk to them they see the writing on the wall um you know we want their input in creating energy jobs instead of constantly losing them um and you know we need to recognize that communities of color especially in texas are on the front line of this crisis they're already disproportionately experiencing the effects of this crisis and from other environmental crises because we tend to put plants that spew toxicity and to lower you know economically disadvantaged communities and communities of color um they're also the last to get hurricane relief and support um so you know the bottom line is we need to set aggressive goals for the expansion of clean renewable energy if we want to continue leading and not let china lead in renewable energy we need to invest in clean energy manufacturing and sustainable transportation we have to modernize our energy grid with infrastructure investments to make sure that it's equipped to handle the increased load during peak usage um and and like i said um i think that the key is to center our energy workers in this broad coalition of stakeholders that we bring together in order to use their energy expertise as we pave the path forward you know texas need you well thank you thank you i'm really tired of watching the corporations do great while my fellow texans and neighbors are suffering all right so i'll jump in now i was going to say i thought scott was going to bump in yeah i was pausing but it's okay adriana mj has talked about the devastating effects of climate change but let's face it louisiana sure has been no stranger to this uh it's seen more than its share of natural disasters as a result of climate change so do talk to us about this adrian and talk to us a little bit about how you frame the issue and how you plan to tackle it go ahead i want to hear from you on this well i'll say that the future senator of texas just described the economic way forward in a much better way that i could i know to talk about that uh but i can talk about the impact uh that it's had on my state as of late uh and louisiana is no different as a matter of fact my brother works in the oil and gas industry my my father works in the oil and gas industry and uh my brother has been laid off we have lost so many jobs even before covet 19 because it's a very volatile industry and we think of it very singularly here i agree with the with mj and saying that hey we have to retrofit our economy not to just be focused on fossil fuels but to be focused on renewable energy resources too so that we can keep people at work it's a way that we can respect our energy sector within our economy but also be responsible for the environment as well and take care of future generations to come what we're seeing right now the impact on our current generation louisiana just got hit with the fourth most powerful storm to ever hit the united states in hurricane laura hurricane laura made it to shreveport we are four hours from the coast they made it to shreveport still as a as a category one hurricane and we had to prepare for that as a community it wiped out our power grid where 90 000 honed or without power that's people that are on respirators people that need medical equipment to be functioning a lot of our seniors without generators so that they can have the things that they need uh unfortunately we got our grid back up uh pretty quickly over about five days and we didn't have any loss of life but lake charles to this day still looks like a war zone uh we need fema to be in there helping out but if you think about it how many of these storms can we take we were just hit this morning new orleans was just uh swiped by hurricane sally i think alabama and mississippi took the brunt of it uh but it's for the hurricanes out there in the atlantic right now and we don't know where they're gonna go uh we are seeing storms and these century you know storms of the century happen every other year as a mayor i can tell you one of the things that kept me up at night for the first four months of my administration was the rain because we got more we got a year's worth of rainfall in four months what it did was it damaged our infrastructure it flooded our river it flooded our neighborhoods and as already was pointed out minority neighborhoods took the brunt of it uh this is something that we cannot wait on any longer denying it it's just out of the window and my opponent hasn't even addressed it he hasn't got us the resources we need and again he's just marched to the party drum the entire time he's been in the senate yeah well louisiana needs you and america needs you in fact the earth needs both of you uh as we know this one hits locally and you talk with real passion about how it affects your home states but our solution has got to be global and we're going to work together on that you know i want to i want to ask you about one other issue and that is you know one of the things that's weighing heavily on our democracy is voter suppression it is the oldest tool in the republican playbook and the pandemic has only made their efforts more evident and more obscene so what should voters be doing to make sure that their voices get heard in this election adrian i've been starting with mj would you like to start this one yeah i will jump in gladly because it's a huge day in louisiana when talking about voter suppression our governor sued our secretary of state for an inadequate uh voting plan and we won today so we're extremely happy in louisiana i'm hoping that the republicans get the message that uh they cannot toy around with this without with our voting here in louisiana but we've seen uh blatant undermining of our voting system over the last couple weeks to a degree that i couldn't have imagined you know a direct attack on our u.s postal service that wasn't just trying to take the you know take the legitimacy away from them but what it did it acutely affected our seniors in our communities that depended on checks that are on fixed income it acutely affected the veteran community that depend on medication from the va and again my opponent was completely quiet about it with voter suppression this is what we're telling louisianians across the state and i've talked to several of our democratic parish executive committees about this who sit on the board of the voter registrars within their respective parish you know parishes or counties for those out there that are listening louisiana's a little different but we've told them hey you got it you got to beat the message home to make sure people know to first have the will to vote because they're trying to take it away from you if it wasn't valuable they wouldn't be trying to take it away from you first have the will to vote and next vote as quickly as possible as soon in the cycle as possible so that your vote is counted this november and with that message out there again the republicans can try all the tools that they want but they know the avalanche of blue that's headed their way yeah that's that's really powerful mj you want to add in on this yeah you know um i i think i have a um veterans have somewhat of a unique perspective especially those of us that have served in in places like iraq and afghanistan and other countries where people put their lives on the line to be able to vote and and um people um you know when i was flying medevac in afghanistan during election season we knew we were going to pick up people whose um your your thumb turn is blue when you vote because you do a thumb print and and we picked up people missing thumbs that the taliban had targeted for voting um who uh were killed um you know and so when somebody tells me um i'm gonna vote for you i i feel a an immediate weight on my shoulders that i'm grateful for that that makes me know what a um it's it's a burden but in a good way um i have to think of a better word for it but it's it's it's definitely it's a centering moment for me where i'm like well then i better get back to work because your vote is something very precious um and so you know we we have a long history of voter suppression in texas as well as louisiana um and covet of course is no different um before covid 34 straight states across the country were able to do no excuse vote by mail and now um after covered with certain states relaxing restrictions texas is one of only six states that hasn't relaxed vote by mail restrictions and so um the good news is because we're setting voter turnout records and people are showing that they're still willing to stand in line for hours to vote despite um you know the the pandemic and because biden is doing so well in texas and we have 38 electoral votes i'm hoping our 30 electoral votes are going to contribute to a more stable environment after this election because if biden is sitting on california and texas while we wait for some of these other states to report the results it's going to be very hard um for donald trump to challenge those results and to sew division and so i'm working really hard to make sure that that happens here in texas um i was raised to believe that uh you know if any state can do something texas can do it better um and so i hold governor abbott and our other elected officials accountable to that and and say if other states can do it why can't texas figure it out if they can figure it out and do it safely and securely then we should be able to also um and i don't know if y'all in the audience have ever met a texan but if you try to intimidate us or scare us out of doing something all it does is motivate us to want to do it more um so i have every faith that the voters across texas are going to come to the ballot box this november um an early vote starts in uh like three and a half weeks and so uh this october and november they're gonna come to the ballot box um you know we are trying to recruit poll workers and so that we can um try to shorten the lines and make sure that people are voting with cdc guidelines make sure that we're being as safe as possible um there's so much that we need to do that um we probably don't even have time to talk about right now things like online registration making election day a holiday uh the voting rights act of course is something that we need to pass um but the bottom line is that the people who are in power now in texas are really hoping that we are too scared to vote i mean they are counting on intimidating and scaring um in order to not be held accountable for their failures and their fumbled handling of this pandemic um but uh texans have a very sensitive bs meter and and when when it's when we've had enough and we have certainly had um enough then then texas turn out in force our democracy is so much healthier and stronger and more secure the more people take part in it um so everybody who's watching right now is either in texas or know someone in texas call that person make sure that they uh realize that there's an election going on and and i don't uh that's not a joke um people really have full plates right now um i've got two small kids at home trying to do virtual kindergarten people are losing their jobs people are worried about their their health um and you know everybody has very full plates right now um and so we have to remind everyone that there's an election we have to make sure everybody knows whether or not they're registered doesn't get kicked off the voter polls um has the correct id uh and gets out to the polls and votes that's right make a plan and vote that's right if i could say one other thing on this just briefly but mj and her team in the dscc we've we've won a couple big voting rights cases in texas recently um making it much making it well making it possible to register to vote online which the powers that beep we're preventing and making it making it much easier for people to get registered online was a big big victory for for our side just a couple weeks back yep yep powerfully important stuff so staying after this so scott and i got a few questions from supporters and i'm going to start by reading one from stephen it addresses an issue in general we've already talked about but i thought we might do this so here's what stephen had to say as a former resident of new orleans in houston i've witnessed the firsthand effects of climate change up close if elected you will be u.s senators from two states which are so vulnerable to hurricanes flooding coastal erosion what kind of policies and legislation would you support to combat this so we talked generally about climate change the importance of it how about just keep things moving along name one thing you'd really like to do that you think would be helpful to your state on the climate front or on the the preparation for what happens uh adrian you want to start yeah i will uh the one piece of legislation that i think we need to push push push is an infrastructure bill a couple years ago under the obama administration the epa and doj issued consent decrees in various cities my city is under consent decree right now that's costing us for for our water and sewer um subsurface infrastructure that's costing us about 800 million dollars of the life of this project that is a huge bill for a municipality and we aren't getting any support from the federal government so it's pretty much an unfunded mandate i think in an infrastructure bill there should be dollars allocated to municipalities so that we can make sure that we have infrastructure that has water pumps so we can deal with the flooding that has sufficient infrastructure to deal with the extreme weather events that we're seeing year in and year out and right now cities are struggling to fit those bills especially in a timeline and dealing with the storms that we're seeing and i think that's a bit of a stop gap so over the long term as we you know become carbon neutral that we'll be able to at least have our cities prepared and retrofitted to deal with the extreme weather that we're experiencing good you know i i want to go to a sec here mj but i i just want to support what you're saying on this adrianne because it's um right now uh we've got an economy that is on a real downward spiral uh high unemployment uh and uh uh a lot that's a lot of small businesses that are not gonna reopen a lot of big businesses that have closed permanently or are laying off people state and local government that are about to do layoffs we need to be getting more money into the economy and one way we could be doing that over a longer arc is we should be putting more money into developing our infrastructure and you're exactly right hardening it against climate change new infrastructure where we need it uh upgrading infrastructure infrastructure to meet new challenges from i can go on on and on i talk about the infrastructure bill a lot i talk about we need to be putting broadband in the ground so there's children right now that are forced to be doing virtual learning who don't have access to broadband internet so that they can be equipped just like their peers are and we know that children in urban areas and rural areas are disproportionately affected by the lack of internet access so you know we're actually not even educating our children there's also healthcare implications telehealth is you know is going to be the future of health care and right now a lot of our seniors in rural areas um like my grandmother she doesn't have access to that so she has to get in her car and begrudgingly drive into the big city of shreveport uh to get her health care and there's a lot that we can do with the infrastructure build and it can very much be boosting our economy and creating jobs on the opposite side of covet 19. i like that i like that how about you mj what's one thing you do yeah it's definitely infrastructure but i just want to touch on something i or that i mentioned before which is modernizing the grid so we can handle peak load on renewable energy um so we one of the things that i have found is really disturbing is the trend um when politicians want to um privatize something or or uh you know watch out for the interests of their corporate donors one of the things that they'll do is um uh sabotage something to make it fail they will starve the va or the postal service or whatever of resources and i want to make sure um that they don't do the same thing to make renewable energy fail by not allowing us to modernize our grid because in order for the grid to handle that peak load on renewable energy we we have to modernize it um so i would say also yes infrastructure is definitely it um and broadband is definitely an issue out here in in texas um i did serve in the military but i also uh worked for five years in healthcare and and getting healthcare out to rural areas um was certainly a challenge and one of the ways that we need to do that is through telemedicine because um you know it's hard enough to even get general practice or trauma services out into rural areas let alone um some of the specialists that you need to be able to see for certain diseases or or diagnoses um and so broadband is certainly something that's that's critical i just want to mention that you know um i flew a wildfire support in california um and seeing seeing the impact of climate change on our country you know i also flew hurricane recovery during ike um i just uh visited in texas um you know pulling people off of their roofs in the middle of that uh in 2008 um recently visited the rio grande valley and and saw firsthand how communities are struggling in the wake of hurricane hannah we just passed the three year anniversary of hurricane harvey which was responsible for 88 deaths and caused 125 billion dollars in damages um and and houstonians are still waiting for help and still struggling to rebuild uh and i mentioned that communities of color disproportionately get that help or disproportionately do not get that help and so um i'm a big accountability transparency person in everything and so i would also like to see a little bit more accountability and transparency um in whether it's coveted relief or fema relief or anything on where that money's going and making sure that those decisions are are being made at the right level and that local officials are empowered to help their communities recover november third that's what accountability is all about right both of you are running against incumbent republicans who need to be held accountable on every vote they have taken and on the votes they have failed to take because they've helped mitch mcconnell keep us from bringing legislation to the floor scott i think you've got the last question yeah so um catherine uh wrote in with a great question i'll start with you mj and then we'll go to mayor perkins um what's the what's the biggest thing we um can do to help swing on these southern red states how to get them into the into the blue wave how do it how what's the best way for people to help with that mj so adrian and i don't take corporate pac money on you know unfortunately i don't know about louisiana but texas is a very expensive state um where our average online donation is 23. and we've raised millions of dollars throughout the course of this campaign but also millions just in the last couple months um but i'm fighting against john cornyn's coke network and the gun lobby and the private detention centers and so um donations are critical calling people that you know and asking them to throw us 20 bucks is critical um you can get onto our website mjfortexas.com and click on get involved and be part of our digital organizing team that's phone banking and texting and um you know doing a lot of uh socially distanced field work um and and i i always say and i think i've already mentioned it today but i'll say it again you know someone in texas and so pick up the phone and call that person and tell them to go vote and tell them to bring five people with them um and thank you so much for for having me today thanks yeah and i'll just say that within um you know 24 hours after we announced we had people in over 30 parishes 64 parishes here in louisiana we have people in over 30 parishes making those small dollar donations and contributing to our campaign pushing us forward we just announced about five weeks ago so we have not yet hit the million dollar mark but we're right there and i know that everybody has tuned in even if you don't know anybody in louisiana you know how harmful bill cassidy has been not just to us but to everybody i mean his trademark piece of legislation that luckily failed was a graham-cassidy bill that would have stripped away healthcare from five hundred thousand louisianans and stripped it away from 23 million americans we cannot afford none of us not just louisianans but america cannot afford to give him another six years in the senate because it's no telling what kind of harm he would try to do with that time uh so yeah please contribute to our campaign go to perkinsforla.com and that's the way that we're moving forward and just in over a month we're still out raising any other candidate in the race and obviously my opponent has taken money for pharmaceutical companies the gun lobby you name it everybody that has been you know those special interest groups that are doing harm to our environment literally and figuratively he's in their pocket and that's why he has about six million dollars on hand right now and he's able to stay up on tv and you name it but again as people hear about us we are winning them over so the more donations that we get the more we can jump on tv and we can contest uh the crazy commercials that he's running about supporting the military but not saying anything to the president as he talks crazy about the military and various things like that so it's very much a blue wave going on down here we just need to make make sure that the dollars match the energy that is in louisiana right now and and cap and catherine one thing one more thing i want to say on your question is part of the way we win in red states and this is we recruit military veterans to run you know candidates like mj and and adrian perkins they can over perform joe biden's number they can over the top of the ticket because people people voters value military veterans and um you know i think they're gonna they're gonna over perform the top of the ticket in some of these redder and purpler states um because of because of their their their military service voters will recognize and appreciate that so um folks i i'll turn it back to senator warren but i i wanted to thank everybody for getting on and senator warren you and and and your team and all the

COM. CONGRESS IS TRYING TO CLOSE GAPS IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE BY CUTTING SOME RED TAPE. NEW LEGISLATION WILL TAKE THE BANDAGES OUT OF THE BRICK AND MORTAR CLINICS AND ON THE ROAD.

CARRIE COCHRAN-MCCLAIN: I THINK IT'S A GREAT RECOGNITION OF SOME OF THE EQUITY CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD IN A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES.

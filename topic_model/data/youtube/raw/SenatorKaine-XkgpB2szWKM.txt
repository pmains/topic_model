charlottesville was a shock and what I think it has created is an energy of people of goodwill standing up and saying there will not be hate hate will not define who we are we're on a path of progress and we're gonna stay there nationwide now there's a lot of conversation generally about race but from president Trump himself he makes the argument that the unemployment rate the jobless rate for the african-american community is at a record low he frequently cites that just statistic to make the point that he's improving lives for the african-american community and from minorities do you think he has created real opportunity no no I think he's been a failure III the unemployment rate is low generally that's good it was coming down when he took office that's good so I gave him that um he doesn't get all the credit for cuz it was coming down significantly when he took office but how about how about gaps in income they are significant how about gaps in wealth they are significant and what I I think I'm most concerned about with this president is his penchant to divide us to attack people because they're immigrants to attack people because of their religion to attack minorities to to use to use vulgar language to describe countries where people come who might be Latino or African there is a concerted effort that he has been engaged in to divide people including dividing him based on race and nowhere was that more obvious nowhere then in the aftermath of Charlottesville when somebody drove a car into a crowd in Columbus Ohio between his election and when he was inaugurated and that somebody happened to be somebody from the Middle East he called the terrorism and went to Columbus to comfort families who had been injured when somebody of a Middle Eastern background drove a car into a crowd in Barcelona he called it terrorism but when this happened in Charlottesville ninety miles from the White House in the home of an archetypal American president suddenly he says well you know there's good people on both sides he could not distinguish who was on the right side was on the wrong side in a white supremacist neo-nazi rally and that was infuriating virginians really saw that for what it was because a state that's been scarred like we have with the divisions of racism and hatred and slavery in the past when we have a president who can't call it out it was outrageous the people who came to Charlottesville to demonstrate their hatred they I'm sure had those emotions before there was a president Trump but he's stoking it and I think that's very very damning burden that's on the shoulder of any of us in leadership now is to try to pull this country together not not divide people what I challenge the President on is I don't think he's behaving like a frog I he is behaving in a way that divides people from one another we got to have leaders at all levels who stand up and make plain that we are a for all nation or for all Commonwealth

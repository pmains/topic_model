I me now are two more democratic legislators who are taking a stand Ohio congresswoman Marcia fudge and California congresswoman barbara Lee thank you both for being here on this MLK weekend I have to get each of you to comment I'll start with you a congresswoman Lee because I know that you were one of the earliest members of the CBC to come out saying you're not going to go to the inauguration Donald Trump took all of the bait and an attack John Lewis on the first day of MLK weekend and he is still coming for him he tweeted last night about John Lewis Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner cities of us I could use all the help I can get here earlier disparage John Lewis's district in Georgia which includes bucket I mean if you understand atlanta buckhead is not a slob but he despairs his district what do you make of this decision by the president-elect to attack Civil Rights icon John Lewis on MLK weekend well first I have to justify congressman Lewis is a moral civil and human rights leader when congressman john lewis speaks the world lessons donald trump talked about congressman Lewis actually insulted him by saying he was all talk and no action well congressman Lewis led the effort for voting rights he almost was killed as a result of his work he continues to represent his district in a fantastic brilliant way bringing opportunities to his district and he's a wonderful effective legislator and so for me Donald Trump has insulted one of our great leaders and we all should feel very uh you know upset and angry about this insult to congressman Lewis yeah so it is about hashtag defend the fist that's going around of him his Atlanta district calling him a hero which he is his book is now selling out as people reacquaint themselves with his memoir on with his life congresswoman Marcia fudge you know we know that congressman Lewis is a longtime friend of the Clintons we know they are very good friends and have been for you know decades really inside of the caucus your former arm chair of the Congressional Black Caucus is this being read as congressman Lewis really being angry about what was done to his friend and that's why he is really being just so put that hard line down on Donald Trump or is it something else because he's being attacked at setting the wrong tone as we head into the inauguration weekend well first off let me say thank you julie for having me it is not something that John is doing because he's angry if you listen to this person mr. Trump who has already made a mockery of our democracy to attack a person whose actions have changed the course of this nation then either he doesn't know history or he doesn't care about it because to be so ignorant as to say the words that he is all talk it's just ludicrous secondly if you remember MLK day in a letter from a Birmingham jail mar Luther King wrote that it is not the clanners who are impeding our democracy and our freedom it is the moderate white he's talking about the Donald Trump and the end of John sessions of the world who talk about order but never justice who are piling on things that are important to people so I think that John is just being the advocate he has always been and he is saying what he believes to be true and so do many other Americans believe that we have a president who is infected as proven has been assisted by the Russians and may in fact not be a legitimate president yeah and you know when John Lowe said these maybes comment to our own Chuck Todd the interview was a lot longer than just that clip that people are playing I want to play one more clip and this is Chuck ask congressman Lewis about whether or not he would invite Donald Trump to Selma let's take listen and I'll get you ladies response would you take them to someone well by going to someone like President Bush President Clinton President Obama maybe he wouldn't learn something maybe he would get religion and you would bring him you wouldn't he would he would do that frame if he asked well I would not invite him to them you wouldn't buy him but he asked to come would you let him I wouldn't try to do anything to prevent him from coming currently you know we saw the members of the commercial Black Hawk is another stand up against a certification of Donald Trump to be President it's something that we saw before with President Bush that happened in two thousand were members of the caucus as well as others stood up and said you should not certify this man based on the way the Supreme Court intervened in but but president bush was invited he did come to Selma he did sort of try to forge something of a relationship I mean with rocky I hope it's a CBC do you see for see in any being able to come to even that level of accommodation with Donald Trump and I'll ask me to did all start with you've got car yay you know that's up to Donald Trump and let me just say I have participate in the Selma March and pilgrimage almost every year with young people and it's a very profound experience you know what is important i think is not just going to Selma but what's important is who do you stand for are you going to fight for the most vulnerable are you going to make sure that health care is provided for people who are at risk now losing their health care I think it's more about what do you do what is your agenda and the reason I'm not celebrating at the inauguration is because up until now this effort in the campaign has been divisive and what he continues to do is really stand for the most wealthy in our country and not on the side of all Americans and so it's basically I think what he intends to do as president and I haven't seen yet that he's going to stand up for everyone same question to you congressman fudge you know what a joy the president elected said seems like he's going to solve the problems of the inner city let him do it don't blame it on John Lewis John has done more for the city of Atlanta probably than any single individual when you talk about whether he's going to be a person that I can support how do you support a person who nominates a jeff Sessions how do you support a person who says that the Attorney General of the United States has only weighed in on voting rights when he thought that the shelby decision was good news who has been cited on things like criminal justice reform other than to say I'm opposed to consent decrees how do you support somebody like a jeff sessions where she represents the state with twenty five percent of all of his children go to segregated schools but he's okay with that because the funding formula is fine with him how didn't have for a person who's not an advocate and calls himself the Attorney General of the United States if that's what we can expect I don't think that we're going to be able to get along very well yeah and I have to play this one more sound this is rice previous has been chosen as the next chief of staff this is pretty extraordinary I'm talking about the respect that the Republicans that brain stem cells would like to be shown to Donald Trump and whether or not that same respect has shown the President Obama's he's elected this is right Priebus on ABC earlier today you didn't have Republicans questioning whether or not Obama legitimately beat John McCain in 2008 where a person that is a champion of voter rights the question whether or not Donald Trump legitimately won an election or not is an incredible position to take five days before an inauguration and congresswoman Lee George Stephanopoulos been asked him but wait a minute you guys you guys questioned Barack Obama's legitimacy Republicans questioned his legitimacy and right service that I thought the point your thoughts one of the reasons i challenge the certification of the electoral college was because of foreign influence and Russian involvement in our elections which the intelligence community has provided and so you know the Russian interference tampering with our elections interfering with our democratic process is very serious and it's very dangerous and I'll conclude by saying I think we need a full investigation so the public can know just how legitimate these elections work notwithstanding what the outcome was we need to know how for a foreign power interfered in this election in Congress would fudge just the irony of saying that John Lewis really shouldn't be challenging legitimacy of Donald Trump when Republicans did nothing but challenge Barack Obama's legitimacy and even his birthplace for eight years you know what you are these are the things that make you laugh to keep from crying I mean when is enough enough just even this past a week we have Republicans standing in the well of the house excoriating this president he is leaving but it has not stopped for eight years joy every day we are a floor they have something negative to say they questioned his legitimacy they questioned his birthright they quested his intelligence and so risk-free these that is the most hypocritical thing I've ever seen ever heard it is just ridiculous now he can say something like that with a straight face he should be ashamed and in the words of Donald Trump it's just bad and you know we were out of time I know congresswoman Lee is not going to be going through naug ural Commerce woman fudge are you planning to attend no I will be here in Cleveland alright we you heard it here first I think that's the first we've heard of what it is much will be doing well thank you for breaking that news here on am joy thank you both to representative Marshall

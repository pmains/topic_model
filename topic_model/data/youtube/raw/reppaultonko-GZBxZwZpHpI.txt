absolutely I see it it's the walk taken by many many families that I represent and I have to share with you that it has touched my family also and so it behooves all of us to be there in this Universal form that to speak to what is a growing growing problem you know I was struck by the the dollars dollar figures you shared and you know the bankrupting of of our situation with Alzheimer's and student loans in it we're driving we're driving such heavy burdens on to all of us as a society that it it challenges us to come forward with some order of prevention some order of hope that will be driven into the efforts that we that we currently share to speak more wisely speak more compassionately to these situations and you know I'm reminded that the brain is the least researched organ of the body now that alone should speak to us forcefully think of not only Alzheimer's but the many neurological based situations that affect numbers of people out there from the very young to the more senior the most senior the brain as an Oregon needs to be researched and so we need to make certain that we share that message here in the halls of government let's bring the hope to the doorstep of individuals who are rendered hopeless at times who see their loved ones crumble and become someone they different and we know that we can invest in that research and that we do have the minds that can lead us in those research attempts and efforts you know when we look at the budget for Alzheimer's less than one set of every dollar invested in in treating speaking to and treating Alzheimer's disease is spent on research and we had put together legislation a couple of sessions ago now that required that we have these Alzheimer's town halls and put together a plan as a nation to speak to conquering the effects of Alzheimer's and you know it meant that we have to have certain orders of budgeting done to speak to Alzheimer's and then we further improved upon that with legislation that said it's not going to be put together this budgets not going to be put together with its guidelines by in an ordinary process it was going to bring in the clinicians the professionals who speak to the Alzheimer's issued as a disease and they will put together this professional budgeting that will tell us from now to 2025 what that budget will be what the demands on the system should be so that that's again renders a budget that is speaking to the soundness of numbers for the for the investment made to conquer Alzheimer's I think that's the professional approach to be taken it's the compassionate approach to be taken and now we're working on issues on legislation that will allow for coverage Medicare coverage for planning when you as an individual and better said as a family are impacted by Alzheimer's let's do the planning what to what should we expect how do we walk through this with the greatest amount of dignity and effectiveness and that planning will be covered if this legislation were to be improved approved so there are things we can do here and it really is a challenge I believe in these times to make certain that research dollars are available research dollars available that will again study we're going to the body that is least research representative Garamendi and I know that by pushing our colleagues who share our beliefs on this issue

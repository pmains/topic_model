i i just want to say that um we're doing all we can uh to continue to refine and redouble our efforts in washington to make sure that the help that is out there is relevant is meeting the needs of new hampshire small business community and will allow us to get through this and to get back up and running as soon as humanly possible we are considering another significant relief package that the house will vote on tomorrow it's going to take some time to work through a compromise with the senate but we expect by mid-march there will be more help on the way and there are some important small business provisions that are part of that package too um but as someone who comes from this world um you know clearly we all know that we have a diverse set of interests in terms of our main street businesses there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach and having as many tools on the table as possible is what is going to allow our small business community to continue to find a path forward there has been a tremendous amount of of innovation of resiliency among our small business community that's helped keep people employed and help keep the doors open and we've got to make sure that both in terms of the economic support but also the public health support that it's as strong as possible um in this next package so that we can get through this um the best thing we can do to get our economy going again is to vaccinate as many people as possible and so there's significant support in this package for vaccinations and ultimately that's what's going to allow us to put covet in the rearview mirror

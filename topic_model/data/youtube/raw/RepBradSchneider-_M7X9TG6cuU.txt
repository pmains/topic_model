match uh let me go down to the motion to uh to recommit um i you know they taught me in freshman orientation ten years ago that that was just a procedural motion it had no policy aspect to it whatsoever and so just vote no uh and so i i recognize that that is not the sign of something that is valuable legislation uh that's the sign of of something that you would think could go by the wayside but in our very new era of having almost all closed rules all the time right not a single open rule in paul ryan uh in paul ryan's administration uh not a single open rule now in uh speaker pelosi's operation there is no opportunity sometimes for the minority to have input on the house floor if we had open rules the challenges would be very much the same as the ones you pointed to uh mr liu those those amendments are offered uh dropped right there on the floor can be written on the back of a cocktail napkin no opportunity for the uh for legislative uh uh drafting and perfection folks don't have time to consult with their staff and and under the five-minute rule ten minutes later uh you could be asked to vote uh on a very consequential uh amendment that that had not uh been seen before so so last minute legislative language used to be a hallmark of this institution wasn't used to disrupt the institution it was just a it was just common as a as a function of the legislative uh process i remember once uh on our prescription drug bill last year the majority saw in its wisdom the uh the ability to offer the minority uh an amendment the nature of a substitute and in exchange the minority said and we're not going to press for our motion to recommit we traded away what you and i would both just agree was not a particularly effective legislative tool and in exchange we got a very substantive conversation about how we wanted to reform prescription drugs uh in the in the country i support uh i support that um i'm particularly concerned about mr schneider's concerns because i i i raised the very same issues in the rules committee last night uh mr schneider we were talking about a bill that was uh a resolution that was intended to speak out against horrific uh treatment uh that has been alleged of uh of uh non-citizens in the country after they have been detained uh by federal uh forces and and the uh resolution i believed was designed to divide us on something that we should have been speaking in one voice to condemn that there's no benefit in america of having it appear that someone condones uh inhumane treatment uh by by federal uh authorities against uh non-citizens so is it clear to you that there is a difference the the occasional majority bills that are brought to the floor for a vote that are designed apparently to divide us as opposed to unite us versus the motion to recommit which i would absolutely concede is often designed as something that would makes it appear that we are divided when in fact we may not be so no um thank you i i appreciate the question the distinction i would draw here is it's never good to divide us but that's part of the politics and and part of the process here it's using a group as a pawn as the wedge to create that division to try to create a false impression of antagonism to a group or a an individual that doesn't actually exist that i think becomes so dangerous and my concern specifically with respect the use of american jews and the issue of anti-semitism in our country which as noted with the adl numbers is on the rise in the country as it is around the world we are empowering groups that are trafficking in anti-semitism and we are diminishing groups that are being used as the wedge they i think back on some of those motions to recommit that i'm sure uh you are referring to i would often say we were talking about um uh protecting uh this group uh or that from some groups that rightfully need protection and the motion to recommit said yes those things are important but someone needs to speak out against anti-semitism and they're not someone needs to speak out against anti-israel sentiment and they're not uh someone needs to do these things and so we're going to we're going to do this we can't move legislation to the floor on our own and so we're going to put it in in this uh in this context uh i we in our last panel we heard members on both sides of the aisle talk about the need to protect the motion to recommit i do hope that we can find a way to make it more valuable as a legislative uh tool but i am i i could not agree with you more that the politics of division that we play have dangerous consequences in in many ways again i believe not being able to speak with one voice on behalf of non-citizens in u.s custody uh is dangerous now because it suggests that something is acceptable when it in fact is not uh and that is certainly true as it relates to uh to anti-semitism and so i would be i'd be happy to uh to to work with you in in a in a republican majority as we're sure to see in january uh it i want you to all be just as willing to partner with you as i am uh you know in a democratic majority uh today and i i i appreciate that and in all our interactions we've always had good comedy and i think it's that comedy that allows us to put forward uh policies that advance the interests of the nation uh there will be arguments and there will be divisions of opinion but we should never use individuals or groups of individuals as a pawn in advancing that cause they i'll just share with you i i don't believe our conversations in the modernization committee are privileged any longer we tried not to to out one another while those conversations were going on but but we grappled with the motion to recommit because uh folks did have such strong feelings about it and i uh while it was not while reforming it was in our in our final recommendations i thought one of the more fruitful places was how can we encourage the minority to surrender uh that motion in favor of getting a more substantive legislative uh alternative uh path uh let's not use the let's not eliminate the motion to recommit to silence the minority let's let's change the motion to recommit to empower legislative discussion and just give the minority one opportunity to take it where they'd like to like to take it and so i your your council is well well taken

i want to introduce our guest tonight who is elizabeth talmont elizabeth is a nurse practitioner and has a doctorate in nursing practice planned parenthood is in her dna and she has over 25 years of experience working for planned parenthood at both the national office and at our local new jersey affiliate she is representing the planned parenthood action fund of new jersey and will provide some perspective on the scotus decision so with that i would like to turn it over to you elizabeth thank you all thank you lisa thank you tom and to your team and to thank you to all of the community members that have shown up tonight um i'm a little overwhelmed um i will admit um but my name is elizabeth and i am representing the planned parenthood action fund um and last friday like many of you um you know my professional and my personal world shook um we had been preparing for this we knew it was coming um my analogy was basically we were on a train track we knew the tunnel was coming we just didn't know um exactly when we were going to enter the tunnel and i hope that through this conversation tonight we can try to paint some forward how we're going to get out the other side of the tunnel but i do want to admit to you that i'm still overcome with grief um i am angry and i am super frustrated i have been a nurse practitioner for over 25 years working in this area of reproductive rights most of the time as lisa said with planned parenthood and what i do know to be true and that my patients have taught me is that abortion care is essential health care i'm going to say that again i've learned from my patients that abortion care is essential health care and i believe like the vast majority of americans and like many of you um that everyone's body is their own and that it's theirs alone um but the supreme court has taken away that federal right to abortion by overturning roe and setting back 50 years of precedent when i say that out loud it feels surreal i am over 50 i don't remember a time before row but it does feel surreal that in my lifetime we are taking back 50 years of precedent and as i'm trying to absorb what has happened um since friday i really want to share with you i can't stop talk thinking about a couple that i took care of last wednesday i'd seen them the week before they were there for a medication abortion um everything went as planned um they were they were amazing in many ways and they're like so many people that you probably know they were smart they were savvy um they were working they were in school they were looking forward to their summer break um and they were looking forward to the future when they got up to leave they thanked me and it's on occasion that people thank you for the care that you provide but it had certain poignancy and it was poignant for them because they knew what was going on in the world they didn't know about the decision on friday but they knew what was happening and i assured them it was the honor was mine to take care of them but when i think about them i think of the difference that my colleagues and so many states now there's eight states now that have outright bans for abortion and soon to be followed and we'll get into that in just a little bit but when i think of what i would have to say if i was living in oklahoma or in texas or somewhere else what i would have to then say to a patient that wanted abortion to this couple and my colleagues who are now faced with doing that and saying that and what that means to people about the travel about how challenging that can be if you already have children child care issues job issues how many of us can just take up after on a whim to go to a different state where they're going to be out of pocket for several days putting up with all of that so i'm angered at what my colleagues in restricted states are now going to have to say to those patients and i grieve for those patients that are going to have to suffer the consequences of these bands and you know as a nurse and as a mother as a friend as a colleague and frankly as a fellow human being i just can't get over how cruel these lo this law this decision is how disrespectful it is to people's autonomy and the hurdles that the supreme court and this ban has put in people's way it's truly nothing short of inhumane some case i've confused you all because of my emotion abortion is legal in the state of new jersey i'm proud of the work that our my affiliate and all of the supporters have done to keep it that way our health centers stay open we are here to serve and we will continue to do everything in our power to keep those freedoms so you'll hear in the coming days i'm sure many of you are reading online and reading in the newspaper the headlines it's a very fluid legal landscape right now we know that up to 26 states in the coming weeks days and months have a have that as their goal to outright ban abortion in their states so that means that over half of the country will no longer have the power to control their own bodies and their lives folks that is 36 million people of reproductive age of those people who can get pregnant and i want to be really clear with you all the anti-choice um an anti-abortion movement this is not the end they may be feeling like they're taking a victory lap now but their ultimate goal is an outright van they are not going to stop with just abortion either their goal is to intimidate and to scare doctors patients anybody who helps folks getting the care that they need they want to scare them with prosecution they could even they even want to go so far as to outlaw um form common forms of contraception like iuds and what scares me a lot is that even people seeking care for miscarriages which is more common than we choose to talk about that those folks could be caught up in criminal investigations we know after 50 years that banning abortion doesn't take away the need for abortion care and we also know that these bans have a disproportionate impact on our black latino indigenous and other people of color people who don't have access to the resources and the support they need will need to travel out of state sometimes coming to new jersey as well or they may be forced to carry pregnancies against their will i want to assure you that while the decision on friday felt like a sucker punch to the gut we have been preparing for a long time for this in new jersey the reproductive freedom uh reproductive choice act was signed into law by governor murphy in just january of this year we applaud and celebrate that important step but there's more that folks like us can do we can call our legislature we can ask them to pass abortion access and justice legislation that's pending right now senate bill 2918 an assembly bill 4350 without delay we can support candidates that respect a person's right to choose and hold those accountable who don't i want you to think of the couple that i took care of last week and the professionals like me who care for them our days ahead may be very challenging indeed but i assure you that we're not backing down we hold those patients close to us we will do everything in our power to stand firm but we need folks and supporters like you to help make a difference so call your state legislators i know tom's going to talk about what's going on on the federal level and on the policy side donate host a house party fund other folks do what you can to support access to abortion here in new jersey and the states that are restricted folks will need your help more than ever i really want to thank you for your time and attention i want to thank you tom for inviting me here and to you lisa and the rest of the team so this is a moment for courage and that's the theme that i wanted it is going to be a moment for courage um but standing tall and as i've described to my children i say courage is not that you're not afraid or that you're not scared but that you do it anyway so thank you and i'll turn it back over to you guys elizabeth thank you so much thank you for your perspective and your with the work that you do and helping to educate the rest of us and um it's clear in your voice how hard this is but we we press on right so with my emotion now i will turn this over to tom thank you thanks lisa thanks everybody for for joining us tonight and of course thank you elizabeth for sharing your experiences and and your um your very real and appropriate emotions about what has happened this is you know often when we talk about supreme court decisions we're arguing about abstract legal principles we're having philosophical debates about the meaning of terms and [Music] that's not what this is about this is this is about real life for millions of women and families across this country the supreme court decision has the consequence that laws will snap into place in multiple states across the country laws will be passed in other states now that that will return us to a time when women and doctors were treated as criminals for making decisions about their own health care and then those laws will start to be enforced and that's not going to be abstract at all because we're all going to know people who are affected i think a lot of the people who have particularly politicians who have engaged in this debate on the other side just are are disconnected from the real world what people actually experience you know we all know i think on this call that there will be there will be women across the country in these states who have miscarriages and who are going to worry am i now going to be subjected to arrest criminal investigation there will be women who are given the terrible news that they have an ectopic pregnancy and they have to act quickly to save their own lives that that baby's not going to be born and what happens now practically who makes the decision to allow them to do that how long does it take who takes that responsibility and if they're allowed to save their life will there be anybody in that state who can actually perform that procedure and then there will be more commonplace situations um your daughter your niece comes to you and says mom dad uncle grandma i'm pregnant i'm in trouble i don't know what to do what should i do and different people different families are going to have different answers to that question based on their own circumstances their own moral and religious beliefs but i think what unites most americans and the reason why we are in such a clear majority is that the overwhelming majority of americans agree that the government should not make that decision that the police should not be involved in enforcing that decision that we should trust women and the people who they trust in their lives to help them to make decisions about their own health care about their own lives about the incredibly difficult sensitive and intimate questions of when and how to become pregnant that's what this is about and that's why although you know 80 percent of americans don't have identical views about abortion something like 80 percent of americans believed in roe v wade they believed that this should have been the settled law of the land and frankly most of my constituents when when you know my job is to ask them what they want from the government very very few people in the last four years were telling me what i want from the government is to reopen all these questions that were settled decades ago and to ban abortion you know fix the economy do something about inflation protect our country build infrastructure protect the environment um that's what most americans want their government to do not to reopen these questions so here we are um as as we all know as as elizabeth rightly stressed we have a law in new jersey that that is um that has codified roe v wade for our state um the politics of it which we will be reminded of we have to be over the coming months um [Music] include the very important fact that my opponent in this congressional race tom kane jr voted against that law as one of his final acts in the state senate which sets up a pretty clear contrast in our views um but um as elizabeth also rightly stressed the the people who are responsible for uh the supreme court decision um haven't spent the last 20 30 years trying to ban abortion only in half the country that's not their goal and they said very clearly we don't have to read between the lines that their goal is to pass a nationwide ban and that um if um the party that believes that wins a majority in the united states congress that's what they're going to try to do and a nationwide ban would override our law in the state of new jersey and so it's really clear now what the what has to happen there's one thing that can make this better and that would be for the united states congress to enshrine roe v wade in the law of the land where it should have been from the first place and there's one thing that could make this worse and that would be for a different majority in the congress to pass a nationwide ban um politics is the problem but it's also the solution and we have to do our part um we have to be honest with ourselves like one reason this happened we can blame gorsuch we can blame kavanaugh and comey barrett and trump for appointing them but you know we we also need to accept some responsibility for not having made this a voting issue um in past elections and for the fact that a lot of people stayed home in 2016 who should have voted um and you know elections do have consequences and and a lot of folks uh warned the american people if you know you put that guy in the white house this is what's going to happen and a lot of americans didn't believe it um 2018 and 2020 i think we were much more disciplined about our civic duties and we elected a congress that moved the country forward in a lot of ways so we've got to draw the lesson from that and approach this election with disciplined determination this if we care about this it's got to be a voting issue for us for our friends for our neighbors we have to understand that there is a a relatively straightforward fix that we can bring about through the exercise of our basic constitutional rights as citizens of this country and if we do that we're going to fix this and in fact we'll be better off because we'll be you know we won't be relying on an unstable judicial precedent we'll be relying on an enacted law so that's where i come in that's what i'm going to fight for all the way from now until november and when we win to ensure that the first act of the next congress um with a couple of extra senators to help us reform the filibuster in the senate will be to as i said and trying roe v wade in the law of the land so um eager to hear your thoughts and questions on all of that and thank you again for joining tonight thank you so much tom thank you elizabeth again uh please write your questions in the chat we're going to be scanning the chat looking for the questions while we get someone teed up tom i'm going to take the my moment here to ask a question what's the mood been like on the hill as you're talking to your fellow democratic members and what what is what are what are people talking about winning um and that's got to be our mood you know i mean look it's it's totally fine and appropriate to be depressed and angry but do not allow those emotions to become paralyzing and there's always that danger you know oh my gosh we we worked so hard we voted we donated to candidates we knocked on doors we ran for office and still they did this um is it really worth trying anymore and of course that's what they want you to think and the truth is again this happened um because of the election of 2016. there was almost nothing we could have done in the elections of 2018 and 2020 to prevent this from happening because the die was cast with the supreme court justices that were appointed by the president who won in 2016. um so this this is not even remotely evidence that all of the activism and energy of the last few years was in vain and in fact we've gotten a lot of other good things i personally was very happy last week uh despite this that we enacted uh the first law in 30 years to protect kids from gun violence in this country and that's because what we did in 2018 2020 by winning those elections so we've got to have a winning attitude uh and um my colleagues i think you know those of us who are in the congress were there because we know how to win uh and many of us know how to win in very tough places as terrible as this is there is an opportunity to mobilize americans of different ideological stripes this november to settle this in a much more definitive way than the supreme court did in in early 1970s so great thanks lisa thank you tom and um liz has a question go ahead liz hi tom um so i i obviously i hear the drum beat to vote in the midterms and uh obviously we'll be doing so very enthusiastically um but there's still a little over four months away which is a lot of time for a lot of states to do harm to pregnant people and one of my fears is that states will weaponize lacks data privacy laws against people seeking abortions um i actually just deleted a period tracking app off of my phone which is never something that i have had to contemplate doing um so there have been a couple bills introduced in congress with the goals of protecting consumer data and preventing data brokers from selling to government agencies what is your stance on these bills and their potential to blunt the impact of the jobs ruling i strongly support them they they're not going to eliminate the impact of the dobbs ruling but but they they could be very helpful in addressing that aspect of it that you just raised um and speaker pelosi um intends to move i think at least one of those bills very soon so i hope hope will have an opportunity to to vote on it um i i haven't i don't have good intel yet on on um prospects in the senate for something like that i am my general assumption is that we don't have 60 votes for anything related to abortion in the senate we may have 52 54 55 for some things i i think we probably have well i i know we have at least two republicans in the senate for a straight codification of roe v wade uh and i'm i'm very interested in doing that even if it's not like the more perfect bill that we passed in the house um i i want to go before the american people uh this fall with um something that is as simple and as unifying as possible and something that that enables us to cast those who refuse to go along as completely out of mainstream i don't want to give them any excuses to um to confuse things so you know maybe on the data privacy stuff there's there's more support uh i would love to uh for that to be the case and we can pass something in in this congress um maybe some of the republicans will be scared enough of the political consequences of this decision that they're going to want to be for something i don't know it should be tested um but either way we should have these votes and [Music] have and show the american people clearly who's on what side and um the consequence of the their voting choice this november i want to make sure they know exactly what they're going to get if they vote for us thank you thanks liz thanks tom um debbie has a whole bunch of questions i told her she could pick her favorite one oh i get to talk and everything um hi john so i have an i i don't know what my favorite one is they're all and i can't even remember what i what i asked but there were two that i want to say my second one because i think it is more this one so what i wrote was there are a number of anti-choice democrats who are in decision making positions whether they are currently in congress or in state or local places all over our country and they are running for office more and more and we have experienced that here and this presents a great challenge to us and the desire to keep democrats in the majority in some places because it leaves it leaves us women without someone to vote for and what can we do what can the party do it's not really a question it's more of a frustration because we have i know we have experienced that here and my daughter goes to school she's in louisiana and they have anti i mean it's it's a big deal what can is there anything that can be done or i mean how do we get i i don't really know how to articulate this question so the the reason one reason why we have not codified or we did not in the past codify roe v wade into federal law is that there weren't always the democratic votes to do it it wasn't just most republicans but there were always some democrats who had trouble with that um and so the feeling was look we've got roe v wade we don't need to um create divisions in the feeling among democratic leadership was we don't need to create divisions among democrats um let's just uh let the decision do the work for us um that's much less the case now actually uh in in in the house of representatives we you know we've got a very narrow democratic majority and there we had the votes to pass the women's health protection act which was um a strong codification of roe um too strong for senators collins and murkowski i mean it kind of went beyond strict codification and and we had the votes to do that so um i i don't think there's any question today that if democrats have control in the house and effective control in the senate in other words some ability to move legislation by majority vote that we could pass a codification um that's not a that's not a worry that i have um [Music] and in the meantime [Music] yes bad things are going to happen that's why we're all on this call and we all you know this is another answer to those who say well we're fine in new jersey because we got our our own law here well you know what i'm an american not just a new jerseyan and like you we all know people right we've got daughters and nieces and sisters and friends and loved ones living in states that are living or studying or working in states that are going to have these laws and we care about them so um [Music] you know it's going to be a rough few months it will be an illuminating few months i think for a lot of americans and let's um that's not let's not waste the time do what we can now to protect people and mobilize for the codification that will settle this once and for all thanks hey thank you tom um leslie uh hi um my comment is that i you know obviously everybody here supports tom everybody here supports the freedom to make decisions about one's own health care we're all going to be donating to tom and canvassing and calling and all of that um what what frustrates me you know um is that the democratic party is sorry incompetent about messaging and strategy okay i have no idea what the leadership of the democratic party has planned for how they are going to win in the election coming up okay we know the situation is bad in terms of gerrymandering i mean we know that because of tom's district but also all over the country it is going to be very difficult we all know that i'm not going to say it's impossible my problem is that the democrats i do not know what their strategy is for winning and i don't understand they have not said what they are going to do and um they have not made it clear they don't um they don't articulate to the american people well i'm not talking about tom i'm talking about all over the country the leadership in the democratic party it seems like they have no clue i've heard nothing from jamie harrison i've heard nothing from nancy pelosi nothing from sean patrick maloney and um the other guy i can't remember his name who all the leadership there have heard nothing so this is what my frustration is and i would like to know from tom if he knows what the plan is because i don't know what the plan is um so number one i don't want you to hear from jamie harrison he's just a guy who runs the democratic national committee he's not like a political leader who should be finding a message um i don't want you to hear from sean patrick maloney he's just the head of the d triple c supposed to be out there raising money for democrats and recruiting candidates to run and doing mechanics um nancy pelosi put out a very clear statement yesterday regarding what our immediate steps in the house will be i think president biden has been pretty clear on this our strategy for winning is not rocket science there's no secret sauce to this we recruit good people to run who know the districts that they're running in uh who understand how to talk to their communities and we focus on a few simple issues that are totally unifying in this country and this is this is one of them and we create a very clear distinction between us and the other side um the one thing i think we need to say with absolute clarity and a lot of us are saying this but um i i wanted i do want to see this communicated in a more systematic way is that if you elect two more democratic senators we will um reform or eliminate the filibuster in order to get this done early next year and that i think is a simple matter of getting a pledge from the democrats who are running for senate in those key states that are flippable from pennsylvania to wisconsin um a few others uh and i i think that you know the folks running should be willing and able to make that commitment and then let's just go to the american people and and make it simple plain and clear here's what we intend to do which is to enshrine roe v wade in the law of the land in order to do that we need um two more senators who will reform the filibuster all of our candidates have pledged to do that therefore we will do it and don't forget to hold the house because if you get the senate and you lose the house then we're we're no better off than than we were just keep it simple and we as democrats also need to be very disciplined about that and our problem is not just our leadership our problem is is us that that you know we we are all the we all want to be the leaders of our party and um there are a lot of folks you know just crying out for some immediate solution to this problem why don't you democrats use your power now to make this you know uh make this all go away uh fight back punch hard um and you know impeach the supreme court and all that stuff and that that's not constructive um you know we you know to impeach supreme court justices for example i need 67 votes in the senate even if i wanted to do that um what i just described to you i would only need 50 votes in the senate um and what i just described is totally unifying 75 80 percent of the american people support it um and some of these other things that are coming from activists would be very divisive so um i actually think we do have a clear simple plan um we do need to articulate it a little bit better and and then i want to make sure all of us line up behind that and we do the work that's necessary to get this done just as republicans have done in a very disciplined way over many many years thanks great thank you leslie um tom i think our next question is going to be from betty hutchinson betty uh yes the republican mantra right now is that in order to make this hideous decision um popular they are going to make sure that they provide all kinds of prenatal care and then care for uh the babies after they're born and they've used this argument over and over but when it comes to voting to support child care and family leave and tax credits their absence so i want to know if the democrats are going to call their bluff and introduce legislation that um you know will seek to fund these items that they say they support yeah it's that's a great point and uh you're right to call out the hypocrisy they um [Music] at the national level have consistently voted against the things that would help um mothers uh take care of their kids and to deal with um the the the the terrible pressure that that that they face particularly low-income moms whether it's child care transportation or simply putting nutritious food on the table and at the state level i mean the states that are uh the fastest to ban abortion provide the least to uh to to families of young children um one of the best things that we've we've done in america in the last few years was the child tax credit that was enacted as part of the american rescue plan and which cut child poverty in america by about half in a year and that was originally a republican idea by the way that you know the idea was don't don't um burden people with complicated social programs where they've got a deal with a bureaucracy that is overseeing the decisions they make to take care of their families just you know moms and dads know what to do uh to take care of their kids they they know what they need just just give them a little financial boost um to be able to um to to take care of their kids and and and it worked beautifully but the republicans refused to renew it and even a couple of democrats were to be fair were skeptical about about renewing it so yeah i totally agree we should be consistently calling their bluff on those things um child care um the the child tax credit um nutrition programs everything we can do to make it easier for um for families to to bring children into this world and to take care of them um is a good thing inherently and also a good answer to this horrific decision great thanks tom betty thanks for your question next up i have susan blackburn and susan has a question that um for tom and i think elizabeth can help answer as well hi i wrote a few things and some of them don't make any sense but i did want to say that um my concern is the localization of our health care system if people have i think that's something to run on i mean the decrepit status of our health care system is exacerbating our ability to help women out of state because if they have uh medicaid or aca those things don't travel we all know that our health care system is in a shambles we can't expect in a way i remember before versus wade even because i was such a child prodigy but um i do remember that um people went to doctors who you know maybe you would know someone who was a doctor and they do it you know off the books that can't happen anymore um if i have aca in new jersey i can't go to another state and get any health care unless i just put myself through so much so many rings of insurance claims uh i think we have to think about the law and federalizing health care in a better way because that's a fundamental issue for everybody and um i don't want to take away from the rage the absolute rage i feel about this issue and that 52 of our population is affected by this including myself in many ways but um the state of our healthcare system is just getting worse and worse and there's no way to do anything or have a medical procedure that isn't going to be discovered doctors don't code their own bills and you know it's just everything's going to we can't do things in cash under the table anymore yeah so um i have to really be this is a state issue it's not for you if governor murphy was asking for my advice but my advice to you is um we've really just got to concentrate on the health care issue yeah well we've made a lot of improvements in the last few years thanks to all of you and the folks that you helped elect um but i think what you're bringing out is that the this will have a very disproportionate income i'm sorry disproportionate impact on low-income women um i i i am um i i think it's worth uh remembering that or noting that a lot of the powerful politicians who pass these laws across the country deep down understand assume that if someone in their family ever faced this situation uh they'll still be fine i think consciously or subconsciously they make that assumption like we'll figure out a way because we're in a privileged position politically and economically and yet they have no problem putting poor women women of color in impossible situations and that that's something that makes me very angry um now as to whether our health care system um in new jersey including our network of reproductive health care providers can absorb folks from other states who may be coming here seeking abortion services i wanted to ask elizabeth maybe to tackle that and in particular the the question of insurance coverage and whether that's going to be a factor and malpractice insurance yes thank you yes so a couple of different things and thank you susan for your question and i feel your pain um i have the pleasure of working for an agency where we will take care of people no matter what so whether you have come with fifty dollars a hundred dollars whatever you've got we will be able to help you um or nothing um so that's a super privilege and it's because we are able to um make that work for patients um so as far as let me i'll just talk to the the practicalities of absorbing other states so as states go dark um or as they you know there is a ripple effect here and i can assure you that the teams that we are building as we speak um are standing at the ready to be able to help support patients who need our care what that will look like in a year from now i don't really know planned parenthood's across the country where there's neighboring states where a banned state and a restricted state and an access state a line are doing everything they can to get patients the care that they need but as more and more states go it will become increasingly harder and there will be pressure on us so when they say you know take care of yourself it's like yes we got to take care of yourselves because we need ourselves for the long haul we are here we are standing and we are prepared to take it on um but what it will look like in here i don't know that anybody can predict as far as insurance coverage it's true if you have a state excuse me if you have insurance coverage in a different state that doesn't allow it to cross we can't build them but excuse me i'm sorry but we will help you no matter what so that's most important susan did i get all of your questions i'm sorry yes i just i guess i want to just finish my what i have to say on a hopeful note because i've gotten i have uh i have nieces i have uh grand nieces and i'm everyone's reaching out to me because they know i'm politically involved and i'm trying to give them groups that send them links to things that for for younger people so if you have any um you know because i'm a very vibrant young senior citizen but still do the math uh so people that are like 35 or 30 or 25 that really want to know all of a sudden they woke up you know um what did they what would you uh i think they're so of course um like i said our agency is able to support patients um we do have funding we do fundraise for those particular activities there are also abortion state abortion funds as well so if you're living in a state like my niece in oklahoma um yes she's privileged i could get her here to new jersey if she needs any care but um you know there are people who are impacted that will not be able to or not without an enormous amount of support and so those funds are available for them to do that um i would say to everybody here on this call whatever you do don't give up and there are ways to solve these problems it's it's despicable we're upset about it we don't like any of this the fact that i can treat a patient in new jersey with ease and other people in other states can't um is not okay um it's not normal that this is the way our health care system is um so i'll leave it at that but um and then we can take another question if that's okay but thank you susan and uh thank you so much thank you susan thanks elizabeth thanks tom um rob has a question go ahead rob you feel that mute yourselves okay yeah thanks lisa um i've always believed that congressional races especially are local races senate races are can be nationalized but local races have to be locally rooted what's our campaign strategy and message strategy to take down tom kane jr specifically uh how long do you have all night look the guy um it's i mean we've been talking about the issue of abortion obviously in roe v wade and that's it's a particularly easy issue to measure message on because most people in this district i can assure you uh supported roe v wade and did not think it should be torn to shreds and believe that it should be codified and tom kane jr is on the wrong side of all those questions and [Music] he's going to want to try to obfuscate that but he can't hide from his vote in january of this year to oppose codifying roe v wade oppose protecting the people of new jersey against this decision um on top of that you know a plus rating from the nra um his campaign earlier this year for congress in the republican primary in which he fully embraced the trump agenda explicitly he put out mailers to voters saying i tom kane support the trump agenda um and uh so on issue after issue he's just out of step and on top of that like i mean have you ever seen the guy probably not unless you know him personally because he doesn't ever talk to the public you know never does town halls and the reason for that is he can't he would be incapable of it um and and i think that's something that's been increasingly brought out by the media covering this race and we're going to use that too i could go on and on but um on a personal level on a policy level he is very very easy to distinguish from what most voters in the district including many republicans want thanks rob thanks um let's see patricia let me find you there you are do you want to ask your question sure um thanks so with some of the the bad news of course like the road decision and probably more decisions to come this week um i'm very interested in taking our anger about these uh poorly founded um uh and very results oriented really dishonest decisions and then turning that into action um you know we can certainly talk all day about democratic messaging i i personally think it's been very crisp and strong given the extraordinary situation and the dumpster fire that the democrats were were handed by the previous administration but we can talk all day about democratic messaging but we it only matters uh in terms of the direction of what the democrats should do if we if we can keep congress if we can defend um if we can defend congress so rather than doom scrolling rather than just feeling angry or hopeless what are the things where we can take that that energy and make it positive in the most effective way and i know for example you know if i were to go to the gym or do something like that i'd better put it in as a weekly calendar item if i really want it to happen right like that's how it's going to happen um are there ways for us to sign up and say okay you know whatever i see in the headlines whatever crazy thing it is um and i know some republicans are now floating re-criminalizing same sex romantic activity and having those laws bring back into effect right so there is no bottom to what they'll do so what do we do with that feelings of upset or dread and turn it into action are there ways to sign up for like weekly canvassing weekly door-knocking weekly text banking um you know what what can we actually do us on this call and what can we drag our neighbors and our friends to do well funny you ask uh yes absolutely so there you know support planned parenthood because that's the organization that's going to be helping people in the next few months and support your friendly local member of congress who is going to enact roe v wade if we um slightly expand our majority and it's important to give people the hope uh that comes from knowing that we don't need to i mean i'd love to greatly expand our majority right but we don't need to we just need to get two more senators and keep the house as it is um so it's really achievable and i think it's important for people to know that this is not like some impossible task that we're we're setting them towards um and then yeah for my campaign there we need we need people and money very simple and as far as people and volunteers we are building back up to what we had in 2018 uh we have canvases already every weekend we're starting weekday canvasses i think this coming week is that right um lisa i'm gonna actually have devin oh stephanon good evan is on and he can actually talk about our field operation so devon why don't you give us an update um yeah great absolutely thanks tom uh and lisa um first of all and what we're doing yeah absolutely um so i've put a few links in the chat i'm gonna keep putting them in there so you have them available um so quickest way to get involved if you go to our mobilize page you can sign up for an event directly we do have canvases happening all over the district in every county over the next few weeks um just this saturday we're going to be in raritan township we've got upcoming events in berkeley heights in morris county uh in warren county um all over the district we also have a big fanwood westfield scotch plains canvas on july 9th but if you sign up at our general volunteer interest form then some of them the campaign will reach out to you uh this week uh or you can sign up for the events directly on our mobilize page uh and i've included our contact details for myself and shea the organizing director who is um uh in dc right now uh but you can reach out to us if you need some more information uh i see leslie's asking about rahway we are definitely gonna be uh contacting voters in broadway a lot very soon um so stay tuned for that um but if you sign up on that general volunteer interest form page then we'll add you to our email list and every week you will get a full uh team tom weekly update bulletin that has all of the upcoming events in your area for you to sign up for or share with your friends um and yeah we hope to see you at some upcoming events this is you know canvassing talking to people face to face is the number one way to increase their turnout to get people fired up about getting involved um you know we've had a lot of success this weekend people saying uh yes absolutely a thousand percent i'm supporting democrats up and down the ballot and i'd love to volunteer what can i do before we even get to the ask people are ready to get started so we want to bring them into the fold um and and make sure that we have a massive operation and give people an outlet to you know do something positive and make sure that we hold this seat because we can't afford to send another republican to congress who is going to vote against this um who has shown us who he is and voted against codifying row in new jersey and we'll undoubtedly do that on a national level so uh let's all send tom madoski back to congress uh come sign up for one of our events i'll put the links in the chat a couple more times before the end of this call and thank you so much that's not nearly enough actually um because if you're on this call if you're willing to spend this time with us this early um i want you to be recruiters as well and bring you know bring folks to canvas with you and you know not everyone's gonna put it on their weekly calendar but think about the people in your life who might be willing to give us two weekends between now and november or one or three or whatever they don't have to live in our district this is the only race in new jersey in my view that is really contested this year so if they live anywhere in new jersey and they care about this they should be helping you here they don't even have to live in new jersey right we had tons of people coming in from new york in 2018 because you know they don't have real congressional races in the general election they should be coming and spending their weekends hanging out with you guys visiting a winery um you know going on a hike whatever you like to do on a sunday and then canvassing on saturday or vice versa start thinking about that aspect and then devin mentioned this when we're going out canvassing right now at this early stage we're recruiting volunteers i went in berkeley heights um a couple days ago and and you know of the 20 doors i knocked on i think i i recruited two volunteers who will come out with us the next time so um that's that's what we need you guys to do if you're willing uh and of course if you're able the campaign is expensive as well so uh we'll be counting on you to help there thank you well that's the perfect segue to brooke oh my gosh yeah it's a whole team affair um yeah thank you tom um thank you elizabeth and devin and lisa for all you said in putting this together um i think in addition to all the really helpful links in planned parenthood abortion funds um and other donation links that folks shared in the chat um as tom said campaigns are expensive and in order to run a campaign that is practically able to help us execute our plans to win this election and make sure tom kane jr doesn't get elected to this seat uh we need to make sure we're raising as much as possible as early as possible so we're able to make strategic decisions um on the campaign on how we're going to connect with each and every voter not just by knocking on the door one time or seeing one tv ad but a really layered cohesive approach and it will cost a lot of money but i know as a team we'll be able to do it we have a lot of different fundraisers that are coming up around district and also one virtually with congressman jamie raskin in july so be in touch with me be in touch with helena on our team about the ways you can get involved in helping us recruit folks to come to those fundraising events about hosting your own and making sure that we're able to expand the team tom family of investors as much as possible between now and november uh because as a practical step it's a really important part of our plan to win in this seat and to to do it um with all that we got thanks thanks brooke so tom there are about 400 more questions but i think in the point of the time and what and i promise folks this will not be the last time we bring you all together for a conversation like this but um if you've got a few words to sort of leave everyone with i think that would be really helpful of course uh look i'll just leave you with a thought this was a defeat but we are we are not defeated and uh our goal our very realistic goal is to turn the setback into the energy that we need to win a really big victory this november and settle this question as i said once once and for all if we're able to codify roe v wade into the law of the land we will be better off than we were under roe v wade um and so let's set our sights really high rather than holding our heads down let's do the work that we know how to do we've won the last two elections in really tough places including this one let's just do it again the only thing standing in our way i think is our own feeling of resignation and depression there's no external obstacle here it's just uh inside ourselves so um i've picked myself up i'm fighting hard to win in this in this tough district we have an incredibly good plan and a great team you're part of it let's go out there knock on some doors pick up some votes and continue to change this country for the better thank you thanks so much tom and elizabeth thank you so much for being here and adding your voice in your perspective and again for all the work that you do on the ground and i want to thank you all for being here and for your patience um i wish we could have gotten to every single question but we'll just have to do this all again as we as everyone said there's lots of ways to help um obviously my priority is making sure that we return tom to congress so that he can be part of the solution so please um sign up to volunteers become part of our community of investors and spread the word and just we'll see you all again soon take care of yourselves and take care of each other be well bye-bye you

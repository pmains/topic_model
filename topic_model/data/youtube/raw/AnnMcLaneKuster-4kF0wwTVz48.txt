I honestly I am honored and the idea that I stand as your next introducting with michelle obama makes me incredibly proud something it's great to see so many friends and my family Duggan sins and mclain in the back row I feel as though I'm coming home to the plymouth area democrats and some of people remember why this sitting literally right here was where I failed my first campaign started because it was the first debate of the primary in 2010 and I walked in nervous I wasn't sure what was going to happen I wasn't sure who I was going to see and now I look around the room and see all these incredible friends and all these people that I've met and it worked so hard for the values that we all share and I was very proud to be on the ballot with so many of you in this room incredible people and I'm really thrilled that so many of you were running again and taking this on again because our country needs our help but our state needs our help too and so you've got a great ticket I'm grateful to poker introducing them all so I won't have to acknowledge every single member the room but just know that we in Concord are really really appreciative that Rafi county is just going to rock digs for you but this is quite a bit of responsibility it's actually the whole country that is going to be looking to New Hampshire looking to the New Hampshire second district and looking to grafton county to make a difference in the makeup of the United States Congress going forward and in who sits in the White House and that's really honestly not too strong of a statement because with the students that you have here with the students in handle them with the people working at the grassroots with all of the folks that you can turn out I just have to tell you an amazing experience a little bit earlier this evening we drove over from Hanover and to come over Horford and now Q and see a sea of blue and white Democrats I'm was history and the baking I just want you to know so we're going to get this done and our country country log on let me tell you you know the story about 2010 I had two thousand three thousand five hundred and fifty one votes that were we were shy of winning and i want to tell you i'm grateful for every vote that we did get but at this point i'm actually going to take a little break whoa this person steps out and I'm sorry and I can explain to all of you I'm going to take a leadership role in this election of civility some of you are going to hear a story that's in the news about me being accosted by a person from the Nats campaign and this young man that just came in with the camera was here to photograph this and I'm grateful that you have your own photographer and this fight is with New Hampshire Public Radio so I just want everybody to be aware that this is the environment that we're in and then I'm going to take the high road and I appreciate all of you having having my back thank you it is about civility and it's about civil discourse but has now said in her introduction what it's really about this responsibility and taking responsibility for our government for our lives this is what New Hampshire is about you know Granite State values mean something in our state they me an opportunity but they need fairies it means not that the government provides all the solutions or that the private sector provides all the solutions but that we work together we literally roll up our sleeves and get things done I love coming in here to the Senior Center and feel just pointed out to me that it this incredible building actually it was made to look like the inside of a train but think of the history in these creaky floors think of the people that came through here on their way to the north country to see the beautiful mountains and to stay in our incredible hotels and the farmers that were bringing their their their their wares to market this is where people came together and I cannot think of a better symbol for what it means when we come together and take care of each other and when a community like Plymouth like all the little towns that you represent come together and take care of each other I'm not talking about bigger government I want lean fishing effective government and I said repeatedly that we should not spend any tax dollar unless it spent wisely it shouldn't be spent at all but we do need to take care of one another congressman bass is taking votes in Washington that do not represent the values that we share about opportunity about responsibility and particularly about fairness and I'm going to walk you through just briefly because you've heard a lot about our already but the Ryan budget that he has now voted for twice once before he voted for the simpson-bowles and once after he voted for the simpson-bowles in fact if you listened to our debate the other day I said congressman you voted for within 24 hours and he said I voted for the a half hour after as though he had no shame about having a bathroom if he believed in simpson bowls and he believed him that approach stick with it but he doesn't because he sold out to the Tea Party and this is where we've ended up so you've heard the part about Medicare dismantling medic we knew it and the voucher system in the voucher care and this won't work on radio but i'll use my little my little char here this is the voucher this is health care inflation and the delta in between is the part that you're going to pick up six thousand four hundred dollars but here's the problem with that approach there is no six thousand four hundred dollars look around at us look around at our lives the average Medicare income is twenty three thousand dollars per year so the six thousand dollars doesn't exist and here's the bottom line unless we're going to be a society where we're literally stepping over each other in the streets and we're not because we're compassionate so what will happen people will show up at the hospital they fall they break a hip they'll go to the hospital you have a wonderful hospital here with the compassionate policy about taking care of people when we arrive at the emergency room so they'll be treating and then what happens you have cost shipping because the hospital has to pay the rent would turn on the lights and pay the wages and who pays we all pay and this is what David Axelrod because called the death spiral of the health care system because what happens next is that all the small businesses around see double-digit inflation again in their health care premiums for providing health insurance for their employees and so they can't afford so first they say I'm sorry we can't afford to have you and your whole family and then they say I'm sorry we can't afford to have any of you or your copay is going to be twenty-five hundred dollars your your before you reach any any relief at all and so what happens more people are running sure more people show up at the emergency room without coverage so just think about that next time you hear about the voucher next time you hear the Republicans talking about the future of Medicare because they will not only dismantle Medicare but our entire health care delivery system will have a big sucking sound that's the worst part but it gets even worse from there and here's why what I believe in terms of getting our economy going again is that we need to invest an opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow education I couldn't be in a better place to talk about education because we all believe in it here in the Plymouth region but we need to invest in people's lives so that they can do the jobs of the 21st century any job go into the auto mechanic you've gotta know computers to be able to work on the cars today I had a wonderful tour at a company called hypertherm over in Hanover credible company 1,300 employees shipping big crates of new products to Shanghai sixty percent of their products are sold in other parts of the world with made in America stamped on it that's the future for us and yet they have to weeks of special training in order to get people prepared to do these manufacturing jobs now that's a wonderful public-private partnership because they're working with the community Technical College over there to get that done but what I'm saying is we've got to be delivering young people and people who are getting reeducation people who are getting reemployed into the marketplace with skills to work together to understand computers and to be able to be a part of that 21st century economy so education innovation research and development and infrastructure the roads the bridges the highways and the telecommunications that we need here's what's cut in the Ryan budget education innovation infrastructure honestly and then they're going to be surprised that we can't pull out of a recession our economy is going to go right right downhill from there we cut 10 million students with Pell grants that's an entire slice of the middle class who will be able to attend college and to me this one breaks my heart 200,000 children from head start and 400,000 children from early childhood education if you know anything about child development you know that these little kids need help to learn their numbers learn their letters lineup put their backpacks on so they can go to first grade and learn the math and learn the reading that will put them on a path to the skills that they need the fastest growing part of state government prisons right so let's help these kids to get a decent starter one and then the cuts go on from there research and development innovation twenty percent cut in renewable energy renewable energy is the future for our economy make us less dependent upon foreign oil and save the planet but that's what they want to come and the list goes on and on family planning eliminates family planning Planned Parenthood clinics will close all across the country this is what this budget does now it would be one thing if that was the sacrifice that was required because of these terrible deficits if we were all coming together as a people to address the deficits which we need to do and to balance our budget that would be one thing but this is the worst part the most insidious part of this entire production with this budget and the whole running Brian vast planet it doesn't balance the budget and it doesn't end the deficits why remember fairness they don't believe in it so here's what they do they add an additional tax break of two hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars for millionaires and it goes up up from their for billionaires me think about that I said in the debate that two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a nice lifestyle in New Hampshire and I want to keep the tax breaks for all of us in the middle class up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars everyone will get that tax break even the millionaires up to 250 beyond that I think people can pay their fair share I don't think it's too much to ask and frankly we hear in the news a lot of folks making a lot of money pay their fair share I'm all for entrepreneurs I believe in people who start their own businesses but I also believe that these are very tough times and that we've got to come together and deal with these deficits so don't let any Republicans tell you that they are trying to cut the deficit they're not they have zune credibility on this you know many people this involves in New Hampshire this tax break for millionaires and this is a million dollars in income per year not assets okay one tenth of one percent of our population 349 people so I want to go to Washington to represent ninety-nine point nine percent of the people and I'm more than happy to represent the one tenth of one percent that are willing to pay their fair share we can't afford the tax breaks for millionaires we've got to deal with the deficits now there are other ways to bring down the deficits as well we've got to end the wars bring the troops home start the nation hilding here at home the roads the bridges the highways the school's the hospitals America needs help we've got to get our economy back on on the trap we also can't afford the tax breaks for oil and gas companies for nuclear for coal we've got to level the playing field so that renewable energy has got the chance for it so that investors will it's not that we don't have great ideas it's not that we don't have great technologies it's that it's not fair you know congressman bassets on this energy and commerce committee and this is the heart of what's wrong with Washington his contributions for his campaign come from these fossil fuel energy companies and don't take my word for its public record at the fec natural gas coal nuclear oil all the way down he takes a vote he gets a check or it takes the check and he takes a boat and this is how it works down here but here's the beauty of it I'm going to be representing all of you because we did this very very differently and it's taken a long time and it's taken a lot of hard work and a lot of contributions from folks in this room and all across this state but here's the difference we have funded our campaign by individuals real people breathing people not the corporate coming okay and here's what it means we have 25,000 owners and the average contribution $53 so it comes in seven dollars three dollars $14 we have a guy in a bit challenged but he's very very helpful in our picking our campaign he comes in almost every day and every couple of weeks he says I'd like to make a contribution and I say that's incredible thank you so much and he pulls out a twenty-dollar bill aneesa's do you have changed and we haven't figured out why but he likes to give us eleven dollars and fifty cents it just breaks my heart every time it's so meaningful he has benefited from the services he showed I'm going to get all choked up now if you showed me a book the other day of his life when he lived at Laconia state school start out in an orphanage but he's a little boy he's probably my age it's hard to tell what he is but I'm guessing that he and I have lived in New Hampshire of all these years together and he knows what it means to have services for the disabled in her community and so that's who I'm is it's for all of you it's for families all across the state and I am going to fight for civility I'm going to fight for civil discourse I am going to fight for opportunity and equality and liberty and I'm going to fight for all of you and with your help we're going to win this seat and we are going to send a message loud and clear the people are taking back the country

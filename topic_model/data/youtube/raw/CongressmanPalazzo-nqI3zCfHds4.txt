all right for reaction now we'll bring in mississippi congressman stephen palazzo congressman palazzo thank you so much for coming on national report we do appreciate that so here we have this absolutely here we have these new numbers as you just seen economists predicted at 8.1 it was actually 8.3 percent for the month of april bottom line still a 40-year high and that's where we are today and as you know president biden spoke yesterday trying to get ahead of these numbers knowing it's going to be high i want to show you this exchange really quickly and then get your response here's that mr president a year ago the administration was saying that inflation was transitory that's obviously not the case now how long do you think it will be until we see prices coming down i'm not going to predict that it ranges depending on what economists you're talking to by the end of this year and some say it's going to be it's going to increase next year but there's others say by the end of this year you're going to see it come down by the calendar year i don't know but i know what we have to do to make sure that we can bring it down congressman your thoughts the president of the united states does not know but he knows it needs to come down yeah so something we say in the south is bless your heart and so um bless your heart president biden i don't think he has a clue on what's happened domestically or foreign or in our military terms in ukraine um but he's heavily engaged in the blame game uh and you know but if he wants to blame republicans for you know us having the hottest economy in our nation's history record job creation record unemployment uh a secure border a strong military uh he always has a tendency to to blame us and it's like hey we i will take that blame on my shoulders right now but if the president uh truly wants to attack inflation he needs to unleash american energy resources drill here drill now before this president took office gasoline was 1.70 a gallon in mississippi and now it's over four dollars but not just unleash american energy and energy independence but keep taxes low keep regulations at a minimum stop paying people to to stay at home and small businesses are competing with our own government for resources but we're paying them to stay at home and sit on their couches and uh you know finally i'd say a rep elect a republican congress in november and we can truly uh tackle this inflation crisis what did the president mean in your opinion by um late what he did to shot yesterday was blame that is something that we've seen blame uh on inflation on covid and putin but also sir your party republicans even named ultra maga what does he mean by that and how did that sit with you it does it doesn't sit well with me but i don't think it sits well with the majority of the american people even democrats know that this president is way outside his scope of serving as president he's been a failure on the foreign policy front for 42 years and why would we expect him to do any better on domestic policy and he's saying a tackle and inflation is his number one priority well his number one priority should be the security and safety in this nation it should begin with securing our southern border which is a war zone um and it's it's basically a man-made disaster and he's complicit in uh the cartel controlling our southern border and not the us government you mentioned protecting the southern border obviously tackling inflation yet at the same time uh the house as you know and you're a part of as well passed the 40 billion dollar aid package it's awaiting president biden's signature this morning again an aid package for ukraine um and that was overwhelmingly passed uh last night 40 billion dollars a lot of money and there is no when you talk to any military official they're not sure there's an end in sight or when this war would end an everyday american is concerned that congress that the government continues to spend when we see inflation out of control granted the want or need to help ukraine is there sure um but one how do you explain to the american people of so much uh spending of money and when would that end where's the timeline on it also do you know how that money's being sent is a check being written to ukraine and then you move on how has you a congressman how do you account for the money being spent by ukraine once it is sent over you know that that's a great question and i have to say there seems to be a pattern where russia likes to invade ukraine when we have democrats uh in the white house it first started with obama with the invasion and annexation of crimea uh and then in 2022 after our disaster withdrawal which was this president's doing uh i believe triggered uh not only china but russia and other rogue nations to see a fundamental weakness uh in this commander-in-chief and you know the fact that we passed a bill last night which now it's going to provide 24 billion in military assistance it's going to replenish our stockpile which is precariously low and it's also going to provide humanitarian aid um and so but what really um ruffles my feathers is if we would have just provided the lethal uh aid and american leadership i think that would have deterred russia from the get-go and we would not even be having this conversation today and again let's just we have a weak commander-in-chief he's wrong on foreign policy he did not lead from the front and we did not provide aid when they requested it i was in ukraine last may this is not a surprise build up but you know and last may when i was in ukraine we abandoned afghanistan and so our generals this administration they were well aware that the russians have been building up not just in belarus but also along the russian ukrainian border but yet this administration did nothing and i think you've got to lead by example on the world stage and if we would have provided the lethal aid and the leadership that ukraine needed again i don't think we would have voted on a 40 billion dollar package last night and when you when you yeah i mentioned the term lethal weight you're possibly mentioning the the polish migs is that correct of getting those over anything and everything that would have been used to protect ukraine and you know and i i feel like as long as the ukrainians are fighting uh for their nation for their sovereignty and for their freedoms america needs to have a role um it just the thing is is russia is a bad country and we need to continue providing the equipment uh that the ukrainians need to protect their families and their sovereignty uh so i think it's a good investment hopefully this will end very soon no one has a prediction and maybe we won't end up spending all 40 billion dollars congressman stephen palazzo of mississippi good to see you congressman thank you for your time sir same here thank you

good morning everybody I'm Samantha venogram and I am joined by Senator Chris Murphy from the great state of Connecticut he is now serving in his second term and is a ranking member of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee where he is the top Democrat on subcommittee the subcommittee focusing on the Middle East in counterterrorism senator Murphy you and I have talked about every issue Under the Sun when it comes to Middle East from Yemen to Saudi Arabia and obviously Iran I always like to lead with intelligence and I assume that most of the work that you're doing is driven by intelligence that you're receiving from the administration to a large degree what rules intelligence playing for the Senate right now and for the SFRC in particular well Sam great to be here with you thank you to the Aspen Institute for inviting me this is my first time here at this incredibly important forum thank you to Nick for the invitation secretary Albright and to many others in the audience it's wonderful to be here with you I think it is important to start a conversation about what's happening today in the Middle East centered around a conversation on Intelligence I'll maybe make one broad point Sam and and then drill down into some of the more event specific details first as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee we have limited access to intelligence and let's just make that clear we are the committee that is primarily responsible for setting American foreign policy we are the committee that would debate any war authorization with Iran or any other country around the world and yet there is more and more military activity happening around the world today that is done in a clandestine manner the information and the outcome and the analysis is not shared of the Foreign Relations Committee I remember when we were being asked during the Obama administration to authorize a overt Defense Department run training program for Syrian rebels well we have been running a clandestine program for a long time I know that because of open source reporting but we couldn't get the information on how well or how badly that had gone because it was outside of our purview and so as you have this massive shift of kinetic activity to the intelligence agencies you hamstrung the ability of Congress to weigh in when actually is a public policy decision that we need to make a decision on on what's happening today I'm concerned about how the administration has handled intelligence in two ways one they have made the deliberate decision to parcel out intelligence at crisis moments to their friends first and that has happened in particular with the escalatory cycle on Iran when moments happen and there is a claim that they have Intel they're acting on they will make calls to Republican friends in the Senate and often the briefing for the rest of us is delayed by days if not weeks second there have been some moments where the intelligence I think has been misconstrued right now one of the things I worry greatly about and maybe we'll talk about it a little bit later Sam is the withdrawal of our diplomats from Baghdad I think this is a massive own-goal the fact that we are reportedly down to maybe only 15 staffers in that embassy is a gift to Isis and Iran and it is because of some claim which has I think some merit to it as real merit to it that there are threats against US personnel there from Shia Iran affiliated militias but I will say to you I have seen no intelligence to suggest that that threat is any greater than what it was during a period of time during the 2000s when we were able to defend a very large diplomatic presence there and so I think there is a withholding of intelligence and then at times a overhyping of intelligence that could lead to some very bad decisions being made well we've seen the polymerization of intelligence in the past and I don't know if that's what you're describing but you mentioned Iran so let's start there it's in the headlines today we have a drone for drone tanker for tanker eye-for-an-eye escalatory cycle going on right now Iran has restarted some of their banned activities softball question for you senator what would you do on the wrong let's fix it right here we'll take it we'll take care of it so I think Nick put it very well what would is what is so concerning is that in a two-year period of time we went from an alignment in which the United States Europe Russia China and India were on one side of the ledger and Iran was on the other today it is the United States on one side of the ledger and all of those nations on the other side trying to work with the Iranians to hold together the remnants of the nuclear agreement and you see this most recently in the discussion in the last few days about the u.s. request to up activity in and around Iran with respect to protections for oil tankers can't get our allies to work with us on it something that you might think would be a no-brainer given the actual real provocations that the Iranians have engaged and with respect to the transit of energy resources and yet because we now have this new alignment in which we're on one side and everybody else is on the other we have a hard time getting to them to the table on it so that is worrying because that may be a permanent state of affairs that hamstrings not only our ability to do something with Iran on the nuclear program but on ballistic missiles and support for terrorist organizations which I would love for the administration to get to the table I think Zarif is sincere about his interest in doing so who knows whether he has the support of the hardliners who have been empowered over the last several years his substantial offer on simply ratifying the additional protocols is not much of a substantial offer but Italy shows that they're trying there are a couple other things though we could do right now to strengthen our hand with Iran and to limit their influence in the region I mentioned one getting our diplomats back into Baghdad every day that we have no presence in Baghdad is another day that Iran can up the presence and the political impact of the Shia militias right we are waiting for the day in which this technocratic government in Baghdad is forced out because of the Shia militias increasing political power I can just jump in to protect those diplomats and more generally in the region would you be prepared to see the deployment of more military assets to the region again for force protection or diplomatic protection I would I would not listen I think we have to have a longer term commitment right now we're doing appropriations and troop level commitments on a year-to-year basis I'm a hardened opponent of the Iraq war thought it was a mistake but I think we have a moral commitment to help that country rebuild especially after what we asked them to do with Isis so I would certainly support additional forces there if they are for diplomatic protection and then let me just say I mentioned one other thing getting out of the Yemen war you know right now is the moment as the Emiratis are pulling out their forces the Saudis have no ability to really push forward militarily without the Emiratis there I think the Houthis are falling further and further into the Iranian camp every single day that war persists we can cut off an increasing source of Iranian influence if we force a negotiation and right now I think only the United States can get a negotiation done in Yemen I as much as I love our UN envoy there I think the United States needs to be the interlocutor well when it comes to Iran were generally ambassador burns and you senator have mentioned our allies in the distance is there any rule for Russia and China to play when it comes to getting Iran to the new goat negotiating table on any of these issues well there is and I think this is where I think we generally worry about the administration's diplomatic bandwidth it seems as if we have the ability to litigate one or maybe one and-a-half issues with China at any one time with with Russia perhaps the same and so the Obama administration was you know able to walk and chew gum at the same time with with China you did a decent job at working them on climate issues well bringing them into the table on the Iranian nuclear negotiations I just simply think the administration doesn't have the capacity to do that theoretically of course they could try to help broker a return to the negotiating table but I simply don't think this administration has the personnel with which to do all that you mentioned Yemen and you've been quite outspoken on human rights abuses in Yemen quite outspoken on Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses is there a way from the United States to look at its alliances in the region with countries there the UAE Saudi Egypt and to stay allies but to hold them to greater account when comes to what they're doing domestically and in other countries in the region as well from a human rights perspective so this has been our historic position in the region we have always said to our allies that we are willing to be with you when our interests align and sometimes even when they may depart partially but when there is a substantial difference between your interests and ours we can't walk down these roads with you and the the sort of unconditional commitment that we've made to the Saudis the idea that because we are allies with the Saudis anything they ask from the United States must be responded with an affirmative answer is a betrayal of US national security interest but I also think a misunderstanding of our historic positioning in the region and so I understand this this this concern perhaps mythology that if the United States tells the Saudis we're not gonna go down this road in Yemen with you that the Alliance will fall apart but I think it is that a mythology I think the Saudis are certainly making overtures to the Russians that I always have and out of the Chinese on different weapons systems but the United States is an ally is irreplaceable they are never going to turn their backs on us but right now they are abusing us they are taking us for granted they have become the dominant partner in this relationship and this war in Yemen is a national security nightmare for the United States AQAP Isis getting stronger a famine a cholera epidemic all blamed on the United States this is the moment for the United States to step in and I actually think this is the moment for the United States to say to the Saudis and the Emiratis we want to be partners with you in peace we want to help get you to the negotiating table something that this administration has been unwilling to do and I don't understand that I don't understand why this administration refuses to play a mediating role in the Yemen conflict why they have outsources to a UN which thus far has proved largely incapable of landing this plane what leverage do we have our foreign assistance posture has changed dramatically whether it comes to Syria negotiating some kind of solution there Yemen similar story what leverage do we have over the Saudis over the Emiratis over the Houthis or any of the parties in Yemen at this at this point well I mean some of this is natural leverage I mean there there is a tiring of this conflict I spend a lot of time talking to all sides of this war and this is a moment where I think people want to get in agreement the battle lines are largely stagnant the Emiratis as I mentioned have essentially pulled out leaving the Saudis friendless so there just is a moment in time that would allow for the United States to come in but we've given away our leverage with the Saudis I mean by telegraphing to them that you know after the perpetuation of possible war crimes in Yemen with us assistance the kidnapping and dismemberment of a u.s. resident you get rewarded for that you get a deeper Defense Partnership you get a deeper nuclear civil nuclear partnership you get a visit from the Secretary of State the Saudis don't feel like they have much to fear from us if they really thought that we were willing to change the nature of our security relationship if they didn't come to the negotiating table on Yemen they would right now they think that they have this administration in a stranglehold would you cut out and had been summoned from negotiations would you advise the president not to meet with him would that be your approach no I don't think you can cut him out of negotiations you know I I might recommend to to work around the current Yemeni government I think there is a tiring of the Hadi administration that is that is a roadblock but I think you ultimately have to deal with the principle players and all of those countries and within within the Houthi coalition final question for you before we open up it up to the audience Syria is another topic that ambassador burns mentioned proxy war was going on there we withdrew the Syrian people are still being terrorized by Assad is there anything that else that we should be doing right now in light of the withdrawal of US troops well you know again I I'm in the position of having opposed the import of US troops into the region I just thought it was a sized deployment that ultimately was not going to be dispositive but once you've made that commitment you need to follow through on it and the the literal weekly prevarication on the disposition of US forces in the region has you know weakened a diplomatic hand that was already as weak as it could be so I think we should provide some certainty as to our military commitment there I think we should be back at the negotiating table having largely under this administration outsource to those talks to the Turks the Iranians and the Russians and then I think we should start to unlock our humanitarian dollars remember this administration has essentially frozen those dollars has refused to participate in the refugee crisis in the region we have taken a number of steps to essentially Telegraph that we have no interest in being a partner we're not going to give you certainty on military numbers we're not gonna send diplomats to be part of negotiations we're not going to help you with your refugee program we're not going to put humanitarian dollars on the ground we wonder why we have no leverage in Syria it's because we've taken a series of steps to communicate that we are uninterested and if we were to reverse course on at least those four grounds I'm not saying that we would win out on all of our requests but we would at least get ourselves back into the conversation Matthew one more just that we end on a high note before opening it up how are we gonna end on a high note well I'm gonna put that back when wheels I'm just asking the questions what's a bright spot for Middle East policy right now well I mean listen there are you know there are there are still relative success stories in that region you know senator Romney and I were there a month ago and is worrying as Iraq is you know Arrakis is still in many ways a success story not only that we beat Isis in the sense that we took away its its territory that we still have them on the run but we have a multi-ethnic multi-sectarian government that still enjoys legitimacy Jordan Lebanon continued to be Oasis's of stability in the region so I think that there are still places that you can point to as you try to build stability in other places as to models that work it's hard to find good news there but it absolutely exists in the defeat of Isis at least when it comes to a territory to their territorial claim is really no small feat the fact that we were able to turn around their advance to D legitimize them in the pub in the public opinion inside Iraq is you know something that we you know shouldn't we shouldn't shirk from Thank You senator and now we'll take maybe two or three questions all at once and then let the senator answer in the back yes senator thank you very much do you think we need a you a new AMF and if so what would you like to see in it sure yeah it wasn't absolutely and Sam we didn't get to talk about this question of authorization but let me take a moment express my disgust at how Congress has abdicated its responsibility to be a co-equal branch on the setting of foreign policy with this with the article 2 branch we have given up on authorizing military force largely because it's a lot harder than it used to be right we don't have armies marching against each other we don't have any peace treaties that wrap up hostilities it's harder to define your enemies it's much harder to define what victory looks like and we just stopped doing it we didn't do it on Libya and we should have we didn't do it when we went to war with Isis and we should have and now we have an administration that is looking to pervert the 2001 AUMF which was an authorization to go to war essentially against al Qaeda as a means to start war in Iran against a Shiite government that has very little if anything to do with with al Qaeda and so I just think we have to get back into this business and put a authorization of military force on the floor of the United States Senate and debate it see if we can come to a conclusion we tried that back at the very end of them crowd control of the Senate we actually got an Isis authorization passed through the Foreign Relations Committee so it's a way to show that it isn't impossible but it is also incumbent upon the administration to show restraint as well the Obama administration rightly showed restraint in deciding not to bomb Syria without coming to Congress and there was all sorts of smart people in Washington who said that was such a political and national security mistake that the president showed weakness and waiting to come to Congress he should have known that he couldn't get authorization he should have just gone and done it himself well because you can't get authorization is not an excuse to violate the Constitution the American people are smarter than you think they are they are very wary of committing US military resources in the Middle East and so they deliberately make it really hard on Congress to authorize war especially in that part of the world Congress was not going to authorize a military strike against Syria that's because the American people didn't support it and that in and of itself is a reason not to do it that's what the founding fathers said and so it is incumbent on Congress to get back in this game but it is also incumbent upon the executive and I would argue the next Democratic president to make a commitment that they are not going to engage in any unauthorized military activity without coming to Congress first even if it looks like an emergency even if it looks like Congress is not going to give you that authority let's do over there and then over there or we can you're near the mics we'll start there Thanks Thank You senator for talking to us the one thing very interesting through myself and I'm sure other people here here we have of the first conversation about the Middle East and it's the first time we've had a conversation the word Israel never came up once is this part of a strategy is is this a democratic thing with no working for Benjamin's or something I what why is this not an important thing in your discussion yeah I don't necessarily know what what you mean with that question so I address some of the words you use but I think I think that as we list the success stories of a region of course the United States partnership with Israel and our ability to protect their security against countries in their periphery who want them wiped off the face of the earth is ultimately a story of success in u.s. foreign policy and success and the partnership when senator Romney and I were there a few months ago there was I think very low expectations for the administration's supposed peace plan I think it is you know likely going to rely completely on economic support for the Palestinian state and not offer any real political offers to the Palestinians I think it will be greeted with immediate opposition from the Palestinian Authority and ultimately I think the United States is much better off when we position ourselves as an honest broker between the Israelis and the Palestinian Authority something that this administration is unwilling to do and so you know obviously this is a very very important central aspect of American foreign policy in the region there are very low expectations for the peace plan but I think there are still lots of people on the ground here who hope that in the next administration they will give it another go visited Israel recently with Senator Romney's already I did and again we were there you know just as there was expectation of this plan emerging and we we talked with the Prime Minister we met with the new prime minister in the Palestinian Authority again you know I just think that this this plan that's emerging has very very little chance of success and and listen I I have expressed to you know both Prime Minister Netanyahu and my Republican friends in Congress about my dire worry about the political in the American political debate the latest series of tweets from the president in which he is you know more overtly than ever before seeking to use irresponsibly Israel as issue between Republicans and Democrats the way in which Republicans have intentionally put legislation on the floor of the Senate before the Foreign Relations Committee that divides Republicans and Democrats on the issue of Israel when with a few tweaks to that legislation you could have gotten eighty to ninety members of the Senate supporting it I think is a is a really dangerous prescription for this debate and dialogue going forward Israel when I got to the Congress in 2007 was one of the few issues where you went out of your way to try to build consensus and that has fundamentally changed in the ten years that I've been in Congress now Republicans look at Israel as a goldmine of opportunity to try to divide Republicans from Democrats and I think that's a really horrible national security and political mistake we have one more in the back thank you very much hey Chris can you comment on the Turkish conundrum both tactically in the short-run and strategically in the longer I mean listen I think the issue is simple here there has to be a consequence for a NATO ally running to Russia for a defense system that could ultimately compromise United States national security period stop I understand the risk of splitting a important NATO ally from the coalition but if you don't make clear that part of being inside this coalition is not arranging your defense assets in a way that could also alternately compromise some of our most sensitive systems and I'm not sure what the point of the Alliance is and so I think this is ultimately a failure of the Trump administration to not be able to ultimately split the baby with the Turks and find a way for them to get a win out of this without importing the entirety of the Russian missile system but I also believe that we have to send a strong message here and tell them that you can't get American planes if you are going to be partnering with the Russians on their system that ultimately might be pointing at at those planes and of course from the very beginning the way in which this administration has approached the Turks has been as bizarre as the way in which they have approached so many other allies the the the hot and cold nature of the president's public statements has just been an invitation for this crisis ultimately and you know we we sometimes think that the president's Twitter feed and his public statements are divorced from reality how many times is Mike Pompeo come before our committee in the Foreign Relations Committee and told us not to pay attention to what the president says just pay attention to what the State Department does that's a really convenient way to try to excuse the president's recklessness but this is an example where the Turks paid attention to the scorn that the president heaped on air Dewan and his lieutenants early in his administration and that mistake that that social media mistake that we all like to write off as just bluster it is coming home to roost for this administration right now and so just yet another example of you know how did the recklessness of the way that the president talks has real ramifications for US national security around the world well listen I I think you know what's happening inside Turkey today is fascinating we're gonna have to watch the the politics of the developing opposition to to air Dhawan and his party there has been no viable opposition there for almost a decade and of course he has done a wonderful job of controlling the media and locking up political opponents as it means to consolidate his power but you have seen these early grass shoots in the mayoral election and other regional political battles of a potential popular resistance mounting and and and and I think it's hard to answer which way Turkey goes without understanding what his political opposition looks like whether it can achieve maturation what we do know is that their economy is is hemorrhaging is hurting and for a long time they had received rightfully so the bounty of this perception globally the turkey was aligning itself with the West and aligning itself with the European Union they stood in this nether world for about a decade in which they had stopped moving closer to the European Union it was pretty clear they weren't gonna come in but people still thought of them as a country that you could really do business with and so they are seeing the consequences of this turn away from the EU and Europe this turn away from NATO and perhaps as they understand that the only way to build a growing economy for their people is to turn back we may you know see a future a future for Turkey that is Western oriented in the way that I think we may be took for granted its future was going to be 15 to 20 years ago so watch the political debate play out watch the continued atrophy of their economy I think those are the signals that you can look to as we try to hope listen I think they're an incredibly important ally I desperately want them to be a full complete partner in NATO I root for them to make a decision to re-engage with the European Union and I think their domestic profile over the next few years will tell us a lot about whether that's going to come to fruition senator thank you here [Applause]

Thank You mr. chairman thank you to our witnesses I think that the topic of our hearing today is very timely I think that as we sort through these issues this is a tremendous opportunity to work together realizing that we have a challenge ahead of us where we have the success in many respects of Medicare Part D and the dynamics and the overall framework of Medicare Part D has proven very successful the question is how can we take those dynamics and make sure that there is an ample competition in choice and access for for seniors and actually not just seniors but but everyone all demographics and I know that this issue is really so important to folks of all ages I mean the the rising out-of-pocket health care costs in general or impacting more and more Americans illustrating hearing from my constituents that tell me that $30,000 a year out-of-pocket expense for their health insurance they would not consider to be affordable and I hope we we listen to them and instead of well when we look at bigger premiums higher deductibles and fewer plan options the patients are faced with higher and higher costs for these essential medicines such as the insulin mentioned by by mr. Luther in order to bring down these costs in a long term we need to address the problems with incentives built into our health care system which which benefit those bad actors and hurt the long-term competition it's necessary for both sides to come together to find consensus solutions as I mentioned earlier which adjusts these incentives to bring new solutions to the market faster and increase healthy competition as mr. Luther expressed the long term solution for the present high cost of insulin is to foster greater competition among the manufacturers of insulin in contrast Medicare for all plans would increase not decrease in government manipulation in spending on health care system on the health care system while failing to address these underlying factors now take for example Medicare Part D as I mentioned early a widely popular program which is performed actually better than it's originally projected costs because the private insurers compete against one another to offer a variety of competitive plans increasing government involvement in the program by repealing Medicare Part D non-interference would simply be an exercise in price setting rather than negotiation fact the CBO has said in the past that allowing the health secretary - supposedly negotiate drug prices in Medicare would only save money to the extent that the Medicare program is willing to limit seniors access to certain drugs we've touched a little bit on that here this morning mr. Antos can you have further elaborate and explain why the CBO would would have come to this conclusion and what the broader effects a repeal of non-interference would have on the pharmaceutical market and consumer access yeah yes the I think I think it's a fundamental view of virtually every economist that unless you're willing to walk away from a product you're not going to be able to get a much better price Medicare is not in that position every president that I know of since 1965 has said we're not going to touch Medicare and and the the obvious fact is that it's very very difficult to say no especially in this kind of situation where we may be talking about a very expensive drug that could be potentially life-saving for some senior citizens so being able to walk away it's just just not in the cards and the the other problem though is how do you know you've actually gotten a good price and will it really last so so you may actually negotiate a price that looks pretty good one year but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be able to keep that price after all when you when you negotiate a price oftentimes that's the floor price not I mean that's the ceiling price I'm sorry that's the floor price not the ceiling price prices go up from what you negotiated and so that eliminates and important element of competition you have competition there might be another product that might actually drive the price down of that original product but you won't see it if you've negotiated negotiated what is essentially a floor price okay very good thank you very much I I just hope that too we as a committee will keep in mind number one consumer choices for for seniors especially with Medicare Part D but Medicare Advantage I mean there are more and more seniors who are very pleased with with what they have access to with Medicare Advantage and certainly Medicare Part D and and the numbers are indisputable in terms of actually helping keep some of those costs down for for Medicare Part D we need to look at how we can make sure that other costs are facing more competition and more consumer choice thank you I yield back

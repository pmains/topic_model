this further congressman mark VC of Texas he was among the Democratic lawmakers who visited some of the border detention facilities in his state this week congressman I was just seeing you shaking your head yeah I mean just hearing that I mean how can you hear that and not just and not just break your heart I mean this is it's awful and based on what I saw on my trip day before yesterday i 100% believed him they did everything they could to give us there's nothing here to see to her but when you talked to migrants that were in custody they told us firsthand that they were being told to drink out of toilets when they were told they were thirsty that there were kids that were walking around in clothing where there was mucus just from days and days worth of mucus and another debris like on their clothing showers being denied for days they told us that they could shower anytime you know at least once a day but what we were told was that they were being denied showers for days by by migrants and you know based on this Facebook posts how can you not believe that the migrants were telling us the truth and now based on what this Border Patrol agent was just telling us and and the IG report I mean something has to change well let's talk about that but before we get there on top of those two things there's something else that has come out these images these drawings from the American Academy of Pediatrics they released these these pictures of drawings that young children made once they were released but made of their time in custody I mean you can see with your own eyes what it clearly looked like to them and more importantly what it felt like to them to be in there what do you say to that when you see this yeah well you know I can't see the images but I can tell you that you know we saw young children that looked appear to me to be 3 or 4 years old that we're in holding sails holding cells similar to what you would see like at a county lockup and and again this based on the IGS report and and the interviews that we just heard I mean yeah the the kids are being there's no question in my mind that these children are being treated very poorly and I think that it also illustrates that President Trump will do anything that he can to try to appease his base when it comes to immigration and that he is using these migrants as pawns in a political game and that is just that's absolutely sick and it has to stop now and I will tell you that one of the things that has to change today is that members of Congress need to be able to go and visit these facilities without 48 hour notice right now we have to give 48 hour notice we need to be able to go into these facilities whenever we want to at a weekend we can fly down there on our own dime we can fly down there at the scrubs they've been wondering about these allegations it's really interesting actually that you bring this up because I i've been wondering this coming from the IG report where they did surprise visits at five facilities and that's what they found and even with the amount of notice that you were giving that you had to give to go into this facility and the story is that you were told I'm starting to wonder if you're just because journalists can't go in there with cameras that's the thing I continue to have to say too our viewers why don't you just make a tour of it why don't you just give that 48 hours notice and make a tour of it and keep visiting these facilities over and over again because maybe that is what would bring about maybe that would is what would bring about change yeah no I I think that again obviously more tours will be helpful but not having to give the notice I mean I mean if I wanted to go down there right now and visit that facility at Clinton or any of them along the border I need to be able to as a member of Congress we have oversight of these committees and the game that they're playing and I personally for like the reason why they're playing games is that they feel empowered by this president and Steven Miller who's his so-called immigration use our but you do have someone appointed by the president as well the new acting chief of the Department of Homeland Security who he says he is acting it's on when talking about the Facebook postings that secret Facebook page right he's directed an investigation and he says that anyone who's done wrong should be should be and will be held accountable we learned that today do you applaud him yeah no absolutely he is certainly saying the right thing when it comes to that we need to see it followed up with action we need to see of course you probably saw that Elijah Cummings who's the chair of the Oversight Committee that he's going to conduct investigations that the Acting Secretary said that he is going to conduct investigations and not only do people need to be disciplined people need to be fired I mean I I can't tell you Kate just the fact that knowing that some of the people that were supposed to be our security for that day when we were at the press conference and all of the people that were in the maggot hats were out there screaming obscenities at us that those were supposed to be our security personnel and those are the people that are supposed to be in charge of making sure of these migrants are being treated humanely and they're a part of that Facebook page I mean that's just absolutely unacceptable and so when investigations are conducted and I hope that they will be conducted very swiftly people need to be terminated and again depending on what is found out there maybe need to be some people that need to be prosecuted well that's one thing that we do know is there something like ninety five hundred members of that Facebook page but we don't know exactly who those Facebook pages who those postings are from who those people are in real life that is part of the investigation and that is what Kevin McHale Lehmann says they're going to get to the bottom of there's so much more to this especially from this IG report I just cannot turn away from it and no one else should congressman thank you for coming on let us know when you're on your next tour

thank you Mr chair so I represent uh Virginia the Eastern Shore Virginia Beach and a lot of the Chesapeake Chesapeake Bay Region so I just Virginians don't know know how to be good stewards of the environment without sacrificing jobs or hurting our economy not only is the Chesapeake Bay Watershed home to roughly 3 000 600 species of plants and animals but also provides countless economic and recreational opportunities generating 33 billion dollars each year so Mr molito Mr Sandberg the Bureau of ocean Energy Management recently announced the draft environmental impact statement for an offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach creating the potential for new job opportunities and economic growth for Virginians the wind industry is growing along the Atlantic coast and provides opportunities to diversify our energy production but Virginia's fishing community and tourism economy are also crucial to our economic well-being and critical military training exercises take place off our Coastline how is the wind industry engaging with and accommodating concerns of these stakeholders to ensure balance access to the outer continental shelf considering the balancing needs of all the different offshore Industries and stakeholders is very important to our industry I do like to point to the Gulf of Mexico experience because we've been developing energy resources there for decades in in a compatible way with military tourism commercial recreational fishing so we have the experience we've been able to do that very well and and we've seen that also in the development of the wind industry throughout Europe so the process that we've seen as it moves has moved forward is a collaborative process it's through NEPA and it's through the outer continental shelf lands act where all the different stakeholders are able to weigh in and provide their thoughts in a deliberative way to make sure that we're allowing all users to be able to move forward with their activities with as little interruptions possible uh and one thing I like to point to is the industry working together to find a way to separate the wind turbines to the greatest extent possible so that there's enough space for all users but we're also able to build up a wind farm that will provide the wind capacity to power the Grid at shore side so there's a lot that goes into it that the companies that are moving forward with developing these projects work closely with the communities with the state Leaders with the federal family to make sure that we're doing everything we can to address all the competing needs and how is the regulatory process underneath the impacting timelines for offshore wind Leasing and construction and what can this committee do better to better the certainty in the NEPA process I think a lot of this is going to come down to making sure we do have guide rails on the NEPA analysis to make sure that we don't have a process that that is never ending and that can ultimately always lead to a challenging court and depending on the judge strike down a project or delay it and send it back I will say that there are also there are already multiple lawsuits filed against the early mover wind projects in the Atlantic multiple multiple lawsuits so there's a lot of concern about that because those lawsuits could have a an impact on the ones that are in line behind them depending upon how they shake out so we need to make sure that the the agencies have a framework with some guide rails and we need to also look at the remedies available to the court to make sure that we're not stifling investment and putting companies in the position to want to invest elsewhere in the world rather than here thank you and Miss sugama while I recognize the importance of the offshore wind industry to my district and other Coastal communities it does nothing to financially support Federal conservation efforts so unlike the oil and gas industry as you know the Great American outdoors acts directs roughly 1.9 billion dollars in energy development royalties to conservation efforts across the country including National Parks and Wildlife refuges as well as permanently funding the land and conservation water conservation fund at 900 million dollars annually in fact 94 of federal conservation efforts are funded exclusively by royalties from oil and gas industry leases in production so with the Biden Administration slowing the permitting process limiting production leases and over-regulating the oil and gas industry what are the expected impacts of unconservation efforts over the next decade and how can we ensure that funding remains available for the conservation of our Coastal communities I really appreciate that because I think that's something that does get lost is if if we took oil and natural gas development to zero on federal lands that would take away that 2.8 billion dollars Federal lands and Waters that goes into conservation with no replacement for it because um right now wind provides something I think it provided like something like five million dollars um whereas we provide billions of dollars so there's no if you took away oil and gas that conservation funding dries up so so there would be none pretty much for our Coastal communities for conservation efforts I mean if these policies were ultimately taken to their conclusion which I don't really see happening but yes if you didn't continue to produce more on federal lands and Waters eventually that money would go to zero thank you thank you thank you very much I yield back

EXPLAIN THE BILL IN DETAIL.  MR. MCHENRY: MAY I INQUIRE HOW   MUCH TIME IS REMAINING?  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: 13  MINUTES. MR. MCHENRY: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE FIXED  CROWDFUNDING ACT.  THESE DAYS, SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND THE FINANCING INVESTMENT THAT THEY NEED TO   START UP, TO GROW. THAT AFFECTS JOBS. IT CERTAINLY DOES. RECENTLY IN MY DISTRICT, WE HAVE READ REPORTS OF SMALLER COUNTIES IN AMERICA, WHICH USED TO LEAD   THE NATION IN GROWTH OF SMALL  BUSINESSES BUT NOW LOSS OF MORE  BUSINESSES THAN THEY HAVE  CREATED. THE REASON THAT WE ARE ABLE TO   WORK TOGETHER ON AN IMPORTANT  PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND LOG JAM DISCUSSION ABOUT APPROPRIATE   REGULATION, A LOT OF STUFF GETS  LOCKED UP IN PARTISAN DEBATE.  WHAT UNITS OUR CONVERSATION IS A RURAL ISSUE AND AN URBAN ISSUE   AND IT'S ABOUT CAPITAL DESERTS   IN AMERICA.  NOW EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT FOOD   DESERTS. IF YOU ARE NOT CLOSE TO A  GROCERY STORE, YOU CAPTAIN GET   FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. BUT WE HAVE CAPITAL DESERTS. IT IS ABOUT THOSE AREAS NOT IN   AUSTIN OR SILICON VALLEY, IT IS  THE REST THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO  GET THE CAPITAL THEY NEED TO   GROW A BUSINESS. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT   GOOGLE OR FACEBOOK, BUT TALKING  ABOUT A LAWN SERVICE OR A COFFEE SHOP, A BAKER WHO WANTS TO SELL  HER GOODS TO A WIDER SCALE, SO   SHE CAN PROVIDE FOR HER FAMILY.  THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS THAT ARE  REAL AND WE CAN ADDRESS IN A   REAL WAY BEFORE CONGRESS TODAY,  TONIGHT IN THIS VOTE.  INVESTMENT CROWDFUNDING IS ONE   WAY WE CAN REVERSE THIS  DISTURBING TREND.  AND WHAT THIS DOES IS ALLOW US,  THIS BILL ALLOWS US TO EXPAND  WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DO THROUGH  INVESTMENT CROWDFUNDING. FIVE YEARS AGO IN THE JOBS ACT,  WE HAD A REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE  THE WAY WE ALLOWED INDIVIDUALS   TO INVEST A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY  IN THEIR FELLOW MAN, ALLOWED MEN OR WOMEN IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO INVEST IN LOCAL COFFEE SHOPS.  YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A WEALTHY  INVESTOR TO THE GET THE  OPPORTUNITIES. YOU COULD BE AN AVERAGE INVESTOR LIKE ME OR MANY OF MY  CONSTITUENTS.  BUT IN THE JOBS ACT AND IN THE   INVESTMENT CROWDFUNDING PART OF  THAT BILL THAT I WROTE FIVE  YEARS AGO, WELL, OUT OF THAT,  THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE WROTE  FOUR REGULATION. AND CREATED A COUPLE OF MAJOR  CHALLENGES.  ONE IS THE 12-G PROBLEM. WHAT THE 12-G PROBLEM IS, IN   ESSENCE, YOU ARE SUBBING VERY  LOW FUNDRAISING TO VERY  EXPENSIVE REGULATORY   DISCLOSURES. THAT'S A PROBLEM, IT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS COSTLY AND   ECONOMICALLY COSTLY AND  RESTRICTS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY.  WE FIXED THAT IN THE FIXED   CROWDFUNDING ACT.  ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR  CROWDFUNDING IS THAT UNDER   S.E.C. RULES, SING WILL-PURPOSE  FUNDS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS ACTING  WHO HAS A FIDUCIARY  RESPONSIBILITY, MEANING I'M  GOING TO LOOK OUT FOR YOUR BEST  INTEREST ON THIS INVESTMENT AND  YOU ARE ABLE TO CREATE A FUND IN ORDER TO POOL THOSE RESOURCES  THAT INVESTOR AND WORK WITH  THEM.  IT ALLOWS UNSOPHISTICATED PEOPLE TO GET SOPHISTICATED ADVICE IF   WE ALLOW SPECIAL PURPOSE   VEHICLES.  THESE TWO PROVISIONS ARE VERY  SIMPLE LEVEL.  IF WE FIX THESE THINGS, WE WILL  PROVIDE MORE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY   AND BETTER INVESTOR ADVICE AND   MAKE REAL THE UTILITY OF   CROWDFUNDING.  THE ESSENCE OF THIS IS THAT WE   BELIEVE IN THE CAPACITY OF   INDIVIDUAL AMERICANS TO MAKE   DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES, TO   TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF RISK FOR  THEMSELVES.  IT'S A POWERFUL THING. IT'S A POWERFUL, MEANINGFUL STEP FORWARD. NOW, IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE  GREATER DEBATE THAT WE ARE   HAVING HERE IN WASHINGTON ON SO  MANY CHALLENGING ISSUES OF   POLICY WHERE THE LEFT AND RIGHT  DON'T SEE EYE-TO-EYE.  BUT WE ARE CREATING OPPORTUNITY  AND TRY TO GET THE RESOURCES OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY.  IT'S A MEANINGFUL STEP FORWARD.  I THANK THE RANKING MEMBER OF  THE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE AND I THANK RANKING MEMBER   WATERS FOR HER ACTIVE  ENGAGEMENT.  SHE HELPED OUR ORIGINAL BILL   THAT CAME THROUGH THE FINANCIAL  SERVICES COMMITTEE FIVE YEARS  AGO AND WORKED THROUGH THIS  COMPROMISE THAT IS ON THE HOUSE  FLOOR TONIGHT. AND WHILE WE MAY NOT AGREE, WE   HAVE WORKED ON TWO SUBSTANTIVE   AREAS OF POLICY HERE IN RECENT   WEEKS. I THINK THAT IS A HOPEFUL SIGN.  I THINK IT'S A POSITIVE SIGN.  BUT WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY WILL EXPAND THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO HAVE  THAT LITTLE BIT OF INVESTMENT  THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IN THEIR FELLOW MAN, THEIR FELLOW WOMAN,  TO CREATE NEW JOBS AND PROVIDE   NEW ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY.  SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I ASK  AND ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR   THE FIXED CROWDFUNDING ACT AND   URGE AN AYE

we need to be very clear about who does not benefit from these giveaways and subsidies the hard-working small businessman who runs this station has no benefit whatsoever the small business people of connecticut are struggling as are the average american family with the highest prices they've paid in a long time and their blood is boiling as they look at that sign and rightly so because the companies that are profiting are making more money than they have before uh exxon and all the other companies exxon mobil are at all time high profits and they are complaining about a simple effort to impose fairness they ought to be embarrassed and ashamed to be receiving those giveaways and subsidies when they don't need them and their shareholders are paying higher prices at the pump along with everyone else so this effort is about basic fairness we can lower the deficit we can send a message that government will be fair and the major producers of gasoline for the united states will have to play by the same rules as everyone else no giveaways no loopholes no sweetheart deals they ought to be making profits fairly not with the kind of giveaways that they're receiving now and one last point i half expected that some of these big oil companies would come and say you know we want to do the right thing we're here to tell you we're going to share sacrifice just like everyone else but instead they are trying to drain every last penny from taxpayers and consumers and the united states government simply ought to say no no more and you don't need it and we won't tolerate it

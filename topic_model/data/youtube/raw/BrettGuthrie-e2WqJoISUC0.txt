mr. Guthrie is recognized for his time thank you madam chair and thank you for all being here and just so everybody knows we've been having these meetings if they're not been formal hearings bipartisan with with several of you over time and I remember when we first started meeting about this might have been dr. fauci I said I'm gonna put working Matthew didn't but we are gonna prepare for a pandemic that's what the American people expect us to do we're gonna prepare for a pandemic we're gonna put things in place for a pandemic and hope and pray that it never comes we're gonna get ready and as we prepare for it people are going to see things hear things and maybe react that there's Padilla is imminent when it may not be because we're doing what we're supposed to do the other thing is I know the White House the administration needs to reassure markets and market places where we are where we stand and for everything that I've heard previously and what Larry Kudlow had said is not inconsistent is where we are but I know that the CDC came out and talking about the pandemic to be ready for it and secretary Hayes or if you'd like to explain this I know the CDC warned that Americans should and I'll quote prepare for community spread in the United States and should be ready for quote significant disruption and would you explain what that means what it means to the average person what that means and what's the most important message you would like for the American people to know about the current state of American that coronavirus our messaging from the president through to this career officials at the CDC has been consistent but it's striking a balance america's risk is low at the moment that could change quickly we are working to keep that risk low but we have always been transparent that we expect more cases in the United States with a rapidly spreading virus especially with what we've seen for the average American there's no change in their behaviors except what we always would advise which is practice good public hygiene washing your hands appropriately coughing into your arm not touching your face with unwashed hands and appropriate preparedness activities at home and you can go to CDC gov for normal advice for flu seasons hurricanes and others good preparedness and good thoughtfulness at home we're trying to be very transparent to people of the risks we face even if we're at a low risk situation now so that we don't so people aren't surprised so that they know what we're dealing with and what uncertainties were dealing with thank you and so dr. fasting dr. Redfield for 50 days we've learned much about the corona virus but much is still unknown what is the current that's why I know people want to know at home what is the current scientific consensus about the transmissibility infection is of the virus and how long once you're infected would you be infected how long can you pass it on and what are the other remaining known unknowns what are the things you know that you would like to know the answer to with dr. Fauci and dr. Redfield or dr. Cadillac if that's in your rope first of all we know it's very transmissible virus there are some viruses that are not efficient in going from human to human what we learned early on and we are convinced now giving what we've seen in China and other countries that it's a highly transmissible virus that's the first thing the second thing when you say how long a person is infected after they get infected that's something that's still up in the air and the way you get the answer to that is you try and isolate virus what we call shedding for a period of time and we know that there are individuals who are actually able to transmit when they are without symptoms before they get symptoms well we don't know yet and I think we're gonna get information from the group including the CDC individual and one of my people who was in China with the Dulce w-h-o group what the extent of that transmissibility is from an asymptomatic person is it minor part of the driving of the outbreak or is it significant that's gonna be a very important thing that is currently an unknown no Bob you want to take off film I concur with dr. voci I think that the biggest challenge we have right now is what is the relative infectivity weather before you get sick are you more infectious before you get sick are you more infectious after you get sick we are tracking these patients that we do have in this country to see how long they actually have virus that can be isolated from their respiratory secretions it's it's probably going to be longer than many of us originally anticipated I think at this stage we have an individuals out about 18 days from the time they initially actually got sick so I think these are key questions and we continue to try to get the data to answer them so there other things that you are looking to know that you don't know and that you know that you don't know that you're trying to find the answers to I think one of the other areas from the CDC's point of view is trying to understand the methods of transmission is it all respiratory transmission through droplets as their phone might transmission for example can this virus survive on certain surfaces long enough for somebody else to come down put their hand down and then touch their face you know it's it's not clear right now what the relative components of safe droplet transmission is to foe my transmission thank you my time is expired I'll yield back

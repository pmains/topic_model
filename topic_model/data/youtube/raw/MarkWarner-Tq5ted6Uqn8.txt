joining me now is the Democratic senator from Virginia Mark Warner he's vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee senator Warner welcome back to Meet the Press well thank you chuckling first of all congratulations to you you and your team for 70 great years of jobs that that I appreciate hopefully we'll be here for another 70 let me start with what we learned this week or what you learned this week from the special counsels indictments do you believe that the fact that you we've already seen some stories change this week or additional information about either contacts with Russians or ideas of meeting with Russians do you feel like that's all coming from the indictments that it this is the impact of those first indictments from the special counsel well the committee itself has been aware of some of this information and we've been continuing to work I know you're gonna have my my friend James Langford on later I'm very proud our committee is the only bipartisan group still looking at this well we are well we did see this week though was one more example of at least where the Russians had what appeared to be a fairly organized effort in terms of trying to reach out to folks affiliated with the Trump campaign to share quote-unquote dirt or emails about Hillary Clinton we've seen it with the case of mr. Papadopoulos we saw it in the case of the so-called June 9th meeting with Donald Trump jr. we've got a lot more questions to get answered we've got a number of other individuals that we're going to want to interview or our effort is separate obviously for the special prosecutors but I think we're both proceeding ahead but I'm curious does the threat for indictments to come which I'm sure many many folks believe is happening inside the Muller Pro probably you you expect them as well is that going to make folks more cooperative with your investigation or do you fear now that because the Muller probe is intensifying that the fear of legal jeopardy will actually make them clam up with you well we've actually interviewed literally a couple hundred individuals many times without actually even the knowledge of the press we've worked with a lot of these individuals cooperatively we've got more to obviously mowers got a different Lane and as people fall into the realm of legal jeopardy they may be less willing to talk to us but I've been very pleased so far in terms of the level of cooperation we've had from virtually everyone is there a point though where you're gonna run into each other listen just as we if you look back in the days of the Watergate there was a special congressional committee that was also a special prosecutor yeah we've got different lanes you know they're looking for criminal indictment we're trying to make sure that we find out what happened in 2016 was there collusion we've got a different factual basis to it we're trying to hit at and I think you know we're gonna have to find wasted deconflict and I think we will continue to do that have you interviewed George papadopolis listen I'm not gonna talk about which witnesses that we've seen or not seen but the Chairman and I did indicate that mr. Papadopoulos had been on our screen for a long time okay so you're not confirming or denying whether you've interviewed him again what what the Chairman I've said is we don't comment on specific witnesses but we put out a joint statement that mr. Papadopoulos had been an honor on our screens all along let me ask you about former national security adviser Michael Flynn and his son Michael G Flynn I know there were reports that your committee was meeting resistance from them when it comes to cooperating with your investigation are you still meeting resistance with the two of them Chuck again the way we get the kind of cooperation with the witnesses is is frankly to not share the the kind of weekly box score of who've we seen and who we've not seen we've got a lot of folks that we have seen we've got more folks that we need to in the end of the day what we owe the American people is the truth and most importantly how we make sure that we don't have a foreign power and a foreign power like Russia intervened again in our elections that's really important whether it's the potential issues around collusion or the kind of questions we've seen in terms of interference with 21 States electoral systems or the stuff that we've dealt with this week in terms of some of the social media interactions right let me quick ask you about the steel dossier you're the chair your partner there Republican Senator Richard burr said you've hit a brick wall on the steel dossier you had confirmed or had been able to rebuild it I think is what he said going back to June sort of but you'd hit a brick wall part in part because you hadn't been able to speak to mr. steel have you still hit that brick brick wall or have you broken through it listen I think the steel dossier there's been lots of press interest and who paid for it obviously we've got evidence now that there was a Republican payments Democratic payments at the end of the day what I want to know is what's true in the steel dossier and what's not true this is a fairly damning indictment out there but it's in that dossier and I wish mr. steel would sit down and talk to our committee we've reached out he's refused to do so so far we still hold out the option that the Chairman and I said we'll meet him any for any place anywhere I want to ask you about something that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said about social media companies I know you want to try to come up with some legislation that makes advertising more transparent but listen to an idea he brought up with Hugh Hewitt on Saturday what we ought to do with regard to the Russians is retaliate seriously retaliate against the Russians and the these tech firms could be helpful in having us given us a way to to do that well you think of that idea getting the tech companies to cooperate in a retaliatory strike of some sort against the Russians well Chuck I actually agree with the majority leader that we need a cyber doctrine for a long time I think we have had incoming weather was Russians Chinese others work we've had cyberattacks misinformation disinformation attacks we need to have both defense and offensive capabilities but I also believe we need to make sure that we apply at least the lightest touch possible I was in the tech business for 20 years I'm pro tect I'm pro innovation but I think at the basics we ought to make sure that when we're receiving political advertising these companies would work with us to make sure that we identify if a foreign power be behind that advertising I think Americans have a right to know all right senator one I have to leave it there for time senator thanks for coming on and sharing your views I appreciate it

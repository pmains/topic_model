the subcommittee would wish to seek time I certainly do gentlelady is recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman and on this bill I we still have very very very strong objections on Valentine's Day the majority delivered the people the state of California box full of empty Valentine's and promised with only a one and a half day notice the mark up prior notice to this markup over the last eight months the majority is negotiated over two dozen changes to the introduced version of HR 1837 without any input on the language from all stakeholders including the California water agencies and certainly my constituency HR 1837 claims to restore the flow of water to beleaguered communities in the world's most productive and highly valued agricultural region let's be clear on the reality this radical legislation will negatively impact how water is managed in the state of California amends our state constitution and will undermine California's ability to manage its own resources it would repeal or overturn nearly 20 years of environmental protections under the Central Valley Project Improvement Act called cvpi a and the endangered species act esa would repeal the court-ordered san joaquin restoration settlement enact a compromise that took over almost 20 years to reach and was widely supported by a variety of stakeholders this original settlement had two primary goals one restoration a the restoration go to restore maintained fish populations in good condition in the upper San Joaquin River secondly a water management goal to reduce and avoid adverse water supply impacts to all friant division long-term contractors that may result from these restoration close by passing this bill out of the committee one step closer to creating drastic legal and water rights uncertainty for all stakeholders and possibly dramatic cuts to the water diversions this is a good bill for lawyers as written it locks up water contracts with no environmental mitigation and in perpetuity it also preempts and supersedes any state law any regulation or requirement that impose is more restrictive requirements or regulations for activities authorized under this bill it overturns a hundred and ten years of reclamation law it undermines the ongoing state and federal efforts under the Bay Delta conservation plan despite the changes by the majority HR 1837 still seeks to make sweeping and dramatic changes to the CVP IA it extends water contracts to 40 years and continues in perpetuity without completion of any environmental mitigation or consideration of climate change removes tiered water pricing aimed at encouraging water conservation and efficiency and also diminishes funds for restoration it completely eliminates the co-equal goal of protecting the environment and allowing for water deliveries violations of these laws were the basis for the litigation by the NRC Council in 18 8 1988 and it puts the jobs of fishermen highly at risk it Priam states rights the state rights are historic and fundamental principle it is the asserting of states rights it's bad precedent and should not be taken lightly this litigation also severe limits ongoing environmental protection efforts and deems that requirements of the ESA are met at levels established by scientific analysis used in the 1994 Bay Delta Accord ecosystems changed that's a fact using 20 year old ecosystem science and is akin to treating a patient today based on vital measurements for 20 years ago does not make sense since introduction we've received nearly three dozen letters in opposition and I'm submitting for the record a list of over i would say about 50-60 letters in opposition it includes the state legislature senator potom Steinberg speaker Perez the Senate boxer a Feinstein assembly cheers and let your resources and state of California water parks wildlife in a signed letter stated it undermines judicial agreements erodes long standing water principles usurps California sovereignty and lays waste to any hope of progress in the Delta I made that it also you serves other states rights eventually fishing industries there's no word this is their quote to describe the complete devastation this will this bill would bring to the sea Central Valley Salman runs and those who depend on them for their livelihood recreation and foot sources from the Central Valley a central Delta Water Agency this bill would transfer responsibility of complying with state river flow and quality protections above the Bay Delta Accord to non export project water rights holders who under California law are senior to the exporters the San Joaquin reliability Act has nothing to do with the reliability and everything to do with uncertainty it does not create jobs and I Thank You mr. chairman I will yield to mr. Garamendi if he so wishes

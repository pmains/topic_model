this is to anybody uh that would like to answer answer this in addition to my role in the committee i chair also the cyber subcommittee armed services committee and a reoccurring issue that has uh come up and my conversations with ranking member senator rounds is our security clearance process our veterans who receive security clearances during their service at great cost to the taxpayers coupled with the experience it gives them a competitive edge in the private sector when they transition my question is this are we adequately taking advantage of transferring their clearances to influence more hiring appeal for our veterans thank you for the question what i would tell you is that one of the things that we will do with this eightfold ai partnership that we will be starting in in the later this fall around november is really looking at the information that that veteran has to offer in terms of their skills their abilities their credentials and even some of the skills that you wouldn't typically see on a resume but obviously clearance can be a very valuable asset and so that would be something that would be incorporated into this electronic matching system to help identify this service member and eventually veteran as somebody who has a clearance so that they can be matched up with jobs that require that because that is clearly a critical asset um i don't know if my va colleagues have anything so it does i know it's extremely valuable i know how hard it is how long it takes but when they have this type of experience level and they already have a clearance i don't know are we having a hard i guess my follow-up would be how would you change the program to enable federal state and certain property owned businesses to hire a veteran that already has the security clearance that should not be an impediment it should be a tremendous asset indeed it is a tremendous asset so i'm not an expert on the security clearance process but i can tell you what i'm trying to express here is that we will leverage that asset and make sure that when we're marketing this individual to employers that that is clearly articulated that that's an asset that they hold so that we can match them up to those jobs that are in high demand yeah well there might be a person that might not match up for the job but they have the clearance and people are looking for clearance and maybe they can make that job turn into something very beneficial for them i wouldn't rule them out just there's just not that many people and it's hard to get clearances today so i would use that as a tremendous a tremendous valued tool my other question is on a given day west virginia has about 90 to 100 va vacancies we have four four va hospitals and hundreds of other across the federal government as you know what can we do to incentivize more veterans to apply to these federal job openings how can we lower their barriers so that they're able uh to enter when applying and senator this is a yes sir senator from the vba perspective i can tell you there's a phenomenal opportunity right now to increase veteran hiring and uh to assist with our uh our backlog and and and uh the effects of bluewater navy the additional presumptive conditions we're hiring more than two thousand claims processors there's two thousand opportunities for veterans to raise their hand and join uh what i think is the greatest mission of the federal government and that is serving those that have served we will continue to look at opportunities to bring veterans into the federal workforce and through our vr e program and this kind of goes to your first question of our 964 uh vocational rehabilitation counselors and our 70 plus employment coordinators they will look at the strengths and the skill sets and the and the things that veterans bring to the table let me follow up with mr burke i can follow up it's my understanding that the usa jobs process is unnecessarily difficult so have any of our witnesses today successfully been hired through the usa jobs and what are your unfiltered thoughts just give it to me if we can help you that's all uh sir to be honest with you i haven't uh applied uh for a job through usa jobs in in in many years so i have no reason anybody that has and the difficulties you might run into thank you for the question i'll actually take that i am a mentor a mentor transitioning service members and i have helped them navigate the usa job system um it can be complex i will tell you that one of the key things about the usa jobs system is you have to have attention to detail there are questions asked in the system um that you have to answer and you have to upload all of the requirements so yes can it be complex it can be how can we how can we streamline it how do we streamline it i mean you're seeing it from the inside out and i appreciate you being so honest with us on that help us fix that so uh it sounds to me like an average person is not going to be able to go through this process unless they have help from someone like yourself i'm happy to take that i think that one of the challenges is that um when when you submit your resume for a federal job it doesn't always have all the components that we need in the federal environment to evaluate for example do you have veterans preference do you meet the key qualifications and what we don't want to do is take a chance on missing a really qualified candidate because their resume didn't capture all the items so it is i think a balancing act in order for us to make sure that we can get all the qualified candidates in the door by giving them the opportunity to add the additional information that may not be on their resume thank you so much and again i want to thank the chairman for doing such an outstanding job with all the help of his ranking member senator moran they do a fantastic job running this committee thank you both

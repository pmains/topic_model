leadership is it's really a gift and it's a gift given to you by those willing to support you I think I think a lot of our representatives or so-called leaders maybe forget that lesson and so I want to tell you why I'm actually here I know that's why you all came if my story started a long time ago it was a difficult path I think my first test it's a lost my mother when I was 10 and I learned how to be strong because of that I learned that from her and with that strength I decided want to become a Navy SEAL and you know that was about since I was 12 years old write a book and I was hooked Fallujah ended up in Ramadi in my third deployment Afghanistan all the SEAL team 3 and that's where my path took a shift about six months in the deployment I was hit by an ie D blast when one of my Afghan interpreters stepped on a pressure plate right in front of me and the poor guy was just membered right in front of me and I was blinded I was thrown to the ground didn't know what would happen just yet I survived it was conscious or remember the whole thing but I was blind I woke up from a medically induced coma about six days later have my friends by my side got flown back to Bethesda eventually had my wife by my side and we prayed and we had faith and we knew that I would see again in spite what the doctors were Thomas and they were not optimistic but I was and I was right and right then I saw again out of my left eye it's complicated but I saw and I also decided to keep the plane I wasn't ready to accept the new path of Public Service just yet I wanted to keep doing when I was doing it and that was back to the Middle East and then back to Korea in 2016 now I was medically retired at the end of 2016 and went on to do my masters in public policy because I just care about policy and I think that's how I can make my impact and I was willing to kind of accept God's new path for me on that with those lessons you know bring a lot of things that I want to bring to Congress and that's an understanding with recent and relevant experience national security issues and defense issues before in affairs and we needed to have in Congress to help our president you can't just have talking points this is so important it takes years and years of classified briefings to understand how things work out there now my last deployment was in Korea that's a big issue these days my one before that was working against the Iranian threat the Persian Gulf that's on the horizon we need people understand these you're gonna set programs you can who can fight for the right ideas because it's ever-changing it's not written down and to think tanks you know not just talking points that's what I want to get it the other reason I'm here is because I have an intrinsic understanding I think what the American people are about and why they're so special is because there's an understanding among Americans that this country is great because of us and because what we do for it because we help each other we put community with a family first and then it's community and it's local government and the state government we stick together and we help each other and I think Houston really knows what that's about you saw that after hurricane Harvey I saw it I was back home where I grew up in Katie mucking out of houses he really just everybody was volunteer and said I've never seen anything like this before it's not like this in Louisiana it's not like this in Florida when we won't see disasters but Exxon's really know what it means to take care of yourself we're self-sufficient we're not selfish and you know a big fear that I have is that we're losing that understanding that are I'm not so sure that my generation younger is really taking up those lessons and that that hurts me and I have we need to teach them you know I think the greatest threat that's proposed by the left is the undercutting of our values and our traditions and our history they see America as inherently flawed and they're wrong and as conservatives we do a better job countering those messages we need to do with optimism and strength and perseverance and inspiration so we lose that next generation our values and our freedom is lost forever and I took an oath to defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic that's changed a little bit I'm also defending it from over taxation and over regulation and over a federal overreach we're defending our borders defending our laws wait to defend the idea that we have to enforce our own laws now and as conservatives got to stand up for those policies those just common-sense good governance policies we don't want a giant government doing everything for us we don't always look to the federal government to solve every single problem it won't lower taxes we just got that thank you what lower regulations we're getting that the Congress has got to take back its role and overseeing the regulator's the unelected bureaucrats that the fourth branch of government is a threat and what do you expect you give people a mission you give them a job to give them a mission they're gonna try and complete it that's what I do it's not their fault it's the system we created for them in Congress advocating its role we got to stand up for free market policies that drive down our health care costs we're getting crushed you guys stand up for policies that that help fix the debt and tackle the main drivers of that debt that's gonna take courage because it's hard it's hard to take away entitlements we're not taking away we've got to fix them we got to make them last we got to stand up for securing the border we're on the frontlines in Texas nobody else in the country seems to realize that that's important to us here but how do you stand up for those values well in a word it's it's positivity it's a vision we forget sometimes what it means to have vision I have a pretty good idea different political side of that vision you know and we should talk about that and that does that's how you bring people to our side it's inspiration is passion it's showing love for one another and it's our vision I envision the country where we look out for each other we look out for our community we help each other just like we did it Harvey envisioned a place where our you know our taxes are well spent and they're accountable and we trust that our government is small and dynamic and worthwhile and I envision a place with the best educated hardest-working freest people on the planet we work hard and we know that our hard work and our education is gonna prepare us for the right challenges and get us up that ladder our vision is one of country it's a love of one another it's hard work it's self-sacrifice it's god it's red white and blue and it's America to the core damn it is patriotism we don't have to be afraid of that word anymore how do we get to that vision a word it's leadership we got to remember what leadership really means it's not Authority it is not just one vote out of 435 in the US House if you think that's all you deserve then it really doesn't matter who you vote for cuz you probably get the vote at least of my race everybody's conservative and a Conservatives gonna win I think second district deserves heck a lot more than that and you deserve a lion for your cause you deserve a champion for conservative values you deserve somebody is going to ensure that those values are carried on the next generation so that's why I'm here all right not because I'm a politician I mean I'm gonna be so everybody's gonna hate me now I'm not rich I can't self fund my campaign but I do care about Texas I care about representing us the way we need to be represented you got to give somebody put somebody Washington's you can be proud of that you know has got your back no matter what and that's why I'm here and I hope to make you proud and I hope to have your support [Applause] let me take something anybody would grab sacrifice like this man does I have great respect for but now I have admiration for it because I believe can be my leader after me then he earned that right to run most people that run for office like this I might be sure what their qualifications were as you earn this right and I'll take a story gets out [Applause]

how do we continue to serve because they are no longer here to serve for themselves what they did is who not who they were is who they are because they are still with us today that's why we have memorial day weekend every time you mention their names every time we think of them every time we talk about them they live in perpetuity they never die so how can we live our lives and start talking about a country to continue to honor their lives so that our country doesn't die either you see they died so that our country doesn't have to they die for our legacy that's what memorial day is about this place is special and i always say this these brave men and women when they pay the ultimate sacrifice they didn't do it for black people they didn't do it for white people did it for americans we took that oath to defend this country against all enemies both foreign and domestic there is no clause that specifies race says americans but the most important thing is the values that got us here based and predicated on sacrifice service one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all e pluribus unum out of many one that's this country and i implore everybody else to take a listen to this because we all bleed red that's it we are all americans in this country [Music]

Thank You mr. chairman I'm pleased that you're holding this hearing today and recognizing the important role that nuclear must play in our clean energy future without utilizing and growing our current nuclear energy capacity it's impossible for us to achieve significant emissions reductions we see it playing out in countries like Germany who are moving away from nuclear power - due to some advocacy from some of the environmental groups and subsequently we've seen emissions increase as this steady base load of power needed is being replaced by coal-fired plants the US has led the world in nuclear energy innovation but in recent decades we've started to cede that global leadership we've also become too dependent on imports of uranium to power our nuclear reactors reducing our energy security and increasing our dependence on supplies from untrue untrustworthy state actors like Russia to that end I am pleased that the Trump administration has proposed the creation of a domestic uranium reserve in the most recent budget proposal we must be doing more to encourage the development and deployment of advanced nuclear technologies mr. Levesque it's great to have you testifying in front of the committee this morning on behalf of Terra power we're proud to have you based in Washington State in your testimony you discuss how countries like Russia and China are actively supporting the development of advanced nuclear technologies by directly subsidizing state supported companies through this government support these these countries are better able to export their technology to other countries creating decades of dependence on Russia and China to meet their nuclear energy needs at the same time you state quote no other country has the capacity for innovation and the freedom to think innovatively like the United States and I couldn't agree more however I'm concerned that government red tape and intransigence is setting back our ability to fully realize the potential of our private-sector innovation especially when it comes exporting our technology to combat the spread of Chinese and Russian influence globally would you expand on the current state of global competitive competition in advanced nuclear reactor development and specifically how can we as policymakers ensure a regulatory framework that enables companies like Terra power to compete with state subsidized companies Thank You Carson Rogers and thanks for your support in Washington as always so I agree with all the points you made on the state of affairs with with Russia and China and earlier mr. Hopkins was describing the kind of economic benefits that those state-owned companies have as they pursue export projects but I do want to offer innovation and new technology as an opportunity for the United States because what you see around the world is other countries are doing quite well at copying our old technology okay in in Pennsylvania in the late 1950s congressman Doyle mentioned Shippingport was the demonstration reactor for light water reactors that once we proved that light water reactors could operate a commercial scale that led to a hundred reactors being built in the US and more than 400 built around the world based on us-born technology and that resulted in these hundred year relationships that American companies had with those countries and those companies so now as we look at new technology you can see other countries have copied our old stuff and are making incremental improvements to it innovation is really the American role we're good at it we're good at managing projects with diverse groups of experts I've worked on international projects and I know often times they call on the American project manager to put the teams together it happens to be something we're good at so we need to recognize that again because we're getting outnumbered greatly on gen3 plants something like 40 to 1 on new builds around the world and we're facing great challenges that miss Coors Nick mentioned keeping our gen two plants running because of the you know incorrect market forces but we need to recognize that advanced reactors and new technology are you know America's opportunity to regain nuclear leadership because we're using a specific on the regulatory front on the regulatory front I think we need to continue what we've started you know the NRC's mission is to protect people in the environment and we respect that and you know Congress passed NEMA the nuclear energy innovation and Modernization Act I think that was really important for empowering the NRC to change because without that congressional empowerment and direction to change you know they might not be you know free to act with all their stakeholders so I think it was very important that Congress passed NEMA and and I've seen we've had chairman svinicki and Commissioner Caputo at terraPower and meet with their senior management regularly I can tell the NRC is responding to that and so I think NEMA was it was a very good start that's great it's always inspiring to hear about American ingenuity nobody used me

Republican Congressman Tom emmer of Minnesota House Majority Whip for the 118th Congress great to have you in focus for the first time welcome Good To Be With You Harris well when you hear words like potential cover-up possible influence peddling scheme what's going on with Capitol Hill right now in terms of responding to this I think everybody's trying to figure this one out uh Harris I go back to last Thursday when the president made the comment there's no there there well since then we've got a ratcheting up of this thing where the Department of Justice is actually scouring his house for hours they're trying to make this look like it's different from other people who have classified documents this might be the worst case of a uh in the words of my colleague Mike Turner the serial uh classified document hoarder he's got documents now we know going back to his time in the Senate going back to his time as the vice president he's got him at Penn University he's got him in his uh home in Wilmington when is this going to end and the big question here is why does he have him why was he holding on to them and what were they being used for Harris well and that's particularly important when you consider that some of them were you know as old as his time in the Senate which in ended 15 years ago amen and I I just when they they try to tell you they're spinning this trying to tell the American public this is different from for instance uh the raid on former president Trump's home somehow this is different because of the cooperation that's going on I think you correctly pointed out when you started this segment today there is no cooperation this President is using every lever of government that he controls including the doj to try and uh control the release of these things and frankly this is why House Republicans uh and this new uh select committee on the weaponization of government the double standard is so important that we'd be able to do our job through Jamie Comer Jim Jordan and several others the American people Harris two-thirds of the American people want this investigative they want to know what President Biden was doing with these uh classified documents well look you said last Thursday the president said there's no there there the previous Thursday his press secretary Terry said that the searches were over he's using every lever as you say of government he's also using that microphone a lot and and some of this stuff just isn't true let's get to this this new batch of classified documents seems to be perhaps don't want to overblow it but perhaps building a bridge between some on the left and the right they're gathering around a single idea criticizing this President some Democrats here it's unbelievable how this could happen it's totally irresponsible it's to think that any of them ended up in in boxes uh in storage one place to the other is just unacceptable there needs to be this independent investigation an independent prosecutor other Democrats say they're not concerned about the Scandal I also don't think this is an issue that's keeping Americans up at night I think they're worried about much more day-to-day things like inflation prices at the pump prescription drug prices congressman whip you alluded to it let's show everybody new polling says otherwise after the most recent discovery more than 60 percent of Americans say they think Biden handled all the Unearthed classified documents and appropriately furthering what you said Congressman about the fact that they want to see someone get to the bottom of it they absolutely do and I you know I disagree with the senator you can go ahead and try to tell the American public that they shouldn't care about this at worst this is sloppy this is a a an oversight flouting of the law by someone who's been in government for 50 years uh it and it gets worse because it could be a severe severe problem with our national security Harris Americans do care about this and it needs we need to find out why it happened what it was being used for and more importantly who else had access to these documents yeah I mean look they were in a garage and the president said some of them you know were near his Corvette it you know locked up in the garage we saw pictures of his son that we Unearthed and showed everybody there's Biden Drive in the course of the uh the Stingray Corvette his son too I mean how many people even just had access to the garage and the documents there look I I mentioned before that that even getting the truth out of the White House and the press secretary may feel frustrating right now because it might not be happening but also I I wanted to bring this up if I'll ask my my team to put it back on the screen the New York Times is calling out the White House's silence on those classified documents mum was the word from their initial discovery on November 2nd to when the story broke months later January 9th here's a quote the decision to keep the discovery of classified documents secret from the public and even most of the White House staff for 68 days was driven by what turned out to be a feudal hope that the incident could be quietly disposed of without broader implications for Biden or his presidency Congressman your reaction it's just this double standard that is it's unnerving uh Harris again this is why we've got to have this select committee that investigates how government is being used to be weaponized against political adversaries you look at the two different ways this was handled Mar-A-Lago very public you have a uh you have a search warrant you've got cameras on this thing this one this one is handled where the American public don't even get to know and the White House wants to tell you that this President is cooperating from day one if he's cooperating why aren't we seeing everything remember the best antiseptic to corruption is sunlight why don't we open it all up and why don't you go get warrants instead of uh playing with the White House having them tell you where you can search when you can search who can be there why doesn't this uh Administration get treated like the last one and by the way like every other American on Main Street all across this country well that warrants part is really important important and you know last Quick one for you how much does this frustrate the president in terms of wanting to announce 2024 plans I I think he's I think this is a big deal for his 2024 plans and I I think they might have been in question anyway but certainly you've got Ron Clane leaving the White House you've got some my some disruption going on with the group around him you've got this uh this smells to high heaven with the constant drip drip drip of finding more of these after he tells us one week after another there's no there there apparently there's a lot there and we need to investigate and I think it will have an impact on 2024. a house majority whip Tom emmer with us today great to have you in focus for the first time thank you

today we're here because the democrats want to pass legislation that insults the intelligence of americans according to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle the only people sophisticated enough to enter into arbitration agreements are unions so they have exempted them from this bill convenient this legislation prohibits pre-dispute arbitration agreements which are fair efficient and effective way for consumers workers and businesses to settle disputes without costly and time-consuming litigation that mainly benefits the trial bar this bill will also deprive americans of an effective legal option while costing them more time and money pre-dispute arbitration agreements exist in many employment and consumer contracts today and are enforced like any other kind of contract arbitration is generally fair often leads to better outcomes for workers and does not keep claimants from simultaneously alerting the world to bad actors those agreements create a win-win situation for parties to con contract in advance on a process for resolving future disputes courts accordingly uphold and enforce lawful agreements to arbitrate when disputes arise between parties an approach consistent with the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract this policy of individuals being free to contract has arguably long been a feature of american law existing law also permits courts to invalidate agreements under generally applicable contract defenses such as fraud or duress some will argue that arbitration requires confidentiality this is not true the parties to the agreement always have a right to disclose details of the proceeding unless they have a separate confidentiality agreement nor does current law typically preclude a party from disclosing information obtained in the arbitration process or any resulting award arbitration is usually less expensive and faster than litigation the gentleman's time is expired 30 more seconds madam chairman i yield an additional minute arbitration is usually less expensive and faster than litigation it normally minimizes hostility is less disruptive ongoing future business dealings and is often more flexible this legislation does not favor the americans consumer the only ones favored are the unions and the trial bar this is not right for americans and i urge my colleagues to vote no on this unfair act thank you

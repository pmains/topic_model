I want to associate my Thank You mr. chairman I want to associate my questions with a follow-up to my colleague mr. Brown I too think it's incredibly important that we receive a briefing in a classified setting regarding the cyber threats to our naval ships but I want to ask you specifically how you mentioned that we are integrating cyber and network vulnerabilities as part of our ongoing investigation how is that happening specifically even if it is just to rule out cyber as a potential cause specifically Admiral gilda Vice Admiral Gill day at 10th fleet is their fleet Cyber Command he has a team that he's formed that will go there a team of experts I mean very very talented young men and women that will that are in place and will use their knowledge of how they would attack to determine whether we've been attacked and they'll don't know where to go look this is the first time we've done this and we're not stopping just we're this is to try to institutionalize doing cyber as part of any mishap aviation submarine you name it we need to go look at it as an order of business and not hand wave it to its cyber yes I I agree with that and that leads to my next question you mentioned that your institutionalizing this process this is the first time that cyber has been integrated is that service wide is that going to be a part of any future investigation absolutely can you describe other activities the Navy is institutionalizing like Task Force cyber awakening and cyber saved up our game when it comes to protecting our critical tactical platforms from cyber threats I'm sorry can you repeat the question sure what other activities is the Navy institutionalizing such as Task Force cyber awakening and cyber safe to increase our cyber security when it comes to protecting our tactical platforms yes great question so those efforts weren't started and completed we continue to work through several of the several of this discoveries during tests for cyber awakening for as an example one of the journeys that we're on right now that our CNO John Richardson has really brought forward is this notion of understanding all of the digital connections that are in that our resident within every system we have out there today and they're not connected as well and we are not able to operate them as effectively as we as we should that's also driving when you when you dive into it that deeply you also realize that there's a cyber component to trying to make the Navy more digitized because it we could become vulnerable more quickly unless you protect that that those digital databases and the ability to do analytics and those sorts of things so again when we come over to brief you on the classified level we will show you what we did with the money that Congress gave us at the end of this year in fiscal year 17 where we applied it to what defensive systems and protections that we needed to do and in some cases is fundamentally basic things like shifting to the new windows across the board where we're getting commercial protection that comes with that product as opposed to living off of older Windows versions on older gear that are very vulnerable without that protection sure it just to use that example there is a sense of urgency to this technology is changing if an example is making sure that you have the updated version of Windows we need to do better in terms of addressing this in the Department of Defense has mandated that across the services all of us are responding to this we have a deadline it's coming up and we're all I can only speak for the Navy but we are on track to meet that deadline on things as basic as what you just described thank you very much Admiral Moran and I yield back

welcome back musical fallen show great to have you with us uh mike johnson congressman mike johnson who's already re-elected uh nobody ran against him so mike doesn't have to go through all of rigmarole running another campaign i'm i know you tick of death about that but mike you know the president's out there with his rhetoric uh hating on minimum of half the people in this country calling us bad bad people and i i read a story we're not a democracy i wish he quit saying that democracy is always going to mob rule and marxism into communism eventually we're republic our former government's different where we have free speech in other words what we talked about earlier people have a right to go worship the devil if they want to but we have a right to stand up against it if we want to so but is it dangerous what the president's doing because he's really really calling people like you and me out in a big time way yeah they have a fundamental disunder a misunderstanding of what about what america is we're a constitutional republic of course we have democratic principles but this is not a democracy a democracy is two wolves and a lamb deciding what's for dinner as we always explain to our con law students you know i teach the constitution to undergrads and i'm i'm constantly amazed at how little they know because they're being indoctrinated into this uh you know into this other kind of language and the democrats do it all the time every single speech that nancy pelosi gives you know she she talks about our democracy our democracy you got to have an accurate understanding of history but look here's joe biden right the the divider in chief now um he has taken it upon himself to call out and demonize about half the country right uh we're all fascists and extremists because we won't go along with his radical left socialist agenda i mean it's really just an amazing thing you know he stood in front of uh independence hall in philadelphia you know a couple days ago with those red lights that looked demonic itself and and uh and i mean it was like an angry rant from an old man get off my lawn you know like that is not what a president is supposed to do and you know i guess to i guess it's a political play i mean maybe they think they're going to gin up the base for the uh the election in november but i don't think it's going to work and we learned a long time ago when we were in elementary school when somebody starts calling you names it means they don't have a good argument and that's what the president's done here it's it's it's patently clear for everybody to see but mike i want i i'd like to know uh what i'm doing wrong i i got up this morning uh i i i cleaned up brushed my teeth okay got dressed fed my daughter got a medicine uh came to work i work hard today to go home but go home i might cook might not depend on what we got at the house make sure my daughter talk to my wife i mean what am i doing wrong here i mean i'm gonna put a little bit of money back for savings put a little bit of money back in case one day the lord lets me retire uh i'm not picking on anybody i'm not i'm not i'm not going after anybody i'm not going after anybody personally i'm not doing any of that stuff so i mean what am i doing wrong i mean i'm not gonna i'm not gonna ever give in to their marxism never i'm never gonna give in to it and uh the global climate change which i think is a bigger line in face mass and so i'm the bad guy now because i have a disagreement with the president does i'm a bad person all of a sudden well no more more than that you're a fascist and an extremist i mean that that's that's what he's labeled you because moon i i know you well and i know that you you you actually don't like uh you know high gas prices and record inflation and surging crime rates so if if you have a differing idea then what his policies have yielded you know in his mind you're an enemy you know like i mean if you want stable gas prices and affordable in you know energy and you want a border that's secure and you know you you don't want 87 000 irs agents uh coming to harass middle class taxpayers or small business owners and you know you you want uh some stability and you want to meet our recruitment uh uh goals for the military et cetera well you must be an extremist because i mean that's effectively what he told us in his speech and look i think this is going to backfire pretty fantastically whatever their objective here is i don't think it's being met i think it's having the opposite effect and you know i'm out moving around the country moving around the state i'm talking to voters and people they are they are very very upset with what the they see coming from washington and the trajectory of the country and they're desperate for change and i think we're going to get it on november 8th yeah i guess the reason he does a speech and calling people out has got to be to try to build up the base because you know in the off-year elections the president really suffers and in a real world where the media was doing their job first of all they never won an election but number two is they would get demolished this time i don't know if they get demolished they ought to get demolished they deserve everything they get well that's exactly right and it's a distraction because they don't want people to pay attention to the issues and to their obvious record he can't run on his record he can't stand up there and say one positive good thing he's done for the country so he's got to call out the other side and i mean i don't think that strategy is going to work i i i think we're going to have a red wave and i i i'm still optimistic we can win the senate it'll be narrow but we're definitely going to win the house and i think we still have a great shot at the senate so we'll see i mean a lot can happen in the next 60 days or so but um you know i think the country's had enough of this yeah and i hope it is because as i tell people people that vote democrat they really are the ones that have to wake up and see what their own party's doing to them they have to realize what's coming they will be in a bad situation as well even though they fussing at us they're going to be in a bad situation as well anyway mike johnson congressman mike johnson sixth congressional did thanks mike we'll do it again soon you go buddy all right

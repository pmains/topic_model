this morning oral arguments began at the supreme court for a case that many expect could overturn roe v wade despite nearly 50 years of court precedent and overwhelming public support for abortion rights roe and access to reproductive health care hangs in the balance this issue is deeply personal to the women that i represent in new hampshire and the last thing they want to see is a politician or a judge taking away their bodily autonomy we are better off as a country with roe as the law of the land it supports the health and economic well-being of women and families still we know that legislatures and governors from mississippi to texas to new hampshire are enacting extreme laws that punish doctors and take away women's rights this must be stopped that's why regardless of what happens in this case it's essential that the senate joins the house in passing the women's health protection act my constituents and the american people want abortion to be safe legal and accessible this legislation will uphold that concept for the country even if the court abandons it thank you and i yield back

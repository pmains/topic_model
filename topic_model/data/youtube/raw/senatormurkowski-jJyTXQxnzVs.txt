Mr President I have I've come to the floor for a few moments this afternoon to to recognize a woman of great distinction a woman of Valor a Woman by the name of Elizabeth paratrovich who championed civil rights for all alaskans um February 16th in Alaska is is a significant day it is a day that the state of Alaska recognizes and observes Elizabeth paratrovic day we have designated this day as early as 1988 but it is a time for us as alaskans to reflect on the contributions of a pretty extraordinary native woman a clinkit woman um and so I think it is important I've had an opportunity over the years to speak about Elizabeth paratrovich Senator Sullivan and I Advanced a resolution recognizing Elizabeth patrovich's contributions when it comes to to civil rights and I think it's always important and timely to uh to pay attention to reflect on the legacies of those who have really worked to advance a more inclusive society and a more representative democracy Elizabeth paratrovic she carried the clinket name clock Ruth up I'm attempting to do that uh well but certainly with respect to honor her name she was of the Luca Cudi Clan she was born on Independence Day I think that's pretty fitting born on Independence Day in Petersburg Alaska in 1911. it was just right after that right after the period that Elizabeth was born in Petersburg that a group of Native people from across Southeast Alaska formed an organization called the Alaska native Brotherhood A and B two years later the Alaska native Sisterhood was formed and as these are considered the oldest indigenous civil rights organizations in the world coming out of of Southeastern Alaska A and B and ANS sought to advance equal opportunities for education for employment housing and they fought to secure native civil rights so Elizabeth paratrovich and her husband Roy became active in in A and B and ANS in the in the 40s they moved to Juno or state's capital in 1941. and that their personal accounts of the Discrimination that they encountered in in Juneau as Alaska natives you read the accounts you read the stories and it truly parallels the Jim Crow practices of the South but rather than be diminished rather than be deterred Elizabeth and Roy parachovich were were Advocates Advocates against the adversity that they saw in their own communities and it was through their work with A and B and A and S that they began advocating for an anti-discrimination bill in the territorial legislature and they pointed out the simple fact that Alaska natives were paying taxes for a public school system the same public school system that excluded their very own children they pointed out that Alaska native men were fighting in World War II and then when they returned from the war those Alaska native veterans were denied rights that others enjoyed these these very real very immediate confrontations with discrimination drove their pursuit of equal rights for people all across the state of Alaska so they worked on this anti-discrimination bill that was advancing through the legislature it took a period of time it was reintroduced in 1945. and in 1945 the measure passed the Alaska state house moved on to the state senate and the the debate on the senate floor was apparently quite animated and um vocal throughout but there was a territorial senator who denounced the efforts to desegregate and he argued and the words that he quoted are ones that as alaskans we we see we see this story told a lot he said who are these people barely out of savagery who want to associate with us whites with 5 000 years of recorded civilization behind us that's what he said on the senate floor at the end of the the floor debate at that time it was not unusual to to open up for comments from those who might be part of the public I served in the Alaska state legislature and we have galleries that sit directly behind the the chambers that are open to the chambers and Elizabeth pratavich was sitting in the gallery listening to this extended uh and very offensive debate quite honestly but she Rose and she said quote I would not have expected that I who am barely out of savagery would have to remind gentlemen with 5 000 years of recorded civilization behind them of our Bill of Rights she stood gracefully she stood firmly she refuted clearly and when asked if she thought that the bill would eliminate discrimination so again pretty interesting exchange between members of the Senate and a member of the public in the gallery and not not just a member of the public in the gallery but a native woman speaking up and challenging forcefully and calmly but with a determination and a resolve and when she was asked if she thought the bill would eliminate discrimination she replied do your laws against larceny and even murder prevent those crimes no laws will eliminate crimes but at least you as legislators can assert to the world that you recognize the evil of the present situation and you speak your intent to help us overcome discrimination pretty powerful reminder and there was a long period of Silence after her remarks and then a wave of Applause went through the gallery and through the senate floor including from some who had previously opposed the bill Alaska's Governor at the time Ernest Greening was the one to sign the anti-discrimination law the nation's first anti-discrimination law signed it into law on February 16 1945. this was almost two decades before the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. it's pretty significant when you think about the contributions that this woman Elizabeth peratovic her husband Roy puratovich other Alaska native leaders at a time at a time when discrimination was rampant throughout our country but they had the courage and the strength and the determination to stand up for what is right she is an inspiration because she set the example that when you see Injustice you speak out you take action and she also provided a great example for why we need to listen to the perspective of all voices especially especially those who have been left out or left behind Elizabeth peretovich is as I mentioned recognized in Alaska on this day she has also been recognized nationally in 2020 the U.S mint released these one dollar coins commemorating Elizabeth pratavich 2020 was the 75th anniversary of when the anti-discrimination law for 1945 became law in our state so on the one side of the coin it features the per the portrait of Elizabeth the name of the legislation that she advocated for and the symbol of the clinket Raven moiety of which she was a member so it is indeed a significant reminder to each of us Alaskan and non-alaskan I think Elizabeth paratrovich day is also a timely reminder for those of us who serve here in the Senate it may not it may not be easy to take on some of these complicated issues especially when partisanship is polls pulling members back to their corners but we know we can make good progress we've done it we certainly did it with the violence against women reauthorization we need to follow a process that allows us to get something done as opposed to Simply sending messages so as Alaska celebrates Elizabeth pratavich day I would hope the Senate would look to her Legacy her example as an inspiration as we seek Unity as we follow her example of treating fellow citizens with respect Mr President I thank you and I yield the floor

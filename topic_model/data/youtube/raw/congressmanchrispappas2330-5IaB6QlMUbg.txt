  NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEMAN FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE IS  RECOGNIZED FOR TWO MINUTES. MR. PAPPAS: THANK YOU, MADAM  SPEAKER.

AS PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID OF  THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED, AS WE  EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE, WE MUST  NEVER FORGET THAT THE HIGHEST  APPRECIATION IS NOT TO UTTER  WORDS BUT TO LIVE BY THEM. LET'S SHOW OUR VETERANS OUR  GRATITUDE BY ADDRESSING HOUSING  INSECURITY IN PASSING THIS

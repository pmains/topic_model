now is republican congressman adam kinzinger he is a member of the january 6th committee congressman thank you so much for being with us you are a freshly censured congressman how does that feel this morning what is this like my baker's dozen of of censures now from between local parties and and now the national it feels great um you know actually it makes me pretty sad because i think it says a lot for the party and it says a lot to call january 6 legitimate political discourse but you know it's actually just made me even double down on my intensity to get to the bottom of this because that's really frightening when you know half of the in theory half of the country's party is focused on complete denial of truth you say it says a lot about the party what does it say well i think it says that they are completely unmoored from truth i think it shows that they have pledge allegiance to one man over any kind of principle and they can call that like loyalty they call that conservatism conservatism is no longer about what you actually believe it's about how intensely you're loyal to donald trump a rhino now a republican a name only as somebody who maybe actually holds to real conservatism and not to donald trump i think it shows that this party is not committed to the rule of law despite what they say it's not committed to democratic principles small d to get uh you know to one vote one you know counts and whoever gets the most votes wins it's pretty frightening and to see you know the chair of the rnc ronna mcdaniel stand up and try to now recover and say oh we only legitimate political discourse with non-violence well that's insane because we would not be having a january 6 committee that i'm being condemned for if it was all non-violent i mean nobody denies your first amendment right to have an opinion we do deny your ability to break destroy and try to overthrow an election guys like marco rubio senator rubio from florida he called he calls the committee a partisan scam what else did he say he said you're trying to embarrass and smear and harass as many republicans as you can get your hands on on the committee what do you say to that look i don't know what's happening marco i mean i you know when he ran in 2016 i was a jeb supporter and and went to marco after jeb because i look and i go marco was talking about a strong america you know he was kind of representing this next generation potentially republicans and he's just he's gone all in now on this kind of big lie or sometimes he'll walk the walk the line a little bit look the january 6 committee let's keep in mind how we got here kevin mccarthy asked john calco to to negotiate a non-partisan fair commission he did that and then all of a sudden mccarthy turned against it it was rejected it passed the house rejected in the senate and then he put forward members to sit on this committee of which some you know had deep involvement in january 6. one or two of those members were rejected and kevin pulled all his members out instead of naming two others and so that's how we got to this position and in that process we have republicans and democrats now getting to fair answers um we're not out to to get anybody we're not out to embarrass anybody we're out to get to the truth if the truth embarrasses somebody i can't help that but our job is to give a full accountability to the american people cnn reported on friday that congressman jim jordan among the records you now have are that he had a 10-minute phone conversation with donald trump the morning of january 6. what does that tell you so i won't comment directly on that i'll i'll wait for the committee to put out any details that do or don't exist but i think what you know something like that in theory would show uh and particularly what we're interested in is what was the president doing that day and leading up to that day what did the president think january 6 was what was he doing during it um i think the question is if this was a spontaneous act of violence of people that took the president literally and he was only speaking metaphorically as i think he recently said hey mike pence was just metaphoric and not real um you know that's one thing but if in fact the president knew that there was a potential for violence that actually is something the doj might be interested in because it would show that he would be maybe have some criminal culpability at that moment i don't have the answer to that i'm not sitting here saying we know that but i think those are some kind of things we're interested in the bottom line on this john is you know i just had a kid three weeks ago when he's 5 or 10 and learning about history i want to make sure that he gets a full accounting of what happened on january 6 and i want to make sure that every republican member of congress when their kids and grandkids are in school they're going to look and be like hey mom or dad or grandma grandpa how did you vote on january 6th this would be something i think in 5 or 10 years is going to be hard to explain if you're not on the side of truth well first of all congratulations second of all what will you tell christian when he's old enough how will what will you tell christian about donald trump i'm going to tell him he was the worst president the united he was a star and he was a man with a more fragile ego than anybody i've ever met which the irony of it is he walks around like the tough guy but he's the one that gets more offended and wounded and sad than anybody i know i'm also going to tell him that it was the moment that i hope america hit the bottom of you know its slide towards authoritarianism and the moment we woke up i hope he's proud of what i've done i'm confident he will be because you know short of this thing really going off the rails this thing being our country in this experiment i think we're going to look back and say wow that was a moment we might have flown too close to the sun and we can never do that again that's my hope and prayer because if not we're in real trouble you say you hope we've those rewards hit bottom the republicans could gain control of the house of representatives kevin mccarthy could be speaker what will he be like as speaker well he'll be well i'll tell you what he will have a high cell phone bill uh because he'll be calling marjorie taylor green and you know people like that to ask them what their opinion is and what he can and can't do uh he will have no leadership ability because he is basically begging the people that just two years ago he said was crazy were crazy he's begging them for the ability to lead so i think it's going to be a miserable experience for him if he actually wins i'm not convinced he will be speaker but if he is speaker i think it will end up being one of the most miserable things he's ever been through so yeah he'll have the title uh but if he thinks there's a point at which he can kind of stand up and take back power from folks like marjorie taylor green and the crazy i just don't see it gonna see it's gonna happen the american people will react by throwing them out of power so you issued a tweet about josh hawley senator from missouri and i want to ask you a couple things about it i think you were responding to holly talking about ukraine and the fact that the united states should you withdraw any guarantees about ukraine being able to join nato long-term and you wrote i hate to be so personal but holly is one of the worst human beings and a self-aggrandizing con artist when trump goes down i certainly hope this evil will be laid in the open for all us to see and be ashamed of i actually want to like break this into parts if i can and take the second part first when you say when trump goes down what do you mean by that well that's not based on anything on the committee although uh i'm convinced that when the full story is out and uh and history kind of moves on donald trump is going to be just seen as a really a sad character in history and uh and i'm still confident that all this information is going to be out there for the american people so i i have a a strong sense of confidence that all the lies all the conspiracies and all that garbage will be fully exposed for the american people to detest and so i think trump is going down i don't know what form that's going to take but i certainly don't think he's going to be the king of much more than mar-a-lago uh and you say and you say that just to be clear this is a somewhat informed statement you've seen things that we haven't seen right right yeah yeah absolutely and i i mean look what what we know even anecdotally guys gleefully watching television while the you know the capitals being ransacked at least that's kind of what we've heard second and third hand i mean that's no good president in the united states and and that's a man that you know really doesn't have the best interest in the u.s at heart and i'll say too with josh hawley let's keep in mind and i try not to get so personal but that was a moment in which he was parodying tucker carlson's talking points on ukraine because he wants to get in the good graces of tucker carlson josh hawley and keep in mind the whole reason january 6 went down there was no senator that was going to even ted cruz for goodness sakes no senator was going to object to these states on january 6 until josh hawley said something and the second he did then all these other senators jumped on board but he was the very first so if we pinpoint january 6 if we pinpoint you know all these lies he is at the helm of it and i don't mean to overplay his importance because i don't think he's important but i also look at that and go that is he is endemic of what is wrong with this party um i just want to ask you very quickly because i want you to leave with a smile on your face how do you like being a dad it's great i don't get as much sleep but it's awesome i always thought you know the baby stage would be tough and i love the baby stage so that's great well don't expect any sleep in another two or three years but good luck congressman adam kinzinger thank you for being with us this morning

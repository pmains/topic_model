uh attorney general barr you just told us that nothing was ever elevated to me you had said in an interview recently that there's a process in place an escalation system it's the ag's responsibility to resolve it how is this elevated to you the case of roger stone uh on monday february 10 the u.s attorney was with me and he raised the issue with me so it was validated by timothy and um had it been elevated uh during the two months between the time the conviction came in under the former u.s attorney and uh and the time that timothy shea started i i think shane may have had conversations with people in there did you ever have conversations with a former us attorney about this case about the sentence i i don't recall any discussion about stone right so timothy shea you said in the interview that he was new you just started um he's he was new but he worked for you for a long time didn't he yes was his job for you well when i was attorney general 30 years ago he worked no no no just just now he was he was on my staff he advised you on on criminal justice policy in law enforcement right correct and you act you named him acting u.s attorney had you discussed the stone case with him before you named him acting u.s attorney no did you discuss sentencing with him not before the first time was when he came in it wasn't monday actually just to refresh your recollection in a prior interview you said he came in the week before he came in to see some senior staff that's right no that's what i said he may have he may have had discussions with people in the deputy's office i was not involved in those discussions basically i didn't uh as far as i can require no substantive involvement in stone until that monday when he came in in the morning well the i'm sorry mr general the week before when he came in to see the the senior staff that he had worked with the week before when he was working on i said i said i think he had raised it with people in the deputy's office that's senior staff too right i understand but i was not involved he started on he started on july 31st the first week he was there he came to raise this issue i think he started february 1st right the first week he was there he came into your office to raise the issue of sentencing in the interview you did with abc you said you know i don't think he he came that's why you that's what you told abc news you said that he's talked to senior staff not you perhaps but he talked to senior staff that i don't know you know i think i speak english i said that before he came in to see me i believe he had some conversation conversation with the senior staff right that's right before he came to see you we're saying the same thing but the first it was raised with me was on monday did you talk to the senior staff after they spoke with him i think at a nine o'clock meeting uh they said that uh he was trying to work something out on sentencing and he was actually optimistic that something could be worked out so i didn't think of it as an issue until that monday when he told me that right so then prosecutors so then he fi so then they filed he filed the sentencing uh memo and the sentencing memo called for seven to nine years it's the policy of the us attorney's office to suggest a specific guideline range which um which they did and then you overrule the line prosecutors they asked for a lower sentence and you gave some reasons you talked about health health is to be considered only for an extraordinary physical impairment did that apply to roger stone mr attorney general that's what the guideline said that's well actually i i can't you know i can't reveal all the information i'm not asking what his health was but did that apply no okay and did it and sorry his health is health is a reason i know is that the is that the reason for roger stone you're asking for a lower sentence let me go on it says let me go on hold on one second age can be consideration it says only if it creates conditions that are of an unusual degree and distinguish the case from typical cases he was 67 to that judge agreed with me congressman no that's not the judge's agreement i'm not asking you that the judge agreed i'm not asking whether i know you're not i'm not asking you that and the issue here is the issue here is whether roger stone was treated differently because he was friends with the president when you asked that when you asked to reduce the sense you said enhancements were technically applicable mr attorney general can you think of any other cases where the defendant threatened to kill a witness threatened to threaten the judge lied to a judge where the department of justice claimed that those were mere technicalities can you think of even one the judge agreed with our can you think of even one i'm not asking about the judge i'm asking about what you did to reduce the sentence of of roger stone yes can you think mr attorney general he threatened the life of a witness and the witness can i have just a few seconds to answer that i'm asking if there's another time in this case the judgment the judge agreed with our answer my and it's unfortunate and it the appearance is that as you said earlier this is exactly what you want the essence of rule of law is that we have one rule for everybody and we don't in this case because he's a friend of the president i yield back damon goes back mr uh miss roby

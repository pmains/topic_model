E GENTLEWOMAN FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE, MEMBER OF THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE, MS. KUSTER. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE IS RECOGNIZED. MS. KUSTER: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 7666, THE RESTORING HOPE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING ACT OF 2022. IT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE URGENT TO PASS THIS COMPETITIVE -- COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION THAT WILL HELP DELIVER ESSENTIAL MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND SUPPORT TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AMERICANS CONTINUE TO LOSE LOVED ONES TO ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH STRUGGLES EVERY DAY. 2021 MARKED THE DEADLIEST YEAR YET WITH NEARLY 108,000 OVERDOSE DEATHS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. UNTIL NASHUA, IN MY DISTRICT, THE RATE OF FATAL OVERDOSES DOUBLED FROM MARCH TO APRIL JUST THIS YEAR. AND IT'S ON TRACK TO REACH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF OPIOID DEATHS SINCE THE EPIDEMIC BEGAN. WE CANNOT WAIT ANOTHER DAY TO PASS THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION. AS FOUNDER AND CO-CHAIR OF THE BIPARTISAN ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH TASK FORCE, I'M PLEASED TO SEE THE RESTORING HOPE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING ACT INCLUDE MANY OF THE BILLS FROM OUR TASK FORCE AGENDA. BILLS LIKE THE MAINSTREAMING ADDICTION TREATMENT ACT TO REMOVE OUTDATED BARRIERS THAT PREVENT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FROM PRESCRIBING ESSENTIAL TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. I'M ALSO PLEASED TO SEE THE RESTORING HOPE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING ACT INCLUDE THE KIDS CARE ACT. LEGISLATION I INTRODUCED WITH CONGRESSMAN HUDSON TO IMPROVE MEDICAID IN SCHOOLS AND PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS FOR JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH. IMPORTANTLY, H.R. 7666 ADDRESSES MANY OF THE UNMET NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES FROM BOLSTERING GRANTS FOR DEPRESSION SCREENING AND SUICIDE PREVENTION, TO STRENGTHENING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORK FORCE. I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT RESPONDS TO THE URGENCY OF TODAY'S CRISIS AND WILL IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CARE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. I THANK CHAIRMAN PALLONE AND HIS STAFF FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL AND THE SPEAKER FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS LEGISLATION. I URG

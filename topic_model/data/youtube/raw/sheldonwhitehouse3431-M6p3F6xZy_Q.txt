I just want to say a word about smaller coastal communities and the infrastructure needs that they have I know Utah's not very coastal and even Sacramento wasn't very coast not yet but yeah exactly we're working on it our problem in Rhode Island is a by the time Sacramento gets coastal there's a hell about less of Rhode Island we don't want we don't want that to happen but we've got in my state about 10 to 11 inches of sea-level rise since the hurricane of 1938 the really monster storm that hit us back then so not only do you stack up that extra sea level for the next big one but it's not that way just along the shore it's also that way all the way out to sea so when you're dealing with storm surge you've got that whole higher heap of ocean out there that is now surging ashore people aren't very expert yet on how you correlate additional sea level rise to storm surge you know it's a least that 10 to 11 inches could be a lot more so we have communities who are facing this problem we've got communities where in a storm you've got to figure out where you pre deploy a fire truck senator gillibrand was here one of her neighborhoods burned in New York because of a fire and the fire trucks were separated by a flooded area if that happens it's a terrible thing for folks so there's this whole new planning for increased sea level risk storm risk that coastal communities are facing and people are starting to get on their case Moody's is starting to judge their municipal bonds based on sea level rise storm surge kind of risks and how ready they are for that they're looking at Freddie Mac is warning of a property values collapse in coastal areas which would have a terrible effect obvious on the tax base of those smaller communities so there's a warning coming from Freddie Mac along with the warning from Moody's and if they turn for help to FEMA and try to figure out from FEMA maps what this risk looks like they're being misled because our experience has been that FEMA maps are spectacularly wrong we've had to do state level and local work in Rhode Island to do the coastal mapping mr. chairman because FEMA is unreliable as a partner in terms of the accuracy of its mapping and it's not just Rhode Island when the big hurricane hit Houston there was a 50 percent error between what FEMA predicted in terms of flooding and what flooding actually took place so if you're in a coastal community you've got your municipal bond people looking at you with a Glinda eye saying what's up are you ready for this you've got Freddie Mac saying by the way these property values you depend on to pay for you misspell you might collapse so there's not gonna be a whole lot of money there's not just a lot of money pouring in the mapping that you have to rely on to make these plans is not reliable and there you are as a town manager trying to figure out how the hell do I handle this so I love the conversation that we're having about infrastructure I'm all for very big investments in infrastructure but before you do the infrastructure you got to have the plan so that the community can get it right and I think we have a big gap right now in helping particularly coastal communities plan for this it may be that the weird temperature considerations that you're facing that you described in Sacramento mr. Corliss are a similar kind of analogy something new that small communities have to have to deal with I know that Phoenix Arizona for instance is having to and Charlie figure out how it redoes its emergency response staffing because it gets so hot for so long there that people can't work out of doors in that heat and if you're a firefighter you can't decide to work indoors that day you got to go where the fire is so they got to wholly redo how they staff and they've got to have a whole extra team for cool people down and it changes the way they work the airport had to be closed because the tarmac was melting and the air was too thin for jets so there are all these problems that emerge and it's really hard for local communities faced with these problems to think their way through them with no support in a you know very constrained municipal budgetary environment so any way in which you all working on this can help keep your focus on this and your attention on this I think it's really really important just going back and rebuilding in place what we already built is probably not gonna work we've got to understand how dramatically the climate is changing and if we're gonna build 30 40 50 year projects we got to be planning for the full life cycle of those projects so my time is out and I just urge you to think about that as we work forward infrastructure is great but these peculiar and changing conditions that are driven by climate change and carbon emissions absolutely need to be taken into account and we're leaving small communities stranded without the support to help them work through a lot of new science and a lot of new engineering well

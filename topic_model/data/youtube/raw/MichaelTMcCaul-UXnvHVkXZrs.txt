city of the house mr. mcauliffe Texas gentleman from Texas is recognized for two minutes and speaker let me thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for his hard work and chairwoman kay Granger for heading up this task force that I was honored to be apart there's a chairman Homeland Security in a former federal prosecutor who's dealt with the border for many years I've never seen a crisis quite like this one this crisis demands action and it demands leadership and it demands a solution to the problem since the president enacted Dhaka in 2012 we've seen 60,000 unaccompanied children cross into the border in the Rio Grande Valley sector in Texas alone 250 per day and we went down there to see these children these children's are the victims caught between the administration's policies and the coyotes and the traffickers who exploit them and make money between five to ten thousand dollars apiece I madam speaker this bill fixes that crisis first and foremost it changes the 2008 trafficking law as a message of deterrence this crisis will not stop until we start sending them back and all this does is it treats Central Americans the same way we treat Mexicans it will provide for swift removal in a humane way back to their countries of origin and it's unfortunate that the administration while initially supportive has now flip-flopped on that issue it also provides for the detention removal and repatriation of these children for me in my home state of Texas importantly it calls for the deployment of the National Guard to the southwest border to secure our border my governor Governor Perry has already activated the National Guard but it is a federal government's responsibility under the Constitution to pick up that price tag and that's precisely what this bill does and finally madam Speaker I think importantly direct the Southern Command our military to help secure the between Guatemala and Mexico which I believe I know the chairman of appropriations as well please is a key to stopping the flow out of Central America madam Speaker the time to act is now and with that I yield back the gentleman's time has expired the gel

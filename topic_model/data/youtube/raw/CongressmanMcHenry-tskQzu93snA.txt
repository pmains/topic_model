congressman patrick mchenry republican from north carolina congressman you've been at the hearing thank you so much for being with us i do not know if you heard the news while you were in the hearing we just got a remarkably good piece of news on ebola here in the united states from the national institutes of health that nurse nina pham has now been declared ebola-free and she's being discharged there has been a remarkable streak of success in dealing with some of these all of these ebola patients in the united states except for the first one thomas eric duncan does this rate of success to you indicate that the united states has turned a corner and is now treating this in a satisfactory way well in terms of getting sick patients here in the united states and taking care of them we have the best health care system in the world for all of its faults and failures and so our success rate is uh been very good you're exactly right about that the concern that we have the reason why we had the hearing today is we wanted to make sure the government has a coordinated response uh on the international front as well to make sure that the american citizens uh and our military men and women that are in harm's way are protected the hearing today did not tell me that the government's doing a good job of coordinating that response though if we do take care of these patients we will get a good good result from it that is clear but it's the policies and procedures that we want to make sure are in place to make sure that our department defense personnel uh the men and women our health care front lines of our health care delivery system are protected and we didn't get good answers today unfortunately all right so you're talking about part of what you're talking about is what will happen largely in these west african nations when hundreds thousands of u.s personnel are there does it give you confidence though based on what you are seeing here that these cases are being isolated when they come up and it is not spreading here in the united states anymore and does that not perhaps give you confidence about what might happen when these troops go overseas i guess i'm asking what more do you want to see well what i'd like to see is uh well what we've seen with the cdc is uh nine different uh protocols uh nine different changes uh in recent months on how to deal with uh an ebola uh somebody who's been in an ebola affected region what we want to see is uh is solid protocols uh for individuals that are coming home from these from this region right now the the standard the science tells us a 21 day isolation period is the best way to go our government has said a 10-day isolation period is is what they they want to see the doctor we saw yesterday came up with signs of ebola on the 11th day so what i'd like to see is the government actually get get moved forward with sound science have the protocols in place to make sure that those that could potentially be exposed to ebola are separated from the population so this doesn't spread so we don't have any more patients that's what i'd like to see there does seem to be some discussion of creating a protocol for people returning to the united states where they might self-quarantine or at least restrict their movements it shouldn't be a self it shouldn't be a self quarantine this should isolate this yes i i think there shouldn't be uh sort of self reporting of this i think we need to have solid policies and procedures so the american public have have confidence in their government and confidence that we're not going to expose people needlessly to what is an absolutely horrifying disease all right congressman patrick mchenry thank you so much for being with us there's a news conference the national institutes of

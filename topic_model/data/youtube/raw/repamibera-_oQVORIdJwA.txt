Thank You mr. chairman you know as a scientist and a physician I agree you gather the facts and you take those facts and you make a decision I don't think anyone disputes that both NASA and NOAA look at 2015 as the hottest year on record I don't think anyone to streets you know that that the back climate does change I mean in my home state of California we've gone through several years of devastating droughts loss of the snowpack I'm grateful that we're getting a lot of snow and you know we're getting that snowpack and we're getting a lot of rain in El Nino but climate does fluctuate and it changes so I think we can agree on that as well yeah we do if we look at extremes of climate we're having more extremes of climate if we take the fact that you know look at our poles on North Pole Antarctica you know we're seeing more glacial melt off and you know more extremes of melt so those are the facts and we should accept those facts we can debate what's causing this and we certainly should have that robust debate but based on those I think many of us take these as just objective facts of what's happening we're seeing you know in my colleague congressman Derek Kilmer's district you know Native American tribes that have lived on coastal plains for thousands of yours are now subject to chronic flooding and having to move to high ground so again we can take those facts this body then has to debate what can we do to help move us forward you dr. Steere if I think about it it can't just be one country moving forward because we're talking about a global climate the reason why you have to act as an international community as setting targets and again I think what I was pleasantly surprised about at the Paris Accords is you know some of the the countries that we have the most concern about countries like India who I think many of us thought could really undermine the Paris Accords really stepped up to the plate I mean and this is a country that will be making massive investments in energy you know the 300 million Indians have no reliable electrical source there is a real opportunity to come up with innovative electrical sources in a very different way using alternative and renewable energies and you know I guess dr. steer as we look at this you've already indicated corporate America gets the economic opportunity here many of us get the job creation opportunity here and what would you say if you know the next concrete steps and and also what the facts are well thank you congressman Bera I agree very much with you look no individual country operating on its own can can address this problem global problems require international cooperation that's been massively lacking for the last quarter century and what we've seen in the last year actually is potentially the emergence of a new multilateralism and it's a multilateralism led by the United States because the United States including the George W Bush administration and the current administration have said look we are not going to put ourselves under some global treaty we are going to have a situation where we are going to pledge we're going to be transparent and something very dynamic is going to happen and it's going to happen because costs are falling and because signals will be given to the private sector and what we have now in the Paris deal is precisely that is actually a very modern type of a deal because it's not based upon sending you to prison or or or already sending you a requirement to pay something if you don't deliver it's rather saying look we gotta move in in a certain direction every year that passes costs are falling and that's why Prime Minister Modi ax you know as you say he came into power he didn't come in you know committed to the environment he came in to promote economic growth he looked at his solar targets which were which were 20 gigawatts by 2022 and he said let's quintuple them to a hundred why did he do that wasn't because he you know wanted to look good on the international stage he actually did it because he wanted to promote a new industry he wanted the notion that there were factories are going to be built and that's exactly what he's going to do and that's why China is spending 120 billion on renewable energy last year something is going on out there that is that is going to lead to an upward racket because the economics make sense and if we want to be smart and worth looking at 21st century industry I want our companies to be creating those new energy sources I want our company to our companies to lead solar and when the thousands of jobs that are going to be created and again let's be smart about this and let's win this and this is smart business it's smart investment and it does protect our planet for the next generation it's the right thing to do so thank you I you back Thank You mr. bear

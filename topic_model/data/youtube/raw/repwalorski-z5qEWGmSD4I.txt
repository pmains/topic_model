down a lady with that let me recognize the gentlelady from Indiana mr. pilarsky to inquire Thank You mr. chairman and I just wanted to add I'm excited and I think this has been an incredible panel today I thank all of you for coming for what you've shared and I'm excited and looking for a bipartisan solution that we can actually come to the American people and solve this with working together and I think that's very possible and dr. Miller I just wanted to thank you for bringing up that issue of the patent thickets I was gonna bring this up and you did right before the break the issue where a company claims any kind of number of patents on a drug to use it to stop competition from coming into the market I was gonna bring that up I just wanted to say thanks for doing that because there's a drug that I have been familiar with in our district and it's called Revlimid I don't know if you ever heard of it you're all shaking your heads that you have and you know just to add I guess how devastating and into your story ma'am and I'm devastating when you're in need you find yourself in need then you find yourself not being able to afford what is out there because of these patent thickets that are walls behind walls behind walls that never bring these drug costs down but only increase them and in this case I've learnt Revlimid it was in the market in 2016 at sixty-one hundred and ninety five dollars per month now it costs over 16 thousand dollars per month not to either we're tolerable but just as an example of what happens when things increase behind all these walls of patents but but Dr Lantos I just want to ask you very quickly you know we all remember when the ACA took the benefit away of being able to pay for over-the-counter medications through the different kinds of health insurance plans flexible plans health reimbursement plans medical savings accounts and it seemed to have taken away or it actually put in a barrier now so if you're trying to shop around for drugs you want to buy over-the-counter the restrictions on HSAs are causing families to spend more money out of their own pockets and on their overall health according to the consumer health product Association every dollar spent by consumers on over-the-counter medicine saves the US healthcare systems six to seven dollars contributing to 102 billion in savings each year last Congress the House passed HR 61 99 the restoring access to medication and modernizing health savings account Act this bipartisan bill would have allowed non prescription drugs and female hygiene products to be considered qualified medical expenses for all of those HSAs MSA is FSA's can you give some other common-sense ideas ways we can incentivize patients to use lower drug costs such as those over-the-counter products instead of having to take brand-name prescriptions all the time are there any changes you could see that we could make to the HR 61 99 or ideas you have to just continue to incentivize lowering the cost can you turn your mic on thank you I certainly you're correct that if you were to buy aspirin at the at the CVS it would be much cheaper than if you were to buy it as a prescription drug and there are plenty of examples like that the HSAs are generally limited in any event I would I would raise a broader question it goes beyond drugs the the issue that I see is that we're tied to having to come up with a receipt so this ties us to the fee-for-service system if you have an HSA and that that there's a there's a more fundamental inefficiency there but you're certainly correct that the impediment to the extent that people are aware of this I'm not sure that they are but the impediment to using your HSA money for appropriate over-the-counter medications is does add to cost Thank You mr. chairman I yield back I thank the gentlelady the gentleman from Pennsylvania mr. Baugh

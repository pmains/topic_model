joining me now north dakota senator kevin kramer senator welcome maybe my audience doesn't realize north dakota a major oil producer in america thank you for that but let's talk a little bit what about what president biden is now saying he's going to release 180 million barrels of the i don't know around 650 million barrels left in strategic petroleum reserve i think this is a bad bad idea what about you sir well it's a bad idea for a number of reasons eric and thank you for the opportunity to talk about it because places like north dakota are a strategic reserve just allow the innovators and the you know the entrepreneurs to drill it and produce it and you'll bring the supply up and the and you'll bring the price down without having to tap into what's supposed to be an emergency reserve in the uh in the strategic petroleum reserve and as you know eric a lot of that reserve was purchased by donald trump for darn near nothing he took advantage when the prices of oil were really low to fill the reserve and now the emergency that they're tapping or that they're claiming is not really an emergency it's certainly a problem and it's a crisis but it's not an emergency we should save the reserve for emergencies and use the untapped reserves of the bakken and the permian and other major oil producing areas of the united states and we can do that with some regulatory relief and right right capital signals yeah and you point out back in seven and a half billion barrels of oil equivalents and some of it in north dakota some of it in montana some in canada but that would be a great way to do it hydraulic fracking etcetera but they put the put the clamp so to speak on on fracking and such famously 2009 i got on my knees on fox business and begged president obama to buy oil at twenty dollars a barrel for that strategic preserve i said reserve i said double it um you can go back and google that folks if you want to he didn't listen and now we're paying 120 a barrel sir let's take a listen to joe biden earlier today blaming the high price of gasoline on none other than vladimir putin listen but as i've said from the start putin's war is imposing the cost on america and our allies putin's price hike that americans and our allies are feeling at the pump the reason for that is because of putin's war putin's war putin's price hike putin's war putin's putin's putin senator gasoline was up 1.60 from a year ago prior to the month or five weeks ago prior to the putin's war as he called and you can't blame all that on putin anyway so vast majority of the price hiking gasoline is biden's biden's fault not putin's right when you look at the calendar and you look at the price charts that's really obvious but when you look at the policies you can see exactly why because every signal that joe biden sends to the marketplace is a negative signal it's it's designed to squelch production whether it's you know killing the pipelines or you know stop leasing on federal lands but more importantly the other regulations like the you know the applications for permits to drill on these federal lands have like tripled in the time that it takes to get one and you know eric as well as probably anybody in america this is a very capital intensive industry and you need some medium-term and long-term certainty to get those investments but these i've never met an oil man that didn't want to produce more i mean then many recruit in many times they really become their own worst enemy because they're built to produce and uh you give them the right market signals price signals and by the way they'll produce it a lot cleaner than vladimir putin is producing it and that means that they'll bring down greenhouse gas emissions globally by producing more in the united states and making it available to our allies and our customers and and and and millions of high-paying jobs nonetheless too also another factor in that senator kevin kramer south dakota north north dakota i'm sorry north dakota senator thank you for being here we love having you on we're going to bring you back again because we are all about the energy right here on this show thank you senator pleasure thanks for the opportunity here

good morning mr mullaney morning senator so much to talk about um i got to follow up on a couple of you so sure you assume this is this i've seen lots of tricky budgets before but this may take the cake you assume abolishment of the so-called death tax estate tax but when you go to the year table s3 baseline by category you still count the revenues in the estate and tax which is kind of a tricky thing i would call that double counting your outside experts have assumed that your tax plan would cut five trillion would cost five trillion dollars as somebody who spent a couple years as you know trying to wrestle with these numbers and took on entitlement reform took on additional revenues i don't see i don't think there's any way you can get there with elimination of tax expenditures particularly when you take charitable home mortgage and retirement accounts are off the table there's just you know there aren't enough tax deductions to get to those numbers unless you're gonna i imagine you're you're now saying you're gonna go ahead and dramatically cut back on the deductibility of employer provided health care plans that's a large number uh i'm sorry um i'm sorry sir the specific question i was making the specific question is you got five trillion dollars in cost in your tax plan right unpaid for you cannot pay for it in any revenue neutral basis without double or triple counting or dynamic storing scoring on steroids if you take charitable home mortgage and retirement accounts off the table is not being cut right um you can't get there the numbers do not add up and by the way i don't think you've told the american public yet that to even get close you're going to have to then take off the deductibility of employer provided health care plans so that's on the table um here's what's on the table which is the i think the the one page set of principles that we censored the hill i've gone through these i know you have as well right i spent years going through these numbers to try to get them to balance you got to go where the money is if you're talking about any kind of rational revenue neutral plan and i don't think you can get there and i don't think your numbers add up i think they don't they don't pass the smell test and i think frankly the what senator whitehouse was pushing at that you were not double counting i just don't believe that as well because you have put dynamic scoring in place dynamic scoring assumes that with the tax cuts because you can't say dynamic scoring alone is going to come about um without the tax cuts in place so if you're counting those on the dynamic scoring process you've got to bake that in and so it's not truly a revenue neutral tax plan and to get five trillion dollars in savings when you take charitable home mortgage and retirement accounts off the table the numbers just don't add up let me move to another item because my time is about up um you take non-defense discretionary spending down to 3.1 percent of gdp i still got another year or two before i can say i spent longer in business than i have in government i was a venture capitalist i invested in a lot of businesses i would invest in businesses based on their investments in their workforce plant and equipment and staying ahead of the competition for an american tax plan and business plan that would equate to investment in people which is education plant equipment equals infrastructure staying ahead of the competition in a global economy means research and development how can you cut those so draconianly cutting discretionary spending by 1.4 trillion dollars over the next 10 years cut those three areas and assume that we're going to have all this growth you project and you know i just i would never invest in a business to spend less than three percent of its of its revenue line on workforce plant and equipment and staying ahead of the competition and that's what you're saying the american business plan ought to be uh no i'm not sir um and i would suggest you that you would also never invest in a business whose revenues were growing dramatically fast excuse me their expenses were growing dramatically faster than the revenues which is what we've seen here amen to that so let's deal with both sides both the spending you're a capital investment uh i think you're looking at only one part of the equation when you look at the american business plan because we agree with you the capital investment is absolutely critical in fact you cannot get three percent growth without having dramatic increases in capital investment we just simply think that private capital investment is a more efficient and effective way to get there in fact history proves that then government capital investment so what we do is in our tax plan trying to promote the type of capital investment that you were looking for we're moving it out of government capital investment which we think is woefully inefficient and into the private market capital investment i would say what gets us to all right mr delaney is that you know for the most part in our country education infrastructure and core basic research and development still remain a government function thank you mr chairman thank you sir

T PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM  SOUTH CAROLINA RISE? >> MADAM CLERK, I RISE TO  NOMINATE MY FRIEND, COLLEAGUE,  AND LEADER OF THE HOUSE  DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, HAKEEM  JEFFRIES, FOR SPEAKER OF THE  UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES. THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE: THE  GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. CLYBURN:  MADAM CLERK, I  WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU  FOR MAINTAINING THE DIGNITY AND  HONOR OF THIS AUGUST BODY. THE EYES OF THE COUNTRY. THE EYES OF THE COUNTRY ARE ON  US TODAY. LET US CONSIDER WHAT THEY WILL  REMEMBER. I OFTEN REFER TO THIS HALL AS  AMERICA'S CLASSROOM. THE PROCEEDINGS WE UNDERTAKE IN  THIS BODY AND OUR ACTIONS SHOULD SERVE AS LESSONS FOR THOSE WHO  MAY BE WATCHING AND/OR  LISTENING. HOPEFULLY THAT WHICH THEY SEE  AND HEAR WILL HELP THEM GAIN  UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATION  FOR THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA AND THE GOODNESS OF THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. THIS BODY HAS A UNIQUE ROLE IN  THIS GOVERNMENT. WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OUR PURSUIT  TOWARD A MORE PERFECT UNION CAN  CONTINUE IN EARNEST. NO DAY IN RECENT HISTORY  UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF  THAT PURSUIT MORE THAN JANUARY  6, 2021. EXACTLY TWO YEARS AGO TODAY, OUR RESOLVE WAS TESTED WHEN A  VIOLENT MOB OF INSURRECTIONISTS  ATTACKED OUR CAPITOL, THREATENED THE INTEGRITY OF THIS DEMOCRACY, AND UNDERMINED OUR CONSTITUTION. THE GREATNESS OF THIS COUNTRY  AND THE RESILIENCY OF OUR  DEMOCRACY WERE PUT AT PERIL. BUT WE SURVIVED. THE PREAMBLE OF THE CONSTITUTION EXPLAINS THAT THE DOCUMENT WAS  ESTABLISHED IN PART TO SECURE  THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY. NOT JUST FOR OURSELVES, BUT ALSO TO PROSPERITY. IN THIS BODY, WE ARE TASKED WITH PROTECTING OUR NATION'S  HARD-EARNED PRINCIPLES OF  LIBERTY, JUSTICE, AND FREEDOM  FOR ALL. EVERY TWO YEARS, THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE EVALUATE OUR STEWARDSHIP  AND RENDER A VERDICT. LAST NOVEMBER, THEY INVESTED  THEIR TIME AND RESOURCES, GOING  TO THE POLLS, AND CASTING THEIR  VOTES. THEY EXPECT AND SHOULD GET A  JUST RETURN ON THEIR  INVESTMENTS. FOR MANY, MAYBE MOST AMERICANS,  THIS IS THE ONLY INVESTMENT THEY WILL EVER MAKE TO HELP PRESERVE  THE GREATNESS OF THIS COUNTRY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER 200  YEARS, AFTER 11 ROUNDS OF VOTING WE ARE UNABLE TO ORGANIZE AND  BEGIN TO WORK ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO ELECTED US TO SERVE. DEMOCRATS ARE OFFERING A  CANDIDATE FOR SPEAKER, HAKEEM  JEFFRIES, WHO'S NOT JUST  PREPARED TO LEAD BUT COMMITTED  TO PRESERVING THIS DEMOCRACY AND ENHANCING THIS AUGUST BODY. MADAM CLERK, THERE IS SOME  DISPUTE AMONG HISTORIANS AS TO  WHETHER -- SAID THIS BUT I  CONSIDER IT TO BE TRUE  REGARDLESS. IT'S CREDITED IN SOME PART OF  HAVING SAID, AMERICA IS GREAT  BECAUSE SHE IS GOOD. IF AMERICA CEASES TO BE GOOD,  AMERICA WILL CEASE TO BE GREAT. THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA LIES IN THE GOODNESS THAT EXISTS WITHIN  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TODAY, THE GREATNESS OF OUR  NATION HANGS IN THE BALANCE  BUSSED GOODNESS -- BECAUSE THE  GOODNESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  IS AT STAKE. WE, DEMOCRATS, ARE OFFERING THE  PEOPLE OF AMERICA, THROUGH THIS  UNIQUE BODY, A GOOD MAN WHO HAS  THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE AT HEART AND IS  COMMITTED TO PRESERVING THE  FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. MADAM CLERK, I'M HONORED TO  CARRY OUT THE DIRECTIVES OF THE  HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS AND  SUBMIT TO THIS AUGUST BODY THE  NAME OF HAKEEM JEFFRIES TO BE  SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES  HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

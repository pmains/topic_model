i want to start by addressing the epa's ongoing oversight of the oasis mobile home park in my district it's very specific but it really highlights some of the challenges and environmental justice that your agency is facing this park is located on tribal private land in a rural farm worker community and has been under an epa emergency order due to high levels of arsenic in the parks drinking water since august 2019. i am very happy with the administration's efforts on lead in pipe water throughout america arsenic is dangerous and causes harmful health effects and we find arsenic in some of our low-income communities as well this effort to deal with the the emergency order uh since august 2019 that is more than 20 months ago i understand epa's mission is to help water system owners get back into compliance when there is no contamination however this assumes that the system owners act in good faith all public accounts indicate that the owner of oasis mobile home park has not acted in good faith over the past 20 months park ownership has repeatedly missed epa deadlines failed to adequately provide replacement water for residents threatened evictions raised rent by more than 30 percent and the list goes on including informing their residents that the water was safe to drink when the epa had not allowed that or cleared the water to drink and therefore residents were drinking with this water as the epa continues to work with the park i'm concerned that the focus on compliance is failing to address accountability and minister reagan how will you work to ensure that oasis residents are protected and that bad actors are held accountable for repeatedly violating epa orders to provide clean safe drinking water you're on mute sir thank you for that uh you know i fully believe every community deserves clean drinking water uh we will continue to partner with your office the bureau of indian affairs uh california's epa and ensure that the technical assistance required from our agency is given to the state so that we can ensure that transactions are remedied i understand the technical assistance my question is accountability how far is far enough how long is long enough you know we talk about the bia the bia has been negligent and never permitted them to begin with to operate this business and now they're coming around so so when is enough enough and hold individuals accountable well i'll tell you what i'll uh look into the particulars of this and speak with my enforcement uh folks and we'll get an answer to you on that i appreciate working with you because i know in your heart you're about helping the environmental justice community and at the core this is an environmental justice issue this is about the decisions and actions of the powerful affecting the health and well-being of the power less in my remaining time i'd like to ask you about another element of the epa's ej mission the american rescue plan included my bill the environmental justice for coronavirus affected communities which provided epa with 100 million dollars for both environmental justice grants and air monitoring grants under the clean air act community groups in my district such as lyansa and leadership council have long been advocating for better air monitoring in the coachella valley my district faces a range of respiratory threats from the particular matter from the sultan sea to agricultural burns and smog pollution yesterday the washington post reported that quote nearly every source of the nation's most deadly air pollutants disproportionately affect americans of color unquote this makes it that much more important that the affected communities have access to the funding meant to protect them minister reagan what is the status of this funding and how is your office making sure that communities like mine are notified of these resources and that they are able to access these critical funds well thank you for that thank you for your leadership on this and we're in the process right now of developing the criteria to administer these funds and what i can tell you is what we did immediately was we engaged the communities uh to be sure that they were a part of our criteria and decision making for those who actually received these funds so it's a priority for us we thank you for the resources that we've received recently and we're we're on the ball uh dr uh administer reagan i'm a doctor in public health emergency medicine uh you cannot disassociate our environmental health with our public health and individuals health part of our chronic health disparities is due to the chronic exposure to toxins in our water and and air and if we're going to address the pandemic appropriately and the chronic health disparities and the health of the american people we need to address environmental justice you're the guy that's going to help us get it done and let's work together to ensure that every child can drink clean water and every family can bring clean it can breathe clean air in america i yield back

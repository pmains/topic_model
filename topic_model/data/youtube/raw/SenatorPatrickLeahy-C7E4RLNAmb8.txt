sister General Kagan the good news is that this is all likelihood the last time you ever have to be in a public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee some of us had probably enjoyed it more than you have but I have appreciated your not only your your intellect hi but your good humor throughout I said I said to somebody do we do agree on something I I said to somebody earlier today I mentioned that I had been here throughout all the hearings I said it was like going back to my favorite courses in law school you patiently listened to our statements you've answered our questions over the last three days yesterday you testify 10 hours today you've been here since nine this morning each senator both sides participate in a 30 minute opening round some some took the opportunity for another 20 minute round some have gone beyond that to over an hour and of course i would venture for the public watching this is in addition to our other interactions with you all of us have met with you privately you I know speaking from my views when I met with you you answered openly and candidly every single question I asked you I appreciate that you've engaged with senators you've answered their questions more fully than many recent nominees some senators on both sides of the aisle of liked and agreed with some of your answers they've differed with others that based on my experience is not unusual in hearings based on my review of your record now your answers this week I expected you and I will not always agree I do not agree with every decision that justice Stevens is written or justice O'Connor or justice Souter but I have such great respect for the judgment I respect their judicial independence and I have never once regretted my vote for each of these justices I mention these two each were nominated by every Republican president i voted for each of them i have never regretted those votes for each of them I hope the Senators and American people have a better sense of the kind of Justice you would be you demonstrated an impressive it's an encyclopedic knowledge of the law and we can see why it so many of your students and many people my vet here during these hearings consider you a wonderful teacher the law ah i told my wife last night i really wish i could be back in law school taking a course of you you spoke about your approach to the law to judging you consistently spoke a judicial restraint and you're a respect for our democratic institutions your commitment to the constitution the rule of law you demonstrated a traditional view about deference to Congress and judicial precedent a view that conservatives used to embrace and fortunately few still do I'm pleasing over 1,000 members of the public we're able to attend your hearings in person thousands more watch your confirmation hearing live on television and we streamed it online through the Judiciary Committee website I believe the country needs and deserves the Supreme Court that basis its decision on the law and the Constitution not politics or an ideological agenda by the right or the left no justice should substitute his or her personal preferences and overrule congressional efforts to protect hardworking Americans pursuant to our constitutional role judges have to approach every case an open mind and a commitment to fairness and I respect your pledge and I take so seriously which you pledged all of us here that you'll do your best to consider every case in partially modestly with commitment to principle in accordance with law sister General Kagan I believe you and we stand in recess

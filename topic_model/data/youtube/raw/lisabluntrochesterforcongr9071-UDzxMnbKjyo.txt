candidates step up and run this fall we will have a record number of african-american women in the Delaware House and potentially the first Latina in the house and in the Delaware Senate this historic achievement isn't contained to just Delaware across the country we are seeing women and people of color stepping up improving that we can run win and lead our country now I get the opportunity to introduce somebody who is working on our team iris iris is actually our campaign coordinator and she will be conducting an interview that will showcase some of the people that you're going to see on the ballot thank you all for being here we're first gonna learn start off and say you know who we are and what we're running for the congresswoman does not need any introduction but she does run every two years and we'll start with me you miss miss Jennings Thank You iris my name is Cathy Jennings and I am running to be Delaware's next Attorney General thank you Miss McGinnis I'm Cathy McGinnis and I'm running to be Delaware's next state auditor in Delaware's first female State Auditor okay and last but not least miss Davis I'm Colleen Davis and I'm running for state treasurer okay thank you so now that we know what everyone's running for we want to also know what does off the trying for do miss Jennings the Attorney General in Delaware is the people's lawyer protecting victims who have been subjected to criminal actions and making sure that all delawarians are safe from crime abuse and fraud the auditor's office is the guardian of the Delaware's taxpayer money so we make sure that the state monies are spent the way they were intended to be spent and rooting out waste fraud and abuse yes thank you the treasurer actually sits on several boards as well as manages the cash that flows in and out of the state one of the important roles of the treasurer is to sit on the pardons board the Agriculture Board mhm the state employees health benefits and pension boards okay thank you and congresswoman Thank You iris I actually brought a prop this is a guide to services that we produced for our office because a lot of times people don't know what the Congressional offices do and what I do number one we pass laws that impact you at home and in your communities number two our job is to advocate for you as a constituent so if you have a problem with the IRS or Medicare or Social Security any of those federal agencies you can contact our office and get help and then number three we look for resources to help the state of Delaware as well in the form of grants and help navigate issues that agencies might have bottom line we also provide the check and balance with the president so those are the main roles of our office but if you need a copy of the guide we have them in English and Spanish as well okay thank you very much so now the biggest question is you know what are you guys going to do and these offices once you are elected miss Jennings iris I'm running to make Delaware a safer place for all of us to live to work and most importantly to raise our children mm-hmm I am running to make the criminal justice system fair and equal to everyone regardless of the color of our skin regardless of the size of our wallet or regardless of the zip code where we live Delaware is experiencing an opioid epidemic and people are dying in unprecedented numbers I want to make sure is the next Attorney General that I provide effective treatment expanded treatment services throughout Delaware for those in need and not a prison cell when it is safe to do so okay thank you the auditor's office has many challenges and I tell people it's not what it was Ben it's what it could be and should be and it's more than just numbers and it should be relevant to every Delaware e'en who cares how their tax dollars are spent first I think we need to take a pulse and actually audit the auditor's office look at our staffing look at the resources and incorporate technology to bring it up to the highest standards that it can be well I'm actually running as an individual who understands what it's like to rebuild I believe it's important that we have an individual who is in touch with the average Delaware en my role will be to steward our tax dollars in the most appropriate way that speaks to the values of all delawarians and I truly am passionate about doing that ok thank you and congresswoman Thank You iris thanks thanks to all of you for participating in this I mean we really wanted to showcase you and make sure people knew who you were as your congresswoman you know as we go into the next term and I hope that we all have your vote on November 6 my real focus is going to be what it was from the beginning it was based on the stories that I heard from all of you we took those stories and turned them into action and it's everything from making sure that we focus on jobs and have a strong economy to bringing people together so that we can solve some of the big challenges like immigration reform health care reform which I hear about all up and down the state we need to protect the affordable care act but continue to improve on it and so when we look at the issues as we move forward it's really going to be about those same things jobs in the economy and making sure that we come together so that we can tackle the big issues one of the first bills that we'll be looking at on the docket is one I'd recently introduced which was called clean slate and it ties into the criminal justice reform piece another bill that we just passed actually was on domestic violence that I'm a lead sponsor another bill is on sexual harassment and also bills on the environment these are things that we've already done but we're looking to do more because we've only just begun and we need your help and we need you to come out and vote okay thank you so now for a little more laid back question you know what is your favorite part about being on the campaign trail outside of me the wonderful people in the state of Delaware and we'll start with you miss Jennings my favorite part of going up and down our state on a daily basis in talking to people is to really know that what matters to Delawareans it's not really what party you belong to what matters is that they're safe mm-hmm most importantly their children are safe when they go to school when they go out to play that they have jobs that produce a livable wage and that the system the government is fair to them and responsive to their rights that their rights are protected and so as Attorney General it's incumbent upon me to listen to all voices and to reach consensus on the issues because the values that unite us are so much greater than any issue that divides us thank you going up and down the state on a daily basis sometimes a few times a day besides the wonderful people and the relationships I would say is the food I love how many times have I seen mr. blunt at Libby's and and then seasons oh and then you're going to you know how its grapple Apple scrapple going down state you know Grotto those Nichola seasons and then I you know dogfish is all over Sussex County so you get to go in constantly and I don't know if anybody can tell but you know we're running around but I just love going and trying new foods and going into so many different restaurants and just kind of become a regular there thank you miss Davis well I will agree you know when we are going up and down the state it's really fabulous meeting everyone but one of the things that I love doing is when you set out at the beginning of your day and you know that you have so many things that you've got to get in there it's a wonderful thing to look back at your day and have that satisfying and gratifying feeling of a day well spent and just strategically laid out before you it's a lot of fun it's yeah a true accomplishment by the end of the day I definitely agree congresswoman okay so I would definitely sum up everything that has been said but the only other thing I would add there's so many things but one of the things that is really fun for me is actually experiencing other people's jobs so you know people have been able to have me deliver packages I've actually gone on to a dairy farm our unions the the folks in labor allowed me to get into a virtual headset and stand and operate forklifts from a perspective of the virtual world and since the future of work is so important to me that was really a lot of fun thank you thank you all for being here and thank you for you know sharing your story sharing your time we really appreciate it thank you thank you some of you may remember in our previous episodes we call this the member to member segment well tonight the member that we are profiling his Senator Tom Carper a longtime friend and mentor senator we have just two questions and we've asked these questions of great icons like John Lewis and most recently Cory Booker the first question is can you tell us about the importance of voting why is voting important what is the second question and the second question for you is going to be why are the stakes so high in this election somebody once actually actually did a run through history of all the times that the the outcome of election that could have been a congressional election mayor whatever was decided by one vote one vote and a lot of times we don't think that our one vote is important but in a little state like Delaware where we don't have all that many people every vote does does count so that's why I think it's one of the reasons why it's important also I think it's important because we need to restore a system of checks and balances you know when they worked on a constitution up the road in Pennsylvania all those years ago they designed a system of checks and balances three branches of government they said they didn't want a king they didn't want a king so they set it up so that no one person would be able to mess things up for forever and it's it's a hard way to govern it's worked for about 230 years and so it's important but in order for checks and balances to work people gotta vote I totally agree I mean one of the reasons we did this television show was really to encourage people to see the connection between their vote and their everyday life and that really leads to the question of why the stakes are so high in this particular election could you talk to the audience a little bit about that sure we live in dollars the lowest lying state in America the lowest lying state in America our state is sinking gradually the oceans are rising we have these extreme weather events we've seen more her category 5 hurricanes in the last year than we've had in like forever we've have these forest fires that are going on wildfires that are going on in the other side of the country and my gosh Montana Oregon Washington sports wildfires as big as Delaware we've spent 300 billion dollars last year on extreme weather events to try to fix things up and patch things up the reason why all this is happening largely is because of global warming too much carbon dioxide in the air and we can ignore it or put our heads in the sand or do something about it and we need leaders who want to do something about Delaware it's especially endangered because of this you know it's interesting because a lot of times people don't see the connection and one of the things I got to attend recently with you we both were voting on the American water infrastructure and you were the lead champion in a bill that was bipartisan passed almost unanimously you think one vote shy in in the Senate but this build reasonably unanimously in the house that's correct thank you Lisa well and it's important because people need to know that connects to Delaware the fact that what you did actually creates jobs at the port 5,000 jobs 5,000 5,000 more jobs are gonna go out and we think the work that you did in common in the Senate also affects our health as you talked about you know what we're seeing with climate change that affects our health clean water and clean water and also clean air and so we beat our beaches and our beaches we've got more fights our Beach and I believe in any state in America and our legislation allows the car Army Corps of Engineers to keep our beaches in great shape and do so in a more cost backed away well we just thank you so much for all of your years of service as you know I started off as an intern in your office 1887 she was 12 to become our Secretary of Labor so proud of you so given so many opportunities to Delawareans and you've done so much for our country so we want to just thank you so much for being our special god bless and again everyone remember that vote is precious it's important and as the senator said races have been lost by one vote so your vote does count make sure you get out and use it ladies and gentlemen were almost out of time in 2016 President Obama said that while he's not on the ballot so much more is tolerance democracy justice good schools ending mass incarceration if you didn't believe him then you can believe him now the president represented an important chapter in the history book that is America I was proud to make history when you sent me to Washington to represent you but our work is not done right now it is more important than ever that we vote not only do you need to vote but you need to have a plan bring your neighbors your friends your family with you because in the book that is America we the people are the sequel there will be so much more to talk about in the next few months so I hope you'll continue the conversation and stay engaged after November 6 after this show stay tuned for some important tools that you can use when making your Election Day plan I want to thank you all I want to thank the guests I want to thank all of you for joining us throughout all of this and I also want to thank I return ur our campaign coordinator for moderating the segment don't forget to keep this date on your calendar November 6 and that you check in to my campaign on Instagram Twitter and Facebook and don't forget to vote November 6 and remember when Lisa goes to Washington [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thanks to so many of you we made history in 2016 I became Delaware's first woman and first person of color to represent us in coins it was an incredible evening and I remember a lot of people asking me what does it feel like to make history I really didn't think about it we were just doing the work but then on the day that I was sworn in that I stood on that House floor and raised my hand to take the oath I carried with me a scarf that my sister created that was an oath that allowed our great-great-great grandfather to have the right to vote and at that moment it really hit me that we are here because we're standing on the shoulders of those who came before us I've spent my entire career working to ensure that all delawarians had the opportunities they deserve and that didn't stop when I went to Congress lisa has been working hard to help the businesses up and down the state find the capital they needed to help them succeed in Delaware she believes in engaging people of all ages and all backgrounds in the democratic process and she's working to ensure all voice she understands that in order to be successful we need a safe burning she recognizes that the keys to enriching our children's futures and unleashing their innovative and creative spirit our equality education and the arts she believes that love is love and that discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity has no place in our society she knows that if we're going to leave the world a better place for our daughters we have much more work to do to ensure that they have equal opportunity so that they can reach their full potential I'm running for re-election because there is still more work to be done more for us to accomplish to truly leave our mark on history this year every voice must be heard so I'm asking for your vote and your participation in our journey to re-election and remember when Lisa goes to Washington we all go we all go we all go we all go we all go I'm Lisa Blount Rochester and I approve this message [Music]

hello and thank you for joining this conversation on one of several we're having on about how to end the gun violence epidemic so last friday i convened a discussion with law enforcement leaders in the 4th congressional district and i'll soon be talking to gun safety advocates and others about this preventable crisis but today i'm going to talk to a few of our elected leaders leaders that work on ending this gun safety crisis they work at the county level the legislative level and i will add as we have other conversations we do know city councils and school districts are working to address this problem as well how do we end gun violence in our communities gun violence mass killings devastate families they rip apart communities and they force all of us to question our own safety this week 10 minnesota hospital systems and i'm going to quote directly from them we believe it's time to declare gun violence as a public health crisis and to work to prevent the deaths of innocent people of all ages and backgrounds the common denominator is guns and the easy access to them by people intent on committing acts of violence we all have a duty to act but we also must listen to the community leaders and that's what i'm doing for members of the public who are viewing this discussion today or later we'll have an opportunity for you to share comments with me so please go to my website www.mccollum.house.gov and if you're live um on a computer or a cell phone um that link's also available with uh information on my my website if you just google in mccollum u.s rep so once again we are heartbroken and we're outraged to the mass murder of elementary school children in texas only days after a shooting at buffalo new york literally massacring by targeting black americans in a neighborhood grocery store and just this past week more shootings in tulsa tennessee and philadelphia and i also don't want to forget that we need to also focus on gun safety for what we call accidental tragedies it's quite often a child finding a loaded gun in a house and then shooting a friend a neighbor or a family member with that weapon and then we also know weapons left unattended or easily available are also used in the violent act of suicide when we lose a loved one but in the wake of tragedy after tragedy i believe every member of congress needs to be held accountable for the actions they take on effective gun laws house democrats are hearing loud and clear from the american people that they demand action so this week i voted to pass protecting our children act this package will make enormous efforts in our fight against gun violence raising the purchasy age of semi automatic weapons from 18 to 21. outline high capacity magazines and bump stocks subjecting ghost guns purchases to background check requirements cracking down on gun trafficking laws and straw purchases and strengthening safe storage requirements like unlocks protect children from accidental shootings there is no no excuse for gun violence being the number one killer the number one killer of children and teenagers in this country and it's my hope the u.s senate will join us in voting to protect children we also passed the federal extreme risk protection order act this legislation will keep guns out of the hands of those who uh pose a threat to themselves or others through a nationwide extreme risk law and encouraging states to enact their own a lot of people hear this referred to as red flag laws i have voted in the house of representatives time and time again to ban assault weapons to ensure that universal background checks block access to firearms for those who shouldn't have them but common sense gun safety provisions are obstructed at every step of the way by the gun lobby and those who are their allies in congress and state legislatures the fact that states like texas and ohio are making it easier to carry firearms including assault weapons and they can have them without even permit or training so there is a lot of work that needs to be done to make our community safer more than a year ago house democrats also passed two major gun violence prevention bills i co-sponsored and supported them it was a bipartisan background check act of 2021 it was the enhanced background check act of 2021. senate republicans continue to block those past actions on these common sense life-saving measures and i believe this resulted in more preventable gun deaths more and more we are seeing the ideology of hate including violent white supremacist beliefs motivates or inspires these mass shooting incidents we're seeing they're targeting our communities of color and that is clearly evident of what happened in buffalo new york in the massacre there in response to that the u.s house passed the domestic terrorism prevention act of 2022 to come back the voting threat of violent extremist groups individuals including racial ethnical motivated extremists and white supremacists so as i continue to urge senate action on legislation we passed in the house we know that there's more work to do i'm a member of a gun violence prevention task force and i know that some of the people we talked today with today are also working on their with their partners and their task force so one of the things that i think people need to know that i am an original co-sponsor of the assault weapons ban to prohibit the sale transfer manufacture and importation of semi-automatic weapons and ammunition feeding devices over 10 rounds and i work to make sure that the use of burn grants grants that go to our local and police departments and law enforcement agencies here in minnesota that they're able to buy back guns if that is one of the things that they would like to do with their burn grant and last but not least i signed a letter to the president seeking an executive order banning the importation assault weapons and i am working with the president in the defense appropriation bill which i chair to implement some gun safety prevention measures in there in a way that some of our military hardware is distributed so as an appropriator let me just tell you i am proud that i've i've been uh one of the leads in providing billions more dollars for burn grants and other resources to keep our communities safe so next week we're going to work on the active shooter alert is to create an amber style notification during a mass shooting and it is widely supported by law enforcement so we're hoping the senate if once we pass that could possibly take that bill up so we'll be hearing uh having hearings on assault weapon bans and other things so as i get ready to turn to the panel i just want to summarize in congress my voice my vote my values are all focused on common sense measures that reduce gun violence and keep guns off of our street and eliminate access of guns that are designed for mass murder the safeties of our communities and our families are my top priority i can't believe that there's even a debate about putting the lives of school children shoppers parishioners patients movie goers concert goers all of us our lives ahead of the gun lobby and what they want to do to guarantee gun makers profits so i look forward to hearing the discussion today i ask you to be direct and frank about what remains to be done here in minnesota but before i turn questions over to you and we might have two other folks join us a little later i would like each of you to introduce yourself and i will start being a former state representative mr troy i think you'll understand that i'm going to go with representative vice verse and mute myself um thank you so much congresswoman mccollum for inviting me to be here today um i am representative sandra feist my district is in the north metro it inc it is 41b which is the southern part of new brighton columbia heights saint anthony and hilltop i'm really really gratified to be here today to have this really important conversation um i'm the mother of a i was gonna say fourth and sixth grader but they just finished those grades yesterday um so a fifth and seventh grader um and and obviously these issues are deeply personal to me and i'm looking forward to to sharing some thoughts and updates on what we're up to at the state level thank you i think that's really important because if we discuss about this impact on our children you'll have your perspective and i'm a perspective of children who are in their 40s who still talk about columbine which happened when they were young young adults high school students um ramsey county commissioner excuse me ramsey county attorney john troy thank you congresswoman mccollum for first of all for the invitation to be a part of this really important conversation along with representative feist and other locally elected officials but i want to thank you first of all for um just the work that you do to ensure that you are connected to and talking to all of the local elected officials throughout your district as the ramsey county attorney i just so appreciate that that you are very interested in wanting to support that so i've had this great privilege to be able to serve the people of ramsey county as their elected county attorney since 2011 and have been very involved with a lot of issues and trying to improve the justice system and safety but there is one issue that has been very elusive and that i see repeating over and over again which is the cycles of violence that we see in our communities and in the courtrooms oftentimes i have to pick up the pieces after tragedy tragedies have occurred people have been shot and killed and and the victims are there who have lost loved ones and also families who have who are supporting those who are accused of those crimes seeing them go off to prison this is a public health issue and there are solutions at the local level at the federal level at the state level but oftentimes and this is so frustrating and congresswoman you talked about this we've been talking about this for for our whole entire careers and we can't get the traction that we need because and i'll just be really blunt and bold because of the the extreme special interests that exist that shut down the 80 percent of people that want reasonable change in this country and so this conversation is so important and it's so important that you're uh in congress uh because of the influence and the power that you have as an appropriator and i know we'll have a chance to talk about some of the ways that you've really helped i think our east metro community uh combat some of the violence and the the shootings but um i just want to thank you for your leadership the fact that you're there and you're not just in washington dc but you're here wanting to know and understand all of the issues that are playing out in our communities and take that back to washington to try to make change and so we're here for you to support your leadership and um uh and i appreciate all everybody that's here as a part of this convening to listen and learn and to figure out what we can do next representative fais we have uh in in our communities active and robust whether it's deer hunting or small bird hunting many of us have people in our family i know we have a we have a income and a very special legislature from your area and she hunts and she talks about about what she does but when i when i last lost the state legislature we were having discussions about what to do about concealed carry and one of the things that became an issue excuse me allergies became an issue was what do we do about um people who want to have a gun made available for them other than than hunting so if someone wanted to carry a handgun if they were a person who took payroll or or was making bank deposits i used to do that when i worked retail some people felt that they would be safer with a gun so what they would do is they would go to a police chief a sheriff law enforcement and and say i'm going to be carrying a gun this is why i think i need it and there would be a limited cursory background check taken to make sure that that really was that person's intent because it is a lethal weapon one that needs to be keep track of in case of theft or robbery from a home or from a from a car and what i noticed is when i'd go to local regional meetings for state representatives or when i'd go to the national league of conferences for state legislators we were starting to see these rolled out pieces of legislation sponsored by gun lobby groups and they would try they were trying to get him introduced in every state house and we i i was experiencing that when i left and i experienced it now as as a member of congress but what are some of the things that uh the legislators trying to do to address gun violence and i know there's even talk about doing something in the special session what are you seeing happen with with legislation and people blocking legislation or introducing legislation to make uh some of these weapons as we're seeing in ohio in in texas and other states people are going to be introducing these bills here in minnesota that you're going to have to fight against what give us a snapshot of what you're up against yeah thank you yes i mean these bills have definitely been introduced in minnesota because the dfl has control of the state house um we haven't advanced those bills of course but i definitely receive emails from constituents and have had conversations with constituents that are in support of having ubiquitous guns in public that's something that that terrifies me just as a person in the world um and and i'm pretty concerned about the case coming out of new york that will be um the supreme court were expected to have a decision i believe this month um that would really limit our ability to to restrict uh open carry and conceal and carry um so so that's something that is definitely on my radar and i'm sure all of our radars as we look at how far this court is willing to interpret the second amendment um one thing that i've done um i've realized that i'm a very pragmatic person um i don't know if i realized that before i was in office but i realized that i'm always kind of trying to figure out like what can i actually get done um rather than um what can i tweet about and and so um i've actually had some very productive conversations with colleagues across the aisle with the gun owners caucus and with nami minnesota to look at things that that we all can agree on because the issue of suicide prevention is is has to be really key in our conversations around gun violence prevention because so many gun deaths are suicides and that is an issue that affects um the greater minnesota it affects all of us across minnesota and so i worked with um colleagues across the aisle with the gun owners caucus with mom's demand action a friend of mine who was with them and nami minnesota to to create a framework around safe storage because there is research published in the journal of the american medical association that that really um looks at and i don't think i'm saying anything that we don't know but like safe storage is is something that really can affect um you know reduce suicide by gun death um gun dust by suicide and um can also um reduce mass shootings and so we created a framework around safe storage that would be kind of a pr campaign similar to a very successful campaign around postpartum depression um and and this bill was included in the veterans omnibus bill this past session um it was not included in the negotiated and passed uh veterans omnibus bill unfortunately um was really too bad i actually thought it had a chance um it seems like the negotiations between um chair ackland and senator lang were pretty efficient and effective um after a pretty difficult session um so so i'm hoping to see that bill advance next year as well um and and again what it would do is you know when you talk to advocates for the second amendment literally any restriction any type of training or permit like is an unconstitutional infringement on the second amendment right um but but informing people about the importance um and the mechanisms for safe storage is something that they really do support um and so so you know obviously this doesn't go as far as i would like to go but it is something that i think we can achieve in minnesota and so that's something that that i'm really um optimistic about um other legislation that has been introduced at the state level is mirrored at the federal level so universal background checks red flag laws um those bills have been introduced they were passed by the house in 2020 session um we were not able to pass them in this past session and i think that's incredibly unfortunate um one other thing that that i would like to see is i was thinking about this as i was thinking about this conversation we were about to have i would love to build broader coalitions um i'm thinking about the chamber of commerce i'm thinking about you know conservative organizations that you know i i'm a business owner i have a law firm i'm in minneapolis right now at my law office um you know when people don't feel safe like it it inhibits like the exchange of money for goods like it inhibits our ability to like function as a society for businesses to make money for you know people to go on vacations um and and i just i would be really interested to see if we can build coalitions that are bigger um and and maybe convince more um more colleagues across the aisle that this is an issue that that matters um from an economic standpoint from an electoral standpoint because i think right now the pressure is minimal um on conservative lawmakers to really um come to the table and look at some of these common sense things like bans on assault weapons um and so so that's something that i'm kind of interested in and and i have reached out to the gun owners caucus and where we're in the process of scheduling a meeting because i do want to continue to have those conversations um as we figure out like what can we do now and what do we need to do in the long term and so i think that's where my head is at i wrote some notes um one other just random idea that i've been talking about with people recently is some sort of law that would require people to report when a a gun is stolen just to create more of a responsibility for people who do own these deadly weapons and and that's something that doesn't seem like it would be would have second amendment implications it's just saying that we want to know where these guns who is in possession of these weapons and when they are involved in a crime um somebody should have had a responsibility to report that weapon is stolen um so so yeah so that those are just some of the things that that i have been up to that the state legislature has been up to and that have been on my mind uh you know interesting that you brought up um that you had suicide prevention in the veterans bill act that is something that we have been laser focused and put phenomenal amount of dollars in and at a federal level dealing with with suicide and i'm very active in the veterans community i have multitudes of generation of veterans in my family and if you can get veterans to talk about how they feel about about guns a lot of them are very strong on on second amendment but a lot of them because of all the training that they've had and what sometimes that they've witnessed them being used in in acts of war know just just the the violence that erupts from the end of that muzzle and how it it changes the shooter's life as well as anyone being being shot at wounded or killed it is they're very dynamic um thought heartful uh difficult conversations to have with our veterans community so know that that's one thing that we talk about a lot at times within va groups it's you know it's a trigger lock i i had a um and i uh when i was at north saint paul high school i had a student who committed suicide um and um you know i'm having that empty desk um talking to students about it and even finding out that there was a suicide pack out there um that that you know put us all into high gear not me particularly but school counselors reaching out to other parents friends of the the children that two of them had committed suicide one in florida one in minnesota but they had known each other all the things that go in involved in that and you mentioned nami which is a mental health organization which is we need to have at the table but that in my opinion lots of that lots of that is to talk about suicide prevention but is often used as a cover not to do anything that you know it's a mental health issue well there was no mental health record uh that i'm aware of uh in either the buffalo shooting or the shooting that took place at the schools in in texas so to say that mental health if we work on focus on that and not focus on ending the ability to just purchase these weapons of mass murder um would have somehow solved the problem so there are a lot of moving pieces as you described in it so one of the things that you you mentioned is you know just just kind of feeling safe and that is one of the discussions i've been trying to have everybody has the right to uh uh you know to to speak however they wish about the second amendment i do believe that there are some legal constitutional restrictions we can put on the second amendment because throughout our declaration of independence and our constitution it is the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and part of that is feeling safe in your community and uh i have been in states with these open carry laws and you walk into a grocery store and there's somebody with a gun holster around them i i don't know who they are uh i'm in line they asked to go in front or it's the last turkey that's left i mean it all these things kind of go through everyday people's minds is maybe that person doesn't mean it to be bullying or intimidating but the fact that they have a weapon on them in a setting which should be non-threatening just uh you know has ripple effects i've had people say now that with some of the concealed carry laws in minnesota weapons of mass destruction that are available without registration and easy access even coming to a congressional office or going to a town hall is now making people feel um uncomfortable so thank you for kind of wrapping that that whole thing about feeling feeling safe on it which is going to lead me to something i'm going to ask you about mr troy so last week saint paul's new office of neighborhood safety outlined operation peace to focus on deterring and interventing where gun violence is happening most frequently and uh the part of saint paul i live in is right up against it if not near in the heart of it so i hear the gunshots go off i hear the police and the ambulance responding um sometimes all times during the day mostly in the evening so can you describe a little bit about uh you know what we can do to help people who have someone who's involved with a weapon or they're concerned that they could become a victim can you describe how your community violence partnership that your head that you're heading is going to try to to stop that cycle from spinning out of control and maybe how you think it could integrate with the saint paul's new office of neighborhood safety well thank you congressman mccollum for the invitation for us to be able to talk about some of these issues and more specifically some of the work that we're trying to do here in ramsey county as well as also regionally as well because solutions in ramsey county can't be isolated from solutions in the east metro and also in hennepin county as well so one of the most important things that i think that we need to do with regard to things that we do in our community and at the local level is to have a common understanding of what is driving some of the violence and have a common way in which we go about um addressing it and and i think with regard to any type of community where you've got different perspectives sometimes that can be really hard and so we've been engaged in a long conversation but it starts with bringing people together to have the conversations to understand what is going on and certainly what we know what is going on is that we as a community are experiencing things that we have never really experienced before around escalating incidents and data that tells us that violent crime is increasing people are experiencing this new phenomena of carjacking oftentimes people brandishing a weapon in doing that particular crime and this has really caused a sense of frustration and fear and stress um all over our community and so i think in that calm in that context of stress oftentimes we kind of go back to um we might try to in the system you know political leaders might deflect the blame or say you know this is happening because of that this issue or it's this issue or that issue and so i think the most important thing is to bring people together and those that's what we've been doing in st paul to create this group called the violence reduction leadership group to have an understanding of the things that we need to do at the local level and understand the challenges and then commonly um in together commit to actual real solutions so one of the areas in which there we've been able to develop consensus is that there are a number of uh approaches to addressing violence that focus around understanding that there's only a small number of people that might be doing the shootings who might be involved in the carjackings or the that type of violent crime and so if we understand that it's a small part of our community then what we can do do then is to agree that police have to be involved as a part of that solution and community has to be involved as part of that solution and so what we have come up with is to utilize these principles of something called focused deterrence uh which is an evidence-based way of actually reducing violence in shots fired and communities across america and so what we've been doing is partnering community and police working together community being that moral voice and so what we do is we do notifications to people that we know are involved in like for instance violence they might be in prison they might be in jail they might be at a juvenile correctional facility or they might be tangentially involved and they haven't been caught yet or not prosecuted but what we do is we do a custom notification to tell them that we know that they're involved in this type of activity that we tell them that this can not continue to occur that it has to stop but that we also have a very sincere offers offer of services and support right and so the community and police are delivering this message together which i think is so important because we've become so disjointed at times that together that approach is then we have a very sincere offer of 24 7 services and that type of approach has proven to work now because of your leadership congresswoman mccollum we are now able to take that to the next level by securing technical assistance from the national network of safe communities out of john jay college the leader of that organization is dr david kennedy who is the founder of focused deterrence principles and so he will now be providing because of the appropriation the technical assistance for the office of neighborhood safety that will be doing the work in st paul uh for the work that's happening under a grant through the sheriff's office and the county attorney's office and the african-american leadership council on the black ministerial alliance but anybody and anyone that wants to to use these types of approaches and any police agency now can get that technical assistance and then the second piece of that is that your investment is allowing for someone to be hired as a coordinator for all this work because what was happening before is that all of these various agencies were trying to you know cobble together all of this but now we're going to have a coordinated effort we're going to have that coordination come out of the office of neighborhood safety in st paul that will also support other groups and police departments that want to do this work around the county and then the latter third will actually be able to resource more the community partners that need to be involved with the police uh to do specific focused deterrence efforts and i'm absolutely confident that if we do this the right way with fidelity and we do it in a way that reflects the values that are important to our community and we have a governance board that comprises of elected officials i see that commissioner tristamas castillo is on the call she's one of the governor's board members im2 as well as others in in our locally elected officials and i'm i'm absolutely convinced that if we do this model with fidelity that we will be able to make a dramatic impact on reducing shootings because you know the way that we always sometimes think about it is that well you know maybe we could just prosecute the person who does the shooting you know investigate the crime prosecute them and send them to prison for a long time and yeah we do that but what i've just done is i've just removed one person from the equation the reality is is that gun violence is an epidemic and oftentimes we see in group settings we see retaliation going back and forth in fact like that truck stop shooting that we had on west 7th street that was a remnant of group involved violence from a decade ago and so we have to recognize that we have it's not just the the the enforcement or the prosecution and the incarceration of one person it's also recognizing this as an epidemic a public health issue and to utilize those strategies to recognize that there's a way to intervene in these cycles otherwise what happens is we will you know people more people will start realizing this but i see this every day is that we have repetitive cycles of violence people caught in it from generation to generation to generation we see grandkids fathers and grand grandfathers who were all in the system who were involved in shootings and this cycle will perpetuate and continue unless we start thinking about working together and figuring out ways to interrupt it and seriously look at this as a public health issue and not only as a public safety prosecution incarceration type of issue i'll just keep talking so so you have to put together the organization to be able to do the work so once the work's done it's going to be very personal from what i'm hearing you know uh you you'll either identify by somebody that uh is is in the uh is incarcerated or going through the court system say hey i can tell that you made a bad choice and you're recognizing that now what can you do to make some some when you care about not make that same bad choice and then you'll have the tools in your toolbox to you know get the community and the support system involved to do the interaction to try to try and hopefully end that that that cycle of violence is sometimes just escalates up just because that's all anybody thinks of they haven't really thought out their actions or realized what they were doing or realized that that action wasn't the solution that it maybe you know tragically ended someone else's life and hopefully that person's feeling remorse for it uh and will want to do something for it if they're not um feeling remorse for it there's a there's a another power that takes care of care of that and that's beyond law enforcement and that's just my personal faith system and belief or it might be their friend you know i mean who who was whose friend just got shot who feels like they have to avenge that death right and so that's the that's the approach of what focus deterrence is all about is to interrupt that and to stop that cycle to repeat itself well i want to uh go to our county commissioner here and you can add a little bit on we've got 20 minutes left add on a little bit about what um mr troy just said but i want to use a statistic here and i and i talked we talked about this a little bit earlier 75 percent of the firearms used in you suicide attempts and unintentional firearms were stored in the residence of the victim the relative or friend in other words they knew there was a gun there they had access to it and there was nothing preventing them from being able to use that gun could you maybe talk a little bit about what ramsay county is doing and then we'll hear from senator pappas and i see that representative feist wanted to add a little something to the conversation yes thank you thank you so much congresswoman oh and introduce yourself for the group yep certainly so i am tristan mattis castillo and i'm the chair of the ramsey county board i really appreciate the opportunity to have this conversation that is critically important to protect our communities i think everyone agrees that gun violence is a public health crisis across our nation uh and and from the county we are looking really at uh that health issue around gun safety one of the things as you were talking about that retaliatory and how people respond uh we used our arp funds uh thank you for help securing those accounts so if we try to be initial free oh sure yeah american funds uh thanks uh to actually invest in our healing streets program which really goes a long way in interacting when there are situations of violence so that there isn't that retaliatory and repetitive violence um we have teams that are on scene right away and work with the folks that are involved in violence or potentially may and they're also working on the grief and mental health issues of everyone impacted around and helping provide resources so they can figure out how to process their emotions and not going to violence so um for instance the attorney john choice mentioned the truck park shooting they were involved in that and actually intervene and work closely with the victims and bystanders as well as perpetrators uh family members and kind of the broader community to make sure that we're not adding to that kind of escalation of violence um and it goes a long way in research there's been so much trauma in our community um that people haven't had the skills or resources on how to process that trauma and so when we internalize it it comes in forms of depression and anger and and then we act out and and as you mentioned the statistics about having access to guns is a huge problem the more access the more likely they are to be used and so you know the county has had a long program for a decade providing gun locks uh for people who want to lock up their guns and who should lock up their guns in storage but it's just the bare minimum really about how we can store our firearms we really need to continue with education around reducing the number of guns the access to guns where they're stored where there's ammunition and an education if people want to have guns in their homes they really need to separate them and keep them out of the reach of young people and make sure that the ammunition and guns are not in the same location that they're in a locked safe and not have access because it will reduce the county also as you know because of additional funding we also invested in mental health programs um and it's and really taking a look at to make sure that anyone in our community if they're thinking about suicide or having uh thoughts of suicide or violence that we will treat them and they can reach out to the county for mental health supports as well thank you well senator pappas earlier on i was talking about the challenges i'm having with u.s senate not our u.s senators here from minnesota smith and klobuchar are all about reducing gun violence and common gun safety but you're running into the same issue senator uh excuse me representative feis was kind of sharing that we were sharing our pain and dealing with with the senate's both in d.c and here at home baby and i know that um representative i keep wanting to call you by your first name and i want to be formal but let me just put it this way you and i commissioner mcguire and others have been working on this issue for decades and decades what are some of the things that you think that that you could maybe try to find a little bit of common ground as they're trying to in the u.s senate moving forward in light of these shootings now just happening over and over and over and over again and the public the overwhelming public wants you know assault they don't want assault weapons readily available they want background checks we didn't even talk about what's going on with ghost guns yet give us your perspective as a minnesota senator who's been passionate about working on this issue for years thank you very much congresswoman mccollum first of all i want to apologize for being late i was distracted reading the news about the first january 6 hearing last night which i caught most of and the time just got away from me um this is a very important topic obviously i don't know how a well-regulated militia in the second amendment evolved to open carry and ar 15 sales to 18 year olds i mean it seems to me that that right to uh a well-regulated militia has been really um taken terribly terribly extreme and out of context um i i was thinking about your question um about perhaps because there was a great deal of support for the mental health bill it's one of the few bills that passed so more mental health beds and more mental health services that perhaps we could find common ground on topics around moving upstream with use and represent feist and i have been having some brief conversations about this and how we can reach out to troubled youth who may be bullied in school who may feel alienated who may be having problems at home to identify signals that they're in trouble because some of these mass shootings are really also suicides going out in a flame right and um is there a way that uh besides obviously we want to limit their access to guns with red flag laws if there's obviously a mental health issue but is there a way that like um like uh you know john and the county and others uh county attorney choi have talked about you know prevention and and programs and um steering youth into more productive activities and when i'm out door knocking these days i do hear that from the neighborhood a lot is that we need more activities for kids to keep them busy so they're not getting into trouble carjacking or whatever is going on so um that and also you know perhaps more um if we have to have guns kind of embracing that with very intense safety training you mentioned how to carefully lock up your gun how these are dangerous they should never be pointed at anyone um if we're going to be a gun society then maybe we need to understand how we can be safe with guns i don't know i mean i think that that's part of our history the nra began as a way to treat gun safety and for target practice at camp uh which a lot of boys and these days it would include girls would do um and i think they have certainly gone off and and a far field from that uh but those are just two thoughts that i had about how we might be able to find common ground with republicans on these issues well one and i i say this as i mentioned earlier i was uh i've been a classroom uh teacher at the high school level uh about you know guns in schools and teachers being armed and i watched one representative from another state on an interview when asked well who's going to provide the training who's going to pay for the gun who's going to do the storage because you need to be real careful if everybody assumes that a teacher has a gun in a classroom you've just you just i don't i can't even begin to imagine how many guns could be in some in some classes and then it'll be you know the custodians and the lunchroom ladies and then is it is it open carry so i think we need to have a real conversation about what we're really seeing when we talk about guns in schools but just putting that aside you know if if the expectation is with my teaching license i can carry we don't have gun registration um uh you know for assault weapons do i bring an assault weapon are we talking about a handgun i mean this is just so wide open um that you could you you can't you can't imagine what a classroom what a school what a school looks like anymore but let's just talk about training for a minute is that teacher person in the in the school district are they going to be required to have the same amount of training that a law enforcement officer has which uh it you know someone has to someone has to to pay for it then they go back in they get recertified right to make sure that their their you know uh using their weapon properly um that they know how to discharge it properly there's a lot of training that goes involved uh with without enforcement you know congresswoman i wasn't advocating no no i know you weren't i'm just i you know when when people talk about this um you know they don't talk about the it's just it's just thrown out as as an example we'll have more good people with guns therefore it's a good that that's a good thing and like you were saying about you know uh training um you know my son was a boy scout he he did the the the training uh the merit badge that included you know uh you know weapons and and firing guns and i have to say that was a good thing he talked about you know what it felt like and he didn't like it and things like that so and realized how how dangerous they are and he wasn't automatically a good shot so it it's uh you know just kind of getting into the whole training and the whole thing about you know arming the public if if if to that point um senator pappas you're right if if that's if that's the that's the path that our some of our colleagues want to go down then they have the responsibility of saying that they're also going to provide the training and the responsibility and then the and the holding accountable when things don't go right our police departments are even held accountable when when things don't go right so um senator uh thank you thank you for bringing that up because we do need and uh representative was talking about that we do need to talk to everybody if we don't talk together and figure out how to find common ground then this will just escalate it so we've got uh you know about nine minutes left i'd like each of you to just kind of take a minute and just kind of like the one big takeaway or the one thing that you're working on uh or the one thing you want people to to know um in a minute we'll start with representative feist and then we'll go mr uh troy and then commissioner and uh youth senator we'll let you ha and then i'll close up and thank you all for being here this has been a great conversation representative thank you and thank you again for inviting me to be here and for your leadership at the federal level um it's wonderful to have your partnership and to be looking at everything that we can do at the state and federal level um one thing that i was going to mention and follow up to county attorney choice comments is that one of my passion projects is to look at restorative justice specifically in the youth setting um i was the chief author of the veterans restorative justice act that passed last year and now i'm turning to youth um but when we can help people who have um committed a crime to understand the consequences of their behavior and also to look at the underlying factors um to support them to help them get on the better path um that's something that affects all of our that that helps support public safety um and and so that's just something that kind of builds on what county attorney choi um was talking about with his efforts and it's something that that is um is indirectly related to the issue that we're talking about today around gun violence um but but yes um thank you again for for inviting me i'm very committed to this issue it's incredibly important um to my community and to our state um i have taken the approach of trying to have as many conversations with as many stakeholders as possible to find out where we can have that bipartisan intersection restorative justice does appear to be one of those areas um and as i mentioned i've been working on that safe storage um kind of pr campaign bill as well um which commissioner amadeus castillo was talking about um so so yeah so i look forward to partnering with everyone here and with community um to take steps both in the short term and the long term to make us all be safer and feel safer thank you thank you uh county attorney troy well thank you uh representative mccollum again for this convening i think it's so important it's a great conversation and thank you sandra uh representative fights for just mentioning what you just mentioned about restorative justices you know we are doing a lot of things here in ramsey county i just really appreciate the partnership that we have between the state and your office and the work that we're doing here but one of the observations i just want to make is that when i heard today from all these great elected officials is that we're willing to listen and compromise and recognize that there's an other aspect or another perspective other perspectives um but what frustrates me is that um i believe that a lot of the elected officials here the ideas that have been formulated the bill that was passed by the the house at the federal level those are very reasonable things that we're just asking uh others who might have different perspectives to uh think about and actually allow to happen right and this is the greatest frustration that i have around this topic is that we can't get traction and i feel like um you know with the elected officials here we're all being reasonable we're listening to perspectives we're trying to moderate we're not trying to win the argument we just want to do right by our people and keep them safe but yet too often i hear the path the possibility of passage for the bill that was that you passed congresswoman mccullum and your colleagues is unlikely in the senate the same can be said in minnesota it's unlikely that it will be passed in the senate and i just want us i think that we need to get to a place that we recognize that we represent everybody we have to meet each other where we're at and really come to real solutions that will work and and so uh congresswoman mccollum thank you uh for your leadership and always showing up that way and trying to find uh those solutions at the local level and listening to the people that uh we represent thank you thank you commissioner don't get off mute thank you so much you know i i would agree with what county attorney choi said that we really are looking for compromise but we also want to resource people with skills so that they're not turning to a gun to solve any situation or problem um and and i'll go a little further i actually you know as someone who is trained in the military i i have very well knowledge on weapons i see them as a tool and and i actually disagree that people need to have them at all because we can't solve our problems with them and more guns even more good people with guns certainly wouldn't have prevented any of the mass shootings that we have just experienced in fact our law enforcement has guns they arrived on those scenes it wouldn't have prevented it it's all reactionary and so more guns is not the solution i would encourage people to think about other skills and resources that are available and if they are going to be gun owners then we we really do want them to store them properly safely and keep them out of the hands of children and maybe and other people who are vulnerable um and and to make sure that they're that they really are being responsible gun owners um and as a county we want to provide those resources the mental health resources the healing streets resources gun locks are available no questions asked free of charge at the county at a bare minimum as well as we are using our resources to back you up congresswoman mccollum and the house passage of the bill and encourage the senate to pass that bill too because it's a reasonable and sensible bill that really will begin to address the issues of gun violence in our community uh and and we'll bring our resources at the county to support that so thank you so much this conversation well thank you uh senator pappas as i mentioned this is something i know you and i have been working on for decades and we're not going to walk away from the issue what would you like to say in closing i want to add my thanks to all of the colleagues on the call for your work over many years on these issues and i really appreciate having such a group of talented individuals to work with um that are that are so um have such strong passion feelings on these very important issues um i wanted to follow up with representative feist with just a little story of something that happened to me out on the um well door knocking and i've been a supporter of the second chance coalition so following up with her restorative justice comment and voting rights for felons and i was at a door and i always carry voter registration forms with me and my first person that i registered to vote was a woman who was an ex-felon she'd been off probation for seven years and she still hadn't voted and i said you know you can vote now you can legally vote and i'm here to register you i will turn in your form you'll get a card in the mail confirming that you have the right to vote and that was that was just really very rewarding experience um i mean there's more that we need to do for ex-felons in terms of jobs and housing and education but certainly they deserve to have the right to vote well thank you i want to thank all of you who joined us in the discussion today we had other legislators who i've been speaking to uh i could talk i i could start mentioning names but then i would forget someone and be in big trouble uh but i really appreciate uh especially the core group of people in the fourth district we all work together we all are elected by the same people and we all have a responsibility to to make sure that we reinforce each other's good works for the best of our communities so i like you we'll remain steadfast in my commitment to work with you to work with anyone to reduce on gun violence and keep our communities and our families safe especially our children the upcoming weeks congress will be taking some action and we'll stay tuned to see what happens at the state level but in the meantime we need to be listening what the public's saying and that is take action take action now and we know that there are a lot of folks that that agree on background checks age for assault weapons banning this you know banning high-capacity clips all these things and we haven't even gotten to the surface yet of what's going on with ghost guns because most of the public doesn't know what is happening with ghost guns and how minors are accessing that over the internet a great discussion to have at another another date so we'll be talking to gun safety advocates in the future and also talking to some of our school districts and health care professionals about some of the steps that they think we need to be taking this is an all all of the above approach in dealing with this and it's going to take us as as the commissioners and as as you uh in state office said it's going to take everybody we can't solve this by ourselves and we can't keep having legislation that doesn't go anywhere you need to take steps to start showing that we can make a difference in this so for those of you from the public who are viewing the discussion today or reviewing it later or want information on it you can go to my website and that is mccollum there are links on there we are going to be putting up links to in our website to some of the legislation that is passed and pending on the u.s congress and we will also put up some information for ramsey county both at the county attorney level and the county commissioners level on how to get involved in these programs that they're working on together and i know washington county is also doing many of the same similar steps and how to go about if you want to make your house safe if you have a gun in it make it safe that you don't have an accidental discharge that either harms someone or causes an unintentional death how to get involved in having trigger locks or even if your gun stolen it it slows slows down the process of that being used in a crime so thank you all for joining me here today i wish you all a fabulous minnesota weather weekend i'm happy to be home and my fingers are crossed that it rains when i'm not doing any activities this weekend it's all the best to all of you and thank you so much for those of you who will be reaching out to learn more on this issue with that i close thank you

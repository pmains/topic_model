my last question for dr fauci dr fauci the nih is still funding research in china at least some 8 million dollars since 2020. in the intelligent community's 2022 annual threat assessment the chinese communist party is presented as one of the top threats to the united states along with russia iran syria and north korea to my knowledge only china is receiving u.s research dollars the ccp controls their scientists and controls the release of research results they work on however nih grants policies requires a grantees to maintain supporting research records which they cannot do when those records are under control of the chinese communist party when will you as director of niaid stop funding research in china thank you for that question senator marshall we have at the nih and in other agencies in the federal government had very productive peer-reviewed highly regarded research projects with our chinese colleagues that have led to some major advances in biomedical research so i don't think i'd be able to tell you that we are going to stop funding chinese we obviously need to be careful and make sure that when we do fund them we have the proper peer review and we go through all the established guidelines i might point out that grants that go to foreign countries including china have state department clearance so any time that we do fund anything in china or any other country it has to go through a clearance with the state department but you would not deny that the research done through eco health that the records the the studies from there that we still do not have access to them is that correct we have no senator marshall we have access to an extraordinary amount of information that has gone there there is a question that people raise with things going on there that we didn't have access to but if you look at the grant the 120 to 130 000 a year grant that was given from eco health as a sub award in china to ask a very relevant high priority question we have received from them published literature with data that shows that they have done what they were given the grant for now obviously none of us know everything that's going on in china but if this if if the question at hand is the rather small grant peer-reviewed high priority grant that was given from eco to china in a sub-award we have a lot of good information that's in the publishing do you have all the information that you think

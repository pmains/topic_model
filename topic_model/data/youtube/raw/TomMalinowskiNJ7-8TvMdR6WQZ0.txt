hi everyone thank you so much for joining us tonight um tonight's round table discussion we've very cleverly entitled a better commute and while many of us are working from home these days we know that new jersey transit and the hudson river crossings need investment and oversight if we want to and if we want to improve the commute we need to secure one seat ride for those of those of us along the raritan valley line and we need to revitalize new jersey's economy by investing in our infrastructure i'm so excited today to have senator loretta weinberg with us she has been a tireless advocate for new jersey transit riders for those of you who don't fan girl over her quite the way i do allow me to introduce senator weinberg she is the majority leader of the state senate she served in the assembly beginning in 1992 and she joined the senate in 2005. the senator co-chaired the legislative select committee on investigation that examined the unlawful closing of access lanes of the george washington bridge in september 2013. she sponsored and passed legislation that required insurance companies to pay for at least 48 hours of hospital care for new mothers and she was with governor murphy as he signed legislation restoring funding for planned parenthood she's also been a tireless advocate for the lgbtq community and sponsored legislation allowing same-sex marriage all in all she is an elected official who never forgets who she represents and the good that government can do when the right people are elected welcome senator weinberg thank you very much and of course we have our own good government guy congressman tom malinowski so thank you all and congressman i'm going to throw it off to you thank you lisa um and thank you so so much senator weinberg for spending a little uh bit of time with us to talk about something that that you know so much about and that you have been such a champion of uh in your time in in trenton uh you know when i when i first started running for this congressional seat this was probably the first issue people talk to me about because there's nothing that that touches our lives in this district more directly than uh our ability or inability to get to work on time and for many folks that means getting to work in new york city but but whether you're uh taking the train or our highways um from your home to work we are all frustrated uh and um and we know how much this uh this transportation system that we have in new jersey is critical to our economy so even if you're not one of the people commuting um you know that uh that so many jobs and so much of the economic dynamism that that that keeps our communities going is dependent on our ability to move people and goods uh across this uh this region um so uh you know uh i've been i've been talking about this uh i got myself on the transportation committee when i was elected uh i've done my uh i've done my research and in fact uh since i love history when when i first started uh uh really uh getting educated i i went online and i tried to find railway timetables from the turn of the last century um on a hunch that that things might have been uh surprisingly uh smoother then than they are now and after a little bit of digging aided by the fact that there are collectors around america who actually collect old railway timetables and post them on the internet i actually found a bench and confirmed that yes actually like in 1910 1912 1906 you could get on a train in um you know close to what is today westfield i think it would have been in kenworth uh the station uh along the the relevant line then you could get on that train uh at eight a.m uh it would take you to uh the dockyards uh in uh in jersey city where um you would get off the train and you know the the setup was like this where the train would come like where my finger is and the boat the ferry would be right there you'd get right off the train right onto the boat uh it would shoot you to new york city and you'd be there in like an hour um which is basically like what it takes today um if things are moving uh on times that is and so for me this is you know it's about doing right by my constituents who are commuters but it's also like the deterioration of our transit system it's just symbolic of how we have neglected infrastructure in general in the united states how we have stopped doing big things building big things um committing ourselves to big inspiring public works projects as we um did so well in in decades past so again for me there's no higher priority we'll talk a little bit on this conversation about uh the state of the gateway uh project and the work i've been doing in congress to try to move that along but i thought to as sort of a predicate for that conversation um since we have senator weinberg here i would ask her a couple of questions about how we got here um because you've been you've been fighting this fight in trenton you were there under christy when things started to go really bad um so tell us from your point of view what went wrong in those eight years well i can give you a couple of very simple sentences eight years of chris christie as the governor of new jersey followed by almost four years of donald trump as president so as you first of all let me take a moment to say thank you for including me in this discussion and more than that thank you for the house of representatives putting you on the transportation committee in the house that is of the utmost importance to the to new jersey's economy as well as to the quality of life of the residents we all represent so to have a strong new jersey voice on that committee i can't overstate how important it is and we were on the rink 12 it's almost 12 years ago now i guess 10 or 12 years of getting the ark tunnel of replacing the tunnel that the amtrak and nj transit trains run through that connect new jersey over the under the hudson river we are also known here in new jersey for being a corridor state everything on the east coast north and west goes through new jersey and most of what's going in um all kinds of goods and services to the western united states starts someplace in new jersey so our transportation corridor which not only affects the quality of life and i don't want to underestimate that but it's the backbone of our economy here it's been the economic driver and chris christie came along and vetoed the funding the federal funding that senator lautenberg and and some of our democratic colleagues had gotten through uh uh through the federal government they vetoed it and i said you know i i was the recipient of many veto pens if veto pens are handed out which they're not but during the eight years of the christie administration i probably collected more of those veto pens than a lot of other people whether it was money for planned parenthood or money for transportation but i said if i put together all of those veto pens nothing equals the dreadful problems that chris christie created for the state of new jersey by vetoing and doing away with the funding for the ark tunnel refusing to make our match now you know he said it was an unfair deal between new york new jersey and uh the federal government and maybe it was but then if in fact you're a responsible leader and you have responsible state senators and assembly people behind you you sit down and you renegotiate the deal but he did none of that he just canceled it used up the money that have been set aside for the ark tunnel the biggest infrastructure improvement some say in the nation certainly in the history of new jersey that is a little over 10 years ago we would have been well through the construction so not only the jobs that that would have created but how it would have approved improved the infrastructure in our state and you fast forward we went through sandy where the tunnels were flooded and further compromised these tunnels i've taken with new jersey transit they have this special train that kind of lights everything up as you're going through that you wish you weren't seeing and it is so uh fragile if one of those tunnels is taken out of existence to be glued back together again at some point and we are back i'm going beyond coven hopefully there will be a beyond clovid in the not too distant future but if we go back to what life what normal life might be if one of those tunnels is taken out of service we will be in complete gridlock in this area so i can't overestimate the importance and i can't underestimate the terrible decisions that were made by christie and the republican administration and now we are hopefully beginning on the road and you been very helpful with getting funded for the portal bridge which is a very important link uh to the ark tunnels the portal bridge is i don't know 100 years old something like that and it's a swing bridge no less so of course when it swings open to allow shipping or whatever to go through it's sometimes doesn't close again and then all the trains in the northeast corridor are backed up so getting the funding to start replacing that's 100 year old swing bridge is of tremendous importance and you've played a terrific role in that and then i'd just like to say a couple of words about new jersey transit itself there is a board that oversees new jersey transit it's supposed to be a quasi public private public entity but in fact it has been functioning under the department of transportation again i go back to the christie years they actually took millions of dollars away from new jersey transit so that it was hardly functioning our fleet was falling apart both trains and buses don't forget we depend a great deal on bus travel to get commuters back and forth and uh things like the positive train control which will improve the chances of not having that terrible accident as we did in hoboken all of that funding was removed so under the two and a half years of the murphy administration we've been working to gradually get back but we also pass reform what i call reform legislation to give some autonomy to the board that runs new jersey transit and the second piece of that legislation that still going through uh the state senate that i'm hoping will before the end of the year to actually give autonomy more autonomy and transparency to the board of commissioners at nj transit we've filled a lot of the vacancies with the governor's help we have a well-rounded appropriate board there a couple of more vacancies to fill and i hope that they will continue to take responsibility to actually run new jersey transit and that with the port authority setting aside funding and planning for a new bus terminal i think we will find and that in a to make sure democrats stay in control in congress and that you built up more seniority on the transportation committee and that we take over the senate and the white house uh we have started the infrastructure and now we're going to need the support so thank you so much and you mentioned the ark tunnel of course and and yes it would be by all accounts it would have been open by now um had it not been cancelled ten years ago uh i brought this up a couple of times in my debates with senator kane in my campaign and i was surprised to hear him continue to defend the decision to cancel the tunnel i think his his argument was something along the lines that it was a very imperfect project and we would have been we would have been getting off the trains in the basement of macy's and you know my reaction is well we're getting off in the basement of madison square garden right now it's wrong with the basement of macy's um there's better shopping it's two blocks away and we'd actually have an extra tunnel without all these delays and we'd have one seat ride for the raritan valley line and as you know for the towns many of the towns i represent that's a that's an extremely important yes you know i'm really surprised to hear that from senator kane because as i said even if it was an imperfect deal at the time we were trying so hard the end there was a democratic administration in the white house under the obama administration uh his secretary of transportation which name escapes me from the moment actually came to new jersey to meet with christie to say we will renegotiate we'll we will talk about whatever you think is wrong there was no support uh certainly from the then for an office because christie wanted that money and there was certainly no republicans that i can recall who spoke up and again i just want to say this one more time it was the most harmful deal that was done to the state of new jersey none over the last 10 years and on top of that all the you know the maintenance budgets that were cut and using capital expenditures to pay for operating expenses and here we are and people wonder why it's in the state that it's that it's in um you mentioned briefly the port authority bus terminal can you say a little bit more about the status of of that project uh that has been a a um a long road to get to the beginnings of the port authority bus terminal it is uh when there was again some new leadership appointed by democrats at the port authority starting with john degnan uh their final i started going to port authority meetings when i found out that they never even mentioned the bus terminal in their capital plans it was almost like it didn't exist and there too a place years old falling apart no not no adequate air circulation no adequate air conditioning i mean i actually showed pictures when i went there at one point during the summer again all pre-covered and they're so help me congressman little fans like the kind you put at your bedside yeah you know if you have no air and you want a little air circulation these little fans sitting on counters the restrooms were falling apart the place was awful and again lack of investment in infrastructure lack of maintenance and the fact that it was pretty old so uh with john dagnan's leadership we they found what i used to call they suddenly found 90 million dollars i said they found 90 million dollars in the couch i called it and they invested in upgrading some of the facilities there fixing up the restrooms uh trying to get some of the escalators to work getting a a communications system developing the apps for the for all of us for our cell phones etc and started the long range planning for a new bus terminal they've gone through several um plans on how to do this and the port authority now has kind of settled on building up over the current terminal which has brought new york pretty much on board because that's what the neighborhood would like they don't want more of their neighborhood destroyed and then and we've got to think too about the inter-city buses uh and um and about bus travel that brings people to work every day so there's a lot of things out there being planned and now we have to make sure that we have a democratic congress and a democrat in the white house so we can get the resources these things will create wonderful middle-class jobs but more important they're going to create the new environment for our children and grandchildren so that our infrastructure is not falling down around our ears and uh you know all of this my interest there started out with the george washington bridge which is right in my district i represent fort lee and like the bus terminal is the busiest bus terminal in the country the gw bridge believe it or not is the bridge busiest bridge in the world and we are home to all of that we in new jersey and we bring those commuters into new york that perform all of those jobs so hopefully we're going to see a new road here after november 3rd and hopefully the way you do things in congress will move up a notch on the transportation committee we'll have a even stronger voice and we will we will have our go-to person in washington you're here lisa do we want to questions from our guests yes absolutely so ally has a question about the portal bridge go ahead ally okay valley ally we're gonna come back to ally we're gonna go to dave chapman dave had um a couple questions go ahead dave thank you thanks congressman and thank you madam chairperson what's the proper honorific um i i had a couple of questions one is just a curiosity question tom what what was christie's rationale uh was it political was it in politic for him or did he have a reasonable rationale for killing the ark tunnel that was one um and the other another question that came to my mind i was at a new jersey chamber of commerce meeting and a state senator told me that the lincoln tunnel quote-unquote was held together by band-aids and i was wondering is it really in that dire condition and uh let's see well that those are two that were important to me sure uh well as for christie's rationale uh you know i wasn't involved uh at the time i think loretta can say more and did say a little bit uh i can tell you you know the stated rationale the official rationale was that um it didn't take you to penn station um it didn't connect directly to penn station uh rather you know that's the basement of macy's argument um which okay you know probably better to have everything uh centralized in in in one train station but you know most of our commuters just want to get to new york and get off the train and then get on a subway or get in a cab or a bus to get to work um so i don't think uh you know waiting an additional 20 years um to get those extra two blocks uh is necessarily a smart idea um there are some issues about um the trains terminating in manhattan rather than being on a track that that allows them to go all the way to the the rail yards um across the uh the east river um in uh in brooklyn queens um which again from just a a train schedule management point of view uh would have been would have been a disadvantage nevertheless like it would have worked it would have been a dedicated tunnel just for new jersey transit um at some point amtrak would still have had to repair the uh and replace the existing tunnels so right now we have two tracks under the hudson river you see that's the problem with the arc tunnel we would have had four and there was even a prospect i think that if then amtrak had to you know at some point uh add to um its existing tunnel we might have had six um so so that those are the stated reasons as senator weinberg uh rightly said um there could very well have been a negotiation with the obama administration to make uh some of those improvements um so we might have even gotten a better version of the ark tunnel had christy been serious about doing the project and then i think what you suggested loretta was that those stated reasons the official reasons were not necessarily the whole story that in fact christie wanted potentially wanted just a pretext to cancel the project so that he could use the money for things that were more important to him um [Music] and and that strikes me i don't know i can't read his mind uh but it strikes me as a more logical reason than the stated reasons because the stated reasons just don't add up in my mind okay what about the lincoln tunnel is it as dangerous i'm sorry i beg your pardon no i was just going to add to what uh congressman malinowski said the stated reasons don't add up because the federal government even was willing to renegotiate some parts of this but that wasn't the stated reasons were not at least in my humble opinion the real reasons he wanted the money he didn't want to have to raise taxes and so 10 years later we're left with no tunnel and no money yeah we actually had to return 300 million dollars right that the federal government had already donated i've forgotten that yeah and as for the lincoln tunnel um i i don't know the answer to that question it's i i can't imagine that it's in as bad a state as the rail tunnel like senator weinberg i've had the tour um uh the midnight tour now now twice and you know don't try this at home is my you're you're lucky they don't turn the lights on when you're going through the tunnels it's really look it's not dangerous uh and one of the reasons we have delays is that they have to go in there fix it fix things so often and so they take good care of anything that is a safety related issue but because those are mounting the repairs become more frequent and the delays become more frequent and at a certain point they will become absolutely intolerable i was thinking that perhaps if we had told president trump that we would have the tunnel come under the basement of radio city music hall the rockettes could greet him there and he might be more inclined to contribute some money you know senator said we could name it after him i was about to say i was willing to name it the trump tunnel and putting it up in neon lights as you're going through it would light up but then we could rename it the moment he's gone there you go thank you thank you so much dave for those questions um okay i think ally's audio is working go ahead allie on here yup you're here we can hear you so it's interesting about the last gentleman's question um of christie's uh i just wanted to make a comment that if you look at where the money ended up going on projects um as opposed to working on the tunnel you'll see that it all went to dirty energy as opposed to clean energy so uh that's a i think a pretty clear trend with christy but um my question had to do with the funds that have been um acquired by our wonderful representative and when they might reach their destination for the porthole northbridge sure the portal bridge um and senator weinberg described it very well it's it's a swing bridge which means it opens and closes on a pivot um and that was a wonder of the world in 1910 when it was first built and it's no longer quite a wonder when a guy with a sledgehammer has to uh go in there and hammer it closed when it fails to shut um even when it's functioning properly which is most of the time trains have to slow down to about 40 miles an hour as they're crossing it uh just because it's it's such an old uh structure and so right there you have a bottleneck even when things are moving as smoothly as they can and then again there are repairs that are needed all the time it has been in recent years as much a source of delay or even more for riders on transit and amtrak as the problems with the tunnel itself so the gateway project includes both of these things both the bridge the tunnel and actually several other long-term improvements including um extending uh and refurbishing penn station to be able to take all the the new trains that we want to send in there so all of this was opposed by the trump administration and um we went to work uh particularly on the portal bridge uh uh a couple of years ago when i was elected because we thought we had maybe a better chance in the short term of getting that done we started talking about the portal bridge as if it was not connected to the gateway project in hopes that uh you know trump wouldn't notice it it would be just some dumb bridge in jersey that he never heard of rather than this gateway thing that he was determined to block um we pushed the department of transportation really hard i i was very annoying in a bunch of hearings with the head of the the federal railway administration and other uh officials and we appropriated the money to cover most of the the project and passed legislation as well the first bill i i got passed in in the house was related to portal it was uh a bill that clarified that if new jersey took out a federal transportation loan to help pay for these things that it would um that it would count as part of our share of the project our 50 not as part of the federal share because after all like we'd have to pay it back um so all of these things added up uh and then finally this summer we we got the the breakthrough and the department of transportation started uh approving the key aspects of the project the money was basically there and we're now at a point where we know that work on the portal bridge will likely begin at the very beginning of next year and you know so that'll be done before the tunnel and that alone will help improve the rider experience although we desperately need the new tunnel to really solve this problem uh in in the long run thank you thanks ali for the question um anyone else who's got questions feel free to put them in the chat we're trying to get to as many people as we can um so i think next we have a question from danette who has a question about my favorite topic the raritan valley line good evening everyone uh my my question is pretty uh straightforward and a little selfish for my town but basically looking for direct uh out of out of all that specifically as well as um i think you've answered some of the questions port authority and what's there but just wanting to know uh what what can be done to provide more service and it almost sounds like this is a question i'm asking given the state of the tunnels yeah so for the the rareton valley line and and it's not a selfish question it's um you know this is this is a basic quality of life issue for folks living all along that line and remember that's you know some of the bigger towns cranford and uh and westfield uh in my district but it goes all the way out to hybrid right it goes through somerville through somerset county all the way out to hunterdon county and so a lot of people at the farther ends of that line would very much like to see faster service to new york so that they can actually you know so this is really a more viable alternative for them to live out there and still be able to uh commute into the city and uh so what do we need to get one seat ride obviously if we'd had the new tunnel we'd have one seat ride because the main problem the main obstacle to it is the capacity through this two-track tunnel and two-track portal bridge is inherently limited it's only about 24 trains an hour that you can get through there uh in the peak periods in rush hour periods um so until we get that new tunnel everything is a bit of a zero-sum game any train you know any direct train that you add uh in peak hours you you basically have to take um a peak train away from one of the other lines now i feel strongly we have a strong case for doing that because we have actually more ridership now on the rareton valley line than a couple of the other lines that do have some peak service um and we'd have even more ridership on the rvl if there was one seat ride because now that i mean right now there are people taking the bus instead of uh that train there are people who will will go further to a to another station on the um on the northeast quarter line and park there because at least it gets them to new york directly some of those commuters would get on the rvl if it had direct service so i think we have a very strong case for this um new jersey transit is resistant to it because the easiest thing for them is to maintain the status quo rather than pissing off commuters say on the coastline or or any of the other lines that might lose a little bit of service for rvl to gain it and you can't just you can't just have one direct train in the morning because then everybody would mob that train you'd need to have at least two or three to make it viable um so that debate goes on and i have spoken to the governor about it so many times that uh anytime he does an event for me he's sure to mention the valley line uh just to stay on the safe side um we got uh we got a study uh that new jersey transit did about all of this which was not very satisfying um uh you know it it basically concluded that we could give you one seat ride uh but it would cost nine trillion dollars and take fifty two i'm exaggerating but but they they somehow made it seem as if it would be the hardest thing that any human being in history ever thought of doing and so i spent almost two hours with the group that wrote that study and just challenged them point by point by four and um we got to uh a very interesting discussion about the viability of at least trying to add what we call shoulder service that's that would be a direct train um so that would be not between the peak hours of 7 a.m and 9 a.m but maybe a 9 30 train or 6 30 a.m train um and they still said it would cost trillions of dollars and i'm like come on that's ridiculous and they kind of acknowledged that yes i was right uh and they agreed to go back to the drawing board at least to figure out how to add a couple of trains on sort of those two ends and it seems to me that with kovid having changed our patterns of transportation so fundamentally uh and and and i suspect we may not go back fully to our old patterns when we're out of covet that there may be more people commuting at less traditional hours and spending more time working from home that that that addition of some shoulder service would actually be a significant quality of life improvement even though it's not what we really want to need and that's direct service during um during rush hour so that's kind of where we are on that the tunnel is the ultimate solution but i keep fighting for smaller bits you really summed that up very well and let me add one thing to it something i've been so interested in moving ahead is if we've got a really viable mj transit board that is accountable this is a place where you could be having public discussions about things like what you call shoulder service uh so that the bureau it is not entirely up to the bureaucracy to tell you it's going to be 30 trillion dollars in 200 000 years so um i point that out because i hope more people will be going to the new jersey transit board meetings most of which you can sign up for now virtually and testify via phone lines uh one of the things we mandated is that they have a certain number of their meetings in the evening so they're not all during work hours during the day so i look upon that board to be an advocate for the transit riders and um hopefully those of you who are particularly interested and you've got so many advocates out there congressman i know that on the raritan valley line should be starting to speak to the board about your plants um senator weinberg ali had a follow-up question she wanted to know how members of the new jersey transit board are chosen now they're nominated by the governor with advice and consent of the senate as many of our boards and commissions and and judges are done so um there are a couple of openings there are a few names around because one one of them was mandated to be a bus rider and uh apparently the governor's office you know having trouble so i suggest to them just go to a bus stop and hand out applications i'm sure you'll get a lot of response but uh that's that's how the board is named we have um my former colleague and my former and the uh former prom sponsor of the first new jersey reform new jersey transit reform bob gordon robert gordon is on the former senator uh is on the board and we've i think developed a really good board there is a man by the name of james adams who's actually been challenging and voting no on things which was almost unheard of at new jersey transit and uh i'm hoping we'll see this develop more because we in the state legislature should not be involved with deciding whether you have one door or two door buses or whether there are shoulder uh viable plans for the raritan valley line that's what the board should be there to do and to make sure that they are accountable and transparent and welcoming to the public great thank you and ally wants to know if she could get on the board so allie will have you fill out an application ally do you ride buses uh i am not a bus rider but i'm willing to go stand at a bus stop and see if that helps well by all means actually get your resume in where do you live westfield so uh uh send it well okay you also should send it to your state senator [Music] thank you you can send me a copy ally how's that great thank you we're actually lucky to have with us bruce burgin who is the chairman of the raritan valley rail coalition bruce you want to say a few words thanks lisa um first of all uh let me say thank you to senator weinberg um as chairman of the raritan valley rail coalition i've been attending board meetings for about three and a half years now um including uh remotely recently but i do believe there is a change in in what's going on at at the board meetings you you can hear it uh the discussion and and you're right that first no vote um opened my eyes so i want to thank you for everything you're doing to really help new jersey transit uh develop as as an agency um but mostly i want to thank the congressman um the the recitation you just gave of the issues facing the raritan valley line there are people who've been involved for even far longer than me five ten years i've been doing it for about five years um and and your grasp of the issues that face us in in just under two years is is amazing um considering it's just one of dozens of issues that that are facing new jersey and our district but um i i do believe that without your hard work down in washington the funding for the portal bridge would not have come through um we're thankful for your assistance here in new jersey helping to push the one seat ride we the the rail coalition meets with the staff members um usually quarterly it's been a while because of of covid but um we are pressing the same same issues that that you are a congressman the fact that the the study mandated by the the legislature really was was came to conclusions that were so far out um and and with your pressure and and that from the citizens we've been able to get them to concede that that's a starting point so in the long run as was said uh until the new tunnel is built there will not be an ultimate solution to the one seat ride but we will keep pushing with both the senator and and congressman's help for to get what we can in the meanwhile so thank you both for for all that you do thank you bruce if i could just add because of what the congressman said that obviously our commuting patterns are going to change and uh more people will be working from home as they have found out that it can actually work so given that maybe there really is a real opportunity now to do this kind of what you describe as shoulder service uh that there might be a better chance which is why i would like to see the board actually discuss that publicly i mean this is the time to try it when ridership is on the lower side bruce let's let's take that as our homework i never like to leave a meeting without giving someone else an assignment um it i actually missed the board meeting which was was at the middle of last week because i um i was at a function with uh with the congressman um but um that that is uh an issue i've raised to the board um not recently but as i said we're meeting with staff soon and um i intend to raise it again at the next board meeting so uh thank you senator for your encouragement thank you thanks bruce thanks for everything you're doing to help us secure one seat ride but look folks um none of this is going to happen if we don't have the right representation in washington which is why it is so important that we re-elect congressman malinowski voting is it's voting right it's election day right now if you have your ballot please get it to a drop box as soon as possible um we just we don't want to leave any vote left on a kitchen table it doesn't really do anything there so thank you all so much for everything you're doing senator weinberg thank you so much for being with us it's always such a treat having you it's my pleasure and i look forward to being among uh congressman malinowski's first phone calls when he gets back on the transportation committee say okay let's get to work for our art money there we go i like it you ready congressman i can look forward to it okay look i'm glad to hear somebody looking forward to a phone call from me looking forward to the progress we can make and and by the way you know i didn't we didn't really talk that much about the tunnel um portion but if we elect joe biden it's done um and and one of my projects for the transition will be to make that a day one decision because again well we haven't approved all the money for gateway it's a lot over many years but we've certainly made a down payment enough for them to start work on it and all that's needed is to for somebody to go to the department of transportation um search elaine chow's office for the environmental impact study which she has hidden somewhere uh very cleverly it's two years late it's ready but they just won't release it um so we'll find it in there and get that out and and approve you know move the project to uh to his first phase and that's a decision the new president can make and i will do what i can to get him to make it very early if god forbid we don't elect him then we'll need more legislative jiu-jitsu uh

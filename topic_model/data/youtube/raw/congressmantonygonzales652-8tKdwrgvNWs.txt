policies joining us now congressman tony gonzalez a republican from the great state of texas he actually serves on the house appropriations committee so he is a man who understands the inner workings of capitol hill and i think you could i think it's fair to say you understand why in particular states along the border are so completely fed up with a lack of support that they seem to be getting from the administration is that your perspective yeah that's right kevin you know it's a not so happy new year at the southern border because nothing has changed you know yesterday julio rosas from townhall.com reported that border patrol agents were actually taking fire on the southern border and this had this isn't the first time that it's happened so i asked where are the house democrats what is it going to take for the house democrats to take action apparently it's not the 557 migrants that died last year i mean people are dying at our southern border this is beyond a crisis and this isn't it should not be a partisan issue this should not be about republicans and democrats this should be about americans and it starts with the house intelligence committee you know where is shift where is swalwell they need to be investigating what's happening on our southern border to protect americans from another 9 11 event from occurring well you hit the nail on the head there because it's not just about the coyotes and about the the human traffickers we're talking about who knows getting into the country right now this could obviously manifest in a catastrophic way down the line and in particular for the communities along the border as you have pointed out this is about much more than just today's politics this is about real life changes to the communities there that could obviously have wide-ranging uh problems there let me let me just share this the president said back in april that we have a handle on this in effect uh from your perspective do you think that the administration is turning a blind eye are they simply being ineffective in the way that they're trying to manage this circumstance you know there's one word for this uh what the administration has done and its negligence you know they have been completely negligent on the southern border you know putting uh vice president harris in charge as the czar when she hasn't even shown up you know appoint somebody else put somebody that actually cares about what's happening in the southern border because there's an intelligence threat that is coming that is already here you know i spent 20 years in the intelligence community uh i spent you know time in iraq and afghanistan fighting terrorism abroad i will tell you this feels a lot like terrorism at home and those that live and work along the southern border are being terrorized and it's beyond a threat i mean people are dying you know right now it's migrants but it's only a matter of time before americans die i ask folks you know go to stand with border patrol.com find out more border patrol are doing everything possible to keep our country safe and they need our support okay and the time that we have left about 30 seconds or so if you had a prescription maybe a top line that you would like to see happen to sort of alleviate the problem certainly in the short term uh what would that be congressman yeah look the remaining mexico policy they they they re-implemented but they've only uh expelled over a little a little under 200 migrants turn that program on and really uh affect it if people do not qualify for asylum they need to be sent back to their country of origin bottom line the other thing is put more boots on the ground give give border patrol agents the authority to do more and that starts by adding more border patrol agents to the equation congressman tony gonzalez a man who would know from the great state of texas congressman as always we really appreciate your time have a good weekend thank you kevin

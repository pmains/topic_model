educators deserve a partner in the White House and with President Joe Biden and first lady dr. Jill Biden they won't just get one advocate they will get two and that's what we need I've got news for president Trump and the Republicans who are trying to politicize the safety and well-being of our students you can't just snap your fingers and reopen the schools forcing schools to reopen without providing them with the resources they need to do so safely or the flexibility to be able to respond to outbreaks in their community is both dangerous and reckless reopening schools is going to require careful planning that puts the safety of students teachers staff all first and that's why it is so critically important that teachers and and school staff have to be at the table for these decisions we need a Secretary of Education who will work with teachers to help the states and districts develop reopening plans based on the best available public health information instead of spending her time sending buckets of emergency taxpayer money to private schools we need real leadership in the White House starting with the President to significantly reduce the spread of this virus we need a Congress that will act fast to invest real money in stabilizing our state and local governments our child care and our k-12 schools instead of blocking critical aid to schools in two states now there are a lot of ways to accomplish these goals but time is of the essence we know we face an uphill battle here but this this is the fight that we have been called to the fight to build it in America that provides educators with the support and the respect that they need and deserve an America that builds a better tomorrow for every child from birth so that regardless of their zip code their family income their race or their ability they are safe and their opportunities look pretty much like everyone else's an America that can only be possible with Joe and Jill Biden in the White House

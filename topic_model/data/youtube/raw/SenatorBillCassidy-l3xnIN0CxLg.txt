thank you all it's kind of with you know i'm a physician and it's kind of with grief that i come to this because there's so much misinformation put out but let me first say that we have a lot of common ground here a lot of common ground um first let me just say what's actually been accomplished are things that i've personally been involved with i've led and has been signed into law the john lewis national institute of minority health and health disparities research endowment vitalization act and maternal health quality improvement act two things designed to address disparity working on legislation called the connected mom allowing a woman on medicaid to be at home and have her vital signs measured remotely as opposed to perhaps taking public transportation to and from the physician we've worked we've worked significantly on what to do about addiction services knowing that many women who die a year within a year after a pregnancy die of addiction working on we just passed a major suicide bill a mental health bill which again since many women who died post pregnancy die of suicide so but there's more to do and i emphasize that because there's common ground and the common ground gets kind of lost in the midst of a cloud of misinformation now again i'm going to speak as a physician because i found that when patients came to me in a panic the first thing i had to do was kind of dispel their fears that were not the case and to try and still facts where there was instead this kind of oh my gosh so first i think dr marshall did a wonderful job of pointing out that he is a pro-life physician takes care of patients with ectopic pregnancies period end of story so we hear dialogue that somehow a woman would die with an ectopic pregnancy will not get her care it's just not true can we dispel that and when folks say oh those those states that have the highest the most restrictive abortion have the highest maternal mortality no one speaks of washington dc which has the highest maternal mortality and has absolutely no limit upon abortion access up to the point of parturition the baby can be coming through the birth canal here in washington dc and can be aborted five minutes it would be a child in someone's arms and instead five minutes early it's dismembered his skull crushed and they have the highest maternal mortality in the nation and my gosh if there's anything to fear ms swindle in my home state i happen to visit one of the crisis pregnancy centers it is amazing the good work they do and people come there voluntarily they can leave at any time they elect to stay and when i went there they had a whole closet full of clothing and formula and i said well this is i thought you were prenatal and they said no we continue to care for the family and the child after the child is born and we have all these that are here for that family now there's federal legislation being introduced that would shut down crisis pregnancy centers that would say miss swindle no matter what your good work washington dc is going to shut you down i will also say my gosh there's all this kind of implication that washington d.c is bearing down on people's lives there is federal legislation to ban crisis pregnancy democrats want to force pro-life physicians and nurses to either do abortions or lose their license or have faced civil penalties so dr marshall you're pro-life have you decided no the heavy hand of washington dc is going to come in and snatch your license away or subject you to civil penalties that is concerning can anyone now next can anyone name a state in which there is a law saying that if the life of the mother is at risk the woman does not have right to to an abortion you can't because there is no state every state allows an exception for the life of the mother and there's this kind of frankly misinformation that that is not the case so i'm going to speak as a physician [Music] there's a lot of common ground let's do something about maternal mortality but let's don't hide our efforts in a claw in a cloud of misinformation suggesting for a fact that aborting every baby is the way to protect mama's lives when we see here in washington dc with the most liberal law and abortion in the nation having the highest rate of maternal mortality nor let's suggest that a mama is going to have her life placed at risk because of these or because of an ectopic pregnancy she can't have her ever abortion addressed and the richest was that transgender is somehow going to be affected there's not a law out there related to abortion that also relates to transgender so i usually ask questions but here i just had to say let's all think like doctors who really want to lower maternal mortality but also calm everybody down with facts not with misinformation without a yield

joining me now to discuss this is Pennsylvania congresswoman Madeline Dean she is a Democrat on the very pertinent House Judiciary Committee I wonder congresswoman what you think of that if the the president was some of the actions he's taken and the Justice Department clearly not being impartial here at the leadership is something that kind of neuters Congress and its ability to do oversight when you look at how the administration has resisted any documents or witnesses or anything well the events of this week are an important reminder that the Department of Justice must be an independent department attorney general Barr is supposed to be the top law enforcement officer he's not the personal attorney of the President and the events of this week with the president publicly proclaiming that he thought that the sentencing recommendation for Roger stone was too great and then within hours attorney general Barr and his department reduces the sentencing recommendation the four heroes who stood up think of it career politicians who left their post in protest over this interference by the president it couldn't be a more serious time we need an independent judiciary we need an independent Department of Justice to enforce the rule of law and the president is attempting to corrupt all that we can we can hear over and over frustration from Democratic voters who don't understand why Congress isn't able to carry out oversight so when you're looking especially at the impeachment inquiry and investigation as a model for how the Trump administration resists oversight which is quite effectively what can Congress really do well we did do something that was effective this president stands forever impeached he's one of only three presidents in our history he is forever impeached for his abuse of power and his obstruction of Congress it's utter corruption and it is unconstitutional so we in the house did our job and he stands forever impeached I was honored to be a part of that sober process what I think the framers didn't anticipate and what it was hard for us to watch frankly was a complicit Republican Senate imagine these grown senators gave up their own credibility in support of a corrupt think of the silly words now when you think of senator Susan Collins words oh well the president's learned his lesson what the president learned was he's not going to be held accountable by the Republican Party or by Republican senators sworn to do impartial justice so we in the house we're going to continue to do our role of oversight and it's for the American people if this president will never learn his lesson the American people note need to know what's at stake our Constitution and the rule of law and then they'll go to the polls in November and cast their vote for either decency or corruption I have faith in the American people what do you say to some observers who say the impeachment process look we knew right we knew it was gonna happen I mean it was clear that there was a very high likelihood that Republicans were not going to join with Democrats to impeach the president it would be historically it's never happened so they say well you kind of knew how this was going to turn out and even knowing that post impeachment the president is so emboldened they actually some of them point a finger at Democrats and say wow you really got him - you really got to show him that actually you can't do much to him other than put a Scarlet Letter on him what do you say to that well we did wherever he is impeached I guess that he stopped him from what we've seen witness retaliation this week and and his Justice Department intervening in the Roger stone sentencing clearly it doesn't stop him as Maya Angelou said when someone reveals himself believe in the first time and I would remind the Republican senators I believe this president he is going to continue his corrupt behaviors now much more involving by their complicity but I say the American people want Congress still doing its work is it doing its work we are doing our work we're not only investigating we are litigating we're passing legislation we hope to pass infrastructure but let me go back to one thing I did hold out hope that a we would actually have a trial we never had a trial in the Senate as you know Mitch McConnell blocked all witnesses all evidence but what we did get was Mitt Romney a Republican senator voted eloquently to convict the President on the first article of impeachment I thought that was a very courageous moment I thought it should have been matched by many many other Republican senators but there were people of goodwill Democrats who voted to to convict and a Republican voted against this president recognizing the grievous wrongs he did American people need us to keep showing that really quickly knowing that it's a month off but I want to ask you before I let you go bill Barr is going to appear before your committee yeah do you want to ask him I'm pleased that he's coming forward it's about time we tried to have him in last year he had agreed to come and then didn't come and it is his responsibility actually to report to the Congress every year we certainly want to ask about the what appears to be a very lack of Independence of the department that he is running he has poured away his credibility we saw it at the time of the malla report now we see it as a result of these convictions and personal favors for this president so I want to know why is it that he appears also to be on a domestic political earned for the president instead of being the top law enforcement officer congresswoman Deane thank you so much thank you we appreciate it

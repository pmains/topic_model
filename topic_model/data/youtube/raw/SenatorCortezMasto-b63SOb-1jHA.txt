thank you thank you thank you all for being here I know this is the fourth hearing and I so appreciate the chair and ranking member and and continuing down this important discussion and mr. Hinchey I want to thank you for sitting down with me yesterday and talking with me so the question I want to start for the panel that I have is to what extent are you personally and end your leadership and staff actively engaging with both the Athletes Advisory Council as well as victims of sexual abuse to help direct your programming to stamp out the culture of abuse that has enabled what we have seen these predators to target athletes can you talk a little bit about that what you're doing individually or within your organization yep and let's start let's go down to mr. Andrews please yeah we thank you hunter we have tried to create a culture since 2016 of really putting athletes at the heart of everything we do ultimately athletes are who we serve first and foremost they're the people who step on the platform and lift their heavy weights in our case literally to your question we have on our board or athlete USOC athlete Advisory Council representative who has an alternate we have a second athlete on our board we also have in common with I suspect every national governing body or own athlete Advisory Council which we work with directly as I mentioned in my opening remarks that as the body that actually has the final approval as a whole on our selection procedures for example to your point I mentioned in my opening remarks that there are specific actions that we have taken as a result of the feedback of victims of abuse not just in our sport but in others plus I make myself personally as do my staff available by phone email and event so let me let me make it a little easier because I appreciate that and let me be more specific because I this is an area of work in now we need to change the culture and we need experts to come in and help normally I do I think we all do when we're trying to adjust this issue so what are you doing in general to change this culture what have you put in place who have you what experts have you relied upon to come in to help with education to help with training to help with understanding how we change this culture is there anybody that you've reached out to in a professional field to address this issue and I've only got five minutes so I'm gonna ask if you don't have anything like that but just please say so so then we can move on no our our biggest experts on athletes are athletes okay thank you just cam it thank you I appreciate the direction what we have done is in the fall last year we hired a safe sport Council who is in taking all the information and has that expertise we currently are looking for another position to hire which will address specifically education and training our AAC is very involved mark Ladd Waqar AAC chair is here today with us and we really have engaged our athletes to speak up and have a voice we have a new campaign if you will called your voice and it's educating it's it's the better-known skaters more public-facing to come into communities and work with children in that community to make help them understand that they do have a voice and they can speak up so and then we've also worked on education and training and after speaking to survivors so we could make it more focused okay thank you mister ng we last six months or so we've had an opportunity of several different groups of national team athletes that are dealing with the training center so we've invited them to lunch to speak to them directly getting their feedback and asking for them what they need more from us and how we can further engage we are a large organization that has 3,000 member clubs so our safe sport department has an ability to get out to as many zone meetings regional meetings or invite ourselves to talk about curriculum and engage those athletes most recently we started our first other athlete Leadership Conference last April in Houston that I attended I spoke to these athletes these athletes are the 13 to 17 year olds that are not necessarily going to be Olympic athletes but those that are at their local clubs that have an opportunity to influence a greater number than we can of their teammates so we've met with them and talked to them and then from a Content perspective we've taken some criticism based on meeting with some survivors on our content so we've halted that distribution we've hired Presidium to come in and audit that fully we look forward to having that content improved and listening to the athletes on the best possible methods to distribute that and even last week at our convention we met with some of our safe sport fellows which are again local club athletes and they were very critical of the fact that we're not helping them with the right tools and specifically with social media communication so that'll be the next expertise we hire outside Thank You mr. Steele AC members are part of the board we have regular communication with them getting feedback from the athletes is one of the most important things in identifying maybe some unknown issues that that are out there and so that's one of the things that that we do pretty much on an annual basis it's best I do a postseason survey for the athletes and they're very candid about what they're happy about what they're not happy about in addition to that we are doing culture training with the entire organization it's not necessarily related to safe safe sport because that isn't the primary issue we did or an issue that we've experienced really in quite a while but um a culture training is important and then that involves you know engaging with the athletes and finding out what what gaps they see so people Academy is the group that we're working with on that and that's pretty much it thank you I I've heard from a couple of you and maybe this is to all of you right now just a yes question do you all agree that we should be adequately funding the US Center for safe sport to address education investigation and adjudication and mr. Andrews if you can just say yes or no yes yes yes yes thank you and one of the recommendations I think it was miss canva that you talked about was needing a national database of and people would you all agree that that is something that is necessary and starting with mr. Andrews yes or no yes yes yes and and I'm gonna ask mr. Hinchey and I don't wanna put you on the spot but I know we talked about this and I I agree we need to do something what have you learned what should we know about or what should be addressed when we're talking about banning people and is there anything that that you've learned from that that we need to take into consideration well I think right now for us you know with the change as relates to initial reporting adjudication the Center for safe sport what we're learning is that were our responses unfortunately are not as fast as they were when we were first handling it and I think so it goes back to your questions relates to funding funding is significant but at the same time we need to hire the right amount of people that can be responsive to the needs of our athletes and right now we're finding the feedback for us is that and what we're learning is that we're not getting to these as fast as we need to okay okay and let me also just put this out there and I hope this isn't the case but I hope you're not waiting for Congress to act to stand this up before we make the necessary changes to protect our athletes please tell me that you are still no matter what happens here we're you're still gonna move forward to change that culture to protect our athletes to do what is necessary within your organizations is that correct and can I start with mr. Andrews yes absolutely yes yes and and just further we need to absolutely have a culture of reporting that is safe for everyone yes okay and then you talked a little bit about a campaign tell me what you think the campaign miss cam it and I know we've talked others that safe sport what kind of campaign are we talking about that would be necessary so in this cases where we're also working on educational materials that are aged adequate naw we're waiting for the USOC to develop that we have a campaign called your voice and it's too you know part of the problem when there is abuse and especially with young children they don't know how to express it they don't know what to say I'm I'm I don't have any background in this but my observation and experiences that that there's a lot involved with being afraid to talk to someone about it so this campaign is really to say you have a voice and you need to express it and let people know when there is something not right either with you or you observe it it is that a campaign that you are taking on through the organization or you are hoping that safe sport us safe sport will take this on it's something that US Figure Skating has has done already and I think we have a t-shirt back here - okay thank you I see it your voice is powerful that's great thank you let me ask the dynamic now between the ng B's and USA Olympic Committee what what is it that we need to know that is happening between that relationship in other words are they dictating mandating certain things that can or should be done with the ng B's to address this culture is there more work that needs to be done is the interaction between the two working how it should and I don't I'll leave that open to the the committee can you please address that for me yes they are they are mandating certain elements especially with regard to our adherence to the US that is a sport but ultimately it comes down to the ng be first to take the action to protect their own athletes listen to their own athletes and put into place actions that pacifically will protect athletes within that sport and that's what we've done and like I'll just be quickly that they are developing its continuing its evolving and meanwhile we are also going ahead and doing it but we do feel important that it is important that if the USOC would have a collective program that all the ng PS can benefit from it and have the same message and information getting out to all in jeebies okay it's absolutely a priority that is clear to them today and has been communicated to us having said that I think and I've said this previously we look at this as our problem you know the survivors the abuse that has occurred in swimming and although we've invested in a program that we think has been very strong over the past eight years it absolutely needs to get better and I think we have to think we can rely upon anybody else we owe this to our athletes therefore I see this is our number one priority and and for us to continue to be a priority and if the USOC can help we're willing to do that we're willing to share and learn but we feel like this is on us just that that that partnership has been crucial for our organization we are smaller and so the the resources that they've been able to offer up as far as helping us with you know guidance on the implementation changes and to circle back about the the mental health question that was asked you know that is something that's important to us that doesn't happen doesn't come up that often but when it does you really need to have a resource for for an athlete and just recently it was announced to all of us that the the USOC is going to be adding this as a as a resource for our athletes and we were very excited to hear that thank you thank you

hi everyone i can't tell you how happy i am to be in georgia at least for a few days the last couple of weeks in washington have been insane not only do we have to deal with nancy pelosi's mismanagement of congress but we have to witness her using this covid crisis as leverage to push their far left wing progressive yes socialist ideology right now she's holding up a bill that is designed to help businesses and individuals get back to work so we can get this economy back on track and she's holding it hostage to push her socialist ideals look they know how important this election is in fact they understood how critical this election was back in january of last year when they introduced their top legislative priority which was house resolution one now i sit on the committee that this bill went through and let me tell you how bad this bill was because it was a federal takeover of our election system you see they learned in california how to manipulate the elections you know in the last congressional election two years ago republicans won several seats in california on election night but because of mass mailing of ballots and ballot harvesting after election after the polls closed for two and three weeks boxes of ballots kept mysteriously appearing at the election office and two and three weeks later we lost almost every one of those elections this is what they wanted to do nationwide but because we fought so hard against it even though it passed the house we were able to keep the senate from taking up this bill but nancy pelosi and the democrats saw this coveted crisis as the opportunity to do what they could not do legislatively by getting individual states and secretaries of state to send out mass mailings of ballots and they have done that and this is what they're planning to do in november now we can stop this i'm going to continue to fight hard against this in congress but the way that we're going to overcome this is to make sure that we overwhelm them at the ballot box that we have more voting than they do and the way we're going to have to do this is working harder than they do we can win the house back it's very close it's going to be a very close election but the republicans can take back control of the house we can hold the senate and yes president trump can and i believe will win but only if we put everything we have in this election we have to work like the future of this country depends on it because it really does look america is strong i'm so proud to be an american and i believe our best days are ahead of us but we're going to have to work to win god bless you and god bless america you

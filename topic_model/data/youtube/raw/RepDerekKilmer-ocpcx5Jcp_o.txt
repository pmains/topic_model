Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to honor dr. Elson Floyd the president of Washington State University who passed away this past weekend let me start with a little bit of background every member of my family went to the University of Washington so I was actually raised to root for the Huskies and to root against the Washington State University Cougars now before dr. Floyd passed I admitted to him that having worked with him over the years and having admired his leadership I suddenly found myself rooting for Washington State University too you'll be glad to know that eventually my family started talking to me again I was proud to call Elson Floyd a friend and a partner he led the University during incredibly difficult times in our economy and he never hesitated to make tough decisions that he believed would be best for his university and best for his students that even include cutting his own salary during the Great Recession he fought for opportunities for his students and in fact the number of students of color at WSU doubled during his tenure I think it's worth pointing out he wasn't just a leader for Washington State University he was a leader and a visionary for all of higher education in Washington State it wasn't just about what was good for Washington State University was what was good for higher education how do we make sure we have an ethic where we're advocating for more people to have more opportunities to get more education to higher levels he understood that he understood that because he understood that education is the door of Economic Opportunity because he had lived it himself he did all he could to ensure that opportunity was felt not just in pullman washington and not just at the University of Washington in Seattle but all throughout our state we saw in my neck of the woods at Olympic College in bremerton where because of dr. Floyd's leadership WSU set up a four-year program in engineering and that sounds kind of wonky but here's the reality of it what he did change lives it meant the young people in brem could see the opportunity to actually learn at home study for four years get a degree in engineering and then go work in private industry or go work at our shipyard there are now young people who have opportunities that they would have never had before if I hadn't been for Ellison Floyd's leadership what he did changed lives he was such a good man he was ethical and he was wise and he had that extraordinary combination of big heart and big brain and courage his life has been celebrated in the days since he passed and I just want to be one of the people to celebrate him I'm going to miss him and I want to extend to the entire WSU community my condolences but most importantly I want his family know to know that we lost a very special person and that our thoughts and prayers are with them Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back

last night on the show we discussed how the left and right have both dropped the ball on cannabis legalization however my next guest's bill the state's reform act offers significant cannabis reform on a federal level she gonna kick it to the states she believes it will bring people together from both sides of the aisle and one big happy hazy circle joining me now the bill sponsor south carolina republican congresswoman nancy mace welcome to the show good evening and thank you uh great to have you here when did you decide to go all bob marley on the republican caucus i applaud you yeah well actually i've been working on cannabis reform since i was a state lawmaker before i actually ever came to congress in the first place so it's an issue that i campaigned on in my general election last year i represent charleston south carolina and along the coast down south of there it's a swing district and something that i campaigned on it's important to me personally and this has been a very long very expensive and very harmful federal war on plants and it's time to end it we have all but three states in this country that have some form of cannabis legalization my home state of south carolina we permit cbd just south of there it's in florida they have medical california has full adult and recreational use telling me it's time that the federal government yeah federal government federal law should catch up with where states already have are and have been for a number of years and so what your legislation is saying is basically uh we have been so prohibitive at the federal level you know this is a schedule one drug it is categorized with the what are considered to be the most harmful and addictive substances on the planet yet the vast majority of americans live in states where it is at least medically legal so the state should be the ones who decide but we've still got thousands of people in prison for cannabis crimes non-violent ones right not non-violent cannabis crimes and this bill has a criminal justice component at the federal level states of course because this is states driven straight states would be in the driver's seat they can determine no one's no one state laws would be forced to change under this particular federal bill but it does get the federal government out of the way it provides a tax structure very low tax structure at 3 percent it regulates it allows states to do whatever it is that they want and we have people there are about 2 600 people that would be affected in federal prison that are convicted for and serving non-violent cannabis only crimes that would be able to be released and have their records expunged and then states would be able to do what they want to do i try to be very thoughtful about including measures that both conservatives and republicans moderates and democrats could get along with this is this is a nonpartisan issue it's 70 30 in most states across the country a super majority of americans are living in states where there's some form of legalization or another where they live this is common sense and pragmatic well it's interesting because i'm not surprised that joe biden and kamala harris are lording over an administration that's very bad on the war on drugs particularly you know the war on cannabis which continues and does such a great disservice to our veterans i hope that this passes i know that you will get sponsors outside of your caucus and i celebrate that i'm glad you took the time i'm glad you put the thought into it i wish more people in congress are rational like this uh congresswoman mace thank you so much yeah thank you so much do you smoke do i smoke oh my goodness well i actually i have a personal story related to to cannabis myself um when i was 16 i was raped i've told the story before but i was given i was given prescription medication um that made the feelings i had of depression worse and i stopped taking those prescription drugs and i turned to cannabis for a brief period of time in my life and so um when i talk to veterans this bill is particularly protective of veterans good ensuring that they are protected not discriminated against yeah and that the va um can utilize cannabis for their ptsd and their protections for ptsd so when i talk to vets you know i feel that pain because i see that pain it hurts because i felt that pain before in my life and veteran suicide uh we see it every single day yeah and and there has been an uptick since the botched afghanistan afghanistan withdrawal thank you so much for sharing your story don't uh don't fear the the reefer and thank you for bringing all of this to light please keep us posted

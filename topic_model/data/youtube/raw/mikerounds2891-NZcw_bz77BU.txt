our next speaker is someone that you may know as a business person as a leader of our state legislature as a two-term governor and now as our u.s center but what many people don't know is he has truly became an expert and a leader in cyber security you also may not know that while i was an undergraduate at sdsu he was a police officer and it is my hope that those records are cyber secure today center mike rounds thank you sit down thank you thank you listening to the governor uh speak about challenges and the fact that we need cooperation in south dakota and the fact that we have denny sanford once again stepping up and saying i believe in south dakota and i want to make things better and i'm investing in something which will make a difference and something that we can build on and something would be matched reminds me back a few years ago when i had to go to the legislature i wanted to go to the legislature as governor and i asked him to put 39 million dollars into a wet hole in the ground in western south dakota the home state gold mine and we tried to share with them at that time how critical it was for young people to stay in south dakota and do cutting-edge research today because of what they did stepping forward and having the guts to put that kind of money in and follow it and ask hard questions but to take and go home to to citizens and say if we put the money in now we're going to make a change in our state that will go on for generations today we have over a half a billion dollars being invested in that gold mine and we're doing big edge technology research right now with regards to dark matter dark energy cutting edge where young people in south dakota can stay here and work well this is one more opportunity very similar to that during the past week i came back from washington dc where it's a little bit different than out here people don't necessarily always get along we come back here and we see people cooperating we see people standing up making commitments finding partnerships that's critical sioux falls stepping up again as well mr mayor i wish you the best working with your team i think you've been a progressive community that has looked forward to making the same types of investments in washington sometimes we fixate on what's in the past we fix it on what's going on and who's to blame and why it isn't working that's not what we're doing here in south dakota today today we are working and focusing on what can happen in the future in 1958 chairman thomas watson from ibm declared i think there is a world market for only about five computers thank goodness it didn't happen that today the world has transformed into something that mr watson could never have envisioned our very way of life whether it be communications healthcare financial services agriculture or the energy sector are all connected together but that inner activity has come at a cost we have more potential for vulnerability than at any other point in our history our societies become interconnected to the point that just one bad actor could do a lot of damage to a lot of people real fast everything we do whether going to the grocery store flipping on a light switch taking a shower or boarding a plane all depend on cyber security making certain our nation's strong cyber security presence is critical in maintaining a safe and a secure world today more than ever we have a responsibility to make certain that the united states is protected from nation states and cyber crime who wish to do us harm if you visit with business owners in rapid city sioux falls or any small town in between they'll tell you one of the biggest challenges they face is getting the workers they need to be successful the same is true in the cyber security community according to a 2021 study there are currently 2.7 million unfilled social security jobs globally president griffith has indicated hundreds of thousands of jobs right now available for young people capable of working in cyber security so much my work in the united states senate is focused on cyber security given my role for four years as the chairman and now two years as the ranking republican member of the cyber subcommittee the cyber security subcommittee on the armed for services committee united states senate as a nation we need to address the growing demand for cyber workforce they pertain to all levels of government civilian and military as well as the private sector to grow the workforce we need to for cyber education as early as possible and that's why plan investment in cyber activity or cyber academy for k-12 education is critical this is a great idea cyber education is a vast upon that includes training our kids to be computer scientists data scientists coders engineers and mathematicians at the national level we need to do all we can to incentivize our best and brightest to seek cyber careers including through premier cyber education institutions like dsu for years dakota state university has been a leader in developing the men and the women who keep us safe in cyberspace today's announcement solidifies dsu in the state of south dakota as the home of the next generation of leaders in the cyber security industry the plans for tomorrow are great and that is a future that's worth celebrating today and now the rest of the story today in world events we see where the united states and russia are engaged in a great power struggle nato is in the muppet we stand here and we watch and in the news every single day we look at what's going on and we wonder whether or not mr putin is going to invade ukraine he sees in his self-interest it used to be that the first attack we feared was a nuclear attack today we know before there is any attack on a country the first attacks come with getting information from space and then creating havoc using cyber tools mr putin will attack the communication system in in in ukraine and around the area he will attack the transportation system attack their energy system all of which will be precursor before he ever commits russian soldiers into battle the same thing we find in almost every battle space that our young men and women find themselves confronted in today and cyber is at the forefront of protecting them regardless of their it's an ied protection system in this in the central part of afghanistan or whether it's looking at internationally at what's going on in terms of breaking down our space communications capabilities it all depends on our ability to not only fight a war in on the air or in the air land and sea but in space and in super space young people here in south dakota have an option because here not only as we increase the numbers that are available they will become experts not just in what we call cyber security but in artificial intelligence because we can't defend our nation without becoming leaders at artificial intelligence and it's here today but there's something else as well we need them in business and we need them to be able to be profitable for businesses and to invite businesses to solicit them and to keep them here at south dakota which is what this is all about but the other piece of this and the important part of it is we also need those same young people who become active and are part of the private enterprise system to also give part of their time in helping to save the world and that means working with the department of defense our justice department uh the national security agency as the governor has indicated homeland security and so forth we do both we can do both because these young people are the best and the brightest and we've got opportunity to create these types of partnerships that will go on for generations to come this is the cutting edge this is like a city bank or a premier bank all over again for opportunities for young people today in south dakota and with that i want to just offer to you my congratulations to everyone involved in this huge project the governor and having the foresight to go to the legislative body the legislature for agreeing to work with it the city of sioux falls dsu and and what marie griffiths has been able to right now with us to denny sanford and all the folks that work with denny on a regular basis whether it be banking or health care partnerships are what make it work and the benefit the benefactors will not only be our nation but a whole bunch of really really bright young people who get to stay and create families in south dakota thank you thank you senator rounds and thank you for your leadership in this very important area

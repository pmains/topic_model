[Music] Millennials have become the largest segment of our workforce and are quickly becoming the largest segment of us voters and while they are very negative about Washington one of their own is trying to change that here's our power player of the week no I wasn't scared I wanted to get some accomplishments under my belt that's Elise Stefanik explaining why she turned me down for a power player profile two years ago when at age 30 she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress I wanted to make sure that my first impression to my colleagues is that I am a workhorse I invest myself and learning about the policy issues and I add substantive ideas to the discussion I rise today in strong support of the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act representing 4 Drummond upstate New York Stefanik is a member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and as a Republican he wrote a change to Obamacare that President Obama song I wrote and passed the largest fix to our health care law in my first term we need a new direction running on the slogan new ideas a new leadership Stefanik campaigned on people's frustration with Congress I would ask every group that I met with raise your hand if you think Washington is broken every hand would go up answer use technology and transparency to make Congress more accountable I use the example of posting votes on Facebook that's using a new tool to reach out directly to constituents and hear back from them on every single vote that's something every member should be doing is there any pinch made quality of that you are a United States congresswoman there are pinch-me moments every day when I walk in and see the Capitol dome Stefanik started in politics a while ago I ran for student council secretary in sixth grade and I ran on the platform of bringing a snack machine and that is very popular I was gonna say I figure you won I won she worked two years in the bush 43 White House on domestic policy and that's the approach I'll bring to Washington then in 2014 she ran for Congress how much pushback did you get you're too young you're too inexperienced I got a lot of pushback initially very few people took me seriously Paul Ryan actually was one of the individuals that encouraged me and gave me great advice you have two ears and one mouth use it in that ratio listen to what voters concerns are Stephanie won her a swing district by 22 points and last year was re-elected by 35 points is it true that when you first got here you got stopped a lot I did and I still get stopped about once a month going back and forth to the floor to vote and if I wasn't wearing my pin there would be many votes that I would have missed Stefanik is not just young she's a maverick often bucking the party line she voted against the GOP tax bill this week because it eliminates the state and local income tax deduction important to New Yorkers and that's not all I've introduced the Republican resolution that climate change is happening and we need to find a solution while Stefanik has had an impressive start in Congress she doesn't plan to be there forever I do think institutionally Congress benefits from having a churn of new members and new ideas so I don't see myself being here for 25-30 years but maybe 15 or 20 you know every two-year cycle I need to go out there and make sure that I continue to earn the support from my constituents and yes we did discuss sex harassment in Congress while Stefanik says she hasn't experienced it she supports mandatory harassment training for members of Congress and their staff and that's it for today have a great week and we'll see you next Fox News Sunday

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of this bipartisan compromise to fund our federal government to the remainder of the year it is frustrating that the Trump administration inserted itself into our congressional funding negotiations last year which unnecessarily delayed this bill for seven months the delay created uncertainty in instability for local governments for schools businesses and the families we represent never less this final funding package we have under consideration today is a win for Minnesotans and for Americans Democrats stood strong and United and that's why this bill does not include any funding for president Trump's wasteful border wall which you wanted to pay for with cuts to our priorities here at home as a ranking member of the Interior environment procreation subcommittee I'm proud that we removed more than 75 poison pill writers from our part of the bill these destructive policies would have delisted endangered species rollback environmental protections and chipped away at our public lands in addition to removing these harmful Republican writers Democrats also succeeded in holding off many devastating cuts proposed by the Trump administration we protected the EPA from steep cuts to its work to protect the air we breathe in the water we drink we fully funded the Great Lakes restoration initiative to keep our lakes and our communities that rely on them healthy and we increased funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities which enrich the quality of lives across this nation this final bipartisan agreement will protect our environment meet our trust and treaty obligations to our Native Americans and safeguard our natural and cultural heritage sadly the president's 2018 budget would undo all this work so we must stay vigilant I would like to take an opportunity to thank the chairman of the full committee as well as the ranking member miss Laurey I'd also like to give a special thank you to the chairman of the subcommittee Ken Calvert and to all of our staff both Republican and Democrat on both sides who work so hard to make this bill possible along with my personal staff so as I yield back the remainder of the time Mr Speaker I encourage an aye vote on this bill thank you

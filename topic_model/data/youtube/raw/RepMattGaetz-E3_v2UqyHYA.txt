here now Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz he sits of course on the House Judiciary Committee good to see a congressman good to be with you ed and though I don't aspire to opine on someone else's marriage it certainly is worth noting that Kellyanne Conway is critical to the Trump communication vortex as she's a patriot and frankly I'm grateful to every member of her family her husband included because the burdens of public service are felt by an entire family and Kelly and Conway was assaulted when she was with her daughter imagine how George Conway must have felt when his wife and his daughter were in such a precarious situation assaulted by a citizen you're saying obviously we're not talking about the marriage in some months ago in the state of Maryland right now you you mentioned you're not going to get in the middle of marriage why is the president got in the middle of their marriage then I don't know I think it's very frustrating for the president to see the difficult circumstance that Kellyanne has put in she obviously is one of the most trusted advisors in the White House and not just within the White House but beyond a lot of us get data on information and context and benefit from her brilliance and so I think it's frustrating for him to see George Conway be so critical when Kelly Ann's been such a part of the great success that's driving the country the economic news he just mentioned getting out of wars renegotiating trade deals and creating one of the most dynamic senses of optimism that the country's had since or two why is the president not focused on all those things that you say are so wonderful in the country right now and instead doesn't this open the door to you and I tonight and others talking about the fact that George Conway and I want to answer you that you didn't answer this directly as now I hear the president he says that the president's has quote-unquote narcissistic personality disorder that is not true I spend a lot of time with the president and talk to him and the president is deeply caring about other people and so obviously that's a view held by someone who doesn't get to see how the president really I think feels for the country and does a lot to make sure that people live better lives I agree with you I don't think that it elevates the presidency or the country to be talking about somebody's marriage I think the president should focus on the amazing economic success he's having the renegotiating of trade deals and really the fact that we roll into a 2020 election cycle where Republicans are more enthusiastic than Democrats and with a lot of good reason real quick last one on the Conway's I wonder if having covered President Obama in his White House if there was a woman working in a senior position in a democratic White House and her husband was attacking her on Twitter if there would not be a lot of people in the media saying why is this man attacking this woman and not allowing her to be strong and stand on her own two feet it seems like everybody's jumping all in on this guy who is attacking his wife and not letting her be what you just said this senior adviser of the President there is a double standard for women in power often times and there's a triple or quadruple standard sometimes for conservative women and I think that's one of the reasons why colleagues of mine like Elise Stefanik are trying to do everything we can to find conservative women that we can elevate within our party Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders are the most well known Republican women in America and that's why I think the president gets so defensive when he feels like either Sarah or Kellyanne are unfairly under fire and Kellyanne Conway still has not gotten much credit at all in much of the mainstream media for winning that presidential campaign the first woman to win a presidential campaign but quickly I want to move on a couple of the topics number one you were admitting a moment ago that is an ally the president you wish he talked more about the economy maybe less about the Conway's why is he talking about John McCain who's been dead for a few months the President believes that one of the reasons why we lost the midterms is that we didn't repeal Obamacare and we still have a lot of Republicans and just Americans around the country who are frustrated and feel like the Republicans let the country down by failing to fulfill that promise okay John McCain voted no will look but they were there driving the agenda look I I've often been a critic of those two individuals but they were doing everything possible to get Obamacare repealed and it was John McCain I think more wanting to stick it to the president than reflect even his own beliefs I mean John McCain ran on repealing Obamacare and then with no real reason and with no real warning at the last minute voted against it and I think it's reasonable for the president to be very frustrated and let down by that despite all these other issues the president appears to be in a good political standing talked about the economy numbers of the CNN poll also enthusiasm among Republicans stronger in the CNN poll than among Democrats and then you have Democrats giving the president all kind of fodder whether it's Medicare for all how are you gonna pay for it the green New Deal and then the issue of abortion here's what bet or Roark said on the campaign trail ISM so the question is about abortion and reproductive rights and and my answer to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes he's one of the darlings of the left right now and he's saying third trimester go for it Vado has to win a primary before he gets into a general election and frankly that answer is not going to hurt him when you look at how far the Democratic Party has lurched to the left on the issue of life and abortion I wonder if NATO or arc also believes it's between a woman and a doctor if a baby has been born and survived an abortion 19 times Republicans in Congress have tried to get the born alive Protection Act heard 19 times the Democrats have objected and so as the party moves so far to the left third trimester abortions allowing babies to be killed even after they're born it won't hurt bado to say he supports late term abortion and that's a real sad real quick last thing there's another Democrat in this race Kirsten Gillibrand who is now saying that she's got legislation to sort of get in between patients and doctors to deal with the opioid crisis and wants to dictate how long you can get certain drugs my colleague Brit Hume noted on Twitter last night I thought when it comes to the issue of abortion for example we hear over and over don't get you see Brits tweet right there that you shouldn't get between a patient and a doctor I'm all for doing something about the opioid crisis all of us want to but how can Democrats all of a sudden say they're gonna dictate to doctors how much medicine they can dispense the answer to the opioid crisis is not more government it's more freedom in every state that's democratized access to medical cannabis you see fewer opioids prescribed you see a lower percentage of opioid deaths and so it's always such a Washington way to say that to solve problems we need to tell people what they have to do the reality is there are different solutions that work for different states and we do not want to impair that doctor-patient relationship with more government we never make things better when Washington inserts themselves in the document you say there may be an issue of hypocrisy in there as well congressman Matt gates we appreciate you taking the tough questions tonight

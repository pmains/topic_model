everybody so we just got done voting on two appropriations bills for the fiscal year 2020 here's the truth about what's in those bills and why I voted for them I'll say this I had some concerns mostly because we're still spending too much money as a country the top-line spending is still too high so what ivote for these well the reality is I already voted against our budget cap deal which addressed the top-line spending I already voted against that we lost that battle so now with appropriations bills we're voting on what to do with that money that was already authorized we don't have to like the top-line spending but I do have to admit this was a well negotiated deal the things that were in these appropriations bills were good for instance more money for border wall more money to hire more border agents removal of taxes on insurance and medical devices which will drive down costs for health care the secur Act which gives millions of Americans access to retirement accounts makes their retirement easier good things for Houston like money for maintenance in the Houston Ship Channel and femur disaster relief money all of those things are good I will end with this when we're concerned about the long term debt and as a millennial you bet that I am we have to be concerned with mandatory spending discretionary spending which is what we voted on today the things we vote on and fight about every single year that really only accounts for about 30% of our total spending and get this as a share of GDP that spending has been going down it's below historical averages you know what's going up you know what's really causing our long-term debt mandatory spending Social Security Medicare Medicaid that stuff is skyrocketing as a share of GDP that's what we have to be worried about especially as Millennials and Gen Z that's what we need to be talking about this stuff today was actually pretty well negotiated deal didn't like the top line but I reluctantly voted for it because there's some good things in there and you shouldn't understand the truth about what's causing our debt and what was in this deal today

from Iowa seek recognition without objection the gentlewoman is recognized for one minute madam Speaker I rise today to urge my colleagues to continue to work with the US Trade Representative Robert light Heiser to find agreement on the u.s. MCA soon I visit each of the 16 counties in my district every month and whether it's touring manufacturers visiting with farmers or stopping in to small businesses everywhere I go the message is loud and clear uncertainty is hurting our bottom line agriculture is the backbone of Iowa's economy one out of every five dollars is produced from Iowa agriculture in our state and supporting farmers is neither a partisan or a political issue it's simply the right thing to do between devastating weather events ongoing trade wars and the EPA's unprecedented abuse of biofuel waivers our farmers have been put through enough they're asking for our help and elected representatives we deserve to give them the right answer we must answer their call and get this deal done right and without unnecessary delay I thank my colleagues for the work they have done and I urge them to expedite negotiations and finalize this

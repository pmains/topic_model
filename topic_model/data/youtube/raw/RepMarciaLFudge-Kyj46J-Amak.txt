myself such time as i may consume the gentlewoman is recognized thank you mr chairman racial segregation in public education has been illegal for more than 66 years in the united states still american public schools are more segregated today than at any time since the 1960s the average african-american or latino student attends schools with the majority of children of their own race most of these schools serve a high number of low-income students forced to learn in old broken down buildings with fewer resources and disproportionately high rates of discipline segregated schools are inherently unequal creating barriers for the students who reside in underserved communities 66 years since the landmark decision in brown versus board of education the promise of equal access to education has yet to be realized today public schools are not segregated because the law requires it they are segregated by their zip codes segregation exists due to due to the erosion of a middle class tax base an erosion that has caused communities of color to become systemically poor essential services and public education are continuously underfunded these communities have been denied access to the intergenerational wealth that comes from home ownership due to discriminatory housing patterns and mortgage lending policies this is particularly true for black communities when districts split schools between affluent and poor neighborhoods it draws a bright line between the haves and the have-nots this type of separation inflicts the same harm on students today as legalized segregation did prior to 1954. that is why i introduced hr 2639 the strength and diversity act it directly addresses inequities in public education by authorizing funding to support local education leaders in their efforts to lessen racial and socioeconomic isolation in public schools the strength and diversity act will ensure every student has equitable access to a quality education this is one step toward remedying the issue of segregated schools the bill provides support for school districts that are developing expanding or implementing school diversity initiatives eligible school districts can devote funding to study the adverse effects of segregation provide equitable access to transportation create programs to attract children from neighboring communities and recruit new specialized teachers studies show school integration benefits students of all races even the conservative think tank the hoover institution agrees that diverse learning environments help close the achievement gap and lead to numerous academic social and cognitive benefits research tells us school integration results in cross-racial friendships and a decline in stereotyping allowing students to better navigate an increasingly diverse society and preparing them for real-world experiences mr chair the strength and diversity act is not new policy it is practically the same policy the obama administration sought to pursue in his 2016 opening doors expanding opportunities program which provided 12 million dollars to help school districts increase diversity nearly 30 school districts from 22 states and the district of columbia applied for the obama era integration grant but the program was eliminated by the current administration in 2017 without explanation that decision came at a time when research clearly showed a resurgence in segregated schools to totally ignoring this increase in separate educational facilities education secretary betsy devos moved to rescind federal guidance to assist school districts in pursuit of racial diversity when my education and labor committee colleague representative trone asked the secretary about this rescission she said she was unfamiliar with the guidance that was two years ago since then things have gotten worse not better mr chair we are experiencing a racial reckoning in this country despite efforts from 1600 pennsylvania avenue to sew racial division i remain hopeful now is the time to enact the strength and diversity act and provide school districts with the support they need to tackle the task of true integration this is hard work but necessary work and it is past time the federal government support local leaders to fulfill the promise of brown today i urge my colleagues to make a commitment to put an end to racial and socio-economic isolation and segregation in our nation's public schools by voting in favor of the strength and diversity act mr chair i reserve the balance of my time gentlewoman

now recognizes the gentleman from Texas mr. Williams for five minutes Thank You mr. speaker mr. speaker up until several weeks ago my state of Texas experienced a drought so severe that water levels were reduced to historic lows what conservation efforts were set to all-time highs lakes and reservoirs were bone dry wildfires were a constant threat in a cruel twist of fate Texas is now recovering from the worst flooding in recent memory rivers overflowed and dams burst in wimberley texas a town about 40 miles southwest of the texas capitol auto rushed over the banks of the Blanco River with enough force to rip houses off their foundations and carry cars like there were toys loved ones we're lost belongings and memories were washed away the last month has been marked by death destruction and disbelief I have met with first responders toward flood damage and spoke to the National Guard and regional FEMA officers about response and recovery operations my office established a response center in town to help with the recovery process although we are still in a period of morning that strong Texas spirit of resolve has proven more powerful than Mother Nature's fury just this week a nearby newspaper ran the headline quote hard-hit by flood wimberley assures tourists were open for business and I personally might add wide open for business mr. speaker this is the Texas way it's what we do today just a few weeks since the rains eased in the flood waters subsided wimberley is making a comeback nearly all of the businesses in downtown wimberley have reopened Cathy Mormon the executive director of the wimberley Valley Chamber of Commerce told my office they've had offers of help from around the country locals and visitors alike have come in and out and offered much and help from rescue to clean up efforts she said the outpouring of support has been astounding mr. speaker this is what I mean when I cite the Texas spirit of resolve we have and will continue to take care of each other look out for our neighbors and together push forward I assure you we will rebound from this tragedy quickly and fully may God bless her residence of Wimberly and may God bless all of Texas in god we trust I yield back gentleman

two separate house panels debated yesterday over the presence of extremism in the u.s military and the rise in domestic terrorism both of which were highlighted during the january 6 capital attack it comes as more former military and domestic extremist group members are being charged for their roles in the deadly riot by the day joining us now two lawmakers that oversaw those discussions chairman of the house or armed services committee congressman adam smith also with us a member of that committee and chairwoman of the intelligence and counterterrorism subcommittee congresswoman alyssa slotkin of michigan she previously served as a middle east analyst for the cia great to have you both adam thanks so much for being with us i'm i'm curious what you're finding now we've we've heard for a few years concerns about extremism uh and military in america's armed forces how widespread is a problem well we don't know and that's a starting point but secretary austin has made it clear that this is a challenge in the ranks um he talked about you know during his testimony when he was being confirmed it was really compelling testimony about what it was like coming up in the military as a black man and where it's gone and some of the things he encountered there is no question as we've seen across the country in the last four years with the rise of white nationalism the rise of white supremacy and a troubling crossover not just in the january 6 riots so that certainly is the greatest example of it but in many instances where you have members of the military who are part of these groups and what we discovered in the hearing yesterday is the military really hasn't done that much at the moment to find out okay who might be affiliated with these groups within the military so what we want to do right now is at least you know dive into the problem and with the republicans yesterday part of the problem in their response was they sort of they took on the role of sort of defense attorneys and say well if you can't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt why are we talking about it um i think there's enough evidence right now of the problem we've seen it across the country there is considerable evidence that within the ranks of the military we have issues with racism we need to figure out what they are how they're being addressed this is really crucial to making sure we have our military as strong as possible so we're at the beginning of this but we need to find out what the problem is and then what the best way to handle it is i think it's a crucial role for our committee to do that um congresswoman slot can what are we finding out about the people who were at the riot the people being charged and um maybe it's impatience media and patience but why is it so hard to make a deduction here on what exactly was going on because it does kind of seem so so basic well i think i mean we reacting to the fact that a disproportionate number of the truly organized truly prepared folks who came in the capital on january 6 who intended we believe to come in the capital long before the morning of uh january 6 had a military background they were either in the military or veterans of the military and so i think we've we've seen that in the arrest reports listen it has to be methodical and i don't think it's a secret anymore that there's overlapping law enforcement agencies that have an interest in what goes on at the capitol so you know it maybe it seems like it's taking a long time um what i think is taking a long time is that we don't have agreement on a 9 11 style commission um truly sort of stand back objective bipartisan look at what happened i think we need that that's been kind of frustrating to a number of members that we haven't been able to come to agreement on getting started on that that's such a good point and joe i mean we can't even agree on the fact that this needs to be investigated we can't even agree that this requires a 9 11 style commission to look at a mass assault on our democracy in process i don't know i mean where where are we if we can't do that well we've first of all it does need to be bipartisan of course the proposal wouldn't it be the proposal that was put forward would have put seven democrats on the committee and four republicans that's not going to work you can reverse that to seven republicans four democrats that wouldn't work the house and the senator split 50 50. they need to figure out how to get six republicans and six democrats on the committee six republicans and six democrats can be like jury selection like they can have a right to dismiss certain certain uh members there and they can keep the wing nuts and the back ventures who are going to be doing this for for for press clippings rather than getting to the truth they can veto those members but again they need to move forward with the 911 style commission and they need to do it in a bipartisan manner and i can't believe there aren't enough adults in leadership in the republican and the democratic party to figure out how to put your country first and get that done and there's so many questions to ask and one of those questions we just put it up on the screen uh chairman smith is the fact that 20 of the people that rioted yeah on january the 6th reportedly remembers our former members of the united states military yeah and that is deeply disturbing and that's you know big part of the reason why we had the hearing yesterday but i think what came out of our hearing yesterday gives you a little bit of insight as to why we're having so much trouble get this commission form the republican response whenever we start talking about this is to equate this with this you know the the the right-wing noise machine talking about you know woke um excessive excessive woke-ism if you will the idea that we're going to go out and persecute people just for something they thought or just for something they said that's certainly where where matt gates and others went yesterday is the idea that you're even going to try to address the riot on capitol hill that you're going to try to address right-wing extremism or what we've seen in the battle over voting rights you know they claim that their effort to shut people down from voting is to stop the rise of this unfair left wing you know sort of mythical attack that they have in their head and as long as they focus on that and say everything we try to do is just excessive it's not we are trying to get at a very real problem and i will say this i know there are republicans certainly on our committee most bipartisan committee in congress but elsewhere who want to address this but the pull of the trump people to make it into a deep-seated partisan political fight no matter what we say to sort of wish the problem away to imagine the white nationalism white supremacy that this doesn't exist it's a very strong poll that the trump people are doing it makes it difficult to get to that common sense bipartisan agreement congresswoman slotkin this is obviously extremely important work to identify those in the military that are hold extremist beliefs or racist beliefs but what forgive the perhaps overly simple question but what can be done about it what could be done to prevent people like that from being in the military what sort of steps or screening can be done to weed out people who have these sort of beliefs in the armed forces well first of all i do want to say that there are some regulations rules already on the books right it's not an open season for anyone who wants to join the military i've visited i can't tell you how many recruiting stations in and around michigan and you know if you've got a swastika tattoo when you come in for your physical exam to try and get into the military that's going to be a flag that's going to be something that's going to potentially be prohibitive it should be prohibitive so there are rules i think we need better data collection and then frankly i just don't see a better person than general austin to be the one who leads on this issue he's already had a one-day stand down for the entire force to talk about this issue i've heard from people who went through that um but you know someone who grew up not only as a black man but who was involved in uncovering nests of skinheads you know in the 82nd airborne this is someone who has real experience with this so i'm going to let him have the time that he needs to tackle it but i think what i got the impression from yesterday from my colleagues across the aisle is one a real reluctance to even look at this issue and it it made me think if you know we have been so so focused over the past 20 years on rooting out people in the military who might have a link to a foreign terrorist group who might be sympathetic to an al-qaeda message to an isis message we have been hyper focused on that so why can't we say take the same vigor and energy and put it into rooting out people who might be white supremacists congresswoman alyssa slotkin and congressman adam smith thank you both very much for everything you're doing and for being on the show greatly appreciate it richard eyes we've been reading i've been reading over the past year

let me welcome my ranking member thank you i'll try to be brief mr under secretary welcome madam secretary welcome i don't know whether to call you secretary or governor or general as an attorney general or professor i think i'll stick with secretary um i'm not going to concentrate as much on the arithmetic today because i think we all know the president whatever president submits a budget and congress kind of does what it wants um i shouldn't say congress because i don't know how the house works i've learned a little bit about how the senate works uh senators are like cats they do what they want sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn't but but uh we're in the process of putting together a budget and i don't think i'm going out on a limb by saying it'll be different than the president's submission it's not personal to president biden that's always the case i want to say a word about our energy policy i know a lot of departments touch on it but uh i'm pretty much a and all of the above energy type guy um i believe in uh fossil fuels i believe if we can produce wind and solar efficiently guys we ought to pursue it i believe in hydrogen potential there um thermo thermodynamic or hydro electric potential and nuclear and and i mean i'm kind of an all-of-the-above guy i just think we ought to pursue whatever works and whatever is most efficient i just make two quick points um i get concerned about the administration's hostility toward fossil fuels i do i think not all but i think with many members of the administration it's more of an emotional reaction than a rational reaction in in my judgment uh as a result of natural gas we're one of the few major countries that has reduced our carbon uh emissions and that's just a fact and we did that because of natural gas um some people who believe that that we need to well they believe we need to start over with our energy policy and get rid of fossil fuels and if we do that it's going to be pretty expensive and and i think for a fraction of the cost we can try to make our fossil fuels cleaner and i'm talking about carbon capture storage and utilization and it makes sense to me to pursue that and i think a rational person will pursue that now somebody who sees climate change i don't mean to be this is in a pejorative sense but somebody who sees sees the climate change issue as a religion is probably not going to look at that but i don't think that's rational point two i think nuclear can be a part of our mix it's expensive but it's clean and it's much safer and i hope we can talk about that a little bit today i watched with with amazement when uh um mrs merkel in germany who i think has done a pretty good job of running her country it's not my place to say but i've got an opinion like everybody else but i looked in amazement when she got rid of all of her nuclear and said the solution to our energy needs is to buy the gas from from russia it never made sense to me but i guess none of us are perfect but i wanted to share those thoughts with you and i hope we can talk about some of them today and welcome to both of you

>> THANK YOU. >> ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET THE DEMOCRATIC  RESPONSE FROM CONGRESSMAN ADAM  SCHIFF, THE OUTGOING CHAIR OF  THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE. CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, YOU WERE ON  THE SHOW JUST AFTER ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND APPOINTED A  SPECIAL COUNSEL IN THE CASE OF  THE TRUMP DOCUMENTS. YOU SAID IT WAS THE RIGHT MOVE. DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT  THIS SPECIAL COUNSEL? >> I DO THINK IT'S THE RIGHT  MOVE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY IS JUSTICE  EVENLY APPLIED, BUT THE  APPEARANCES OF JUSTICE ARE ALSO  SATISFACTORY TO THE PUBLIC, AND  HERE, I DON'T THINK HE HAD ANY  CHOICE BUT TO APPOINT A SPECIAL  COUNSEL, AND I THINK THAT  SPECIAL COUNSEL WILL DO THE  PROPER ASSESSMENT. I STILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE  CONGRESS DO ITS OWN ASSESSMENT  OF AND RECEIVE AN ASSESSMENT  FROM THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY  OF WHETHER THERE WAS AN EXPOSURE TO OTHERS OF THESE DOCUMENTS,  WHETHER THERE WAS HARM TO  NATIONAL SECURITY. IN THE CASE OF EITHER SET OF  DOCUMENTS WITH EITHER PRESIDENT, BUT, YES, I THINK THE SPECIAL  COUNSEL WAS APPROPRIATELY  APPOINTED. JONATHAN, IF I COULD ALSO  THOUGH BECAUSE MY STATE IS STILL TRYING TO DIG OUT FROM  THESE TERRIBLE STORMS, I WANT TO THANK THE PRESIDENT FOR MAKING  AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION AND LET CALIFORNIANS KNOW THAT IN THE  THREE MOST AFFECTED COUNTIES,  THEY CAN NOW APPLY FOR HELP IN  TERMS OF REBUILDING THEIR HOMES  AND THEIR BUSINESSES AND THAT  OTHER COUNTIES NEED TO REPORT  THEIR DAMAGE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR RELIEF  AS WELL. >> YES, THANK YOU FOR THAT. BACK TO THE DOCUMENTS, YOU RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE  NATIONAL SECURITY ASSESSMENTS. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT NATIONAL  SECURITY WAS JEOPARDIZED HERE AS MANY INCLUDING YOU RAISED THAT  POSSIBILITY WITH THE MAR-A-LAGO  DOCUMENTS? >> I DON'T THINK WE CAN EXCLUDE  THE POSSIBILITY WITHOUT KNOWING  MORE OF THE FACTS. WE HAVE ASKED FOR AN ASSESSMENT  IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY OF THE MAR-A-LAGO DOCUMENTS. I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET THAT  SAME ASSESSMENT TO THE DOCUMENTS FOUND IN THE THINK TANK AS WELL  AS THE HOME OF PRESIDENT BIDEN. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THESE  DOCUMENTS WERE, AND I'D LIKE TO  KNOW WHAT THE IC'S ASSESSMENT  IS, WHETHER THERE WAS ANY RISK  OF EXPOSURE AND WHAT THE HARM  WOULD BE AND WHAT MITIGATION  NEEDS TO BE DONE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE  APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH  WHAT WE REQUESTED IN THE CASE OF MAR-A-LAGO.  >> THE WHITE HOUSE KNEW ABOUT  THIS ON NOVEMBER 2nd, SO THAT  WAS ALMOST A FULL WEEK BEFORE  THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. WE DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT IT. THE PUBLIC WASN'T INFORMED UNTIL THIS WEEK, AND IT WAS ONLY AFTER THE STORY WAS, YOU KNOW, WAS OUT THERE AND REPORTERS WERE ASKING  QUESTIONS. SHOULD THEY HAVE BEEN MORE  FORTHCOMING, AND SHOULD THIS  HAVE BEEN REVEALED EARLIER? >> I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION  WILL NEED TO ANSWER THAT  QUESTION. I'M GOING TO RESERVE JUDGMENT  UNTIL THEY DO, BUT I THINK IT'S  IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE  BIDEN APPROACH WAS VERY  DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT IT  LOOKS AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THAT IT WAS INADVERTENT THAT THESE  DOCUMENTS WERE IN THESE  LOCATIONS. WHEN THEY WERE DISCOVERED, THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY PROVIDED  TO THE ARCHIVES OR TO THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. THERE WAS NO EFFORT TO HOLD ON  TO THEM, NO EFFORT TO CONCEAL THEM, NO EFFORT TO OBSTRUCT THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S  INVESTIGATION.  ALL OF THAT IS IN VERY SHARP  CONTRAST TO DONALD TRUMP'S  HANDLING OF THE SITUATION, SO AS YOU POINT OUT, THIS IS A VERY  DIFFERENT MATTER. BUT NONETHELESS I THINK IT'S  APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIAL COUNSEL  TO LOOK INTO BOTH.  >> REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING THEY  WILL INVESTIGATE HOUSE  COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN COMER SENT A  LETTER TO THE WHITE HOUSE  COUNSEL MAKING A SPECIFIC LIST  OF REQUESTS. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT THE  DOCUMENTS WERE.  THEY WANT INTERNAL  COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE AND THE PENN CENTER  WHERE THE DOCUMENTS WERE FIRST  FOUND, A LIST OF ALL PEOPLE  WHO WORKED IN THAT OFFICE THAT  WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY HANDLED THESE DOCUMENTS AND A  FEW OTHER REQUESTS. THEY SEEM ON THE FACE OF IT TO  BE REASONABLE REQUESTS. SHOULD THE WHITE HOUSE COOPERATE WITH THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT  COMMITTEE ON THIS? >> WELL, THOSE REQUESTS ARE  COMPLETELY HYPOCRITICAL WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE  MR-A-LAGO SITUATION. I THINK CONGRESS OUGHT TO HANDLE BOTH SITUATIONS THE SAME WAY,  AND THAT IS, WE OUGHT TO GET A  BRIEFING FROM THE INTELLIGENCE  COMMUNITY ABOUT ANY POTENTIAL  RISKS TO NATIONAL SECURITY OF  WHERE THOSE DOCUMENTS WERE AND  WHAT THEY CONTAINED, BUT  CONGRESS SHOULDN'T TRY TO  INTERFERE WITH THE  INVESTIGATIONS. I THINK SADLY THAT'S WHAT  MR. COMER'S OBJECT IS. HE SHOWED NO INTEREST IN  INVESTIGATING THE FORMER SERIOUS SITUATION WITH ABOUT 100  CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AT  MAR-A-LAGO WITH EVIDENCE IN THE  PUBLIC DOMAIN OF OBSTRUCTION.  NOW HE IS SUDDENLY INTERESTED IN INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT BIDEN. I THINK CONGRESS NEEDS TO BE  CONSISTENT HERE AND TAKE THE  SAME APPROACH. I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT TO BE  DOING THINGS THAT ARE WILLFULLY  INTENDED TO INTERFERE WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S WORK. >> SO YOU DON'T THINK THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD COOPERATE  WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS? I MEAN, YOU FOUGHT MIGHTILY TO  GET THE WHITE HOUSE TO COOPERATE AND FOR THE MOST PART THEY DID  NOT. >> JONATHAN? >> YES. >> I NEVER SAID THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULDN'T COOPERATE. WHAT I SAID WAS CONGRESS OUGHT  TO ACT CONSISTENTLY AND  INTERFERE WITH WHAT THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT IS DOING. THAT'S WHAT I THINK MR. COMER IS INTENDING, BUT, YES, I THINK THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OUGHT TO  COOPERATE WITH ANY APPROPRIATE  INQUIRY FROM CONGRESS. >> YOU'VE ENDORSED PRESIDENT  BIDEN'S RE-ELECTION. HE HASN'T ANNOUNCED YET, BUT  WE EXPECT HE WILL. DOES ANY OF THIS COMPLICATE HIS  EFFORTS TO MOUNT A RE-ELECTION  CAMPAIGN AND MAKE A STARK  CONTRAST WITH DONALD TRUMP? >> I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY  STARK CONTRASTS WITH DONALD  TRUMP ON POLICY, ON DECENCY, ON  A DEVOTION TO THE TRUTH, ON HIS  HANDLING OF FOREIGN POLICY, ON  HIS DOMESTIC POLICY PRIORITIES,  ON HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND  ATTACKING CLIMATE CHANGE, IN  GETTING A BIPARTISAN  INFRASTRUCTURE BILL DONE WHEN  TRUMP TALKED ABOUT IT FOR FOUR  YEARS BUT DID NOTHING, WHEN  TRUMP MISUSED MILLIONS, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN AID  MEANT FOR AN ALLY AT WAR,  UKRAINE, TO TRY TO EXTORT THAT  COUNTRY INTO HELPING HIS  CAMPAIGN. IN CONTRAST JOE BIDEN HELPING  UKRAINE FIGHT AGAINST A RUSSIAN INVASION OF THEIR LANDS. SO THERE ARE LOTS OF SHARP  CONTRASTS FOR JOE BIDEN IN THE  NEXT ELECTION. >> ALL RIGHT, CONGRESSMAN  SCHIFF, THANK YOU FOR JOINING  US

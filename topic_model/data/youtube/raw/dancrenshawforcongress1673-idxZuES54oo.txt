- Hey friends we have a fundraising deadline
coming up in 72 hours. It's the final quarterly deadline before the November election
and this is important, it's important because this is our chance to show that we have real momentum and that we are going to
race to the finish line not looking back. It's also our last chance to show that it's important to
continue the policies that we care about. 3.9% unemployment rate over 4% growth over multiple quarters, strong national security and reinforced military. These are all good things
and we need to continue them and if there's one thing to remember these are the policies of
more liberty and more freedom and less big government. That's what you're supporting, that's what I'm asking you to support, that's what I'll be
fighting for in Washington so please support our campaign
before this next deadline.

for weeks the media's been showering praise on governor andrew cuomo for his handling of new york's Kovach crisis but at the same time they were warning us that florida under the leadership of governor Ron de Santos was a ticking time bomb for viral spread people are gonna die because of decisions that were made by Ron de Santos in Florida we were already seeing states like Louisiana and Florida and Indiana you start to have surges in cases that decision was reckless it is a big gamble well that ticking time bomb never went off so let's go through the stats for starters Florida currently has five times fewer kovat hospitalizations per 100,000 in New York Florida also has 18 fold lower Cova death rate we were warned that the virus would tear through Florida's nursing homes and retirement communities including at the villages but what actually happened while dozens of residents initially tested positive the villages currently has zero that's right zero coronavirus patients in its hospital meanwhile in New York Wow the Cuomo administration just ordered nursing homes to readmit kovat positive residents and the results have been absolutely horrifying with more than 4,800 dead remember all that media fear-mongering over Floridians heading to the beach how dare they go to the beach at least one liberal columnist ghoulishly tweeting then deleting that this was a good way to thin the ranks of Trump supporters nice people well that turned out to be wrong to two Florida counties that kept beaches open Duval and Brevard Rivard I always say that wrong have only seen a fraction of the hospitalizations and deaths were adjusted for population and that's all it was well of course this isn't surprising given the latest science that shows sunlight may be effective at killing Kovan studies also show that viral transmission rarely occurs outdoors and yesterday Cuomo was forced to admit the real super spreader well people who were locked down 66% of the people were at home which is shocking to us this is a surprise overwhelmingly the people were at home we thought maybe they were taking public transportation and we've taken special precautions on public transportation but actually no because these people were literally at home so despite locking down later than New York and allowing their citizens a lot more freedom Florida has yet to see the epidemic the experts all promised almost would come joining me now I am so happy he's here Florida Governor Ron de santis governor those dire predictions have not come true so you guys obviously just must be lucky it can't be any of the approaches you've taken along the way your thoughts well a look Laura we really focused on where the greatest risk was and that was to our elderly population but particularly our elderly in long-term care facilities so we acted very early to suspend visitation there to make sure all the staff were screened before they went in there we've now we've required the wearing of PP but we put our money where our mouth is for these facilities we've now sent out ten million masks just to long-term care facilities in the state of Florida I also have 50 National Guard strike teams that go around to the nursing homes and do testing and we just started doing we have a mobile lab that has a rapid test lab on it and so that's also going to nursing homes you can get the results back in 45 minutes and so that is where if you look at the numbers overwhelmingly that's where the fatalities are occurring people 65 and up but really even 75 and up in Florida 60% of the deaths are 75 and up so let's devote resources to help those folks who are the most vulnerable we did that in Florida and I think some of these other states we've seen did not do that they took their eye off the ball Governor DeSantis what have you discovered if anything about those Spring Breakers who were on the beach there was n commentary about how awful they were and they were selfish terrible rotten people was there or could you track any spike in the area or any increased transmission what happened there yes so we have virtually no evidence of any outdoor transmissions leading to outbreaks be it a beach be it a golf course the fishing anything that Florida's known for the transmission is typically occurred in enclosed environments when you have repeated contact with someone such as in the home and so our policy was never to try to drive people indoors if we had golf courses open we did have a number of places at beaches open we encouraged fishing and running and all that stuff and I think we cut we wanted to take advantage of our climate and so I was criticized for that but I think if you look at the record clearly you didn't see an outbreak everyone was so upset about Clearwater Beach I grew up about 15 minutes from there in Pinellas County but if you look at Pinellas County's numbers they've had very relatively few cases for having a million people so a lot of this is narrative a lot of that was based off partisanship in the media but it has not been borne out in facts and you mentioned Jacksonville beaches they had a spasm in mid-april that Jacksonville was reopening beaches but if you look since then ICU admissions have fallen off a cliff hospital admissions down sharply then a later use down sharply were three weeks later if this was going to lead to the apocalypse why are we seeing all the indicators go down instead of up yeah well this is how Governor Cuomo is responding to concerns about the economy watch this is not a situation where you can go to the American people and say okay how many lives are you willing to lose to reopen the economy we don't want to really lose any lives and you start to hear these to me whether absurd arguments governor your response you're either callous or you you just want to keep people shut in well what I would say is focus on where the risk is we've done that in Florida with what we've done with long-term care facilities that does not require the economy to be shut down at all you either do it or you don't obviously a lot of those states that have had way worse outcomes in Florida they did a harsh shutdown but they didn't do things to protect the long-term care physician in fact some of them were forcing sick seniors to go in there and that was infecting other people so I don't I think it's a false choice I think you absolutely can do both and I hope all the beaches are open soon in Florida people need to be outside and enjoying the outdoors and enjoying the beautiful state of Florida governor we wish you all the best I mean that the country suffering and the economy is suffering everywhere but keep up the great work

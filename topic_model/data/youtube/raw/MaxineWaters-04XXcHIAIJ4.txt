we have speaking of which another czar number 16 as i've been saying the white house appointing ken weinberg as the nation's pays our master compensation whatever you want to call him uh i wonder though what he's what he heard about the treasury secretary on this whole pay cap issue what he had to say we are not proposing an ongoing government role in setting policy and compensation we do not believe it's appropriate for the government to set caps on compensation all right so if he's not for pay cups if we're not setting pay caps why do we have a pay let's ask democratic congresswoman maxine waters she favors having a pay czar congresswoman i if i heard the treasury secretary right that's not what this dude's going to do so why do we need him well i think we do need someone watching the store you know we've not had the kind of watchful eye from our regulatory agencies that could see trouble coming uh could talk about the unreasonable compensation and the bonuses and the golden parachute and so if he does nothing more than place transparency into these companies so that the public and the stockholders and the investors can know what's going on that's enough for me all right so if he's just if there's no cap if he's not going for caps then he's not going to cap any salaries all right so what is he capping what is he doing what's up why don't we have to look at bonuses we are going to look at those bonuses particularly so is he going to cap both so is he going to cap bonuses is that what he's going to do well we're going to talk about what's fair what makes good sense and whether or not there should be golden parachutes or whether or not there should be the kind of compensation that short-term rather than long-term uh stock options that kind of thing there's a lot to look at a lot to talk about after all this is the taxpayers money uh that is being watched these companies have taken the top bailout money the taxpayers money no no i see congressman i see your point and it's a very good one i'm just wondering though with all of these banks and brokerage houses rushing to return that money i guess so they can go back to paying their executives whatever they want what happens in the interim to those who don't now if their salary isn't being capped but you seem to be implying their bonuses could be then i don't understand the role of this pesar is he then saying i'm going to put a limit on how much a ceo can get in bonuses or in stock grants i'm going to put a limit on what his executive vice presidents can get with the same what is it because the treasury secretary seems to be no big deal don't worry about it what is it well we're looking at the top five executives in the companies that have received a lot of tarp money those executives will be watched we will be looking at their bonuses and we will be coming up with a formula similarly do you have a number in mind do you have a number one the reason why i asked is because at first it was a half a million dollars right they have a million dollars they said anyone learns more than that too much what do you say no no no no that's not any numbers have like that have been put on it and i'm i'm not the czar but what is being talked about bonuses that do not exceed one third of compensation no golden parachutes no big cash outs over a short period of time uh what is compensation congresswoman i mean compensation includes bonuses now a lot of these guys bonuses are bigger than their salary so all i'm asking because i can't get a handle on it what is it well obviously we're talking about the difference between pay compensation and bonuses we're going to define what those differences are you mean compensation compensation is pay it is bonuses it could be it could be and it could not we're separating that out we don't know you don't know i love you dearly but you don't know and the czar doesn't know and the treasury secretary doesn't know he's going to define what is a bonus and i think we should let the czar do that what do you have against a watchdog over the taxpayers money don't you think for example uh the people should be looked out for after they have given and loaned no doubt the congressman i guess what i'm trying to find out that people don't even know what the watchdog is going to be watching because he hasn't given up no they will know we we hope you will help to get that information out i try i'm asking you when i talk to the white house i talk to treasury no one gives me a number i just want a number if i'm going to pay attention i want to know what pay he's going to look at we're still working on on legislation as a matter of fact we have a hearing tomorrow in the financial services committee we will be determining these things you will be the first to know and we want you to have your information out okay maybe not the very first but you'll be right up there you better not call cnn first because i'm going to be listening congresswoman seriously i want you to know we want you to help disseminate information the taxpayers have a right to know and that's what you're all about helping to disseminate information let's look out for the taxpayers all right i just want to know what the heck that information is that's but it's congresswoman it's coming yes that's christmas but uh you're a great guest always good having you on thank you thank you so very much

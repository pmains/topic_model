that's an honor to be here and out of Washington DC and in Washington County that's a lot nicer here trust me it's important to me I want to come by and just say a few words of respect you know we gather here today to honor and to remember to honor those who served and to remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for this great country and as a member of Congress the hardest thing we do is comfort the families who have lost a loved one in a time of war they were part of something greater than themselves and we're safer today because of them and every day that goes by quietly on American soil it's yet another silent reminder of the courageous acts of Valor our men and women in uniform have performed to protect our freedoms and we are fortunate particularly from this state that we have no shortage of brave men and women who are willing to serve in fact there are more men and women serving in uniform from the state of Texas that from any other state in the Union I'm personally very proud of that I pray that God's hand will protect them and bring them safely home this month I visited our embassy in Baghdad in Iraq not a pretty sight the current situation in Iraq and Syria is concerning the lack of a Status of Forces Agreement and the political neglect of that part of the world created a force of evil to mankind the likes of which we haven't seen since the Nazi Third Reich came to power the rise of Isis is a dark threat to America and everything that we hold dear they have turn our gains in two losses our victories in to defeat their brutal beheadings and crucifixions scourge the human experience we be clear the strategy and policy of our nation of this nation should be clear that we will defeat and destroy Isis wherever it exists today we also honor the flag of our fathers didn't remember that my father was a World War two veteran I can't the state can't go by without me thinking about him Obama deer on a b-17 part of what we now call the greatest generation then the heroes of this new generation or the next greatest into those who made the ultimate sacrifice those lies embody what we see in the Gospel of John chapter 15 verse 13 when he said greater love hath no man than this but a man laid down his life for his friends I recently commemorated victory over Europe day in Normandy sort of on my bucket list I was telling John about as I mentioned my father was part of the air campaign in advance of the d-day invasion and we laid a wreath at the memorial in the cemetery of white crosses in honor of the American men and women who lost their lives that day and they play taps as Old Glory wave let me tell you something there wasn't a dry eye and that most sacred shrine of America's most revered fallen heroes at ord Omaha Beach or bloody Omaha as its described the scene from the movie the longest day and saving private ryan which so accurately portrayed the challenge and the great sacrifice made that day the cliffs where the Army Rangers climbed into the Nazi bunker is pointing and raining bullets down upon them it was really quite a sight to see I don't know how they did it the courage that they demonstrated that day is beyond measure and yet they persevered then they won that great victory liberating Europe for freedom crushing evil and advancing the great cause of freedom and all this under the great leadership of Colonel Earl rudder a fighting Texas Aggie there are a few aggies i'm sure this audience my wife is 12 but memorial day began as a decoration day many many years ago after the Civil War to give tribute to the bloodiest of wars to ever take place on American soil so I like to close I think it's appropriate with a quote from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address as he consecrated the dead on that bloody battlefield his words are timeless and as relevant today as they were so long ago the lincoln wrote and said that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living to be dedicated here to the unfinished work for which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is fitting for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here shall highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth men don't talk like that like what he said so we'll remember his words for a very very long time so let me just end with this may God bless Texas may God bless Washington County may God bless the United States of America thank you I was able to bring some this isn't john Omaha Beach some sand back from that beach that I wanted to present to the Veterans Association along with the flag that was flown over the United States Capitol and out of the Washington County Veterans thank you so much thank you thank you

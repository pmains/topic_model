kevin cramer is the north dakota republican senator joins us right now sits on the senate banking and budget committee senator um i don't know even technically the president can do this but he wants to do it and he's going to go full throttle doing it and let the courts argue it out but he thinks it's a winning election issue what do you think well i don't really see neil how it's a winning election issue because of the people that i talk to the vast majority of them are very upset by the the unfairness of this just yesterday i was at a veteran veterans appreciation event up at the mandan hidatsa rikaran nation here in north dakota and a native american veteran came up to me and said exactly this he said you tell that president there's a native american veteran in north dakota who wants his money back he i want my gi bill benefits even back he said if you're going to do this then what about me i paid a price as well for my education and so he i think he represents probably millions of other people and for various reasons you know in some cases they didn't you know they didn't accrue any debt in some cases they paid off their debt in other cases they had to make choices that that led them a different direction maybe to serve in the military so they could go to college and then you have people who accumulated debt but they didn't do it through the federal system and so they don't they're not eligible which brings up your point about whether he can even do it uh you know constitutionally and if he can it'll be for a very narrow group of people that uh you know that he might have some authority over you've heard obviously the president come back at republican senator and saying all right they had nothing uh to you know to argue about when it came for tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the wealthy they're against college kids who can't pay their bills you say so yeah so i'd say to him after the tax cuts and jobs act which did not disproportionately help the wealthy but rather as much as anything helped the middle class and the working class in this country we had a booming economy we had everybody working we had salaries and wages going up you know we we had a very low unemployment very high wealth creation at every level including young people getting jobs and getting paid well to do them and to your previous to charlie gasparino's point showing up for work in those days and um and so i'd say yeah let's let's let's cut taxes across the board if you want let's cut regulations let's create more job opportunities and wealth but to suggest somehow that this is the fair way especially in inflationary time free money i mean giving away money for a product by the way neil that's already more inflationary even than the consumer price index and that is of course higher education you know you're right about that it runs about four times the pace of the the cpi uh we'll watch it closely senator good catching up with you always a pleasure thank you

today I want to take the opportunity to talk about an important piece of legislation that may or may not yet be on your radar last week I introduced the Central Bank digital currency anti-surveillance State act to Halt the efforts of unelected bureaucrats here in Washington D.C from stripping Americans of their right to financial privacy digital Assets in the digital economy are the future but the Federal Reserve should play no role in developing a central bank digital currency or otherwise known as a cbdc the consequences if we get it wrong are far too serious the Biden Administration is currently itching to create a digital Authority authoritarian styled surveillance style digital dollar and through an executive order they are pursuing analysis on a retail cbdc that would not be open permissionless permissionless or private in fact it would be ridden with significant risks to Americans privacy Security Financial inclusion and a whole lot more this kind of digital currency would give the federal government access to and control over literally every financial transaction conducted by Americans that's why I along with a number of my colleagues introduced the cbdc anti-surveillance state Act fact it's going to prohibit the fed from issuing a cbdc directly to anyone it's going to Bar the fed from using the cbdc to implement monetary policy and control our economy and it's going to require the fed's cbdc projects to be transparent if they get to go forward to be transparent to Congress and the American people we need these Common Sense guard rails to prevent unelected bureaucrats here in Washington from sacrificing Americans right to financial privacy is I think Mike Gallagher's committee is going to show us tonight we do not want to emulate the CCP we should not be taking our our direction from the Communist Party of China developing a digital version of the US dollar that makes transactions more efficient extends Financial inclusion and does not compromise American sovereignty or privacy will send us into the next several generations of the digital economy and we can't afford to get this wrong and with that before I turn it over to the Cajun who is always more fun when he's raging I just want to point out for those of you that I know have been waiting for this day for at least uh several months tomorrow night is the Congressional hockey game end if you want to see the greatest trophy in sport it will be the Stanley Cup will be in the whips office from 9 30 to 12 today and with that Steve scalise

question about structure our kids had fairly structured lives before the pandemic school obviously five days a week and then basketball practice or gymnastics or swim class or Girl Scouts whatever it may be they have pretty structured lives how much do you recommend that parents try to create regular structure in children's lives you're in the stay-at-home period structure is very important for kids so especially for young kids but for all their kids too of being able to predict what comes next so things that you can keep in place like hey on school nights you know we go to better kept and do school in the morning you know these are the times that we have dinner this is you know what time we go to bed on weekends those types of structure and routines are really important I think again it's about it's like these are the times we're gonna do things but then if you notice hey I'm getting stressed and overwhelmed my child is communicate that and say you know what we're having a stressed day today and we're gonna put on our jammies and we are gonna watch a movie and teaching them again that that's okay you set up expectations for yourself but it's important to check in with yourself and no one you need a break that's great advice

yes mr. secretary as I understand it taken the NRC can withdraw this commit you withdraw it as with prejudice they could let you withdraw without prejudice so they could deny you from withdrawn the license application in any case they let you withdraw it wastes confidence is an issue as we move forward are you going to propose legislation to effectively legislate waste waste confidence well again it's we're going to take it one step at a time the Blue Ribbon Commission is there to look at what we know now also what they will anticipate things being developed for the coming decades the NRC believes that the current stores drug has storage a waste doesn't pose an immediate environmental threat we can do this also we can store it safely securely so for many decades and so we have time to develop a strategy so the blue mission will be is being asked to make recommendations including legislative recommendations that would then go to Congress and so again so rather than jumping at this given that the NRC has said that there could be half century century before we actually have to do so you know before it becomes an environmental challenge let me just make one other comment that you that you can comment on one of the things that's concerned me is we talk a lot about the science and technology and all that kind of stuff here today all important work but at some point in time this stuff's got to get out in the real world right I think arpa-e is a great start for particularly small new technologies those kind of things things that might not be able to compete in the real world until they have this this chance of this kind of thing what about ng NP you know you've I understand you've awarded 40 million dollars for the design work to two companies for two different designs on on what the prismatic reactor and the pebble bed reactor you're now negotiating fine cost share when are we going to start working with industry so that I is an appropriator and we as an appropriation committee know what's going to be expected of us what's going to be the government's responsibility and share and when does industry step in and when are they going to take over we need some I think formal type of group organization whatever that works this out ahead of time I'm surprised that after awarding these two things that we are now discussing with them cost share you would think that would almost have been a done deal before the bids were awarded I'm and I'm just saying are we doing it right do we need a do we need a better organizational structure to work with industry because ultimately we do all the science in the world if industry don't want it'll mean anything we've got it's got to be deployable I agree but you know I think the department energy has been a good partner with industry we we and and with the with Congress legislation have had a program to help companies go through the licensing for example for the new ap1000 nuclear reactor that's still in this process but that program after 2010 is ending and it's well on its way so in these issues any new design reactor if industry is not going to pick it up we don't really want to see this this is these are big expensive things and so we will continue doing this in the small modular reactors there's been a lot of new industry interest in this so we are facilitating that in facilitating again with the licensing so we can actually help industry get going but eventually you want to step back and say look is just going to stand on its own and that's again isn't for example this generation nuclear reactors like the ap1000 you know after you built a couple of them two or three that should be enough proof that you can build these things on time I budget then let industry decide okay let me ask just one follow-up and then I can be done mr. Chairman I don't have to come back so i'll be done is what would if the NRC denied your withdrawal of the application what would that do to your fy11 budget the question I think we're gonna have to regroup there wouldn't we I we I don't know we'll see I mean if there's no ancillary plan you they're gonna I think if they deny our request and we'll have to reassess whether it be the word will have to reassess where we are okay thank you

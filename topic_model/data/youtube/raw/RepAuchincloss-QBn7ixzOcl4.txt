ALSO A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. >> IT IS SO INTERESTING, JULIE TSIRKIN, THANK YOU FOR THAT, IF THAT IS A PERFECTLY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. I'M JOINED NOW BY MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESSMAN, JAKE AUCHINCLOSS, -- AS WELL AS THE TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEES. WELCOME BACK TO THE BROADCAST. I'M CURIOUS, YOUR REACTION, SIR, TO THE WEAPONIZATION COMMUNITIES APPROACH FOR THESE ALLEGED WHISTLEBLOWERS THAT THEY'VE INTERVIEWED. WHAT A CASE DO REPUBLICANS EVEN THINK THEY HAVE HERE? >> WELL, I CAN'T GET UNDERNEATH THE TINFOIL HAD TO GET INSIDE THEIR BRAINS AND FIGURE THAT OUT. WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT WE 100% DO HAVE WEAPONIZATION THREAT IN THIS COUNTRY, IT'S JUST 100% NOT FROM WHERE THE REPUBLICANS THINK IT IS. RIGHT NOW, IN WASHINGTON D.C., THERE IS A THINK TANK CALLED THE AMERICA FIRST FOUNDATION. THE AMERICA FIRST FOUNDATION IS BASICALLY A MAGA WHITE HOUSE IN WAITING. RIGHT NOW, THEY'VE GOT LOBBYISTS AND LAWYERS WHO ARE WORKING ON HOW THEY CAN ERODE THE INDEPENDENTS OF CIVIL SERVANTS, AND SCHEDULE OF. HOW THEY CAN BREAK DOWN THE FIREWALL BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HOW THEY CAN UNDERMINE CIVIL MILITARY RELATIONS, BASICALLY ALL THE TOOLS DONALD TRUMP OR SHE HAD IN 2016, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PLAYBOOK IS AVAILABLE TO THE NEXT MAGGOT PRESIDENT. THAT, IS WHAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. >> YEAH, I'D SAY SO. WE'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION ON THAT IN EARNEST. BUT RIGHT NOW, LET'S TURN TO THE CHINA COMMITTEE'S FIRST PRIMETIME HEARING THAT WAS HELD THIS WEEK. HERE'S SOMETHING SO THAT YOU HAD SAID DURING THAT MEETING. TAKE A LISTEN. >> THE RESILIENCE OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS UP TO US, YES, THE KREMLIN AND THE CCP HAVE -- BUT ALSO, IN THE PAST TWO, YEARS OF THE WORLD WATCHED AS AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT SUMMONED THE MOB TO OVERTURN A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION, AND KILL OFFICERS OF THE LAW. JANUARY 6TH, 2021, WITH XI JINPING'S BEST DAY IN OFFICE. I HOPE THE BIPARTISAN SPIRIT OF COMPETING WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY OVERSEAS EXTENDS TO DEFENDING DEMOCRACY HERE AT HOME. >> NOW YOU, KNOW CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTRY WAS LISTENING AND CALLING THIS HERON THIS THE COLD WAR MENTALITY, I'M CURIOUS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT. I'M YOU CONFIDENT THAT THIS BIPARTISAN SPIRIT OF FOCUSING ON CHINA WILL REMAIN? >> IT NEEDS TO BECAUSE WE'RE FACING A GENERATIONAL CHALLENGE HERE IN COMPETITION WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. THE CCP DOES NOT RESPECT THE VALUE INHERENT TO AN INDIVIDUAL, THEY THINK PEOPLE ARE POUNDS OF THE STATE, AND THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED ON SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS ON FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND SPEAK PEOPLES INALIENABLE RIGHTS. THOSE ARE NOT SELF ACTUALLY LADING TRUTHS WE, HAVE TO DEFEND THEM HERE AT HOME BEFORE WE PROMOTE A CHAMPION OVERSEAS, AND THE MESSAGE I WANT TO SEND TO MY COLLEAGUES BOTH ON AND OFF THE COMMITTEE AND THE GOP IS THAT YOU CANNOT GO OUT AND SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VALUES BASE COMPETITION WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, IF YOU ARE NOT DEFENDING THOSE VERY SAME VALUES HERE AT HOME. JANUARY 6TH, OBVIOUSLY, SETS US BACK THERE, BUT SO DOES THE WEAPONIZATION SUBCOMMITTEE. ALL OF THAT IS BUSY DOING THE CCPCS JOB FOR IT. >> I KNOW YOU JUST RETURNED FROM TAIWAN, SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME RECENT VIDEO THAT WE OBTAINED, NBC NEWS GOT RARE ACCESS INSIDE A U.S. NAVY MISSION OVER THE SOUTH CHINA SEA WHEN THEY SPOTTED THIS CHINESE FIGHTER JET. LOOK AT THAT, RIGHT BESIDE THEM. APPARENTLY THEY THREW ALONGSIDE FOR THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR, HOW DANGEROUS IS THIS SITUATION TODAY WITH CHINA, WHAT DOES TAIWAN NEED FROM THE U.S. RIGHT NOW? >> IT'S DANGEROUS, THE PEOPLES LIBERATION ARMY IS NOT DOING A GREAT ZONE IN PERSIANS ON BASICALLY AN HOURLY BASIS, IT USED TO BE A RARE EVENT, THEY ARE NOW VIOLATING TAIWAN'S AIRSPACE REGULARLY IT'S WEARING GONE TAIWANESE. IT JUST UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR US TO EXIT A FOREIGN MILITARY SALES FOR THEM AND TO CONTINUE OFFICER TO OFFICER MILITARY TRAINING BECAUSE THOSE TWO THINGS IN CONCERT SENDING THEM THE WEAPON THE MATERIAL THEY NEED AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE TRYING TO USE THEM IN A DEFENSE STRATEGY SHOULD BE CRITICAL IN THE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS FOR SHE JINPING. IT'S NOT JUST MILITARY THOUGH, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. I THINK A REAL THREAT IS A ONE-TWO PUNCH OF ENERGY BLOCKED KADE PLUS DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN, RIGHT NOW TAIWAN ONLY HAS ABOUT 2 TO 3 WEEKS OF ENERGY RESERVES ON THE ISLAND, THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY IS NAVY CODE BLOCKADE TIME ON SPORTS, IF 68 THEIR ENERGY SUPPLIES, AND THEN BE PUMPING IN DISINFORMATION AND PROPAGANDA TO THE ISLAND, TRY TO ENGINEER A COUP FROM THE OUTSIDE AND. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S A MORE LIKELY NEAR TERM THREAT THAN AN AMPHIBIOUS INVASION. BUT WE HAVE TO BE WORKING WITH TAIWAN ON BOTH FRONTS. >> YEAH, THAT IS VERY SOBERING, LET ME GET SOMETHING AS ALSO SOBERING BACK HERE AT HOME. INVESTIGATIONS WITH -- AIRPLANE COLLISIONS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. TWO PLANES CAME WITHIN 100 FEET OF EACH OTHER IN AUSTIN'S. AIRPORT LET'S CHECK OUT ON VIDEO RECREATION THOSE BASED ON THE FLIGHT DATA. SO THE SOUTHWEST FLIGHT IS TAKING OFF, WHILE A FEDEX PLANE IS ABOUT TO LAND. WHAT IS HAPPENING LATELY, AND HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU. I MEAN, WHAT IS CAUSING THESE NEAR MISSES. IS YOUR COMMITTEE GONNA LOOK INTO THEM? >> YES, WHEN YOU SIT DOWN IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF AN AIRPLANE, AND YOU BUCKLE IN YOUR SEATBELT, YOU DESERVE TO FEEL SAFE, AND NOW THAT THE FAA, THE PILOT, THE AIRLINE, OR EXERCISING SUPREME CAUTION IN THE UTMOST SAFETY MEASURES. IT SEEMS THAT SPRING AT THE EDGES HERE. I'M ON THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEE, THE FEDERAL VA SHOULD ADMINISTRATION. THE AUTHORIZATIONS UP THIS YEAR, THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY BE A FOCUS ON THE COMMITTEE AS WE TALK WITH THEIR LEADERSHIP BECAUSE, RIGHT, NOW THE FLYING PUBLIC IS NOT GETTING THE DEAL THEY DESERVE. >> OKAY, WHAT WE DESERVE THIS

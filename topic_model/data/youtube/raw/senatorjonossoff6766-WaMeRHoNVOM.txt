from georgia is recognized for five minutes thank you mr chairman and thank you to our panel ms osborne i'm working with mayor davis in augusta georgia which hosts the cyber center and has a growing high high-tech industry to expand autonomous vehicle development capacity possibly including the development of a testing center in or around augusta for autonomous vehicles can you discuss how augusta and its work on autonomous vehicle development could contribute to the quality of life and transit opportunities and technologies over the next few years in georgia and across the country i'm happy to uh my uh uh lens towards transportation is much more about the policy that governs how any mode or any technology of transportation moves through it uh the more we build a multimodal system multimodal roadways the better things like autonomous vehicles will work uh the better transit will work the more easily people will be able to walk and bike to that transit and to their opportunity unfortunately i think in our current policy environment these technologies will be somewhat squandered so i'm hoping to see places like augusta and and my friends in pittsburgh who are heavily involved in autonomous vehicles uh look at how uh the design of our transportation system and particularly our roadways uh interferes with the deployment of avs uh uh because i think we'll find that the same things that interfere with av testing and movement is what's making our current system with old-fashioned people drivers less efficient and less safe as well

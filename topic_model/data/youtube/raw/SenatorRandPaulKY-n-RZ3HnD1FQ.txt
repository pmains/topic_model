but my question to you is can't you give us a little bit more on schools that we can get back to school that there's a great deal of evidence and it's actually good good evidence the kids aren't transmitting this it's rare and the kids are staying healthy and then yes we can open our schools I feel very strongly we need to do whatever we can to get the children back to school so I think we are in Lock agreement with that

the senator from Missouri mr. president this is a classic example of everything's been said but not everybody has said it yet one of the great traditions of the Senate is to be sure that everybody says it and we're going to say it now we're going to continue to say it until the house finally has that boat it's been pointed out that this agreement was signed well over a year ago it's been pointed out that our two biggest trading partners are Mexico and Canada in that order been pointed out lots of focus on agriculture every state every state is an agriculture state every state has that as significant part of their economy nobody in the world does that part of the economy more efficiently more effectively than we do and so that's important it's important to realize that lots of other things are in trade as well but agriculture is going to be mentioned a lot until we get this done whether I was at the Missouri State Fair in August are the roundtable meetings I was at in our state in October it constantly comes up eighty eight billion dollars is the agricultural economy in Missouri about the same amount I think senator Hoeven just said that his state was in the top ten ours is - we export about four billion dollars worth of Ag products but we also export pickup trucks and airplanes and lots of Technology from our state export our fair share of beer cans and other things that go all over the world and we're going to continue to make that happen but opening markets makes a big difference it also makes a big difference in how you look at the world if you have strong trading relationships you're pretty careful about how you deal with all those other relationships and we need to do that we need to have this vote the votes are in the house the votes are in the Senate it's up to the speaker to bring this up I think the US Trade Representative is working as hard with Democrats in the house as he could possibly be expected to do to maybe look at those last few things that might make this a better deal but Sarah Portman did a great job talking about why the choice here is too continue to have NAFTA which has been great for all three partners Canada Mexico and us or do you want to have us MCA which in area after area after area has the twenty year update that needs to be had

all right joining us right now is congresswoman karen abbas so uh thank you for being with us here this afternoon so what does this mean for the george floyd justice and policing act well i am certainly hoping that it will give us the momentum that we need to get the bill on president biden's desk i will tell you that all along since we passed it out of the house on march 3rd we've been having very positive discussions on a bipartisan basis and my colleague in the senate senator tim scott as well as senator cory booker we have been working very hard so this hopefully will be the final push we need and and what does it mean in the senate i know it passed pretty much along partisan lines in the house did it not yes that's correct that's going to be challenging right i mean it's there but like you said perhaps the timing is right now well the timing is absolutely right now i mean the nation calls upon us to really begin to look at ourselves in the mirror we need to transform the way policing is done in the united states and you know for so long we've been watching video after video after video we have got to make some significant changes and i believe that we know what to do i don't think the george floyd justice and policing act is going to be the only thing that needs to be done but it will be a significant step forward we've seen decades of video here congresswoman however very little has been done so you talk about bipartisan talks but uh what about bipartisan support and bipartisan action oh no it's all all connected absolutely i mean bipartisan talks mean nothing if they don't result in bipartisan votes and so that is the whole point and i do believe that we will get there i know that uh tim scott's colleagues in this in the senate have put him in charge and have basically said you know if he can come to an agreement with us that he will have their support and so we will see but i do think that you know we have to look at this in the context of not even just our own country but how the world looks at us i mean we consider ourselves the beacon of human rights but yet we have this human rights issue right here in the united states i mean since the trial started on march 29th over 30 people have died at the hands of their interactions with police officers since george floyd was murdered a year ago over a hundred people have died in officer-involved shootings and so we have got to figure out a way out of this problem it actually is an embarrassment in the eyes of the world you have worked on the issues of racial justice for decades now what does this mean to you personally to to hear this verdict today well it just provides me with tremendous hope after you have worked on an issue for decades uh you know you can get weary you can get weary and so to me this is a tremendous adrenaline boost in a positive way uh there is hope i mean we have advanced in so many ways in our countries and it just seems like every time we take ten steps forward we take five or six back and so i am hoping that this is indicative of a new day and i will say i mean 30 years ago i thought it was going to be over with the rodney king tape 30 years later we're still struggling but we never saw anything like this uh you've uh created a tweet storm i'm just looking at your twitter page here he says as we exhale from the relief of justice finally being delivered in a case like this we have to remain focused now on the sentencing which i believe should be the maximum so you've moved forward beyond the guilty verdicts here yes because unfortunately in the rare case when we have seen someone convicted of murder and it's rare and i'm not even just talking about police but um the sentencing then can be very light and so i'm worried about that and we do have to keep our eyes on that it was interesting because we spoke with usc law professor jody armour earlier and he talked about the issue of trying to reform sentencing and so he said it'd be interesting to see what happens here as we look at a man who doesn't have a criminal history and minnesota law you know for for basically a man like himself derek chovin would say that the average sentence on that first count alone would be 12 and a half years instead of 40. so where do you find that balance well you know number one i'm not sure he is a man without maybe he hasn't been convicted of anything but one thing that was not entered into the trial is that he had 17 other incidences of brutalizing people and so as far as i'm concerned he has a a long record unfortunately because of the way things are structured he was never held accountable for that so i think for something which was literally the torture and murder of someone uh you i i don't i couldn't even imagine you not having the maximum sentence all right so before we let you go here what needs to happen next what needs to happen next is my colleagues democrats and republicans need to get the job done and i do believe we will all right congresswoman karen bass thank you for your time we really appreciate it thank you

rise in support of two pieces of bipartisan legislation the house will consider later today i introduce these bills alongside republican colleagues because there is simply no question that they will save lives and protect our children the first piece of legislation is critical in the fight against the opioid crisis plaguing every single community across our country known as the mate act this legislation is simple it will require that doctors who prescribe highly addictive pain medications are trained to spot signs of addiction and intervene accordingly health care professionals often interact with and have opportunities to provide effective treatments for individuals suffering from addiction critical opportunities to save lives but far too often those chances to help are missed in fact research has shown that most clinicians could not confidently diagnose and treat patients with substance use disorder stigma discrimination and lack of understanding about addiction have prevented far too many americans from accessing evidence-based care for addiction the mate act will change that i drafted this legislation after meeting with a physician in my home state of massachusetts dr jim baker who shared the tragic story of his son max dr baker was visiting his primary care physician one day when his pcp asked him if there was anything he could do to help dr baker pleaded with his pc for help with max max's opioid addiction to dr baker's surprise his pcp did not have adequate education or understanding of addiction to point dr baker in the direction of appropriate treatment for max max baker died from an overdose at just 23 years old every person in this chamber knows that the baker's story a parent's worst nightmare is not unique each of us have heard similar stories from families who are willing to do anything and everything to save the life of a loved one battling addiction we can get these families another path for help by passing the mate act i am grateful to dr baker for his advocacy for this legislation as well as my colleagues representatives trone carter custer and mckinley who were instrumental in securing today's vote the second piece of legislation is just as essential my bipartisan bill with ranking member mcmorris rogers congresswoman axne and congresswoman kim doesn't need a fancy name it just needs to become law that's because it will extend and strengthen key youth and young adult suicide prevention efforts many of us have talked about the youth mental health crisis extensively in the past two years have only increased the urgent need for solutions that protect our children that starts by authorizing the garrett lee smith memorial act and the key programs it supports to provide mental health resources bolter's suicide prevention efforts and end the stigma with associated with getting help make no mistake these programs have a long track record of success study after study has proven that these initiatives have significantly reduced youth suicide rates for young people and saved tens of thousands of lives we must ensure that these programs continue and i urge my colleagues to support this legislative package so we can do just that

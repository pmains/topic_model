>> Brennan: AND WE'RE BACK WITH CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER OF ILLINOIS, WHO IS ONE OF TWO REPUBLICAN MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING THE JANUARY 6 INSURRECTION. FOOGOOD MORNING TO YOU. >> GOOD MORNING. >> Brennan: I WANT TO START WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. YOU HAVE THESE MASSIVE RUSSIAN MILITARY EXERCISES. HOW DO YOU ASSESS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING OF THIS SO FAR? >> I'M ON TEAM AMERICA, TEAM UKRAINE. TERE ARE SOME NUANCES I WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENT THAN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO STAND UNIFIED. THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB, PARTICULARLY IN BRINGING OUT INTEL EARLY TO TRY TO DEFANG ANY RUSSIAN FAR TIFF THAT COULD COME WITH UKRAINE. WE KNOW ABOUT THE DISCUSSION OF A FALSE FLAG ATTACK, AND NOW WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT RUSSIA MAY DO THAT. I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS GOOD. ONE THING I WILL ADD, THOUGH: WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN NORDSTREAM 2 REGARDLESS WHAT HAPPENS IN UKRAINE BECAUSE RUSSIA IS USING ENERGY AS A WEAPON. >> Brennan: RUSSIA IS USING ENERGY AS A WEAPON. >> YES. >> Brennan: ON RUSSIA GENERALLY, THERE HAD BEEN FOR SO LONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR STANDING UP TO RUSSIA AND STANDING UP FOR DEMOCRACIES, BUT THERE IS THIS INTERESTING TREND WITHIN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, YOU HAVE SENATORS, LIKE JOSH HAWLEY, WHO CALLED ON PRESIDENT BIDEN TO RULE OUT INVASION INTO UKRAINE. AND SIMILAR SENTIMENTS ELSEWHERE. HOW SIGNIFICANT OF A PORTION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION? >> I DON'T THINK IT IS A HUGE PORTION, BUT IT IS WAY TOO BIG AND IT IS GROWING. A FEW YEARS AGO IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING LIKE RAND PAUL WHO MIGHT SAY SOMETHING, AND NOW THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FOLKS DOING IT. WITH TUCKER CARLSON TALKING ABOUT HOW UKRAINE IS PART OF RUSSIA. I THINK IT COULD BE A COUPLE OF THINGS. NUMBER ONE, IT COULD BE NNAIVETE. I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS DONE A DECENT JOB IN ENGAGING IN CULTURE BATTLES. HE HAS SEEN US DEFENDING IN ESSENCE. UKRAINE IS NEXT. ALREADY ONE-THIRD OF THE COUNTRY OF GEORGIA IS OCCUPIED BY RUSSIA. THEN YOU HAVE THE BALTICS THAT THEY'RE ENTER FEARING IN. THIS IS A FRIGHTENING MOVEMENT. ANY REPUBLICAN WHO HAS AFFECTION OR VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS NO UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OUR PARTY STANDS FOR OR WHAT OUR COUNTRY STANDS FOR. >> Brennan: YOU ARE ON THAT JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE. RUDY GIULIANI, THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER ATTORNEY IS APPARENTLY SPEAKING TO THE COMMITTEE IN SOME FORM. IS HE BEING COOPERATIVE AT THIS POINT? WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? >> WELL, WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS HE HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED. OUR EXPECTATION IS HE IS GOING TO COOPERATE BECAUSE THAT IS THE LAW AND THE REQUIREMENT. THERE MAY BE SOME CHANGES IN DATES AND MOMENTS HERE AS LAWYERS DO THEIR BACK AND FORTH, BUT WE FULLY EXPECT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, WE'LL HEAR FROM RUDY GIULIANI. REGARDLESS OF WHEN WE HEAR FROM RUDY GIULIANI, WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION, AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WRAPPING THIS UP WHEN THAT IS RIGHT, SHOWING IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BUT NOT RUSSIA NOT RUSHING THIS. I HAVE A NEW SON, I WANT TO MAKE SURE IN FIVE OR 10 YEARS WHEN HE IS LEARNING ABOUT THIS IN HISTORY CLASS THAT HE GETS THE FULL ANSWER AND NO SOME CONSPIRACY GARBAGE. >> Brennan: IS THE PLAN TO END THE HEARINGS IN THE SPRING? >> SPRING OR SUMMER IS THE TIMEFRAME. WE WANT TO TAKE THIS INFORMATION AND PRESENT IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT JUST IN A REPORT, WHICH IS GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL, BUT IN PEOPLE, IN FACES, AND STORIES. >> Brennan: SENATE MINORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL SAID IN VERY CLEAR TERMS THAT JANUARY 6 WAS A VIOLENT INSURRECTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING TO PREVENT THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER AFTER A LEGITIMATELY CERTIFIED ELECTION. SO UNLIKE SOME REPUBLICANS, HE IS CLEARLY POINTING TO THE INTENT OF THE ACTORS. HE IS NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THERE IS SOME VIOLENCE. HE SAID WHAT THE PEOPLE WERE DOING THAT DAY WAS INHERENTLY WRONG, AND WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SAYING ABOUT THE ELECTION HAS BEEN CLEARLY SAID BY VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE TO HAVE BEEN WRONG. DOES THIS GIVE MORE POLITICAL COVER TO REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR ELECTION IN 2022 TO SAY THIS, OR IS IT STILL TOO DANGEROUS? >> WELL, IT DOES GIVE MORE POLITICAL COVER. THE QUESTION IS: WILL IT? I HAVE LOST FAITH IN SOME OF THE COURAGE OF MY COLLEAGUES. I THOUGHT THAT EVERY PERSON, WHEN THEY SWORE AN OATH, HAD SOME VERSION OF A RED LINE THEY WOULD NEVER CROSS. BUT CERTAINLY MITCH McCONNELL'S STATEMENT WAS IMPORTANT. CERTAINLY THE VICE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT WAS IMPORTANT. MARGARET, THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE EVERY REPUBLICAN, I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL ALL THE WAY UP TO CONGRESS AND SENATE -- EVERY REPUBLICAN HAS TO BE CLEAR AND FORCEFUL ON THE RECORD, DO THEY THINK JANUARY 6 WAS LEGITIMATE POLITICAL DISCOURSE. DON'T LET THEM AVOID IT OR HEM HAW. THIS IS AN ANSWER EVERY ONE OF THEM HAVE TO GIVE, AND THEN WE CAN MOVE ON ONCE THEY'RE CLEAR AND ON THE RECORD. BUT THIS IS DEFINITIVE TO OUR DEMOCRACY, HOW DO YOU FEEL? >> Brennan: AS YOU KNOW, THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND EVEN SENATOR MARCO RUBIO, WHO WAS ON THIS PROGRAM LAST SUNDAY, ARGUED THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DAY AND WHAT THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU ARE ON AND THE WORK YOU ARE DOING -- WHAT THOSE THINGS ADD UP TO. THEY ARGUE THAT YOU'RE COMMITTEE IS PERSECUTING ORDINARY CITIZENS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH VIOLENCE. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT? >> IT IS OBVIOUSLY A CONVENIENT WAY FOR THEM TO DEFLECT. WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT THE 20,000 OR SO PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE ON JANUARY 6 THAT DID NOT ENTER THE CAPITOL GROUNDS. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CORRUPTION THAT LED UP TO THE MOMENT AND WHAT HAPPENED SINCE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANYBODY COMMUNICATING, AND THOSE WHO WENT INTO THE CAPITOL ATTEMPTING TO OVERFLOW THIS. MARCO RUBIO KNOWS THAT, RHONDA McDANIEL KNOWS THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO TICK OFF THE BASE, BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO APPEAR TO BE TWO IN THERE WITH DONALD TRUMP, AND THAT'S THE GAME. WE HAVE TO CHOOSE AND TAKE DEFINITIVE LINES. IT IS STARTING TO SHA

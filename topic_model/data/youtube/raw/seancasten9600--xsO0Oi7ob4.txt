let's be really clear about what's happening right now europe is being destabilized by a petro state whose power comes from the fact that the world is addicted to their product you do not end that addiction by increasing u.s production of oil and when we're sitting here saying we are we are days weeks maybe months away from russia occupying ukraine and then transitioning to an occupying power we would like to prevent that from coming you are deluding yourself if you think the way that you stop that is to start construction today on an lmg terminal in the united states or to start construction today on the keystone pipeline or this is a lie it is it is done to confuse the american people

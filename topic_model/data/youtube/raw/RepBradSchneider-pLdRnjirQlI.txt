Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated
public servant, terrific mentor, and good friend – Elaine Nekritz who retired this
week as State Representative for Illinois’s 57th District. For more than 14 years, Elaine has ably represented
the communities of Buffalo Grove, Arlington Heights, Northbrook, Wheeling, Palatine, Mount
Prospect, and Prospect Heights in the Illinois House of Representatives. During this time, she’s been an outspoken
advocate for the constituents and a passionate defender of our environment and a champion
for women’s rights. Future generations in Illinois will benefit
from Elaine’s work to invest in infrastructure, including a high-speed rail link between Chicago
and St. Louis. Her smart backing of criminal justice reform
ensures more young offenders have an opportunity to reform their lives through juvenile court. The residents of the 57th district will miss
her energy, dedication, and tireless communication with her constituents. I’m personally grateful for Elaine’s service
and wish her and her husband Barry the very best in whatever comes next.

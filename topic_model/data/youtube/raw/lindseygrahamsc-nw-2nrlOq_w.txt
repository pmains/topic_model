joining me now senator dick durbin the number two democrat in the senate a member of the foreign relations committee and senator lindsey graham republican from south carolina he sits on the senate armed services committee gentlemen thank you both for joining me today i'm kind of tempted to say ukraine go uh and see what comes out because this is an ever-changing situation let me let let me though try to sort of uh channel this in and say to you senator graham the president has come out and spoken very forcefully on friday about consequences the uh us has made it clear that it disapproves of what russia has done you've been tweeting about strong statements what more do you want from president obama at this point well number one stop going on television and trying to threaten thugs and dictators it is not your strong suit every time the president goes on national television and threatens putin or anyone like putin everybody's eyes roll including mine we have a weak and indecisive president that invites aggression president obama needs to do something how about this suspend russian membership in the g8 and the g20 at least for a year starting right now and for every day they stay in their crimea add to the suspension do something senator senator german i'm imagine you're going to disagree at least uh with the description of how president obama has handled things well of course i disagree you would expect the president united states to speak out against what putin is trying to achieve here we've got to remember that putin developed his diplomatic finesse as the head of the soviet secret police and his idea of invading countries occupying them and and really daring people to go to war is the tactics those are the tactics of a bully and what the president has done is speak out against them this notion of taking him out of the g8 has already been suggested by the administration some members and i think it's the right thing to do now what congress has to do what the senate should do quickly is a resolution condemning what putin has done second saying that if ukraine will stand up for real reform that we're going to back them through the imf and making it clear to our allies in nato that that alliance is strong and neighbors of russia that we are going to do everything in our power to discourage further aggression by putin does any of this i hear of you know resolutions of condemnation i hear the president say this is wrong you're violating the law there'll be dire consequences given the stakes for putin in this area of the world why would he care about any of this i'm not sure that he does i'm sorry go ahead senator graham we'll be back senator durbin a second go ahead well i tell you what he very much cares about democracy on his borders i would like to create a democratic noose around putin's russia durbin dick durbin is right georgia is trying to seek nato admission through the membership action plan let's accelerate georgia's admission to na into nato moldova is under siege by russia let's help moldovia poland and the czech republic we abandoned our missile defense agreements with them to protect europe from a rogue missile attack coming out of the mideast russia backed obama down if i were president obama i would re-engage poland in the czech republic regarding missile defense i would admit georgia to nato i would have a larger military presence in the balkans to nato members who were threatened by russia i would fly the nato flag as strongly as i could around putin i would suspend his membership in the g8 it would be the g7 the g20 would become the g19 at least for a year and every day he stays in the ukraine i would add to it senator durbin uh refers to the question of why would putin care about this condemnation he is much more interested in crimea than he is about what the united states thinks about him candy uh vladimir putin and the russians just spent 50 billion dollars on this sochi charm offensive to try to redefine russia in the 21st century that sochi charm offensive died on the streets of sebastopol when he moved in thousands of troops days after the closing ceremony he is trying to have it both ways he wants to have this grandiose vision of empire at the expense of those countries that neighbor russia or depend on it for natural resources and then he wants to play like he's part of civilized society his oligarchs should be denied an opportunity to fly back and forth to europe at will we've got to make him feel that there's a price to pay for this kind of conduct and senator and he does and he does care about missile defense systems in poland in the czech republic he does care about the fate of georgia he invaded the country so let's challenge him where we can let's secure our friends and if at the end of this candy he has not paid a price if russia is not isolated if there continued to be membership in good standing with every international organization shame on us all in the end can there be any sort of deal that backs russia off that does not include russia's concerns and take into consideration russian concerns uh when it looks at the ukraine it sees western uh intervention it saw top u.s officials out before the president was ousted and fled to russia there were top u.s officials on the streets in kiev supporting the demonstrators so putin looks at this and says the west is you know interfering in sort of my neighborhood so doesn't putin's um ties to perceived or real uh to the ukraine and to crimea have to be considered if there's to be a diplomatic solution senator durbin well well let me see uh from my point of view i agree with lindsay when he talks about missile defense and strengthening nato alliance now let's be honest about it the crimea has been in a crucible for decades if not centuries over its identity and its future and it were it was the ukrainian government that invited the russian government to establish a base agreement in crimea that complicates it as does the ethnic breakdown within that region but we've got to make it clear to putin that if there are russian-speaking people on the soil of another nation that doesn't have give him license to invade to protect them when there's no obvious threat against him because there are russians spread all over the former soviet empire there in in countries that are today very free very democratic and very friendly to the united states we've got to draw the line senator graham i want to read you something from congresswoman marcie captor she is part of a ukrainian caucus on capitol hill democrat from ohio in which she said in an interview if i was president putin i would have been worried with the collapse of the party of regions that is the government in kiev about peace in the crimea i understand russia's military posture this obviously runs counter to anything either you or or senator durbin is saying right now what do you make of that position that there is a you know a russian view to this that is not totally understood or taken into account it's a horrible position for american political leader to take to legitimize what's happening the crimea is part of the ukraine in 1994 there was an agreement as the former soviet union split up and by the way putin's trying to create a new russian empire and we should stand up the crimea is complicated but it is part of the ukraine 1994 agreement the ukrainians gave up all nuclear weapons to maintain territorial and sovereignty this is not the way to influence a democratic state yes people in kiev need to understand eastern russia has its complications but nobody in the world including a member of congress should legitimize using fifteen thousand troops to invade a country to have your say about what's going on regarding your neighbor this is an invasion the crimea is part of the ukraine this is not the way you settle disputes can china go in and take islands away from japan the iranians are watching if we do not decisively push back against putin and make him weaker and all of our friends in the region stronger the iranians are going to misunderstand yet again we mean it regarding their nuclear program so much is at stake putin's on the wrong side of history he's on the wrong side of the law make him pay a price the ukrainian people are dying for their freedom i hope we will stand with them not this not just in words but in deeds uh senator um durbin your reaction to what congresswoman capture had to say well i disagree with marcy i think we need to be sensitive to the russian populations uh in crimea as i've said this is an historic reality but the notion that putin can send in as lindsey graham says 10 15 000 troops or whatever the number uh in order to so-called protect them just defies the sovereignty of ukraine and especially the point he made an agreement which this uh russians were signatories to back in 1994. so i would say to my friend congresswoman captor we can be sensitive to the russian reality in crimea but don't give license to vladimir putin to invade the sovereign nation senators i want to agree now with senators durbin and graham i wanted to take the opportunity to talk to both of you about the new budget proposal from secretary check hagel out of the pentagon which basically would cut the army kind of world war ii levels uh cut back on equipment uh getting ready for kind of a new uh new sort of warfare i feel as though i have heard that for some time i imagine that both of you agree are going to agree it's too much but what would you suggest in terms of cuts to the pentagon senator durbin i can tell you that we live in a dangerous world the united states has the strongest military in that world and we want to make certain we always have a military that can keep america safe if these cuts make it less would these cuts that are being proposed make it less powerful well let me address one point you made candy at the opening and that is that this is going to reduce our troop strength below world war ii levels the men primarily men men and women who served in the military in world war ii were the greatest generation the best soldiers on earth and they proved it but today's soldier brings to battle more capacity more capability and more firepower than those soldiers in world war ii ever did so numbers alone don't tell the story we've got to make certain that we have the very best military well-trained and that we have the best technology to back up our national defense but at the same time acknowledge the reality we are not going to i hope we're not going to engage in another land war like iraq or afghanistan a long-term commitment that costs too much in human lives and treasure and secondly we've got to make certain that we reduce spending in all areas senator graham it certainly sounds as though given the state of the world and the kinds of warfare that are seen in the future that you don't need as many people as you did when there were you know world war one world war ii vietnam any of those well my goal is to deter war read the report as to what's going on in north korea do you think the person running north korea is rational it is a gulag it is nazi type tactics being practiced in 2014 what if the leader of north korea woke up tomorrow and said it's time now to take the south 440 000 members of the united states army is a gutted army we do have a lot of technology available to our troops every soldier goes into battle with an array of technology and equipment not possessed in world war ii but you still need trigger pullers so this budget by president obama guts air defense it is the smallest army since 1940 the smallest navy since 1915 and the smallest air force in modern history if you went into iran tomorrow to have to neutralize or stop their nuclear program you're going to need every b2 and f-22 you can get the f-16 and the f-18 are great planes but they're not stealth so if you're going to modernize your military for future conflicts this budget will not allow you to do it and the idea you're going to make sure you're taking off what kind of wars you're going to fight assumes the enemies of our nation will agree with you a senator german the last word to you in fact the wall street journal made much the same point as senator graham did saying look the purpose of fielding a large army is to minimize the temptation for aggression how far is too far to cut back on troops well i don't know that we can pin our national defense strategy on the irrationality of leaders in north korea because i don't know that we could ever build a national military that would deter some craziness by someone but the question is can we protect the united states can we protect our citizens and our interests around the world and that means for example strengthening the nato alliance making certain that we do have troops in south korea that are there god forbid something occurs in the future i have great confidence in the men and women of the military and our technology to continue to meet that challenge but we have to acknowledge the obvious if we are going to reduce our debt for future generations we are going to have to cut spending on the defense and non-defense sides senator durbin senator graham thank you both for joining me this morning you

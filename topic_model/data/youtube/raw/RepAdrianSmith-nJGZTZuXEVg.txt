today's markup of HR 58 61 the jobs for success Act is the culmination of a significant amount of work this committee has done over the past year and particularly this spring to explore the jobs gap as part of our jobs and opportunity hearing series you'll notice the chart on the screen they it shows the jobs gap the jobs gap is the difference between what employers need to keep the economy growing and the number of workers in the labor force from the perspective of workers or potential workers the economy as as strong as it has been in years the unemployment rate is it at it is at its lowest level since the turn of the century the number of job openings has soared to more than 6.6 million and the number of people receiving unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level since 1969 meanwhile we have millions of Americans who are not working the human resources subcommittee has held seven hearings of this Congress this includes four hearings in the past six weeks with 19 witnesses to discuss the jobs gap and a legislative hearing following the release of a discussion draft proposal to reauthorize and reform the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or the TANF program as it is called we have followed regular order three of these hearings included witnesses representing local employer and federal federal perspectives on the jobs gap what we heard loud and clear was our economy economy has finally turned around and there are millions of job openings across the country our fourth hearing a legislative hearing included feedback from poverty policy and Workforce Development experts on how this reauthorization could be used as a building block to help close the jobs gap all three witnesses including the Democratic witness supported many of the policies included in both the discussion draft and the bill we are marking up today the jobs for success Act focuses on making sure truly needy families are provided meaningful access to the services and supports they need to move up the economic ladder not just getting a check every month overall this legislation strengthens program accountability transparency and oversight of federal dollars by doing four things one expecting universal engagement and case management to measuring work work outcomes to hold States accountable three refocusing TANF dollars on the truly needy and four using funds to support work and allowing states greater flexibility in customizing work activities to fit an individual's needs for success we have an opportunity to revitalize and retrofit retrofit the TANF program to today's economy and the needs of Americans who are on the sidelines throughout the hearing series held by the subcommittee I was encouraged by the comments on the TANF program made by ranking member Davis which suggests there may be space for meaningful bipartisan work on reform it seems lawmakers on both sides of the aisle know that TANF is not living up to the expectations set for it we have an opportunity to make real change for the American people and the American economy I hope we can work together on moving this important legislation for

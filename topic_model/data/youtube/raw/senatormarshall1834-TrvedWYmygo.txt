um miss gould if you don't mind miss gould we have a generation of children and young adults who have not drank milk and that's because we try to serve them some imitation milk fatless milk that tastes like water with powder in it as an obstetrician gynecologist i'm very concerned about osteopenia and osteoporosis that in 20 years from now those those young adults children never reach their peak of their their bone density and no matter what medicines i give them when they reach menopause the women we will never be able to to keep them their bones strong i think that's a great example of washington d.c trying to legislate or try to try to tell nutritionists in schools what to serve children i'm equally concerned about the tier three spec specs and i know other folks have talked about this but i just want people to realize that that a tier three uh pizza is basically a piece of cardboard without cheese on it um so what what will happen is and that's my guess my question is you know which is going to be worse for a young child cheetah to eat all of a tier two meal or eating a fourth of a tier three because i just don't think kids are going to eat tier 3 diets how hard is that going to be to implement in the school system thank you for your question i think you nailed it it is going to be incredibly difficult and ultimately we want nutrition going in our students bellies we want them to actually eat the meals and get the nutrition into them uh we know that if they don't like it if it is too restrictive they will choose to not eat it and i think that's the balance we need to be considering because we're also in the limits of tier three we are eliminating many culturally diverse items from students menu so we've got to think about the whole child i don't think one nutrient is the premise for if they're going to be obese or not i think we've got to look at the overall meal and ensure that there's nutritional quality in that meal and it's getting into their stomach thank you and i just got to put an explanation mark on the whole milk part of this that the whole milk has fat in it which allows people to absorb vitamins a d e and k and that's especially important of course in my in my pregnant patients how important it is to absorb those vitamins there is a such thing as good fat

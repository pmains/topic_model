at the heart of this hearing today in this ongoing investigation about the IRS is that we have millions of Americans that live in fear of their government and that's not what whether you're a liberal or conservative you're a democrat or republican or you don't care at all about politics you don't want to live in fear of your government and that's what's frightening about this and the more that we've investigated here in the house the more that we find that is disturbing deeply disturbing and so when we when we talk about this question about you know these these cases being shipped from Cincinnati up to Washington some want to believe it's because it's these were hard or complex cases but what we found in our investigations we have cases that were sent from washing it from Cincinnati to Washington based on news reports about a class of tea party folks then we've also heard from Carter hole that he had he had cases taken from him he's got 40 years of experience and given to somebody who has very little experience with these cases so the idea that it was complexity that drove this it doesn't appear to be the case what we find is that it was the politics that mattered and that leads us to be more feel fearful of what I RS is doing now mr. George have you found anything counter to what I've said uh counter to what you said no I mean the IRS has one of the most important roles and the federal government it is the one of the organizations that most Americans at one point in their lives or another will have to interact with it has to have this trust of the American people we live in a voluntary compliance system and if people don't trust that system it can undermine you know this nation trust trust yes well you know I appreciate y'all's testimony the work that you do on a daily basis to to be that oversight that inspect and you know inspector general's are there for that purpose regardless of what administration's in power there needs to be a check on this and so going back to the first panels testimony I a reference mr. hull but also miss ha faker she testified that she accidentally sent this below this be on the lookout list to Washington personnel have you found that in your investigation what we did we didn't see that now we do not see she testified to it on the first panel so it so it so then it leads to the question so if she accidentally sent this to Washington leadership shouldn't they have known this was happening all we know is according to the lowest learner this briefing I mentioned a minute to go to congressman Lynch Lois Lerner started asking questions and was first briefed in June of 2011 that's what we know at this point there could be more information but that's what we know based upon our audit okay well with that I'd like to yield the balance of my time with the gentleman yield just fit

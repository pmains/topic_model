THE BILL. WITH US NOW, CALIFORNIA SENATOR  ALEX PADILLA WHO SITS ON THE  BUDGET COMMITTEE. ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU. HOW DO YOU SEE, SENATOR, THIS  BILL BEING A BENEFIT TO YOUR  CONSTITUENTS, TO YOUR STATE? >> LOOK, THIS IS A BIG DEAL,  IT'S A HISTORIC MEASURE THAT  WE'RE GOING TO PASS AT SOME  POINT THIS WEEK. AND JUST TO GIV A COUPLE  EXAMPLES OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR  THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA, NUMBER ONE, LOWERING THE COST OF  PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW THAT NEED EITHER INSULIN TO MANAGE  DIABETES OR SOMETHING ELSE FOR  ANOTHER CONDITION? CAPPING OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR  MEDICA RECIPIES. IN CALIFORNIA ALONG 6.5 MILLION  MEDICARE RECIPIENTS, 1.8 MILLION CALIFORNIANS RELY FOR HEALTH  COVERAGE AND WE'RE SHOWING THAT  IN THE MEASURE, AND TACKED ON TO THAT THE HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN  BATTLING CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA, I'M NOT PROUD OF  THIS, BUT IT IS EXHIBIT A ON  CLIMATE CHANGE HERE AND NOW WITH WILDFIRE SEASON JUST BEGINNING. TO HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN  HEALTH CARE, DEFICIT REDUCTION,  CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S AN ULTIMATE WIN-WIN-WIN, IF YOU ASK ME.  >> SENATOR, I HEAR YOU TALKING  ABOUT LOWERING THE COST OF  PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ALMOST EVERY  ADMINISTRATION AND EVERY  POLITICIAN TALKS ABOUT THIS IS  GOING TO LOWER THE COST OF  PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, IT'S GOING  TO DO THIS AND THAT. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT NEVER GETS DONE, EVEN WHEN THEY SAY, OH,  THIS IS INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO DEAL  WITH THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE? >> I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE  TRIED, A LOT OF PEOPLE  CAMPAIGNED ON IT, OBVIOUSLY. BUT THE BEST TOOL TO ACTUALLY  MAKE THAT HAEN IS GIVING THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IN THIS CASE MEDICARE, THE ABILITY TO  NEGOTIATE FOR BETTER PRICES,  USING MARKET POWER. HOW MANY PEOPLE GET THEIR  PRESCRIPTIONS THROUGH MEDICARE  COVERAGE AND UTILIZING THE  STRENGTH AND THE PURCHASING  POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS. IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR YEARS AND YEARS, PROBABLY DECADES, AND IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING. ONE OF THE MANY EXAMPLES IN THIS BILL THAT, FRANKLY, I'M SHOCKED  THAT REPUBLICANS AREN'T  SUPPORTING THE FACT THAT IT'S  GOING TO BE PASSED THROUGH  DEMOCRATIC-ONLY VOTES. THAT SENDS A BIG SIGNAL BECAUSE  THIS BILL OVERALL, I HEARD THE  PREVIOUS PANEL TALKING ABOUT WHY THIS IS A PARTISAN BILL. MY COLLEAGUE, ANGUS KING SAID  EARLIER, THIS IS A BIPARTISAN  BILL, IT'S BIPARTISAN EVERYWHERE BUT THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL. IT HAS PUBLIC SUPPORTS FROM  DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS,  INDEPENDENTS AND EVERYBODY IN  BETWEEN. IT'S JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO. >> SENATOR, TALKING ABOUT  BIPARTISANSHIP I SPOKE THIS  WEEK WITH SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ. HE TOLD ME HE WOULD NOT VOTE FOR THIS BILL IF REPUBLICANS ARE  ABLE TO ADD WHAT HE CALLED  POISON PILL AMENDMENTS TO  IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY,  WHICH COULD ATTRACT SUPPORT FROM SOME OF YOUR MORE VULNERABLE  COLLEAGUES ON YOUR SIDE OF THE  AISLE. HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE DEMOCRATS  STICK TOGETHER AND REJECT THESE  AMENDMENTS, SENATOR? >> I STAND WITH SENATOR MENENDEZ ON THAT POINT. THE BEST THING IS TO MOVE THIS  BILL FORWARD AS CLEANLY AS  POSSIBLE. WE KNOW BECAUSE OF THE  UNIQUENESS OF THE RECONCILIATION PROCESS, REPUBLICANS ARE GOING  TO TRY TO ADD POISON PILL  AMENDMENTS AND UNRAVEL THE WHOLE DEAL. DEMOCRATS HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER AND TAKE THIS HUGE WIN-WIN-WIN  AND MOVE FORWARD. SO VOTING DOWN AMENDMENTS. MAKING SURE ON IMMIGRATION  SPECIFICALLY, CAUSE THAT'S  WHATG ABOUT, WE'VE WORKED HARD TO TRY  TO MAKE PROGRESS ON IMMIGRATION  REFORM. IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE  SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN  IMMIGRATION REFORM, WE'RE NOT  TAKING STEPS BACK BECAUSE OF  HOSTILE AMENDMENTS THAT  REPUBLICANS ARE NO DOUBT GOING  TO OFFER THIS WEEKEND.  >> AND SENATOR, AS FAR AS  IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER  CRISIS, YOU'RE ALWAYS SO CLEAR  ON SEPARATING THOSE TWO ISSUES,  WE'RE IN FULL EMPLOYMENT,  ESSENTIALLY IN OUR COUNTRY. THERE ARE SO MANY JOBS OUT THERE AVAILABLE THAT THERE AREN'T  ENOUGH PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM. THERE ARE 11 MILLION, 12 MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE  BEEN PARTICIPATING IN O OUR  ECONOMY FOR YRSRS NOW WHO ARE  FULLY VETTED AND COULD  IMMEDIATELY COME IN AND HELP OUR ECONOMY, AND YET THERE IS NO  MOVEMENT ON THAT. MPP IS STILL I PLACE A MONTH  PLUS AFTER THE SUPREME COURT  SAID IT COULD BE TAKEN OUT. TITLE 42 IS STILL IN EFFECT. TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, BUT  RELATED TO SOMETHING THAT COULD  HELP OUR ECONOMY, SENATOR.  >> EXACTLY. AND THE STUDIES ARE OUT THERE,  THE DATA IS OUT THERE, IF WE  WERE TO ADVANCE PATHWAYS TO  CITIZENSHIP, NOT AUTOMATIC BUT  PATHWAYS TO CITIZENSHIP FOR SO  MANY IMMIGRANTS THAT HAVE EARNED IT THAT ARE HERE TODAY, IT WOULD BE A BENEFIT TO THE ECONOMY FOR  EVERYBODY. BUT, SADLY, IMMIGRATION IS JUST  ONE EXAMPLE. WE EXPECT HOSTILE AMENDMENTS  THIS WEEKEND POSSIBLY ON THE  RIGHT TO CHOICE OR THE RIGHT TO  AN ABORTION. MARRIAGE EQUALITY, CIVIL RIGHTS  PROTECTIONS, VOTING RIGHTS  ISSUES. IT WILL BE EXPLOITED BY  REPUBLICANS WITH POLITICAL  GRANDSTANDING AND HOSTILE  AMENDMENTS. WE'VE GOT TO STAND TOGETHER AS  DEMOCRATS TO DEFEAT ANY OF THESE HOSTILE AMENDMENTS AND TAKE  THESE HUGE WIN TO SAY THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT  TO BE PROUD OF GIVEN WHAT WE  ACCOMPLISHED LAST YEAR WITH THE  AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN, THE  INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, INVESTMENTS IN SEMICONDUCTS AND CHIPS. A WHOLE LOT OF FEDERAL JUDGES  THAT HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED. NOW THIS, I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE  ON THE RO

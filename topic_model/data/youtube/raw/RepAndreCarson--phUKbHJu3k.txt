joining us now congressman andre carson he's an indiana democrat he's also a member of the house intelligence committee congressman thanks very much for joining us i know you like your colleagues thank you you've been brief can you say conclusively right now congressman that a bomb caused the downing of this plane well i'm i'm i'm i'm not at liberty to con to confirm these things what i can tell you is that there is a huge and growing threat uh in the middle east as it relates to isil and other terrorist organizations uh it is very disappointing that our friends in the egyptian government have not allowed the fbi and other agencies to help with the kinds of uh forensics that they're skilled at doing to determine uh the source of this but you know what what it tells me more deeply is that perhaps there was and and are terrorist sympathizers in our international airports that we have to address when do you believe u.s officials will be able to confirm the cause of this explosion we know it was an explosion they heard an explosion at the end of that that cockpit voice recorder recording it would be gravely irresponsible for me to speculate or even say quite frankly uh but it's clear um right now as we speak that we need our international community to come together and share intelligence information and to see to it that you know one we're not hurting um uh other other us citizens or even russians for that matter but even more than that that we're guaranteeing the safety of those who wish to travel see their friends their loved ones their families and even vacation and if we fail to address this threat or even minimize the threat i hate to see what happens for our future i raise the question uh congressman because there's at least one but probably several killers mass murderers at large right now presumably still in sinai maybe they've gotten out by now yes you know i i this is why it's ever more critical for the international law enforcement community and intelligence community to work together i think our friends in the egyptian government must realize that they need the help for the united states to help track down these terrorists and to get to the root causes of it so another incident doesn't happen like this in the next few weeks you're on the subcommittee on aviation and as you know an internal investigation of the tsa this summer this summer showed that investigators were actually able to smuggle mock explosives or banned weapons through checkpoints 95 of the trial runs so are american airports at risk of an attack right now unless security is dramatically re-evaluated well you're absolutely right you know since uh there was a recent gao study that that showed that there are numerous vulnerabilities in airport security since 9 11 we have worked throughout the years to strengthen security at airports and we and we've been quite effective for the most part uh however there has to be more that needs to be done the tsa head was very direct in his uh testimony before congress i think that secretary jay johnson is doing a great job but we have to look at recalibrating the training that's taking place within tsa because a u.s official has told cnn that when it comes to aviation security here in the united states and i'm quoting them now you can lock the front that front door all you want if you've left the back window open it doesn't really matter and it's pretty chilling when you think about the desire of these terrorists to blow up planes with people inside sure sure you know there are a lot of great men and women who are at tsa who go to work uh with the intention of making our country safer but at the same time there have to be a series of internal controls and and reviews regularly to ensure that the outputs are high and that the services are efficient congressman standby we have more to talk about including another very disturbing development today the killing of two americans trainers in jordan much more coming up right after this

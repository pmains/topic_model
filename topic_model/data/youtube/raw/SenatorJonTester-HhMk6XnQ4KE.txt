Thank You mr. chairman and ranking member Nelson thanks for having this hearing I want to thank the witnesses today I think we'll start with with you mr. Watts can you tell me why transparency between behind who's paying for political ads and issue-based as is important yes I think the number one issue with that is public safety we saw with Russian active measures one of the primary things they sought to do was actually mobilize population regardless of the election mobilize people to protests or a counter protest which can lead to violent confrontations at the same point those advertisements probably when annotated and noted based on campaign laws give legitimacy to those advertisements so the public actually knows what is a real political stance versus a false or manipulated truth or a narrative they have to stand behind their actions I think that's important for the public to restore trust and faith in the democratic process and could it also have impacts on election results yes it makes it more difficult for a foreign adversary or even a manipulate a social media manipulator with a lot of resources and an axe to grind to do character assassination or to tear down social movements okay so and this goes to any one of the other three that wants to answer this can can you tell me why you don't tell us who's paying for the ads whether they're political ads or whether they're issue based ads who wants to answer that Thank You senator and Twitter is very proud that we last year announced industry-leading transparency practices for political advertising so do you know do tell people who's paying for the ass for electioneering ads yes sir how about issue based s issue based ads are harder not to crack it's hard to determine and we are working with with our colleagues with with our pure companies to try to figure out what the right the right to address those issues on okay how about the other two you want talk about political ads versus issue based ads and if you're telling us who's paying for them we're working to put more transparency into the election based advertising system and are taking four steps in advance of the 2018 midterms the first is verification we will require advertisers to identify who they are and where they're from before purchasing advertisements will also launch in AD disclosures where we notify users of who is running an election based ad will release a transparency report on election advertising purchased through Google and will also release a creative library to the public or all of that those advertisements are made public and will that release of the transparency report have who's paid for the ads I believe it well yes yes sir senator Thank You senator our answer is substantially similar to my peer companies on the issue of federal election related ads and like mr. monje political ads writ broadly are is a little bit more complicated but certainly an area where we think increased transparency is important political ads are more complicated than issue based ads or the other way around the issue base I'm sorry editor that the issue based ads okay very hard to define that said we're very interested in how we can increase transparency and we look forward to talking to yourself and other politics about it well I would just tell you this as is editorial comment I I would agree with senator Schatz I don't think this is a Democrat Republican issue I think this is a democracy issue and you guys are smart guys and just about everybody that I read writings of tell me that it's not that difficult and they're smart people too and so I would hope that you guys really would put pen to paper if that's what you do these days and figure out how you can let people know who's paying for ads and I think issue based ads by the way are just as important as political based ads because those fall into the political category and and I would just say that's important every one of you said that you did not like the FCC decision on net neutrality that came out a month or two ago during that debate we had learned that there were BOTS that dropped comments into the hopper that distorted the whole public comment period how how is that going to be stopped the next time we have a public comment period on on a rule that's written by an agency anybody want to answer that and I'm out of time so make it quick I'll tell you what we will not occupy the time of the committee give me an answer to that in writing when you go back to your folks this is a really important issue I just want to just say this is a really important issue from a terrorist standpoint from all the questions that were asked before but our democracies at risk here we've got to figure out how to get this done and get it done right and get it done very quickly or we may not have a democracy to have you guys up to hear you out

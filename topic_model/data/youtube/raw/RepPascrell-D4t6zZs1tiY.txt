good afternoon mr. chairman mr. Pascrell mr. chairman two things a be a this president took over and he said what a mess I inherited I remember his words on the day I don't know what the heck he would have done in January of 2009 with that mess because of that budget that you talked about and referred we're still on a you you refer to there was no capitalizing there was no investment and if the federal government they didn't get involved as they have in every economic downturn in the 20th century in the 21st century God knows where we would be now let me give you a little history mr. chairman inauguration day 2017 president Trump issued an executive order that directed the agencies to undermine the ACA you want me to read it to you to January 2017 Trump's HHS Department cut millions of dollars in outreach customer assistance total enrollment time let's put this all on a record it's the record you can't make this stuff up you know HSS used taxpayer dollars intended for advertising vital ACA enrollment information to fund an ad campaign intended to undermine the ACA they did the same thing yesterday May 28th 2017 House passed the AHCA which would have left 23 million more uninsured over the next 10 years this is painful here isn't it remove protections for those with pre-existing conditions implement and age tax and age tax and discrimination against woman increased 2018 premiums by 20% and got medicaid with a hundred billion dollars and cuts we have very short memories September 2017 HHH s threatened states would decrease funding for pursuing policies that would lower premiums get you cut any investment any research into lowering premiums some predicted by size 30% then in October 2017 the Trump administration announced they were canceling cost-sharing reduction payments remember that the CSRs remember that mr. chairman he smiled about that what did it do the CBO projected would leave 1 million more uninsured it would raise premiums 20 to 25 percent over the next two years and increased the deficit by 200 billion let me opinions compared to two point three trillion I understand that December 2017 the Republican tax bill remember that mr. chairman the Republican tax bill had a 2.3 trillion to the deficit cut three years off the life of Medicare trust fund short memories and also zeroed out the individual mandate the latter is predicted will lead to millions more uninsured and 15 percent premium increases that was in December of 2017 2018 of June we're getting close don't worry I'll be done soon the Trump administration director partner justice not to defend the constitutionality of the consumer protections in the ACA think about that we're working at cross-purposes we're not worked it together you know problem solvers you got to be kidding me come together with the other side let me read that sentence again mr. chairman maybe it hasn't sunk in the administration directed the Department of Justice remember those guys not to defend the constitutionality of the consumer protections of the ACA don't protect the consumer we're going to wrap this thing out even if we can't repeal it their legal argument which has been denounced by liberal and conservative scholars would gut protections that ensure that more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions are not denied or charged X potentially more for coverage on June 20 2018 also the administration continued their streak of encouraging enrollment in junk plans sound familiar when they finalized a rule to expand access to Association health plans I feel good doing this I really do and no gentleman's time I'm not tired I know but you're not get somebody else the gentleman's time has expired does anyone wish to remove the strike the last word mr. Thompson you recognized Thank You mr. chairman I yield my time to mr. Pascrell Thank You mr. Thompson from California you're doing a great job AHP AHP Zinn short term limited duration insurance don't have to cover essential benefits for older people or outright reject coverage I know this is painful it should be expanding use of these plans will lead to millions leaving the individual market leaving a sicker risk pool and raising premiums and then also in July this month the Trump administration announced they will not make ten point four billion in risk adjustment payments which ensure insurance companies don't share pick you know what that means you know what that means the premiums when you cherry pick you know what it does to the risk market I'm not teaching you anything you know what I'm talking about and try to enroll only healthy populations what a great plan that is only enroll the healthy in insurance plans there is not one person in this room who doesn't know what the consequences of that are that is the administration should stop these payments at a time when insurance were determining their participation in rates for 2019 how could be so the rates are gonna go up just before the election oh I see I'm beginning to understand this july 2019 your department the administration's Department of HHS cut outreach and consumer education funding to local organizations by 10 million dollars you really twisted it than you and what you do when you're twisting it is trying to SAP every drop of blood out of the ACA you know how many bills we came up how many amendments we had since 2010 they tried to change this and make it better you never were with us on any of them the amendments we've come up with here you're never with us on anything so what is this go buy out we're gonna all get together we're all gonna have a nice time we're gonna listen to you you're gonna listen to us and then we'll come up with a resolution well that's what reasonable people don't that's what reasonable people do how dare you sit there and blame us for the mess that you caused and we're willing to say okay bygones be bygones bygones let's have a resolution let's have a solution that's the fair that that's the American Way to do because if you don't and we don't then a lot of people are gonna suffer not just what preconditions either not just what preconditions mr. chairman you're you are I consider a pretty reasonable guy but you blown this you really did there is no reasonable way if you look at the facts I didn't make this stuff up I didn't pick it off the shelf when you take a look at the record so when mr. Trump came into office in January of last year 2017 when he said huh what a mess I ain't heard that is so much malarkey and Bologna it is in funny I would have wanted hit to be back I hope you go back in history put him in charge in January of 2009 God saved the Queen I yield back gentleman yields back miss Riley recognized strike the last word let's talk about phony and malarkey remember you can keep your doctor remember you can keep your policy you remember that this is going to save the average family $2,500 a year you want to talk about phony and malarkey oh my god actually you know the the statement that Obamacare would save the average family $2,500 a year what that had to either be just an outright falsehood or just complete lack of knowledge about what was in the bill to think that applying a health care tax to think that applying a tax on health insurance companies to think that flying a tax on pharmaceutical companies to think that applying a tax on medical device devices would drive down the cost of health care who in their right mind with any common sense would think that any of those things would do anything but drive up the cost of health care and in fact you know it played out as likely as Republicans said they would I wouldn't hear them but it played out exactly as they said it would in the first three years you know the Democrats and Barack Obama were smart too to say that delay the inception till after the president's second inauguration because they knew if it went into effect beforehand and people actually got to see it he wouldn't get reelected and so it went into effect in 2014 in the first three years before a president Trump ever took office the pre means that instead of going down by $2,500 per family went up a hundred and seven percent in three years the premiums went up a hundred and seven percent now let's think about that what did we get with the Affordable Care Act the object was we have these group of uninsured people right well let's talk Fox 85% of Americans were covered before the Affordable Care Act between private insurance employer provided and and individual insurance between Medicaid and Medicare 85% of Americans were covered this was before the quote-unquote protections of the Affordable Care Act now mr. Pascrell said a minute ago if we did away with these protections of the Affordable Care Act 137 million Americans would lose their coverage that would be over like 40% of the population well they were covered before the Affordable Care Act before the quote-unquote protections of the Affordable Care Act and they were covered for less than half the price what did we get from the Affordable Care Act the percentage of Americans uninsured dropped or excuse me the percentage insured went up from 85 percent to 91 percent now you know most of those folks because the government gave them insurance now I'm not against more people being insured I certainly want to do that but I wanted to do at a reasonable cost what was the cost of insuring six percent more Americans the cost of that was the other eighty five percent who already were insured had to pay a hundred and seven percent more that is absurd I mean any any fool with common sense could come up with a better plan than that 85 is sick to go to go from eighty five percent to ninety one percent six percent more people covered the other 85 percent have to pay a hundred and seven percent more that is an absurd deal so let's talk you know what were the words he used phony and I can't remember the other word malarkey Obamacare the ACA was based on a foundation of phony and malarkey the entire prospect that it would drive down the cost of health care was obviously wrong from anybody who understood the provisions of the bill and the result was entirely predictable the people that I'm hearing back from in my district are what are we going to do we can't afford this insurance anymore the the when mr. Pascrell refers to the protections of the required coverages let me tell you in my business my little 20 person law firm I covered everybody throughout my entire practice and I'm none of the policies that I ever bought had all those protections in them so mr. chairman to say that to say that the actions of the president are the reasons why these premiums have doubled that's fantasy because they actually double in the years before the president took office I yield my imus expires to chairman I ask a question mr. Bolen not at this time does anyone remember we asked a question of you know mr. Pascrell yes I'll ask again does any member wish to strike the last word are there any amendment wolf destroyed the last word as Larson you recognize Mike last Ralph to ask a question thank you thank you very much mr. Larson if it's not I want to be corrected mr. chairman if need be let me ask you this question the only people affected by the ACA are those people who are enrolled in the ACA or does it not affect the entire market on special requirements that were not in existence in other plans so if the answer is no it affects a lot of other people besides those few people that you talked about sir I'll talk about those few people but let's say let's say it had nothing else to do with the rest of the market is that what you're saying no I don't think that's what you're saying because people who had regular plans as whatever you call them many of those people did not have preconditions that could be responded to many of those people were woman who had to pay more than men well the gentleman you excuse me now when I'm finished you could jump in I like that back and forth but let me finish so many people who are not so-called quote unquote enrolled in the ACA are affected by what we passed how much the insurance companies have to put in and responding to their customers that changed as well that goes for everybody it did not just include those people in the ACA would you agree with me sir where I differ with you in that respect is you said 137 million people with pre-existing conditions would lose their protections well the great bulk of those people recovered before the ACA but if you take those conditions away if you take those prerequisites away they work how those people are going to be affected just like those people who are enrolled in the ACA that was my point that was my point so therefore that's why you're selling us cheap policies today you're selling us these policies and I think some of them are necessary but it's not the solution and we agree that the ACA was at the total solution so let's change it together but no you had an alternative plan ho ho yo ho is a nickel here where is it you don't have it so it's a lot of hoods but the question any of the numbers I got to be reading off the chalkboard for crying out loud now these numbers I can prove I can assure you we're not going to solve this of us we do it together and unless you join us we're not going to do it so therefore you will have accomplished what you set out to do to bleed the only plan that's in existence that helps people who didn't have insurance before you blood it and now you're stuck with it so you want to give us these few bills today and tomorrow I'm gonna give us a few bills to show people that you really concerned about their health that's not the answer my friend it is not the answer Thank You mr. chairman gentleman yields back does anyone remember we should strike the last word are there any amendments to the amendment made sure substitute there are no amendments questions on the adoption minimum nature substitute all those in favor signify by saying aye those opposed no in each ear the eyes have the minimum the nature substitutes agreed to I'll now recognize mr.

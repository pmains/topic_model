the arguments for tax reform how are the Democrats responding in this final sprint we're joined now by congressman Steny Hoyer Democrat of Maryland and House Minority Whip mr. Minority Leader whip I can tell you I just got back from Alabama and I want to get the tax reform in a second but there's breaking news reporting from Politico that speaker Ryan waying resigning after the midterm elections what do you make of all of that and condemn ik rats take that control of the house well I do I do not know what the speaker Ryan is thinking he hasn't talked to me about it but I'm not surprised Speaker Boehner left because he had a deeply divided party and it made it very difficult for him to pursue rational reasonable positive policies frankly I think speaker Ryan has confronted the same kind of environment and maybe he just thinks there's some way he could more productively serve we'll have to break in for a second because the u.s. FCC has voted to end Obama era net neutrality rules this was widely expected the proposal came last month from the FCC chair Ajith PI but we're now getting the vote tally and it has ended the Obama era net neutrality rules now this is a move to deregulate the telecom and cable industry and now it's undoing the 2015 classification of broadband as a common carrier service right we'll get you more of the latest as soon as we get them but for now let's get back to the congressman and congressman Steny Hoyer we were talking about a tax reform and what happens in Congress next once at a final tax bill is passed first of all do you expect that to carry out to carry on because we are now hearing from different senators that they could have reservations about the final bill well again I haven't seen the conference report I asked the majority leader just a few minutes ago was it available to be looked at he indicated that it was not so I don't know exactly what they've done but I agree with you I don't think it's a sure thing that it was going to pass the United States Senate first of all what they've done is made it a bill that needs him even more skewed towards the wealthy in America the bills of the house and the Senate bills excuse me had millions of people getting a tax hike they had it sixty two percent plus of the wealthiest people in America were getting 62 percent of the benefits so this bill would have also had an impact and I think this conference report will also have the impact of twenty five billion dollar cut in Medicare next year so that this is not a bill that the American people support as a matter of fact the polls show that they overwhelmingly oppose it and Cory Johnson a Bloomberg News joining us on the FCC's net neutrality decision and Cory you have a question for the Congress mr. Hoyer I'm sorry you seem to have the same call all of us to have these closed right now yeah I'm curious about your take on what the FCC is saying about net neutrality well obviously is a Democrat Republican divided here but you know you've had big contributors in alphabet and Facebook for your most recent campaign and I just wonder how you look at this net neutrality ruling and whether you think that the Comcast of the world should have the upper hand here or it's the companies of providing content on the Internet look I think we are very disappointed that the FCC action we think in a democracy and the free access of not free but access to information a non-discriminatory basis is absolutely essential in democracy so that we want to see all information for all users be treated equally and net neutrality does that so we're very very concerned about the action that the FCC has taken and we think it was a an action that was not not good for the American people I got I got a two-part question for you first and foremost sticking with the FCC breaking news there that the FCC voting to roll back those regulations but Chrisman what exactly can your party do in order to reverse course on that that's point number one and the second is you just got off the floor and you had a 71 minute back-and-forth with mr. McCarthy can you tell us what's gonna come of that because I knew that that a lot of folks wondering about that back and forth as well well we think the the Republican majority has not done the work of the American people they've not given us the opportunity to do the work of the American people they've been focused on really two bills the repeal of the Affordable Care Act they took some nine months to try to do that they failed they are now passing a tax bill in the most a ramrod way just ramming it through no hearings no witnesses very little time to consider one of the most complex pieces of legislation of the Congress passes and that's tax bill we think it is a very very negative impact on the American people and we are pleased that the American people get it they know what this bill does it gives money to the rich and doesn't do much for the working class and that's not a good thing particularly when you have speaker Ryan saying that's the objective of this bill it's not it doesn't do that and I think that's why senator Rubio who has seen this conference report as we hear it explain advantaging to the wealthiest in America even more than either the House or Senate bill did is having reservations about it so that yes it was a colloquy but the reason it was a long colloquy is because we are down to the last day of the session without having accomplished so much of what we need to do and of course I listed a litany of 10 to 12 things that are must-do pieces of legislation that we have not passed Congress but bit congressman how do you are so sticking with the FCC now so and the Republican majority and being you know in the minority party how do you push back how do you actually address for example with the FCC how do you reverse that course given that you don't have a majority well obviously we push back very hard but we explain to the American people who I think overwhelmingly believe that net neutrality is the best policy for them their families in their communities and their countries so I think from that standpoint the people are with us we need to make that argument and very frankly what the American people can do and what we need to do is take back to the majority in 2018 so we can address that policy with the majority in the Congress and in the Senate obviously you're right without majorities without the ability to put legislation on the floor it's very very difficult to change this policy and congressman we are now here right from attorney General Eric Schneiderman saying that he will sue to stop the legal rollback of net neutrality we had already heard from Senator Hendren Markey Democrat from Massachusetts saying that he plans to also fire a brief against the order as a legal challenge how United are the Democrats right now on trying to stop these the rolling back of net neutrality rules I think the Democrats are very United we voted on this before overwhelmingly the Democratic Party is taking the position that in a democracy like ours we need to have a net neutrality equal access equal treatment of those who use the internet we think that's what a democracy and frankly demand so that I think the court route is obviously the perhaps the only route we have available to us now until such time as we take back the majority which very frankly I think it's more likely every day Wow also you know when you look at this in the the other argument other side was that the Federal Trade Commission should be looking at this not the FCC and that this went from a protection to a regulation that it was there was just unnecessary bureaucratic I wonder what your take is of that argument I don't think that's the argument that that may have been the argument used that was not the underlying reason the underlying reason was - they didn't like the fact that there couldn't be disparate treatment from volume users or special users and they thought that and I know my and I have a lot of friends in the in the Internet network providers on the ISPs and I understand their argument but we really believe that open access equal treatment is the best policy in a democracy and whether it's the FCC or the FTC is not really the issue the issue is do you agree with the policy or don't agree with the policy that that's a makeweight argument that I don't think is the honest argument as to why this action was taken for those of us joining us the FCC has announced that they are rolling back the Obama era net neutrality regulations the New York Attorney General saying that he will lead a multi-state lawsuit going against this and we restored by the Democrat with Steny Hoyer mr. Hoyer let me follow up on this with regards to the multi-state but multi-state lawsuit that could make its way through I mean we've seen this in the past as a strategy on immigration for example where state leaders really taking it to going against the administration house significant of a strategy is this mr. Carter Carter in order to combat some of these regulations I mean does it really have a chance of working well I think it really has a chance of working I'm not I'm not expert on the pleadings or the case that is being made as to why the FCC's ought to be reversed on this issue however it is the Avenue that is available we are a nation of laws the courts couldn't oversee this and see a whether it was done correctly from a procedural standpoint and then if so was it substitute ake this action so you ask me is this the but it may not be the best way the best way would be legislatively but this is a way it is a way that is available and obviously a lot of tourneys general throughout the United States believe that this is harmful to their public's to their citizens in their states and so they are filing an action on their behalf to ensure equal treatment and equal access to the Internet congressman of course you're very busy right now dealing with a spending deal as well House Republicans pushing a military spending bill appeared with a measure to the to keep the rest of the government open will the Democrats try to block the CR and if so are we headed for a government shutdown I hope we're we're not for a government shutdown we've never been for government shutdown the Republicans as I said on the floor today have on a number of occasions shut down the government purposely to accomplish objectives that they want what we are saying is we need to do our work we voted for and by the way this CR that we expect to come on Tuesday if it doesn't pass will not shut down the government we have another 72 hours before after that so we have till next Friday until the government shuts down so we have time to reach by some agreement on critical issues that must be done chipped the child health insurance program is certainly high on that list flood insurance for people damaged by storms is high on that list fixing the national security apparatus for protecting the American people from terrorists is high on that list records loan program for students there are a number of items I can name five or six others that are high on the list of things that we must get done yeah and we think frankly that just kicking the can down the the road which we voted for ninety days ago unfortunately in that 90 days none of those have been accomplished it's time to say enough is enough of wasting time let's do the work of the American people congressman Steny Hoyer Democrat of Maryland in Houston argument after 71 minutes on the House floor joining us on Bluebook in the middle of breaking news with the FCC talking taxes and at the budget we very much appreciate your time congressman and and speaker Ryan saying he's had enough himself

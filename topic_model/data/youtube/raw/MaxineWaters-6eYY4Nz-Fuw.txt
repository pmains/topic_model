running around to all of the various committees and dealing with the President's speech from last evening and foreign bears and we should be the natural services filled with FHA but we have taken the time to try and share with your information which you have been attempting to get for the past almost week or so and I'd like to read this full statement to you so that you can have a better understanding of exactly what we have been attempted to do as african-american members of Congress we are keenly aware of the extreme economic crisis and our communities and we're responsible for confronting the issues threatening the survival of the people and institutions that we represent over the last several weeks we have reengaged in constructive dialogue on the issues that we have been fighting for throughout our careers foreclosures unemployment access to credit for small businesses and parity in the federal hiring and contracting process are but a few of the issues that we have continued I work on each of us serves on the Financial Services Committee and we have not been forceful enough in our efforts protect to protect the most vulnerable of our population that is 10 of us serve on that committee we cannot address systems risk on a broad scale without taking steps to prevent the crumbling of our communities infrastructure since last September we have continuously voted for bailouts and reform for the very institutions that created this devastation without properly protecting the african-american and minority youjizz are small businesses that stops today while we appreciate the need for the expansion of regulatory authority we can no longer afford for our public policy to be defined by the worldview of Wall Street policy for the least of these must be integrated into everything that we do we must protect and defend our individual constituents as well as the small businesses and institutions that serve them let me take a moment to paint the picture we're faced with in our communities when we return home to our districts although unemployment is at record levels nationwide the impact on the african-american community is especially devastating but the latest figures at seventeen point four percent the numbers are even higher for are you talking thirty-five percent in many communities in addition food stamp assistance a key economic indicator is at twenty-eight percent for african-americans ESCA hired to eight percent for whites these are among the reasons why they must focus on job creation economic development and the expansion of small and minority businesses in the coming days the Congressional Black Caucus were put forth a proposal that we hope will be included in the coming jobs package our communities were targeted by predatory lenders fifty-five percent of loans made in 2005 to african-americans were sup run as compared to seventeen percent for whites in addition one in ten African American homeowners expected to go into foreclosure compared to one and 25 for what African Americans and Latinos could move up to one hundred and seven four billion dollars and well over half of the nation's overall foreclosure losses the solutions that have been put in place to this point I'm not working so we must be strong and LeGarrette working with the administration we must enhance foreclosure programs to include principal right now mandatory loss mitigation and loans for unemployed homeowners in addition to the end vidual struggles in the community our institutions are facing greater economic strain due to the recession and a continued legacy of lack of access to credit in 2001 there were 600 african-american own automobile dealers today there are less than 300 African American auto dealers are based on a credit squeeze as the very manufacturers that we have bailed out have failed to use their resources to assist in the floorplan financing and other mechanisms to help in the survival of these important institutions the top lending facilities must be made more flexible in order to accommodate the needs of these automobile dealers african-american old bags have not been able to benefit in the same way from the assistance provides to some of the larger institutions that have been deemed too big to fail some of the honors and preventative aspects of the federal programs lockout minority owned banks if the federal government is going to be in the business of assisting financial institutions in a time of crisis there should be more time to ensure that small and community banks will lend to african-american and minority communities have the opportunity to participate programs such as the one announced a few weeks ago by the President to increase access to credit must be carefully tailored to incentivize participation and increase access to capital despite significant numbers of highly skilled qualified and experienced minority and women are legal accounting asset management and financial services firms barriers to entry remain high or prohibitive for significant contracting and asset purchase opportunities within the federal government and its agencies that is wise also members of the committee co Walker provisions in the financial services regulatory reform package that would establish the office of minority and women inclusion and each of the services focus agencies we must ensure parody and access and government contracted our communication infrastructure is failing there has been a sharp reduction in the number of african-american owned newspapers by forty percent over the last decade like other businesses access to capital has been a challenge but this industry is well with declining ad revenues newspapers everywhere struggling to survive along with the african-american broadcasters who have also suffered declines by up to forty percent they are the primary means of communication of our community for our community as such the federal government must make a post focus effort to increase this advertising in the african-american community on all issues related to our work the GAO reported that from 2001 through 2005 the federal government devoted only five percent of his 4.3 billion ad related expenditures to smaller minority businesses which included broadcasters advertising agency graphic design houses etc let us be clear we understand that many of these issues are not issues that have been created solely in the last nine months but we also clear that we have the resource at the political will and the duty to come up with solutions that serve all Americans there are those who choose not to speak about african-americans or the working class we can no longer be in denial that certain sectors of our population including the african-american community are filling this recession to a greater extent today we're here to reaffirm our commitment to be forceful advocates for the voiceless and insists that all of the resources of the government whether they be through financial assistance programs or federal contracting exhibit a basic fairness and equality that historically has not existed and we commit to using all of our resources as a collective body to be sure that this is that with that look at you questions we won't be able to go into much greater detail than that

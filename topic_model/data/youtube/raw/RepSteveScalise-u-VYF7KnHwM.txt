house minority whip steve scalise joins me now congressman thanks so much for taking time for us today um with this current iteration of calls for defunding and diminishing the role of department of homeland security and i say this current iteration because it's certainly not the first time we've we've heard calls for this from progressives do you get the sense from where you sit that this push is coming from the president or is it likelier that it's coming from the progressive wing of his party maybe even including vice president kamala harris it seems to me from where i said there's a little bit of a divide yeah jillian it's good to be with you and frankly it's very disturbing when you hear a sitting member of congress referring to people who are keeping our nation secure as terrorists i've been down with the border patrol agents i went down there a few months ago and we actually went and saw just how out of control the border is because of president biden's policies where he's literally opened the border the real big concern is that right now it's the drug cartels from mexico who are who have operational control over america's southern border and the democrat party has become more and more in washington the party of defunding police defunding border patrol defunding ice who's standing up for uh americans who are hard working who want to have a functioning legal system of immigration including by the way the millions of people who come here legally who wait in line who follow the process and so i think they're they're first of all they're way out of step with the american people but the left the far left radical base of the democrat party is controlling the agenda and president biden is letting them write these policies he has yet to stand up to any of them i'm curious to see jillian is president biden going to speak out against a sitting member of congress referring to our border patrol agents as terrorists people who work for his department of homeland security he's yet to show he's willing to stand up to them interesting so it seems like you're saying it's one thing to not for the president to not be on the same side and not overtly support these policies it's another thing if he's actually going to take a stand and condemn the people in his party that are calling for these moves i want to make sure sir that we get your take on big tech today it's very hot story for us on the same day that former president trump announced his lawsuit yesterday against facebook and google and twitter we did have a house caucus republicans unveiled this legislative agenda to break up big tech and crack down on censorship the house judiciary committee ranking member jim jordan said he's spearheading spearheading the effort and he wants uh big tech has targeted conservatives for far too long house judiciary republicans have had enough so my question for you sir is you know we've been hearing for months years really threats from lawmakers both sides of the aisle to rein in and really legislate big tech the social media companies you guys excel at these like marathon hearings where you drag the ceos up to the hill you demand answers from them but we've seen really very little by way of legislation is this like the big kahuna push now that we've all been waiting for do you think yeah this has been growing for a long time and frankly republicans and democrats both have concerns with big tech for different reasons on our side we're very concerned about the censorship that you're seeing of conservative voices way way more than you see other voices being censored by big tech i think that's what president trump was getting at but what leader mccarthy did is rolled out a bunch of task forces one of them dealing specifically with big tech uh jim jordan's going to be involved katherine mcmorris rogers is going to be involved all of our leading republicans in those subject areas are going to be focused on how to hold big tech more accountable and also by the way standing up for transparency and for the privacy rights of everyday americans who right now no matter what app you're using they're tracking uh things that you may not even realize and there's very a little way for a consumer to find out exactly what is being tracked on their device if you're just having a conversation with a friend about going hiking next thing you know you're getting things fed to you advertisements about hiking uh you never even typed anything into a google search so those are the kind of things that people are very concerned about we're looking into all of that and putting a task force together so that we can come up with true legislative proposals so there is this perception sir here in washington at least that congress writ large is busy sort of fixing the problems of two to ten years ago when it comes to holding big tech accountable i hear a lot of critics saying you guys lawmakers are about two to ten years behind the problem you're kind of building the maginot line and solving the problems of decades ago when these big tech companies are moving in leaps and bounds and coming up with new innovative ways to try and gather data from americans so that they can keep it they can essentially resell that repackage and then resell that data to companies some of them foreign what are you doing on that end of the spectrum yeah you know look i i used to write software for a living i have a computer science degree and one of the things i've always said is the technology community can innovate faster than congress can legislate and you know one of the things you've got to look at now is privacy is the next realm and it's it's not you don't pay for apps anymore it's because they're aggregating data from people who use these apps and people have very little information about just what is being tracked just what data is being collected and then sold uh unbeknownst mostly to the consumer it's very hard to even find out what that information is that they're tracking and selling in aggregate form and so trying to get a better better handle getting more transparency is going to be something real important that we're going to try to do well congressman thanks for taking time to break it down for us today we wish you the best with the task force going forward please come back to check in with us sometime soon we'll do thanks jillian you're back

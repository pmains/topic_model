today we spend an average of a hundred billion dollars a year responding to disasters a hundred billion this is a number that we can't afford to continue responding continue reacting to disasters the national institutes of building standards have done all sorts of analysis looking at the efficacy of making investments on the front end on the front end so mr speaker we're not in a situation where as in the chairman's case we're having to go into oregon or washington or california or other states out west and pick up the pieces of these communities destroyed by forest fires we don't have to go to these communities that have been impacted by severe winter storms communities living along rivers that have been inundated by floods or communities on the southern coast the gulf coast or the east coast that have been pummeled by hurricanes such as our home state of louisiana with just in recent years hurricanes lara delta zeta ida some of the most powerful hurricanes to ever make landfall in the united states the national institute of building standards have found that for every one dollar you invest in in natural mitigation solutions you get up to thirteen dollars in savings by adopting more resilient building standards building codes you get up to eleven dollars in savings let me say it again mr speaker we can't afford to keep doing this a hundred billion dollars a year as ranking member graves noted a few minutes ago back in 2018 we worked on a bipartisan basis to to actually enact the the brick program to to really take the pdm the pre-disaster mitigation program and put it on steroids and this based on the incredible popularity of the program the progress that's been made this legislation helps to advance it even further by increasing the funds that are available most importantly by eating into that hundred billion dollars we're spending in taxpayer funds every year responding to disasters reducing that cost and most importantly mr speaker the most important thing is the actual impact on the ground those communities out west that are dealing with forest fires helping to stop prevent contain those forest fires those communities that are that are experiencing devastation from winter storms helping to protect and make them more resilient communities that are getting repetitive floods making sure those communities can withstand those floods in those communities that we represent in south louisiana that have had hurricane after hurricane that are truly challenging the existence the livelihood of those communities helping to make sure they can withstand they can withstand these storms and we can continue to live life and enjoy life in coastal communities like south louisiana lastly mr speaker i want to thank chairwoman titus and chairman defazio ranking member graves and rank member webster we were able to include two amendments in here number one we worked with congressman dunn on the very important right now fema takes so long to reimburse communities in the aftermath of a disaster in many cases our parishes our counties and states have to take out loans and so there's an amendment added to this bill that mandates that fema pay the interest cost of the loan if they're going to take forever to reimburse they can at least cover the loan costs the interest costs in the loan and and the second one is a government efficiency provision right now the corps of engineers has the most arduous process in the federal government for developing projects including cost-to-benefit ratios environmental analysis and technical feasibility yet under current law corps of engineer projects are prohibited from receiving funds under the brick program or pdm this fixes it if that's the best solution if it's the greatest cost savings if it's the best efficiency of the dollar my goodness we shouldn't be stopping it we should be incentivizing it so i want to thank all the folks that work together on this legislation i look forward to enactment and urge adoption and yield back

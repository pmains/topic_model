thank you mr speaker and thank you to my colleague from ohio for yielding here we go again about to vote on a divisive bill being pushed through by the majority without any republican input disguised as accountability this bill hinders law enforcement's ability to do their jobs it limits the readiness of law enforcement and demonizes an entire profession for the actions of a few a bill for my minnesota colleague mr stauber a former police officer himself accomplishes many of the aims of this bill before us today and has bipartisan support from the stakeholders involved but democrats rejected it picking partisanship over real reform to help and improve law enforcement we do not deny there is work to be done but the path to getting it done is working together to ensure that law enforcement develops the necessary tools to keep our communities safe and protect the rights of people they serve i urge my colleagues to vote no and work on a bill that will really help law enforcement and the citizens and i thank you madam speaker and i yield back

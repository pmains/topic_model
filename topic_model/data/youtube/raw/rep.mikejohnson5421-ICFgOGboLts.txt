attorney general millions of americans are deeply concerned today that instead of addressing the most pressing issues facing our country we're watching the biden garland justice department be weaponized that you are using your authorities now to advance far-left policies and attack republican-led state actions and erode constitutional norms the most recent case in point has been brought up this morning your memorandum directed the fbi and other department of justice officials to get involved in local school board debates it concerns us that it was issued just five days after the national school board association sent a letter to president biden which referred to concerned parents as the equivalent of quote domestic terrorists and perpetrators of hate crimes unquote given the timing of all this your memo appears to have been motivated by politics more than any pressing federal law enforcement need this is concerning to us and it's worthy of investigation it also concerns us that your actions may have been motivated by your family's financial stake in this issue published reports so that show that your son-in-law co-founded a company called panorama education we now know that that company publishes and sells critical race theory and so-called anti-racism materials to schools across the country and it works with school districts nationwide to obtain and analyze data on students often without parental consent on its website the company brags that it surveyed more than 13 million students in the u.s it's raised 76 million dollars from powerful investors including people like mark zuckerberg just since 2017. my first question is this are you familiar with title 5 of the code of federal regulations which addresses the rules of impartiality for executive branch employees and officials i am very familiar with it and i want to be clear once again that there's nothing in this memorandum which has any effect on the kinds of curriculums that are taught or the ability of parents to complain about the kinds of i understand your position on this free speech wait just a minute the question is the question is the thing that is concerned many of those parents that are showing up these school board meetings the the very basis of their objection and their vigorous debate as you mentioned earlier is the curricula the very curricula that your son-in-law is selling so to millions of americans i mean my constituents i was home all weekend i got an earful about this they're very concerned about that subpart e of that federal regulation says an employee of the executive branch is discouraged from encouraging con engaging in conduct that's likely to affect the financial interest of someone close to them your your son-in-law your daughter uh clearly meets that definition and and so the question is uh did did you follow that regulation did you have the appropriate agency ethic official look into this did you seek guidance as the federal federal regulation requires this memorandum is aimed at violence and threats of violence understand that but did you see excuse me did you seek ethics counsel before you issued a letter that directly relates to the financial interest of your family yes or no this memorandum does not relate to the financial interests of anyone it's a thr it's again i take that as a no i take that as a no memorandum is against violence and threats of violence will you mr attorney general will you commit to having the appropriate ethics designee review the case and make the results public this memorandum is aimed at violence and threats of violence i understand your talking point you're not answering my question mr attorney general with all due respect will you submit to an ethics review of this matter yes or no there is no company in america or hopefully no law-abiding citizen in america who believes that threats of violence should not be prevented there are no conflicts of interest that anyone could have according to you but sir with due respect that's the purpose of the federal regulation we need objective third parties to review our activities you don't get to make that decision yourself it doesn't matter you're the top you're the chief law enforcement of this country this raises questions in the minds of millions of americans and your impartiality is being called into question why would you not submit to a simple ethics review of that i am exquisitely aware of the ethics requirements but you're not following them i have followed them and lived with them for the last 25 years did you seek an ethics review of this or not i'm going to say again there are no conflicts of interest involved when the justice department okay okay according to you i got that i'm not trying to be disrespectful but you are not respecting our rules our constitutional norms and the federal law that directly applies to your activities this is a great concern this is why people are losing faith in our institutions they're losing faith in this department of justice and you and i both know as constitutional attorneys that if if the people lose their faith in our system of justice if they lose their faith in the idea that justice is blind that they're not two standards that there's one standard of the law and that every time the gentleman has expired would the attorney general like to respond to the innuendo no all i can say is i completely agree that the rule of law and respect for it is essential and i will always do everything possible to uphold that and to avoid any kind of conflict of interest but you will not submit to an ethics time of the gentleman has expired i would just time of the gentleman it wasn't innuendo it was a question thank you it was a question the question is the editorial comments from the chair about other people's questions is not appreciated by this side of the aisle

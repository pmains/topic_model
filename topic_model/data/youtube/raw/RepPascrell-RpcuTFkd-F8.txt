[Music] to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district [Music] hi I'm Mike Angus monville Pascrell ninth congressional district and we're here with to the point all we got a special guest today knock your eyeballs out Frank LoBiondo it's the congressman all the way down to southern part New Jersey we went into the assembly Jersey legislature together in 1988 January 88 we served there together he went out to Congress a term before me he was in a dhingra's revolution i won because of the Gingrich revolution the next time and in 96 and I took office in the Congress in January of 97 I'm honored to have served with him he's leaving the the Congress not because he got defeated but because Mary even really gay became much smarter than the rest of us and he's ready to do something else he worked with us his father built a beautiful trucking business in South Jersey I remember the time he drove me all over South Jersey I thought I was going to another state or another planet or something he's I think it's one fourth to the entire state isn't it try 40% 40% of the entire state that's not fair that's not democracy well it's a people we're not talking about square mileage when we've won we break down so we're honored to have him here and it's a great pleasure Frank and thank you for coming aboard well thank you we've worked hard together on a lot of good projects together and I can't think of a better person that I met in the Congress even there you are of the quote one call other party than Frank law beyond a good family man good for the entire state of New Jersey it's good for the nation what you've done in aviation what you've done with the coast guard on transportation I think he served on the committee for 25 years no 22 I'm sorry 22 years not the total time you were here and as you did penance the first couple of years like I did like everybody but you you've done such a great job at transportation and the epitome of it the the other day folks was we named the coast Coast Guard bill after Frank LoBiondo congratulations yeah I'm not sure how that happened but thank you it happened who can happen so Frank give us the synopsis all you've been through how you got here how you made that decision well we probably don't have enough time for the whole story but let me also thank you because when people ask me what it's like now that I'm leaving and I say it's it's very bittersweet I'm not going to miss the drama I'm not going to miss some of the other things that are going on but I'm gonna miss the relationships and at the top of that list is bill Pascrell we've been through a lot together in the state of New Jersey we've been a lot through a lot together here and if we had been able to convince our leadership to let the two of us decide the agenda we'd have a balanced budget world peace we'd eliminate world hunger we would have fixed at all and I told that to Bill Clinton when he was the president about you because because I bestow it though the relationship we've had is what is missing from a large part of this congressional body we're members of the opposite party can look at issues I can find common ground and you know I started out as a freeholder in Cumberland County I didn't seek office they sort of came after me one thing led to another both our paths led here to Washington we've encountered a lot of issue we worked a lot of things for New Jersey together and you know there is a big difference as you said we should be a separate state South Jersey should have been a separate state we've got very little from North Carroll start up again right but you were one of the ones who understood South Jersey you knew where Atlantic City was you knew about beach replenishment you knew about the FAA tech center you know about the only Coast Guard recruit training center in the nation nobody even knew it was there no no even know it was there and always and repeatedly came to me and said what could I do to help and whenever I asked you did so that's what's made up our relationship and why we've I think I've enjoyed some degree of getting some things done because of working together with people like you legit legislatively Frank I can remember you know a lot of things to get in your mind but with you what's the side of my mind not more than anything else but it it's one of the things that sticks out of my mind is how you thought of the entire state when we got attacked by nature and Sandy you were the first one to run point on us not to accept why should we accept one penny less than what went to the state of Louisiana and Mississippi and all those states down there with that her great hurricane during a Bush administration why people didn't understand that and then I went to Texas on storms in Republican areas they they greeted me like I was bringing medicine to the people there as I came down on my hell and the helicopter just to see what it was like and canopies blue canopies over every roof we took care of those people because we're Americans when sandy came those same people voted not to send any funds how could this be you persisted you persisted and you took the rest of us along with you really and we're still fighting today could you imagine we are still fighting for equality and equity in the storms that hit whether it was Texas Louisiana whether was New Jersey what's the difference we're all Americans what do we know jet the denomination's of what's got who the people are in those great fires on California is they are these blue people or Redfield what are what are we crazy you persisted tell us give us a brief synopsis well none of us really expected to be impacted by Sandy the way it was we knew that a big storm was coming I knew we were do right but it was always going to be next year or sometime in the answer and mostly wind mostly wind and the flooding from Back Bay not as grab from the ocean just as that gets that river flooded manake and Littleford right so when all this hit we knew we had a challenge on our hands but I was pretty confident because in the history of our country the entire 200 plus years right when there was a natural disaster we're there we're always there earthquake hurricane tornado whatever it may all red and blue states I never expected that we would have people from my own party the Republican Party said we're going to change the rules now now that it's New Jersey we're going to change the rules and at first I was taking it personally and I still take it personally being Sicilian you know what that mean that means that's right it means for both Italians but it means that laminated long lists toeholds right and when at least you and your colleagues and the Democrats and in this state of New Jersey we all held together and thanks to a couple of us Peter King and a few of us who would not accept this tragedy that they were trying to put on us and you remember that year we were here New Year's Eve that's correct we were here New Year's Eve because we had been promised this would be fixed right and they wanted to get past that current Congress where we had a lot of friends on our side who had committed to do this right and they wanted a new Congress that's correct where there were freshmen who didn't understand the thing saying it like it is we remember I remember calling my wife on New Year's Eve I thought I was back at a service calling my wife on New Year's Eve and telling her she says I don't believe you're in Washington doing this I says so I put John Larsen on he was my backup and I went to bed on New Year's Eve 10:30 yeah that's a bad shape I was I you know I couldn't believe we were down here and you know with the people that we helped it's a difficult thing to even look at them and talk to them which we need to do because they voted why did you vote no against us what the hell did we do again to eat to you well we got to watch every dime of course you got to watch every dime well you may recall in my floor remarks on one occasion I wanted to congratulate the members of Congress from Florida because they weren't going to have any hurricanes anymore they need to worry about it I wanted to congratulate California because they weren't gonna have any earthquakes anymore yeah and warned all of them you'll have your day everything and to this day we have people who have just suffered natural disasters that are begging for something to be done five minutes ago when they held us up for months and months and months so the suffering of the people that you and I represented meant nothing the suffering of their people mean more than the suffering of our people that's what's really egregious so I hope it's a chapter that's never repeated to you you carry the list on your pocket it's laminated it's love the Republicans who voted no and it's oh yes I'm not standing oh yes yeah I carry something that I carry don't do things I carry all time is the Constitution I carry that because I'd rather watch paint dry on a wall than when I was in high school but I've read that was a special caucus you remember what I termed it the hypocrisy caught a Parsi oh yeah you got it so the laminated list is for the hypocrisy caucus who decided that they were going to change the rules for New Jerseyan right and that's just flat wrong and on the other thing I carry all the time is the list of the folks from my district who died on 9/11 that's the two things I carry and all the time would have been what is what's been your approach the coalition's Frank since you've been here and has it changed is it easier more difficult it's something that works the bipartisan coalition's that we call them working groups call them what you want that we put together we find common grounds and I don't know your experience but my experience is that when I first got here they were much easier to form and they were much easier to get a result with wine why is it I think it's the overall mentality of both our parties and I think both our parties share some blame in this we get tied up in rhetoric sometimes from our leadership that shuts people down we had we had the creation of the freedom caucus right the freedom caucus when that was created intimidated a lot of people we we have republican media outlets that spent more time attacking republicans and finding primary opponents for Republicans than getting a solution for a problem that was affecting all of us and you know in this past election the one good thing I think that came out a lot of young people are in a lot of new people are in a good diverse population but what I find fascinating is when you look at the numbers remember that was my job before I became of seeking or someone seeking office that when you look into the weeds you find out that moderate Democrats won most of the primaries and were the reason why they won the general elections that's a healthy thing in our party there may be three or four five we stick out as maybe extreme in certain areas they don't have the day and I don't ever get the impression that they have today so I think that's a healthy thing now when we were freshmen we come in here like Mickey Mouse these freshmen think they know all the answers some of them and I think you're gonna see a little bit of that and that's up to leadership to work it out but I believe in a bottom-up kind of listening channel so that it's not just top-down this is what you're gonna do if we get back to regular order and the chairmen have their authority in their power and in the committees and in the subcommittee's I think that's a better Congress do you agree or disallow a tap oint in time got away from it I think it hampered the ability of the institution to get things done and I think in some respects that hampered our ability as members to work together because the framework wasn't allowed to be in place for us to be able to utilize that energy that we create when we get together and we're from different parties that's powerful that's powerful Frank you've had a great relationship with organized labor down in South Jersey why are so many of the people in your party afraid to get into those kinds of relationship what is it working people these are people that that exists and work in our districts why are we so afraid some people in your party afraid to taking that into consideration I don't understand that hard for me to understand as well so you mentioned my background and working in our family trucking business so I sort of had a first-hand example because we were a full teamster operation to mulch I can go teamster truck drivers teamster mechanics teamster dockworker and you survived and I was the one who after I got my feet in the business was tasked with negotiating the contracts and then dealing with the working rules our stands so if if there was a union member who came in who had a grievance we sat down and there in the beginning was a little bit rough but in 25 years I didn't have a grievance that left the barn because when we were wrong we were wrong when they were wrong they were wrong and I got to see that this picture that was painted of union operations that they were trying to put companies out of business and this other nonsense it's out there was just not true I got in a little bit of trouble with Tom DeLay from time to time when we had some issues coming before our conference there were pure anti-union measures I still don't it that I had to get up and say listen I was in management here's my experience now if you're from Montana if you're from Idaho you got a whole different ball game on your hands right but if you're from the Northeast and some of these populated areas I find it hard to believe I refuse to accept that you can't be Pro labor and pro business I was one of the only ones who was endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce and endorsed by the afl-cio at the same time it's a that's like when I ran for Congress I was endorsed by both so it's not mutually exclusive yeah and you're absolutely right Frank you've been in this business for twenty four years at this end what's what's your future waiting in there what do you want to do well I've been fortunate to have great committee assignments after I got over the hump that you talked about right so transportation chaired Coast Guard and maritime a lot of maritime experience for more than half my time here just coming off of chairing Aviation think I've developed a lot of knowledge and a lot of expertise been on armed services almost the whole time and although it took me a lot of years to convince John Boehner to put me on the Intelligence Committee I'm finishing term limiting out on intelligence where I've been chairing the CIA Wow now if I put all that together with some 30-plus trips on armed services and CIA Wow most of them into Africa some places that most people don't want to go right and we've been on some trips together where people won't go up use it only fire those weapons up to the Pakistan Afghanistan border so I'd like to think that I could really help out with those issues somewhere along the line of course a lot of people don't give it the thought but we have some very strict ethics rules here which I'm very conscious of to make sure that I don't cross any lines winding up so you really know you will you really can't talk a whole lot before you leave but as this winds down to January 3rd at 11:59 a.m. I'm hopeful to make a connection that allows me to stay involved with the issues that I've spent a lot of time in anyway I can be of help you know that from I'm gonna call you and but anyway I could be of help I'm serious you've been such a great plus for the institution you know I talked about this said Pasquale he shoots his mouth off on a lot of things but he really has a respect that's what I want people to say about me I have a respect for the institution equal branches of government don't try to put anything over on me Bush Obama whatever your name is don't try to put anything on me because I'm not going to accept it I didn't accept it in trade I didn't accept it on Intel I want to know what's going on America people have a right to know on trade article 1 section 8 is perfectly clear we have control of Commerce you'd never know it under Democratic and Republican presidents we've surrendered our options and then we wonder why we get bad trade deals and and and and this president now we have now he was all wrong about blaming immigrants for outsourcing of jobs the outsourcing of jobs because countries like Mexico don't respect their workers they can't even have a private contract they can't have a private boat so we gotta straighten that all out we gotta straighten that all out you made the legislative branch of government what it should be you did everything you possibly could as one person we have no excuses to lay down sit in our hands and say all what was me you didn't accept that Union except that statical you are you are an anomaly in the Congress Frank and you are gonna be missed and I'm glad that before this was over you introduced me to your beautiful brother a Jesuit priest and who's a great guy also so your your parents must be so proud of all you how many brothers and sisters do you have just two older brothers to all the brothers and one of them is Jesuit metal one suggestion yeah and he's still going yeah he's still going he's the record Gonzaga he was the executive director good basketball team yeah well Gonzaga high school but their eyes are good they're good in sports yeah he was the executive director of the Woodstock Institute for a lot of years that's right he was a missionary in Chile and when things went really sideways in around 1970 and he had been working with a very poor area in osorno Chile he came back and realized that he can have a bigger impact if he changed policy and instead of helping out people 1 to 10 at a time if you change policy and gay people an economic opportunity but that would be the biggest thing so the Jesuits had a think tank called the Woodstock Institute how's the drummer's like affordable so I noticed I got to be there with some of the most brilliant minds in the world in different areas but just like everything else the Jesuit Maryland province could not sustain it so a few years ago while he was director he was he was directed to close the Institute oh yeah it's really tough that was a tough one that's very tough for him but and he's a little bit older than me and a little bit up there myself so having the opportunity to be the rector of Gonzaga and work with the students and give them retreats and do a lot of the things he's doing they're not actually teaching courses but working with the whole student population and there's also the McKenna Center that's right there that takes care of homeless people right right it's over by Union Station so he's he's very happy with what he's doing let me ask you a question which time so you surf here 24 years which period did you like the best well well you know initially you come in as a freshman and Republicans were never supposed to win that year so Republican leadership was not prepared to take over and that first year you you lucky you missed it we had no schedule if we got finished 11 or 12 o'clock at night we were happy it was basically five days a week and after six months I'm still not sure I knew where the bathrooms were yeah cellars if you were in the Longworth burthen or the arremer bill Rayburn building get lost in there but after we settled down a little bit as tragic as September 11th was I think that the way for that period of time we came together where weren't Republicans are we right Democrats and we focused on what we could do to protect the country that was a very special period of when we came together who stood up who stands up who stands up and you know we had then then Republicans sort of got sidetracked a little bit and Democrats took control in 2006 that was not a particularly fun period for me I'm sure it was different tried trying to try going to the town meetings any very Democrat in that 2009 Affordable Care Act and I ran on the act because I wasn't gonna run against it I really believed in it I didn't was unable to get done what I wanted to get done in and as we were writing it but I think it was a good start we should have made many changes afterwards I thought was impossible for us we lost them for short they tried to get rid of the thing but that was a difficult time that was a very difficult and we when we came became the majority in 2006 we had this big branding idea before we get into health care we were doing the carbon tax and all of that stuff and the Senate wasn't gonna bring it up through so we sent our toughest district people out to defend this even though we voted for it we start off on the wrong foot before we even got into ACA day I remember it clearly berry like that almost right and I think that gave birth to the the flip in 2010 which was really the creation of the freedom caucus yeah and for the Republicans led to a whole new headache the part would they call him see Party Tea Party Tea Party morphed into the into the freedom caucus yeah and the the Main Street group that I've been a part of for all these years the really moderate Republicans the Republicans who wanted to get a result who wanted to work across the aisle who understood labor issues or understood environmental issues we were really diminished when that happened and there was a greater voice crying out from from that particular group and that was the tail wagging the dog for us it was a particularly tough time they listen to some nonsense about what should be done we ended up with a 17-day government shutdown I didn't I wasn't elected here to shut the government down or to do any of that stuff so that was a particularly tough time but having a chance to to chair aviation and we've had the first long term five-year FAA reauthorization bill since 1980 tests what we needed and transmitted infrastructure that's why do you think if acted on idea we did that under Democratic leadership we did it under Republican leadership ma bro bill Shuster Jim Oberstar yeah right down the line here right down the line we got to get back to that we do but in in terms for me getting the waiver to chair both aviation and CIA were two areas that I was so inspired and motivated by and just loved the opportunity to do that so as though the political waters were troubled in the last couple of years and we've talked about this before I was always in the political crosshairs before my district was what was considered a d-plus your biggest threat was there it was a climber my primary so five minutes after the polls closed I was a target of the Detroit right right just the way it is we raise our hand nobody should feel sorry for us please vote for me but it's a little bit different than some buddies from +14 district I lost 10 district but having those chairmanships and having a chance to impact policy that really makes a difference in the country that was really nonpartisan an aviation Rick Larson is fabulous to work with right I'd go anywhere with him at any time he was great to work with the Intel committee was kind of the same thing so I feel that you know you you have to pick a time in place and Kenny Rogers was right about knowing when to hold them and fold them that's great so great chairman um I'm feeling pretty good about where it is Frank I can't tell you how appreciative I am that you did this before you know it's not your swan song probably but that you did this before you left the institution but you never really leave here Frank you have so many people who really love you as a human being well you've been a good friend for a lot of years and nobody can take those things away you know we have issues that go up and down inside ways but the relationship and the friendships last forever thank you for being there thank you very good and good luck to you and your family ok thank you for joining us our address and phone number will appear got a great American thank you doctor thank you for watching [Music] you [Music]

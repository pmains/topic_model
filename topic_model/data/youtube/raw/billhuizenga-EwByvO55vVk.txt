who as someone who was publicly opposed to the the bailouts that had happened under dodd-frank I was not in Congress at the time but I'm dealing with the echo effects of it yet today the the I was I was very frustrated to see that and having to explain to colleagues or I'm sorry to constituents about why that had gone on and I've had a chance to express to at least a couple of you personally that you cannot count on this congressman to ever allow that to happen again or to vote for a situation like that again but part of the action here and what we are trying to do is to make sure that it never happens again on anybody's watch but I do have one main line of questioning in this and I'd like to have all of you answer very quickly it can be yes or no or just briefly are you properly capitalized properly sized and stable so that you survive without hard-working taxpayer Americans dollars having to be put back into the system and and having the taxpayer on the hook so mr. Corbett are you properly sized capitalized and stable we are properly sized we are scaled to serve our clients ok great mr. diamond yes mr. Gorman yes yes we are sharp yes we are mr. Shawn yes we are ok all right well I appreciate that there had been a lot of a lot of discussion about whether you're too big to manage and whether you really were staple and whether you were properly capitalized and I think the numbers do speak for themselves on that I want to quickly move to two brexit because this is this is of some real significance we're two days away from from a hard exit the London is is the center of the derivatives market there's nearly 2 billion contracts that were written there in 2018 alone hundreds of trillions of dollars that that flow through there the UK has been dominant in the space and because of the regulatory regime imposed by the Bank of England and the financial conduct authority in fact every globally active financial firm maintains a presence in in London I assume you all do is anybody not everybody does okay well the Chairman giancarlo highlighted he has a quote here that quote London is and will remain a global Centre for derivatives trading and clearing end quote and he also added that the package of measures will quote provide a bridge over brexit through a durable regulatory framework upon which the thriving derivatives market between the UK and the United States may continue and endure and so I'm very concerned about whether regardless of whether the breaks that outcome is whatever that is are you're in Lucian's going to be needing to do more direct trading with continental banks through those right regulated by the Bank of England or how are you planning on having this happen I'll take bad mr. Corbitt you as I stated earlier we have set up a vehicle now that encompasses our UK operation we've separated our European operation from that yep we have banks we have brokerages in in both jurisdictions at this point are you going to have to be dealing more with the main with the continental banks then directly I don't know okay alright anybody else care to weigh in on that I bet you you feel prepared and I think mr. diamond or somebody earlier had said uncertainties but we have put the planning in place correct is this is this actually is this err an area that you need to be in are you what are you doing for the world economy mr. korman mr. Dimon we need to be in Europe absolutely I mean listen we we collectively finance the largest institutions in the world predominant number of which were in the US so we absolutely need to serve them globally all right thank you and I will be submitting some questions earlier and I do want to say thank you mr. diamond and mr. Corbett for your involvement in Detroit coming from Michigan very important work that you've been doing our gentleman from Texas naked

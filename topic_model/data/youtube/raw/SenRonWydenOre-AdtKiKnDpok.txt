I believe it's hard to overstate the importance of writing the best possible farm bill here in the Senate when America desperately needs more jobs and one in every 12 American jobs is tied to agriculture this bill is an opportunity for the private sector to grow more jobs when obesity rates are driving the American healthcare challenge this bill can promote healthier eating without extra cost to taxpayers when we're concerned about the threat to our treasured lands and air and water this bill is our primary conservation program when our rural communities are especially hard-hit and the president of the Senate knows about this because she's got a lot of rural a country in her state these rural communities are walking on an economic tightrope and this bill can be a lifeline Madam President I spent much of last week in rural Oregon in my state oregonians do a lot of things well but what we do best is grow things lots of things oregan grows more than 250 different crops including everything from alfalfa seed to mint and blueberries several weeks ago the Oregon Extension Service reported that agricultural sales in my home state increased more than nineteen percent in 2011 agriculture in Oregon is now more than a five billion dollar industry annually and much of this is driven by high prices for wheat and cattle dairy products fruits vegetables and other specialty crops the fact is agriculture is really the lodestar to prosperity for many rural Oregon communities and nationwide there are many other towns in a similar position to the small communities I have the honor to represent here in the Senate there are about thirty eight thousand farms in my home state which roughly support 234,000 jobs that's about eleven percent of our state's employment as much as eighty percent of the agricultural goods produced in Oregon are sold out of state half of that is exported to foreign countries that was especially important to me Madam President because I also chair the trade subcommittee on the Senate Finance Committee and so what I have taken as the centerpiece of my approach to agriculture and to our country's economy is we ought to do our very best to grow things here in the United States to make things here in the United States to add value to them in the United States and then ship them somewhere and it's especially important for Oregon agriculture as I just noted that eighty percent of our agricultural goods that are produced in our state are sold out of a state now abroad our producers are doing very well nationally each 1 billion dollars in agricultural exports is tied to approximately 40 8,400 American jobs these growing overseas markets represent a way to create and sustain good-paying jobs that rely on export sales in fact agriculture is one of the only sectors with a trade surplus and in 2011 it boasted a surplus totaling 40 2.5 billion dollars the highest annual surplus on record from burns Oregon to Bangor Maine fart farm programs need to make it easier for those with low incomes to be able to eat healthier and there never ought to be a trade-off between promoting good health and affordable food and so I think we've got to look at some fresh a pro Madam President to promote healthy nutrition here in this country and I believe that it is not just an economic threat to our country it is also a national security threat to our nation Madam President because we have seen regrettably the many Americans would like to wear the uniform of the United States Patriots who have not been able to pass the health exams to physicals necessary to serve in our military it doesn't have to be this way and I want to outline some specific ideas for changing that to promote good health in our country without adding extra costs to taxpayers one opportunity for change Madam President is through the Farm to School a program again without costing taxpayers additional money it ought to be easier for delicious pears and cherries and other healthy produce grown just a few miles down the road to make it into our schools and again this ought to be a national approach I was in Oregon last week I had a chance to meet with the management of harry and david they're a major employer in my state and oregon pair producer and they told me they want to sell their fruit to schools down the street but instead a complex maze of federal rules and regulations has been a hassle I mean pretty much describes something that sounded like bureaucratic water torture so I'm going to offer an amendment madam president would make it less of a hassle for producers such as harry and david and farmers to sell directly to local schools all without spending additional federal dollars a second opportunity to improve our nation's health madam president lies with the SNAP program the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program which is better known as food stamps let me make clear I am NOT for cutting benefits I understand the crucial lifeline this program provides for millions of our people what I am interested in doing is seeing that through that 70 billion dollars is possible to wring more value for good nutrition and improving nutritional outcomes out of that enormous expenditure and one of the ways that we can do it would be to allow states to obtain a waiver from the SNAP program a third opportunity for improvement Madam President is through what's known as the gleaning program in Portland Oregon a wonderful nonprofit organization run by Tracy Osmond is known as urban gleaners and they are poised to collect surplus food hundreds of thousands of pounds of food from grocers restaurants and parties and all kinds of social organizations and they redistribute those hundreds of thousands of pounds of food to organizations that serve the hungry urban Gleaners is doing great work but they could be doing a lot more Madam President so again without spending a dime of extra money we can advocate for Gleaners all across America all across America Madam President by making it possible under the micro loan program if you're trying to set up a gleaning program in a small town and you have to borrow say $20,000 $20,000 to start a refrigeration program to preserve the quality of the food let's make it possible for the Gleaners to be part of the microloan program next Madam President to produce the healthy food needed to feed America we need fertile agriculture and conservation plays a central role in that roughly twenty eight percent of Oregon's land mass is devoted to agricultural production maintaining this land is crucial for our productivity for more than half a century the farm bill has supported infrastructure modernization and conservation of projects they give once again the opportunity for collaboration and that's key to our natural resources the time is also ripe to promote farmers markets and locally grown food which will lead to greater awareness of local markets roadside stands and community supported agriculture this farm bill expands those up opportunities and I think once again these types of local initiatives give us the opportunity to change the trajectory the tragic and staggering trajectory of obesity in this country and to ensure the viability of these programs the land required to produce nutritious foods must be addressed this bill at a crucial time in American history can help us grow more jobs it can help us improve the health of the people of our country without spending additional money it is an opportunity to protect our treasured land and air and water and finally it is a lifeline for these rural communities these communities that I've described as walking on an economic tightrope

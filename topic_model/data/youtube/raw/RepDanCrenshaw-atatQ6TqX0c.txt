we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw has landed all right welcome back folks um besides afghanistan what has been at the top of everybody's mind is the infrastructure bill and look there there's been a lot of consternation on from a lot of conservative media on the uh 19 senators that voted for republican senators that voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill and um maybe some of that is is deserved but i do want to get into it a little bit more detail and um tell me what the pros and cons of it are you know my initial assessment of it it's not nearly as bad as some people are saying it is um it's also not that great i think it's too expensive but it is not as if these senators voted for a human infrastructure bill which is i think what a lot of people think happened it's not exactly what happened but let's get into it let's talk about what it even means to have an infrastructure bill uh why it's useful why it isn't uh how much it should cost and how we should generally be thinking about infrastructure developments in the united states uh to help us with that conversation because i am uh i mean i'm you know pretty good at this but not an expert uh we're gonna have ed glaser back on uh professor ed glazer from you know he's been on before he's a senior fellow at the manhattan institute uh contributing editor at city journal uh professor of economics at harvard university where he has taught since 1992 and uh also this is his uh second time on the podcast and ed you know is has this been your greatest honor to be on this spot this this esteemed podcast twice easily represented petrol no it's not it's not even close the the the honorary degree from the swedish uh academy nothing nothing relative to to this so the uh oh we appreciate it that's for sure um we appreciate you lending us your expertise uh yet again um so before we actually keep moving on i'm gonna really quickly run through some of the things not not the price tags on these things but some of the things that are in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that has that has caused so much uh consternation um and i'll start off by saying this this i i still think it's too expensive um but when i look at what's actually in it it's not that what we're spending it on is absolutely terrible it's not exactly the progressive human infrastructure items that everybody thinks it is it's things like bridge repair it's um federal highway program money roads bridges major projects butts bus transit rail systems there's some ev infrastructure electrical vehicle infrastructure which i'm not a huge fan of but that's a pretty small part of it uh airports ports waterways flood mitigation water infrastructure the kind of thing that's pretty important in houston um clean drinking water high-speed internet environmental remediation just power infrastructure and there's a there's a variety of offsets but i think anybody honestly looking at this uh believes that the offsets don't possibly make up for the entire spending bill uh we're we're still there's just been various estimates on this but i think uh still lacking uh a few hundred billion dollars of pay fors so that that's generally what's in it uh without going into a massive amount of detail just for everybody's awareness just so everybody knows generally what we're talking about um what i guess what what is missing from the conversation ed i mean just uh if you just want to react to the sort of general discussion then let's get into some more details from there so i think there are two things that are missing from us first of all with most forms of infrastructure there really should be a strong presumption that the users should pay the cost right there's just no reason why we want you know federal tax dollars raised in nebraska to pay for uh john f kennedy airport right there's no reason why we want you know uh things that that protect florida's expensive seaside uh real estate to be paid for by uh taxpayers in in houston um the principle of user pays was a great principle in at the start of america's infrastructure bridge i mean the erie canal which is surely among the most successful infrastructure projects ever put together ever right paid for itself i think within three years uh through tolls and particularly if you think about infrastructure like highways that is that is likely to be used disproportionately by goods producers by the shippers of freight for goodness sakes why not let them pay so that's that's one thing the second thing is more cost benefit analysis right there are very few areas in which it's easier to waste billions and billions of dollars on white elephants than infrastructure and so we really have got to get into the habit of saying before we do anything new you don't have to do this with every road repaver i mean repaving roads is by and large a very good thing to do and it's you know maintenance of existing uh projects is pretty easy to justify but before you do anything else big you know we owe it to ourselves to actually try and figure out whether or not this will deliver enough benefits to offset the cost well that and then it makes a lot of sense you know one thing i want to ask about too is the difference between federal spending on infrastructure and say the problem solving that often happens at a more local or state level uh when we want to build something here for flood mitigation for instance we we had a bond sale two and a half billion dollars worth um you know the houston ship channel is being largely paid for by private investors who want to use it uh and then you know so there's a public private relationship a partnership that's that's uh materializing from them where the army corps of engineers will pay for operational costs uh you know maintenance costs in the longer run uh but the main initial investment is done from from private actors uh that kind of problem solving there's no incentive to do that kind of problem solving uh if if there's just a giant federal spending bill because why would there be right like why would i even think about spending my own money when i can just my time is now better spent trying to get the grant money from the federal government and you got to wonder what the efficiency of that one is there's a lot to like about local control and local spending right so the further you are between who pays for it and who is actually using it the more likely you're going to have a mismatch between costs and benefits between uh projects that people need and projects to get built so that doesn't mean that this current infrastructure bill can't have more of that but it needs to be then put into the implementation more clearly i mean it's it needs to be uh inserted in more strongly but you know i think in general your point that you know a lot to like about local problem solving is surely correct yeah and not just local problem solving but well actually let's talk about the user fees real quick i mean one of the things that people were really mad about this infrastructure bill was uh mileage fees for cars can you explain some of the costs the the pros and cons of of a user fee basically as opposed to a gas tax right you either if you're going to get people to pay into the into the federal highway system you either have to increase the gas tax to make up for it or you have some other kind of user fee which which looks at mileage and what i think a lot of my republican colleagues don't realize because they're claiming it's a tax on work on the rural areas um i'm not sure again if it's a choice between gas and mileage i'm not sure what their argument is because either way people who drive longer distances are going to feel the pain from that i'm not sure they realized that that that's actually a compromise to get at the people with electric vehicles who are using roads but not a lot of gas uh i mean can you comment on that really quick you're exactly right so the the whole point about um the mileage taxes are that you know people are frustrated that electric vehicle drivers aren't paying for any of the costs of highways i mean it's also just been true that we've been very reticent to raise the gas tax over the last 30 years it's very politically unpopular and since i'm don't have to run for office let me just make the case of why i think it's it's right that people should pay for the roads that they they use right so it's you know there's a uh it's it's socially just that you should pay for the things you get it's appropriate that you should you know pay for costs when you engage in some degree of wear and tear on the road and it's probably right that you should pay a little bit for the risks that are created through uh people potentially dying on the highways and from uh congestion all of those things are reasons why having a moderate amount of a charge for driving is a totally reasonable thing i mean i think it is entirely republican sentiment to believe that you know we cover our own costs in this world that if we're imposing costs on infrastructure we should be actually paying for that and um that principle has just gotten lost somehow and uh you know i certainly believe that it should be reinserted on this and certainly you know we shouldn't worry very much about it whether it's a gas or a mileage tax because as you say the whole point of mileage taxes are detects urbanites who are more likely to drive electric cars and one other question i have is well actually maybe i should just start with the broader question um there's actually disagreement and and some smart people who say look this crisis of a lack of infrastructure in the united states this this idea that we're just not building anything and that everything is crumbling is a bit of an overstatement um what do you what do you say to that i mean do we do we really need a 1.5 trillion dollar infrastructure bill right now well the uh that's um so it is certainly true that when the society of civil engineers gives us terrible grades for our highways um that is somewhat odds with the fact that the actual data on road roughness appears to be going in in the opposite direction we appear to have roads that are actually much smoother than we used to have in the 1980s according to the department of transportation zone data you know they send out these trucks they actually measure roughness and that's actually better than it was in the early testing when oddly the american society of civil engineers actually gave us a higher grade than they do today um so it's it's a sort of strange thing and i think by most measures i mean there are particular forms of american infrastructure famously john f kennedy airport is often used as being a poster child for infrastructure dysfunction but you know i am sure there are very few of your listeners who would favor you know taxing texas to pay for the by and large quite wealthy people fly in and out of john uh you know jfk that should be something that should be paid for by user fees on on the flyers so there are certainly things that america can do better in terms of infrastructure but whether or not this is the right number or not i don't know and i think certainly the more that this money is leveraged with you know coupling it together with user fees or various public private partnerships the more that we'll get for it so the key now is to be once we've got this money the key is to be smart about using it yeah and you know speaking of being smart and looking at projects that are vetted it it seems to me that something like the army corps of engineers all the projects that are in waiting for the army corps of engineers there's a backlog of money that if they if they got about 100 billion dollars right now that there is there are legitimately shovel ready projects ready to go and shove already in in the actual shovel ready sense not the sort of fake sense that we had back in 2008 but these are projects that have gone through all of the hurdles already permitting etc and it could go right now and they they have a very stringent cost-benefit analysis that that takes place there i mean when you talk about flood mitigation projects that's that's generally what we're talking about we're working with the army corps of engineers and such i mean but but that's that's certainly not 1.5 trillion dollars and in any case it you would you would think from a lot of the rhetoric that we're just not building anything now of course any american that's just that that takes a drive to their local grocery store sees that we're always building things it is not we're always doing maintenance it's not as if nothing is happening we're all just waiting to get this massive infrastructure bill and i always just like to take it back a few steps and say like does does the reality match the rhetoric uh of crisis that we're that we're seeing and and my feeling is that no it doesn't um and it's not that we don't want some spending on this i mean it's pretty obvious that we can simply transfer a lot of the kova's spending to infrastructure but that does that's not 1.5 trillion i think it's i think it's about half a trillion which is still an enormous amount of money um but but that for some reason that's not even on the table as far as an option and i and i and i have trouble figuring out why um i will say this bipartisan bill does it does improve upon permitting processes a little bit i'm not sure it does to the extent that a lot of republicans would like uh maybe can you talk for a second about how important that is i mean one thing i say a lot is you can't spend a lot more money on infrastructure if you keep making it hard to build infrastructure it seems like a silly thing to do so one of the things that i do is i co-lead a national bureau of economic research uh project on infrastructure and this is actually something i should have i should have disclosed to begin with that which it does receive funding from the department of transportation that started two years ago and it continues so that's a that's a uh that's a disclosure that i should have made but one of the papers that we've supported with that which is one of my my absolute uh favorites is on the evolution of the cost of highways um so the uh leah brooks and zach liskow uh lia's at george washington university zack's at yale law school have put together date on the cost of highways over the last 70 years and you know they got you know substantially more expensive between the 1950s and the 1980s um i think that's by the way just as a broader question for us to figure out why it is that infrastructure costs so much in the united states right we don't fully know the answer to this but certainly the difficulty of getting through various forms of permitting are part of it and what they looked at was you know they found that it wasn't any of the inputs it wasn't as if the asphalt was getting more expensive it wasn't as if the labor was getting more expensive what did seem to be happening is the roads were getting a lot more zigzaggy if that's an adjective that i can use they were they're much less straight they're much more likely to be built with additional mitigation you know walls to protect them from neighboring communities various other things which looks like they were accommodating the community in different ways now we all in in massachusetts we lived through this because we lived through the big dig which came in you know it was sold to massachusetts voters in the early days with oh this is federal money so we don't need to worry about it of course the federal money ended up only handling a tiny fraction of the 18 billion bill but one of the reasons why it was 18 billion dollars was it was spent in a way it was built in a way so that no one had to move their houses no one had to be relocated and you know this sort of hyper-sensitive way of dealing with this with everything this hyper-sensitive way can actually just blow up the price tag and we really do need to ask if we're going to be spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure are we buying it at the right price or are we you know buying infrastructure at a vastly higher price because we've made decisions about not bugging anybody right in uh in a way that you know justice goes too far well the other question is is is which should come first uh the the giant price tag that just we're just going to spend this money on infrastructure or or the assessment for need for projects and then see how much we can get that for again this is this is kind of why i go back to the army corps of engineers analysis because that assessment's been done and so now at least we know what the price tag is that that seems to be how we would buy things as normal consumers why wouldn't we buy it that way as public consumers right and and i wouldn't be an economist if i didn't also add that if you think that american infrastructure is really expensive to buy then you probably should want to buy a little less of it just in the same sense that if you think that a grocery store is particularly expensive you should probably want to buy a little less there yeah and that that's what's caused me personally as somebody who does have to vote on this um some consternation is is is not just the price tag but the fact that the price tag is on the heels of the six trillion dollars we've already spent for covid uh which is uh you know and which is not good what do we um you write you've written a lot about um economic trade-offs too and and maybe maybe you can comment on that um specifically you you write about how when we tend to do federal infrastructure it actually tends to go to the wrong places and in fact it goes to declining areas that don't require it there may be losing population um and not so much the places that are vastly increasing population would probably need it more so i believe that i mean i also think that it's important in terms of cost benefit analysis how much the place can adjust in response to it so this is a big case for you know building in texas right because in fact if you build something in texas you can then build housing next to it because no one's going to say that you can't build the housing that's around it if you build in coastal california you build in coastal massachusetts the land use controls are so stringent that it becomes very hard to adjust the housing stock to the new forms of infrastructure so that's that's one thing you really need to take into account which is not just the number of people who are there today but how many people will be there tomorrow if you build it um so i wrote a column for the new york times about six months ago that you know into this infrastructure bill should be squeezed a a you know a requirement that at least somewhere we should throw money at areas that made it easier to build and take money away from areas that make it harder to build now given the fact that the places that are easier to build tend to be red states and the places that are harder to build tend to be blue states i can understand why maybe that wasn't such a popular thing among the um the new york times readers especially and the vibe of your science readers but uh i'm i'm sticking with it the other mistake which you alluded to is this thing that you know this magical thinking that somehow you're going to build a monorail in downtown detroit and it's going to bring detroit back right most declining places have tons of infrastructure relative to their needs right you can run a bus at basically any speed you want in downtown detroit right because the streets are underutilized it's a city that was built for 1.85 million people that now that has less than half of that you don't need a monorail to glide over empty streets that makes absolutely no sense so you really have to ask what the region needs and you know so i mean detroit needs are are more cops and and you know more education it doesn't need more infrastructure whereas there are parts of texas they're parts of uh that absolutely do need more infrastructure especially those that are at risk from flooding yeah the full flood mitigation is big for us i mean it's interesting why do okay let me just put this really bluntly why do democrats love rail so much like what is what is it about it maybe it's because the most liberal cities have are just built for a subway system i mean you live in boston right that it's a it's built for a subway it makes a lot of sense to have a subway system new york it makes a lot of sense to have a subway system but the democrats here in houston also want rail and it makes no sense to have rail in in what is a suburban urban sprawl it would be completely useless and probably offer no benefit whatsoever but is but but it's upset it's an obsessive it's an obsessive um inclination of the left but i'm not sure why there is an old joke that 40 years of transportation economics at harvard can be boiled down to four words bus good train bad and the the thing is in a if you wanted to help the poor of houston right and ensure more mobility which is something i believe very much we should be doing we should be focusing on this incredibly inexpensive technology called the bus which does not commit you to particular areas which you can be you can flexibly lease the things you can adapt to new technologies right you can put in electric buses you can put in autonomous buses and if you really want them to go fast you can build lanes for the buses to go on all by themselves right at a fraction of the cost of putting in rail so it's very hard to get rail to work in all but the very densest parts of of america so um i i know there is a fascination with rail but i have long been on the record confirming that it was exactly the right technology for the 19th century but it's very unclear that it's the right technology for the 21st century yeah it seems that way i mean again you can it is nice to be on a train i guess if there's there's something nice about it uh but it just kind of depends on where you're at i i think um it's just always fascinating to me how that how that uh plays out um it'll be smoother but we can make buses nicer too yeah right buses don't need to be as crappy as they often are that's true um and now the next question uh escaped me for a second what was it it was uh oh okay here's another very simple and blunt question if i'm a politician which i am and uh in my campaign promises i want to say i'm going to end traffic i mean i can't imagine a more popular campaign slogan if we're being perfectly honest what do people hate the most hate being in traffic and um it's kind of amazing that's never really been a campaign slogan not even for like city mayors uh running but if you were to actually say that with a straight face uh what would your first ideas be from a policy perspective to improve traffic flow in in our major cities because it's becoming maybe it's not a problem in detroit but most other cities were especially in texas and we're seeing growth you can't i don't see any space to make the highways wider um i you know i suppose we could build above maybe below that's unbelievably expensive you know look at the big dig for instance what would be your ideas and i would remember if you build more right you will get more drivers i mean there's something called the fundamental law of highway traffic which has been identified by the economist shielded anton matthew turner that seems to show that you know highway miles traveled increase roughly one for one with highway miles built so if you build it they will drive it and you're not even going to fix traffic congestion in the long run the problem is there is this magic bullet for fighting traffic the problem is it will lose you every vote you gained by saying that you were going to fix traffic which is congestion pricing right which is actually charging people for the congestion that they create um you can have at this point in time you can have time varying congestion pricing you put it on during peak hours you take it off you know it's absolutely crucial when it comes to autonomous vehicles right if we introduce autonomous vehicles and make them the norm without also having congestion pricing on them you have just radically decreased the cost of sitting in traffic so guess what more people will sit in traffic and our congestion problems will get even worse thanks to autonomous vehicles we really need to at least with the autonomous vehicles introduce the principle that you know you're going to pay for the congestion that you create london's had this for you know 15 years now singapore has had this for over 40 45 years and you know singapore moves pretty swiftly because they actually charge people for the social costs of their of their driving um now i know that it's political poison uh congressman and i'm not actually uh i'm saying this so you don't have to but it is in fact the right economic answer is to actually charge people during peak hours for driving and you know push people towards smoothing their driving in different ways push them towards carpooling more push them towards other other solutions you need to have public transit options if you're going to do that um but that doesn't need to be real it could be just be you know relatively common and flexible bus service would you have how would you do that realistically would you have to actually install some kind of meter on everybody's car how would you do that um going forward with the autonomous vehicles i think that's a no-brainer yes you have the transponders in the car the cars are directly linked um it's hard to do without uh without some form to really efficiently without an electronic transponder the low-tech way to do it remember singapore was a poor place when they did it in 1975 is you just pay a flat fee to drive on the highways during weekdays so but you pay a flat fee you then i guess have to have to just put that in online or in the old days you just bought a certificate which you put in your car uh and if you are driving on those those highways without paying the flat fee they charge you a big fine so um that's the lower tech way of doing so there are lots of ways of implementing it but i think the right way going forward is something some sort of a gps transponder based system i thought you were gonna say flying cars um but you know i guess uh i'm working on that okay the more i think about this it's not that unserious of a conversation um there's some very interesting technologies that are that are up and coming and uh you know we were promised as 90s kids growing up in the 90s that by the year 2000 you know the millennium would have would be around the corner and we would have flying cars and just never materialized and there's a lot of 90s kids with their troll dolls that are very upset about this so so there was a lot of uber energy on this at one point in time i don't know if it's still going on but there's a lot of uber energy around sort of vertical technology for doing this i would guess it's going to be a fairly elite thing before it ever becomes a mass market solution but as as many things are i mean televisions were an elite thing for a while and that's what got them down to the right price point where everybody else could afford them um absolutely so let's talk about uh just economic analysis of infrastructure for for a little bit uh again the proponents of a massive infrastructure bill will say well it'll pay for itself five times over because of you know it's just the it's the multiplier effect and all that and it's just you know my answer to that is it's probably yours too well it depends and so so so where where does that analysis get tricky what's the proper way to to look at um the multiplier benefits of a dollar spent on infrastructure so just to be clear an extra dollar of gdp is not an extra dollar of benefit right because it actually means that you know people are exerting effort to get that extra extra dollar of gdp people are exerting you know inputs to get that so you need to be really careful about things that are straight benefits and things that are gdp that might yield benefits right i mean if you have underutilized resources and they're going into then the extra you know the extra output gets counted some sometimes but you need to be really careful about that um so uh we have not yet i can say this has been a very frustrating thing i certainly felt this during the 2007 2008 period is there never has been a good integration of macro benefits into micro cost benefit analysis right we've no one's ever really reached consensus on how to do this and it is it is certainly important um i think there is a wide division among macroeconomists and to how big this is so uh jim paterba and i did an an edited volume this was supported by the smith richardson uh foundation on american infrastructure investment and uh it's a national bureau of economic research volume and you know we have an excellent paper by valerie raymie who is deeply skeptical about the spillover benefits of infrastructure and then there are other people who are much more enthusiastic about it who actually believe it so but part of the problem is that you know there are things that are micro things things that are done like give you a simple example like rent control rent control has been done in hundreds of different cities at various points in time and i can tell you that it you know screws up property markets over and over again right because it's a micro thing right these macro things are you know very much based on particular points in time and it just becomes very hard to be very confident about any of these effects so i would be very wary before you turn to those macro spillovers as being your primary justification of infrastructure the primary justification of infrastructure should always be that you you're delivering enough benefit for the actual users of that infrastructure and you know if you're if you're way short on that then you know think a long time before going ahead with that infrastructure it's okay well this brings us into another subject but related you've advocated for a microeconomic approach identifying projects so how does what is that exactly and how does that improve decision making so again i think it's it's about you know you could do this either with um you know the current state level uh choice which is fine but you just have some degree of requirement of of showing a relatively high cost benefit analysis uh number for this or you could do it with a national infrastructure bank in principle which could seek out high cost benefit uh high net benefit projects so you do this by considering some set of projects which get proposed you then have some independent agency engage in some form of cost benefit analysis and you figure out which one of these things are yielding the highest benefits per dollar spent right that's the that's the most standard way to do this this is the micro approach if you are very confident that one project is going to yield more macro benefits than another uh then that's fine but most of the time you wouldn't have any reason to be very confident about that and so you should go for the projects that yield the largest micro benefits which okay that makes sense um another example which is interesting is japan um had a massive infrastructure building initiative between 1991 and 2008 yet they had anemic growth and their debt to gdp ratios over 230 percent what did they do wrong though i mean did they just assume that every project would would pay off did they fail to incorporate a really disciplined micro approach to evaluating projects or what can we learn from that i think it just shows that infrastructure is not enough to you know correct all tailwinds in terms of the the economy and it's also important to remember that the benefits of infrastructure are a lot higher when you start from a low level of infrastructure develop than than when you start from a high level of infrastructure development so the erie canal was really really valuable because look in 1816 it cost as much to ship goods 30 miles over land as it did to ship them across the entire atlantic ocean and there were americans sitting on the edge of this incredible continent right with their arms outstretched trying to get to it they couldn't do it and so the erie can now radically reduce the cost of shipping goods across space so did the trains that followed right so did the early early highways um these were radical changes by the mid early 1990s in japan japan was pretty well built out i mean they had bullet trains by that they had pretty fast means of going around so added infrastructure was a really incremental change and when you try to choose projects in the us as well you need to ask yourself is this going to be a revolutionary thing or is this a fairly incremental thing given the existing uh ability to get around so there's i mean there's a marginal there's a decreasing marginal benefit to infrastructure building right you get because you do hear that argument sometimes look we did this massive infrastructure federal highway system before you know that was when we were all in this together we were all doing it and why can't we go back to that it was so great it was just this sort of national good sense um but but as you say it's well that's not necessarily the case now um they think times times have changed i would guess the largest benefits are going to be once where we actually are paying attention to new technologies i mean for the first time it really seems as if transportation technologies are moving again i mean it's sort of amazing in my life that like the stuff today is really not that different than the stuff was 50 years ago when i was a kid i mean the cars aren't that much faster they're safer certainly they're not that much faster the planes are kind of not that different the trains aren't that much faster um but now with autonomous electric you know there's there's a bunch of things which could really change things and so like if i were thinking about where infrastructure could really be revolutionary i would be thinking about things like dedicated highways for autonomous vehicles let's say running from dallas to houston where it's all autonomous and those things can go 150 miles an hour because you're not having anything else on them so you know part of the problem with autonomous is if you have autonomous and non-autonomous together all sorts of you know problems go go on but if it's just a lane that's pure autonomous and you build it so basically the road can talk to the cars and keep them especially far apart you know you have a lot of possibility for doing something really great but it needs to be you know you need to use the new technology you need to not just just think that you know we're going to go back to old stuff that we're doing we need to think about how to be smart about how to leverage those new technologies to increase mobility are you familiar with the uh the uh texas central project from dallas to houston it's a it's a potential rail project basically a bullet train um back and forth between houston and dallas so i know a little bit about it so i remember that as skeptical as i often am about rail my recollection for this project was overwhelmingly private money is that is that correct was that or is that changed yeah that's correct that that's correct i feel much better whether or not it's a good idea or not i i think investors should be free to lose their own money if they want to lose their own money that's that's the uh and they may they may well not lose their own money that's fair do you think um the other critic the critique of infrastructure bill is that it might cause um even more inflation than we have now do you think that the cur as it's currently written do you think that's the case uh look i don't opine on again inflation is a macro topic but i would say that you know debt is not free okay trillions and trillions of dollars of national debt is not free and will lead to you know either expectations about higher taxes or expectations about printing money in the future which will mean higher inflation this is not a so i wouldn't see inflation as being a separate worry in my case but i just you know i'm old-fashioned i just think that you know it's it's not it's not free to spend more more money and we've been spending an awful lot of it lately as you pointed out at the beginning of the talk yeah we we certainly have um the other thing about it is i think some people voted for this bill um thinking it's politically popular because generally if you just ask an american in a survey question um do you think we should have more infrastructure yeah he was going to say no um so it's it's you know you gotta take these questions with a grain of salt but um and so they can oh say so it's politically popular but you know i'm actually not so sure about that because i think your average american is like less and less concerned with the massive amount of debt we have unfortunately we need to be more concerned with that but the reality is is that people just aren't um especially when you start talking about what would be required to reduce that debt um and what would it take away from them which they they feel they have earned or that they have a right to um it's kind of a separate problem but the point is is that when you add that much more money to the debt and um and they don't see these golden towers popping up all around them you know they're going to be pissed off uh and i promise you you won't see any golden towers popping up around you i mean you know infrastructure is very long-term investment and it's often in in things you you probably can't even see uh that might have some benefit for you that might not and again it just gets back to how careful we have to be about how we analyze it but that's more of a comment than a question mr free to react to it no i think i think you know we should address every dollar that we spend you know with the seriousness as if it came out of our own pocket and anything less than that is just not what not what taxpayers deserve do you think there's such a thing called human infrastructure which which is the other three point five trillion dollars that's that we're talking about so sweet um i i found that a bit frustrating because i don't think that something's good because you call it infrastructure or you know bad because it's not infrastructure there's certain things like investing in vocational training programs for you know especially experimental ones for low-income kids that i think are great things for federal money to be doing even though i wouldn't call them infrastructure at all and uh you know that human infrastructure included an awful lot in home healthcare workers that is not a topic that i study but i could well believe that investing in home healthcare works was a good thing to do but it certainly is not what's traditionally meant as infrastructure which is a a word that really came into england from uh french it's supposed to be you know infrastructure from the latin the stuff that goes below the structures so it was used traditionally to talk about the rail network that was the traditional origins of this thing so i don't think it does much good to change the definition of infrastructure in some way to include a larger definition but that doesn't mean that we don't want to necessarily think about you know there are lots of cases in which i think spending on things other than structures is the right thing to do especially you know um especially things around around education and um education of course the other big thing which i would love to see even more energy on is you know you would have thought that what we've learned over the past two years is that this country in the global economy is extraordinarily vulnerable to pandemic i would have thought that you know that would have been a pretty top priority for whatever we are going forward on this so whatever whatever you think is the right infrastructure to protect us against pandemic uh that would seem like a reasonable thing whether or not you call it infrastructure or not yeah that's a probably a much longer conversation uh for sure one of the other arguments on infrastructure is um it's going to create a bunch of jobs uh what do you think of that argument especially right now since i believe we have like 10 million job openings at the moment many of which are high paying jobs and uh you know it was something i hear from business owners all the time it doesn't seem to matter what price point they they raise wages to and it's well above 15 an hour just to be clear well above that they're still having trouble getting people um maybe maybe they don't make quite that much by staying at home but you get to stay at home right and so that's factored into their their analysis uh that that probably should end in september uh it doesn't i don't think democrats have the votes to keep that going to keep these unemployment benefits going which are largely keeping people out of the workforce but uh do you have any comments on that that just the entire situation on our labor market and what we can expect to see over the next six months it's it's hard to know but um but the um you're the general point that you know jobs are only the only jobs you want to count right are people that you've genuinely taken off of federal benefits and moved into being taxpayers right because that that does generate a genuine social benefit which is these people have stopped requiring some form of federal subsidy and now they're earning a living and now we're paying it in um those numbers are hard to understand even during the you know hyper recession so the work of andy garan now at the university of illinois urbana-champaign found that you know it took more than a hundred thousand dollars per job uh during the great recession so it takes more than a hundred thousand dollars to generate a sort of new form of new new person working in the area and those jobs are very localized towards construction they also remember many infrastructure jobs i mean infrastructure isn't you know the 1930s anymore where you've got a bunch of guys sitting with picks and axes by the shovels by the side of the road this is a pretty high-tech industry right you don't build a tunnel with sort of low-tech workers and so those those engineers tend to be pretty well employed so the idea that you're pulling millions off of the off of the welfare roles that's that's pretty hard to to fathom so i tend to think especially now but even more generally infrastructure is really best thought of as a you know a policy to create mobility or other benefits for the actual users not as something that you're creating a benefit for the people working there right and in general right we shouldn't think about work as being a beneficiary the reason why we have federal you know jobs is not as a benefit for the people who are working on them right it's the benefit for ordinary citizens right that's the whole bloody point of having a federal government or a local government is you're of service to the larger economy not that you're giving out you know this great perk of having a federal job so and i every time i talk to somebody who's in the construction business their their main issue is they have trouble finding workers so there isn't all these workers sitting on the sidelines just wishing that they'd be hired by some construction company it's just not true yeah so you know choose the projects based on what they're delivering in terms of value to the users not on not on the alleged employment benefits well uh ed we've debunked some myths we've gotten some clarification on infrastructure and it's uh greatly appreciated the the listeners have loved it and they're probably gonna they're probably gonna tell all their friends about this podcast and give me five stars and what that does for me i'm not sure because i can't monetize something so this doesn't really matter but it makes me feel good and you know there's some uh i guess in economic terms there's some uh social value to feeling good so we really appreciate your expertise on this and uh thanks for coming back on thank you representative and thank you uh thank you for your service to our country appreciate it

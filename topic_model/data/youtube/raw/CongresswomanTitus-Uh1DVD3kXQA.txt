. AND I YIELD BACK.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: FOR   WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE  GENTLELADY FROM NEVADA SEEK  RECOGNITION? >> I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO  ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR ONE  MINUTE.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE   GENTLELADY FROM NEVADA IS  RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. MS. TITUS: THANK YOU.  WE MARK THE SIXTH ANNIVERSARY  OF THE TRAGIC SHOOTING OF SANDY  HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH   LEFT 26 DEAD INCLUDING 20  CHILDREN AGES 6 AND 7. IN THE YEARS SINCE THERE HAVE  BEEN 1,917 MASS SHOOTINGS,   KILLING 2,175 MEN, WOMEN, AND  CHILDREN, AND ROUNDING MORE  THAN 6,000.  THE WORST OF THESE SHOOTINGS   OCCURRED IN THE HEART OF MY  DISTRICT AT THE ROUTE 91 MUSIC   FESTIVAL.  WHEN A GUNMAN OPENED FIRE ON   THE CROWD KILLING 58 AND   INJURING MORE THAN 800.  7 THE LIST OF VICTIMS -- THE   LIST OF VICTIMS GROWS EVERY  DAY, AND YET ON THIS FLOOR   THERE IS ONLY SILENCE. THIS PAST NOVEMBER VOTERS SENT   A STRONG MESSAGE BY REJECTING  THOSE WHO STAB IN THE -- STAND   IN THE WAY OF COMMONSENSE GUN  VIOLENCE PREVENTION. WE CAN NEVER BRING BACK THOSE  WHO ARE LOST TO GUN VIOLENCE,  BUT FROM UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND  CHECKS TO A BAN ON BUMP STOCKS   COME JANUARY, WE CAN AND WILL  TAKE ACTION. I YIELD BACK

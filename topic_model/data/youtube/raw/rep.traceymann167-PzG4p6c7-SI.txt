madam speaker i rise today to voice my opposition for h.r 3755 which would federally legalize abortions on demand up until birth this bill isn't just morally reprehensible it also prohibits states from passing their own laws acknowledging the humanity of unborn children it is a wicked path to accomplish a wicked end this bill would override both federal and state laws and adopted before and even after its enactment this year 48 states have introduced a combined 289 pro-life bills 89 of which have been signed into law h.r 3755 does not reflect the voice of the american people on the issue of abortion it reflects the voice of the abortion lobby this bill abolishes any law that regulates abortion in any way including laws that prevent sexual election abortion and abortions based on down syndrome diagnosis by 12 weeks of age babies have fully formed arms hands fingers feet and toes and a functional circulatory system and liver and the capacity to experience pain all of this astonishingly at a weight of one ounce and a length of four inches i believe that life begins at conception i support adoptions foster care and crisis prejudice centers god knits every one of us together in our mother's wombs life is a miracle and i believe that the right to it extends to the unborn in this country that's why i strongly oppose this horrible bill

investigating january 6 congressman adam kinzinger congressman thank you for being back on the program always good to have you here and you wrote an op-ed that the country has to do better and doing better starts with calling out the lies so given what we heard from president biden just a little while ago some of his strongest most forceful and direct uh attacks against former president trump about his responsibility for january 6. uh was that a step in the right direction i think so i mean it's it's it's time it's time to you know i understand the idea of kind of letting bygones be bygones when it comes to presidents and they have and i think that's frankly a good tradition uh but in this case when you have people continuing to deny the truth about january 6 and not just a handful of people it's a significant part of america denying that i think it was important for him to forcefully come out you know i've had to come unfortunately to the reality that the audience of these kinds of messages is not necessarily whatever 25 percent of america that will never believe any different depending on regardless of what facts you put in front of them but it's the 70 percent of americans that can vote and put a bull work out there and prevent anything further from eroding and i think that's what we have to look at in terms of that congressman your committee surely has conducted so many interviews read a tremendous amount of testimony listen to it as well with what you've been able to gather so far what concerns you the most about the actions and inactions of then president donald trump well let's let's look at what we know we know that for 180 minutes he basically sat down and watched television you know i don't know if he was entertained by it if he was frozen in indecision i don't know i have my suspect i suspect he was somewhat entertained by it given what he said to kevin mccarthy that day about they must care more about the election than you do but the real linchpin of a question and this is why a lot of these inquiries we're doing is so important people will give pieces of this puzzle what did the president know prior to january 6th did january 6 catch him by surprise i'll be honest it didn't catch me by surprise i predicted violence on january 1st did it catch him by surprise and if not why what did he know i think those are going to be the key and the key questions now keep in mind let's say magically he didn't know anything which i don't necessarily believe the fact is his oath says he has to defend the constitution and defend the country he certainly failed to do that as he's watching article one the article one branch of government be attacked by his supporters uh there's a lot we need to know but we're getting a lot of information as well and as far as what you need to know you said you wouldn't have been surprised and he shouldn't have been surprised by it but there's another level or layer to that about whether or not he conspired in some way if he was actively before january 6 engaged in any way in the planning of it how far are you from getting that answer well look we're certainly digging we're certainly doing interviews i can't go into too much of what we know i don't want to get ahead of the committee on that certainly there is more to know and that's why it's not just the interviews with people like mark meadows and steve bannon that matter a lot of that is you know what's out there kind of in the circus of of what's going on but it's the 300 people we've talked to already more than 300 people that give us those pieces so i think if there is any information to uncover we will uncover it uh but we have these court challenges we're focusing on we have these interviews and the american people regardless again of whether we present this committee report when we do and it convinces you know every american or not the history books deserve to have a full accounting you know my kids deserve to have a full accounting that's what's important too congressman what would a smoking gun look like in terms of criminal activity by president donald trump well i think you know that's a subjective question and so i don't exactly know i think it's one of those you'll know when you see but i think it's pretty clear that if the president had an idea of what was going to happen if he knew there was going to be violence to me that's certainly a smoking gun but let me just say we've already had plenty of smoking guns that the president of the united states the former president knew the election was free and fair uh you know buying into conspiracy theories peddling conspiracy theories telling people look you can be on the far left and far right but you have to have a basic compact and self-governance which is my vote will count even if you lose every vote or whatever that's the basic compact the former president violated that and that's what matters all right congressman kenzinger we uh have more questions we're going to stop there because you understand your wife might be in labor as we speak we know you're expecting a a little one any not even any day but any moment now so good luck congratulations give her our best and we'll see you down the road congressman will do god bless thanks

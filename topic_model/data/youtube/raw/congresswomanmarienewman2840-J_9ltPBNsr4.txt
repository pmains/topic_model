about so-called food deserts apparently there are some banking deserts and you're pushing a plan that would allow people who perhaps don't have easy access to the bank to do so at their local post office personally i think it's a great idea and yet you're getting a big pushback from the banking lobby why do they care whether or not people can bank at a post office so this is fascinating uh from from about 1905 to the early 1970s there was a postal bank and it worked incredibly well at that point um people were banked to the point of in the low 90s 92 i think it was and now we have one third of our nation is either underbanked or unbanked one-third so it has dropped off dramatically because this wonderful service a public bank inside of our local post office so there's a post office in every single zip code they are already ready made to have services such as checking and savings and loans so

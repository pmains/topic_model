Thank You mr. speaker March 25th through March 31st is national physicians week as a practicing physician for nearly nearly 30 years I'd like to use my time today to acknowledge the dedicated doctors nationwide that devote their lives to providing quality care for our patients I'm so thankful for the doctors that have led the charge to observe a week dedicated to our nation's physicians and especially thanks to dr. Kimberly Jackson dr. Jackson is a proof true pioneer for the medical profession in June of 2015 she founded the physicians working together organization this group was created to bring physicians together from a broad spectrum of specialties dr. Jackson then just one year later established the last week of March as national positions week this year celebration will include a physician led virtual conference hosted by the fishin's working together group the conference is available for free and will provide physicians with fabulous to improve their everyday practice the virtual sessions will also highlight ways that physicians can take action and policy through advocacy groups and navigate the world of politics I encourage my friends in the medical industry to tune in as an obstetrician and gynecologist I've had the privilege of building relationships with patients that I always hold clear to my heart to hold dear to my heart there's nothing quite like watching a family grow before your eyes and having a hand and they're healthy growing although government regulations piled on over the years have continued to make it difficult to build and nurture these relationships my patients have become no less important nor less of a priority to me I know this to be the case for many other doctors throughout the nation during my time practicing medicine and grape in Kansas I had the opportunity to work alongside many fellow physicians who practice with a level of care that I want from my own family physicians are more than deserving of a week of appreciation so please take a few moments to show your support for your local physicians for more information we'd ask you to check out the conference to check out the National physicians week Facebook page or look at our own social media pages for more ways to spread the word I yield back

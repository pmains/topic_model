thank you and thank you for for being here today and I do wish that FEMA had been here I think they would have been a integral part of this discussion I echo a lot of the concerns from my colleagues that I've heard today and appreciate your candid comments as well about the challenges we still have moving forward but the good things that are happening with the alerts one of the things I do have concerns about sometimes particularly in a state Nevada where we have a very diverse and growing population our language barriers I know miss folks and mr. Bergmann you talked a little bit about this and the actions that were taken in 2016 to enable spanish-language alerts can you talk a little bit more about that and describe how that works to ensure understandable alerts are sent to everyone and then just not just Spanish language alone in Nevada in particular in Southern Nevada we have a large Filipino population to Golic is an important language obviously and that's a barrier for those who do not speak Spanish so can you talk a little bit about language barriers and how you address those and where the gaps are and what we should be doing to also keep that in mind and when we're talking about reaching out to everyone in our communities when there is a crisis or a concern of national to a natural disaster well as you as you noted the Commission back in 2016 adopted rules to facilitate Spanish language we alerts we do currently have the broader issue that is pending before us that we're still considering regarding other length other languages and and to what extent we alerts we should be looking at we alerts in other types of languages not there yet though not I'm not there it's dopant it's pending mm-hmm and then mr. Bergmann if you don't mind talking a little bit about how you particularly with Spanish how you overcome that barrier with the technology sir senator I think we certainly agree with you and think that's an important improvement it's one that we're working diligently to to implement and then just would flag again the addition of URLs plays an important role as well to write because we think often of we as a bellringer all right the idea is that you're letting folks know there's an issue and then giving them the opportunity to go and get additional information so together those two tools we think will be very valuable for consumers particularly for those who speak languages other than English as well - thank you and besides language barriers and I I echo my colleagues again there's Geographic barriers rural communities particularly in Nevada and across the country that are still struggling to have broadband access and access to be able to use some of the technology that's out there that's providing this information I know this is an area where we've talked and will continue to support to bring resources and funding to our rural communities to connect them but to me this is just a crisis as well that they are not connected right now and it's a focus for many of us let me ask you this cybersecurity is there any concern about hackers hacking into an alert system and any manner whatsoever have we seen any of that or is this something that you're thinking about or making sure you're addressing in the infrastructure the FCC has addressed the issue of cybersecurity particularly with respect to the EAS through its Advisory Committee you may or may not recall that back in 2013 a hacker gained access to EAS equipment at various broadcast stations across the country we conducted an investigation we asked our advisory and we asked our Advisory Committee to come up with best practices that EAS participants could use to make their equipment more more secure in addition to which the FCC through its advisory committees has developed best practices for really all the communications sectors to address security risk management specifically how to implement the NIST framework best practices are there but there's no guarantee that they're going to be adopted we have various we have taken steps to it was strongly encourage communication of service providers to implement those best practices we also work with industry organizations and some of the organ of the organist reorganizations for example nab has done a lot to encourage its members to implement those best practices right but we're still at the stage of encouragement not necessarily mandated that these yeah seen implemented right thank you thank you I appreciate the conversation today

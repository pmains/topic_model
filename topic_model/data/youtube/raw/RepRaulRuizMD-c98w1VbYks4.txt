over the past year i've spoken in this committee many times about the environmental injustices taking place in my district at the oasis mobile home park and other areas in some of our underserved communities and i'll continue to advocate for them until i know my constituents can safely turn on their faucets without being exposed to toxins since august 2019 oasis mobile park has been under an epa emergency order under section 1431 of the safe drinking water act due to arsenic contamination nine times the legal limit in the weeks following the revelation that they were drinking arsenic laden water the residents of oasis faced a nightmare scenario due to predatory park ownership who one failed to quickly provide replacement drinking water to then put residents restrictions on who could access that water then raised rent by over 30 percent and then threatened evictions and while the epa region 9 staff have been diligent and attentive to the situation it was during this crisis that we saw the limits of epa's enforcement abilities the safe drinking water act threatens fines of fifteen thousand dollars per day for violations of an emergency order but the process takes time and it's cumbersome when residents require replacing drinking water now they can't wait weeks or longer for a legal process to play out in the courts so dr mclean under section 1431 what are epa's current enforcement abilities if a water system owner or operator fails to provide replacement drinking water pursuant to an epa order thank you thank you for that question we um we work closely with our partners in our office of enforcement and compliance as well as in as in the regional offices as in region nine in this case and um we do see that we have a number of tools available to us in in the in the statute and we work hard to to implement the statute as it as it is written and i think that the thing that it that we are very appreciative of um your attention to this issue and this um this you know the these folks were drink had had contaminated water and we want to make sure that we we addressed that so how long how long does that process take you say you have different tools there's been no true enforcement no fines and it's over almost two years that they're struggling with this for how how long does that process take from initial reports of non-compliance and violations to the day fine is levied well i can't speak directly for the enforcement program because it's outside it's outside of my office i would be happy to take that question back and and talk to my colleagues thank you so my bill the emergency oasis act would give epa the authority to step in and provide drinking water in cases where an owner of a system fails to do so within a week of an order going into effect epa would then recoup the cost of the water plus a penalty from the system owner who would be prohibited from passing those costs on to the residents dr mclean under the provision that i just described with residents who are not provided alternative drinking water by a system owner likely get access to safe drinking water faster than under the current process thank you for the question i'm not prepared to talk at that at that level of detail on the provisions well i think if an owner if an owner doesn't provide water for 14 days and the epa is able to provide water in seven days then and i think the match just speaks for itself that they i think they would be able to get water faster if they were able to get it sooner by the epa uh and then also the the second piece of the emergency oasis act focuses on making sure the entire drinking water system is safe before it is put back into service at the oasis mobile home park the initial epa emergency order was focused on the well filtration system yet it took a community group an outside group to test the distribution system where they found that arsenic remained in the water pipes as well despite the epa order saying it was okay to drink that water section 1431 of the safe drinking water eye gives the epa broad authority to implement remedies to fix an unsafe system dr mclean a situation like oasis or other other places where the contamination point is a well does epa have the ability to ensure that a contaminant hasn't built up in the distribution system thank you thank you for the question and i'd be happy to talk to my colleagues who are implementing the enforcement provisions of our statute we do have many tools available to us okay well i'm looking forward to working with you the epa your colleagues in the enforcement tools and those that know how to clear a system from contaminants because this is a problem identified in my district that is systemic uh and could be eliminated with this provision in my bill so i appreciate it and i yield back my time

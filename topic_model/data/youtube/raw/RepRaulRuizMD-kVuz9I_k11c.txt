a local veteran remembered today at the White House with the signing of the honoring our pact act by President Biden our John White was there at the signing continuing on his reporting on toxic burn pits he first brought you in 2017. we came to Washington D.C for this story because of local veteran Jennifer Kepner she shared with me her story five years ago around that same time she was sharing her story with local Congressman Dr rol Ruiz and others and may God protect our troops now I'm going to walk over and sign that legislation President Biden signing the honoring our pact act a long battle waged by local Congressman Dr role Ruiz in honor of Jennifer Kepner and many others culminating in a major expansion of veterans benefits I was there for the signing in the East room and then talked with the congressman on the North Lawn of the White House Jennifer Kepner was The Ultimate Fighter who who until her last breath was fighting for other veterans and she became a very strong source of inspiration for me and it's in her honor and her family's honor that that we got this done the congressman also celebrating with comedian and activist Jon Stewart in this video at the bill signing this guy would come out to the press conferences and spitfire spit facts crush it Jon Stewart with the Game Changer in this In This Moment In The Name of Jennifer Kepner and the Kepner family and all those better than we fought for Stewart heavily involved in fighting for veterans getting wide praise from the the president and we owe you big man we owe you and from veterans groups you often see some kind of superstars show up here to grab attention and testify they really don't know what they're talking about this is a guy that um it goes much deeper than even this issue but the day really belonged to those who fought for their country captain Leroy Torres has battled for 13 years struggling with his health losing his job fighting for benefits When I first had my lung biopsy in 2010 that he discovered that I had a lung injury the constructive bronchitis fibrosis that in itself just just the hearing that uh you know it was irreversible and it's permanent then to facing job loss so not only it was such a compound loss not only with my health but then losing my job because of what related illness he was with President Biden for the signing I presented him one of our coins for burn pitch 360. my sister in honor of Beau and the many affected that are no longer here to present you this coin it just that was your point yeah he swapped I completely reminded him that there was so then he yeah they presented me his coins so well his wife Rosie Torres started the organization burn pits 360 to fight for veterans who believed they were getting sick because of those burn bits veterans like Jennifer Kepner who left her this voicemail definitely interested in in what you have to say and trying to figure out what my next step is so she really you know um planted her flag on that platform and said you know until my last breath I'm gonna fight and that's exactly what she did it was her dying wish and while she knew she was dying she asked me to help other veterans not to go through what she went through and that is very selfless and that is a hero in my book Congressman Ruiz invited Jennifer kepner's husband Ben Kepner to be at the White House signing ceremony today unfortunately he was not able to make it but she was remembered here today for helping to start this discussion reporting at the Capitol John White NewsChannel 3. well students in Palm Springs

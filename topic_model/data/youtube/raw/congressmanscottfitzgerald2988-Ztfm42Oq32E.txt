uh mr olsen in your opening statement it kind of surprised me that you called the january 6 investigation largest in the history of the national security division um i'm just surprised that you kind of led with that in your opening statement would you again state for the record what you're investigating as a division and the scope of the investigation uh sir with respect to january 6th in particular right yes um i mean the reason i said that that investigation stands apart is the largest domestic terrorism investigation in u.s history the fbi has characterized that investigation and opened it as a domestic terrorism investigation it is as the attorney general has said the most wide-ranging investigation in u.s history the numbers speak for themselves over 850 people have been arrested many if not most of those for felonies it includes serious charges very serious charges involving assaults on police officers obstruction of congress seditious conspiracy uh so the ev it has touched on every state in terms of the fbi field offices and every state in terms of the u.s attorney's offices around the country that are involved so by several measures um in scale um and significance the significance being that it involved an effort to prevent the peaceful transfer of power which is one of the pillars of our democracy by all of those measures i feel justified in describing it as a as a as an investigation that stands a part in our history so you yourself said the division investigates quote threats of violence what threats was the division division aware of on the days that led up to january 6. so i i think there's you know i i don't know exactly how to respond to the question of what threats that the nascar division was aware of because i wasn't at the nascar division at the time um i came in the office later i do think that there was information aware of what the investigation includes at this point i'm sure right absolutely uh again we're working on that did you partnership with the dc would you say that doj and the fbi failed to anticipate the threats of january 6 or failed to prepare for the threats i think the the level of violence um speaks for itself um you know i think we always want to learn to do better when it comes to anticipating uh something that i think we didn't necessarily anticipate in terms of the level of violence that occurred and and in the run-up to january 6 so we always need to continue to learn from that yeah do better might be soft selling it here has there been any coordination between the doj and the house of representatives january 6 committee i'm aware of our requests from the department of justice for access to transcripts from the select committee but um other than that the answer is no there these are two separate investigations one by congress and and another by a co-equal branch of government that's the executive branch and both of us have a job to do it they're different um and we'll continue to do that there are news reports stating that doj is considering more charges related to january 6th but rather than violent acts these charges are based on speech or verbal communications rather than any of the violence or the threats that uh were experienced on that day is this accurate is this actually happening as we sit here today so the department of justice does not conduct its investigations in public and that's for a couple reasons one is to protect those who may be within the scope of the investigation in other words those who may ultimately be accused as well as to protect the integrity of the investigation so i'm not going to talk about um the trajectory or the direction of of uh the ongoing investigation into the events of january 6 and the days leading up to it well you made some comments earlier based on questions asked by mr jeffries and mr raskin that that were you know inside what you're actually investigating that's why i just asked it let me just move on is what speaker pelosi knew regarding potential threats and her preparations or lack thereof something that is off the table or is that something that could be investigated as well by doj so again i'm not going to discuss anything about that ongoing investigation what i can tell you is it's our obligation at the justice department to uphold the rule of law the rule of law is what distinguishes us from dictatorships and autocracies and a central tenet of the rule of law is that no one no matter their status is above the law and we will continue to pursue the facts and the evidence and apply the law in the course of our investigation of the january 6 attack in my final 30 seconds i'd just like to go back to my colleague from rhode island pointing out that president biden's doj has endorsed the american online innovation and choice act even after the revisions several national security officials have raised concerns that the bill could limit u.s tech companies ability to fight cyber threats and other national security risks are you aware if the department of defense or any intelligence agencies outside of doj were consulted prior to acting assistant attorney general juan sending the letters of support on the american online innovation and choice act it would be normal order for legislation to go through a process that involved a number of different departments and agencies i know that we were consulted and i know that ultimately the department of justice came out in favor of that legislation and that now security risks we felt in the nascar division were addressed by the legislation and the particular changes that were adopted

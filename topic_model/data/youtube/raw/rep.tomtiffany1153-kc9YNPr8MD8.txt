uh thank you representative johnson and uh thank you madam speaker um two weeks ago we were here and we heard about how president biden was going to use every tool at his disposal every tool to combat skyrocketing energy costs now this is the same administration that told us the border was secure that was about a year ago a little less than a year ago this border was secure and we just saw in the last month once again record numbers coming across the southern border of people coming in illegally to our country and of course as the gentleman from louisiana just said inflation was transitory and we're starting to hear that his chief economic adviser is saying maybe it's not so transitory and we're seeing record numbers now this month in regards to inflation well it all started january 20th 2021 with the shutdown of the keystone pipeline and all the other actions that were taken to limit production here in america we saw it but it's turning out to be a foreign policy disaster the okay of the nordstream pipeline that's delivering natural gas to western europe something the previous administration would never do and this is all part of the green fantasy here in america that has become america's nightmare back at home in my district 2.85 cents a gallon to heat your home with propane right now propane is used by about a third of the homeowners in the district that i live in they paid a dollar fifty august of twenty twenty one they paid eighty cents a gallon in august of twenty twenty that's what they're facing and president biden came to my district right after uh right after the state of the uh state of the union speech came to superior wisconsin and once again we were anxious to hear how he's going to use every tool every tool possible to provide energy for america but we didn't hear a thing about rerouting the pipeline through northern wisconsin that's held up because a permit is not issued by the governor of wisconsin and his department of natural resources we didn't hear a single thing about line five that goes through the straits of mackinac that the governor of michigan shut down that permit last year a major throughput to canada and to the entire midwest we didn't hear a word about rebuilding the refinery in superior which we hope is complete soon and he was there on an infrastructure tour that refinery produces all kinds of asphalt don't you think that would be a really good time infrastructure asphalt to talk about rebuilding that refinery and finally he didn't say a thing about a natural gas plant that is proposed for superior wisconsin nearly a billion dollar investment to produce clean electricity with natural gas and we didn't hear a word about producing more fertilizer for those farmers to grow our crops we didn't hear a word about that this president does not understand security job security thousands of jobs two of the major pipeline manufacturers in the united states are right in uh wisconsin we didn't hear a thing about economic security the inflation that is in part as a result of these increased energy costs and we didn't hear a thing about national security and that's what's at stake the biden administration has let us down on all three fronts job security economic security and national security i yield back

welcome back to this wednesday evening edition of the KSP NT News say to my congressman Greg hello Lisa blonde says Commonwealth kids are not getting a fair shake when it comes to federal school meal support our channel to Washington correspondent Nick Cave reports Sablan asked USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack for a study there are so many children in the enemy who qualify for federally subsidized school lunches and breakfasts at congressman Sablan told us da secretary tom vilsack at an education in the workforce hearing the northerners public school system which is above block grant to support each child nutrition program is served over 14,000 Mills it's taped over 11,000 school children but sablan told Secretary Vilsack those 11,000 Anna my kids are not getting the same deal the children in other high-cost food jurisdictions are getting food costs have gone up since 1991 the year when the Block Grant started in the Northern Marianas and I'm concerned that there has been no review instead whether the payment rates in an audemars a Porsche know proportional to the cost of providing nutritious meals there as we're done for Alaska Hawaii in 1979 out of the Secretary's powers under the child nutrition act now the healthy and hunger free child act and then this between sablan and secretary tom vilsack so my question is would you be willing to accept his authority again to review payment rates in the Northern Marianas so that you can set the appropriate reimbursement rates to reflect the cost of food in in that area in my district well I'd be happy to work with you congressman on that issue the federal government now spend some 11 million dollars on enemy school meals according to Sablan office which could not say how much more the enemy would receive from a food cost adjustment but there's little doubt island food costs are higher and a study could help build a case for additional meal support for thousands of the Commonwealth's children on Capitol Hill Matt k4k SPN channel two new

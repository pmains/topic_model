and I know this has been a a challenging time for the SBA over the last several months is challenging time and obviously for our country I had a conversation on Monday with the administrator talking about the some of the issues we face with the IDL program I know I heard from so many people about the uncertainty we weren't on certain times to begin with this virus the pandemic the response has created so much anxiety for businesses will they be able to get through just day-to-day and we piled on top of that unfortunately with so much of the stutter steps and challenges we faced with the loans in my own district as an example we had a wonderful webinar the SBA folks in Illinois are working so hard and just you know bending over backwards but they told our businesses and there are thousand people on this call that they would have a decision within 21 days or their money within 21 days and they advanced $10,000 advance within three days obviously that didn't happen so I guess where I'd start with is where we are where we are now we have the decision of the hundred and fifty thousand dollars we have the change in how that emergency $10,000 was let out it's June 30th has come it's July 1st what do we tell them our businesses how do we give them the confidence that the SBA is going to be there for them it's going to give them the information you know I can order a pizza and track it from the time of order to delivery every step along the way and know when it it's going to arrive our business you should be able to at least have a similar sense of when they apply for a loan how much they're gonna get and when they're gonna get it so thank you for and thank you for spending some time with the administrator and the call that we had on Monday the the so today let me let me fast-forward today over the last since the beginning of time we since we started this in mid-march we're running about 41 days to fully to fully process these loans approve a decline from that perspective what are we doing right now are I looked at this morning's report we we're processing grants in two days we're processing loans in five days everything has been processed it's not in this application portal it's in the either the loan queue or the grant queue from that perspective so you know in hindsight I wish we could have been quicker which we could have maybe been a little bit more communicative than now that I'm hearing a lot of this is gonna come off more harsh than I mean it but you know we went through this crisis we did try to slam a whole lot through a small pipe in a very short time but being perfectly honest when I hear we're doing really well now that's kind of like the diner saying we crushed it we got crushed at lunch but at 3:00 in the afternoon things look fine but I know there's gonna be a dinner hour I know that is these loans the money that companies have borrowed is consumed they're gonna need to come back and they need more help I am confident that in a bipartisan way we're gonna find a way in Congress to help these companies what is the SBA doing today in that afternoon law to make sure that when we get to the next rush that we won't fall back into the 41 day time frame well we don't consider 3 2 to 3 million applications thank you al all right now I mean we're working still working seven days a week you know the 10 to 12 hours a day we've learned a lot but what I'm what I meant to say or what I intended to say is a we're a better organization today than we were when we started this process back in mid-march the the system's working faster we have individuals who the queue we've gone from a thousand employees up to seven thousand employees were better trained we're better prepared as we continue through this journey are there specific changes that you have to improve that are the changes completed and ready to go or and if they're not completed what is the timeline to get them complete so we're pretty completed from the perspective of things we've learned as we go through I mean every week we have a different build to address a specific issue I mean from that perspective so we're in a good place right now but we still do have a lot of work that we need to complete okay and I know this is changing week to week but that's one of the frustrations so many businesses had is that things kept changing week to week coming from the SBA and Treasury the instructions kept changing on the idle loans there was application one and then that case - uncertainty of whether I was gonna keep my place and mine if I did the first application when I applied for the second application I know we're gonna have to be flexible we're going to have to adopt because this virus is so dynamic but what confidence can you give not just me and my colleagues but every small business in this country that the SBA is going to provide some stability in the storm I mean we pride ourselves in customer service I know we we've not been successful in many individuals minds I mean but we have provided this 130 billion dollars - you know 2.1 million into businesses that employ that employ 11 million people I mean so I think we've had some level of success could we do better always I mean we continue to strive to be the best and that's why we continue to have these weekly sessions where we try to figure out what's the challenge that we need to address next continue on tonight and I don't want to question your intent or any SBA employees intent I know I know how hard everybody is working I know that we're asking the world of you but at this moment in this crisis we need the world from you and we're here to give whatever help we can but we really need the SBA to step up and deliver in the next round with that I yield back the gentleman

some are trying to define pro-israel to mean alignment with the political parties of the right of the American and Israeli political mouth you said that the president you just mentioned it want to get back to this through Israel under the bus they would say that being pro-israel requires supporting every policy of the present Israeli government in fact they might argue that means going even further to the right we've had an invented Palestinian people we see a well-funded machinery attacking as anti-israel political candidates who stand up for American leadership to resolve this conflict for peace so this is real crystal and Gary Bauer that are a part of this group that upon any sort of adds this is what people hate about politics so in 2012 we have to fight this trend we have to make clear that being pro-israel means advocating for an Israel that is secure within borders recognized by its neighbors in the world and for an Israel that embodies the Jewish and the democratic values on which it was founded and that are core to us as a people that we will establish is the future of pro-israel it will go from synagogue to synagogue congressional district to congressional districts house to house person to person and we'll make our voices heard we will take action and we will fight for our values in the name of our grandparents and for the sake of our grandchildren we are the future of pro-israel

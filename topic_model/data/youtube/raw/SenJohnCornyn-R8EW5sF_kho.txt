>> John: SOMETIMES IT'S AN  EXERCISE IN SELF-CONTROL. LARRY KUDLOW COMING UP SOON,  RIGHT? LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. THE SENATE TAKING A MAJOR STEP  FORWARD ON A BIPARTISAN GUN BILL ALMOST EXACTLY A MONTH AFTER THE HORRIFIC SHOOTING IN UVALDE,  TEXAS. SENATORS VOTING TO BREAK A  FILIBUSTER, A FINAL VOTE COULD  START AS EARLY AS TONIGHT. IT WOULD EXPAND BACKGROUND  CHECKS AND BOOST FUNDING FOR RED FLAG LAWS AND MENTAL HEALTH  AMONG OTHER THINGS. MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTION ON GUN  REFORM IN DECADES IF IT CAN PAST BOTH CHAMBERS. JOINING US NOW IS SENATOR JOHN  CORNYN. ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE  BIPARTISAN BILL. THERE WAS A SPLIT IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY. 14 REPUBLICAN SENATORS VOTED TO  ADVANCE THE BILL, 34 VOTED  AGAINST IT. IN THE HOUSE, STEVE SCALISE  WHIPPING VOTES AGAINST THIS.   MITCH McCONNELL SAYS THIS IS A  BILL. LISTEN TO HOW HE PUT IT. >> THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT. THIS TIME DEMOCRATS CAME OUR WAY AND AGREED TO ADVANCE SOME  COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS WITHOUT  ROLLING BACK RIGHTS FOR LAW  ABIDING CITIZENS. THE RESULT IS A PRODUCT I'M  PROUD TO SUPPORT. >> John: COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS  WITHOUT ROLLING BACK RIGHTS FOR  LAW ABIDING CITIZENS, A PRODUCT  I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT, WHAT DO  YOU SAY, SENATOR? >> I THINK HE'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW, CHRIS MURPHY, THE  SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT AND I  WORKED BEFORE ON THIS DIFFICULT  ISSUE AND IN A WAY THAT IMPROVES THE NATIONAL CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM AND SAVED LIVES IN  THE END AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT  WE ARE FOCUSED ON HERE, AND YOU  MENTIONED THE COMPONENTS OF  THIS. NOT ONLY DOES IT INCLUDE  ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR A COHORT OF 18 TO 21-YEAR-OLD GUN  BUYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE  NOT MISSING THINGS THAT WOULD  DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY WERE  ACTUALLY DISQUALIFIED UNDER  CURRENT LAW FROM PURCHASING A  FIREARM, BUT THE LARGEST  INVESTMENT IN THE  COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH  CARE THAT WE HAVE EVER MADE IN  AMERICAN HISTORY. AND AS WELL AS MAKING OUR  SCHOOLS SAFE. NO PARENT WANTS TO SENDS THEIR  CHILD TO SCHOOL FEARFUL FOR  THEIR SAFETY AND NO STUDENT  OUGHT TO HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL  AND BE AFRAID. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL  ADDRESSES. >> THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICANS,  INCLUDING FORMER PRESIDENT  TRUMP, WHO ARE RIPPING THIS AND  RIPPING YOU AS WELL. HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT PUT  OUT ON TRUE SOCIAL. HE SAID THE DEAL ON GUN CONTROL  CURRENTLY STRUCTURED AND PUSHED  IN THE SENATE BY THE RADICAL  LEFT DEMOCRATS WITH THE HELP  MITCH Mc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ohn: LET ME ASK YOU THIS  QUESTION. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL  THAT WOULD RESTRICT A LAW  ABIDING CITIZEN FROM PURCHASING  A FIREARM? >> NO. >> John: SIMPLE NO. NO GRAY AREAS, NOTHING THAT  WOULD RESTRICT SOMEBODY WHO,  MAYBE THE BACKGROUND CHECK SHOWS SOMETHING THEY DID NOT KNOW WAS  IN THEIR BACKGROUND, BUT -- YOU  ARE SAYING ABSOLUTELY, NOTHING  IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD RESTRICT A LAW ABIDING CITIZEN FROM  GETTING ACCESS TO A FIREARM. >> THAT'S CORRECT. IF YOU GO IN AND YOU PASS A  NATIONAL INSTANT BACKGROUND  CHECK YOU ARE ENTITLED TO  RECEIVE THAT FIREARM IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE LAW, AND NOTHING HERE  WOULD RESTRICT THAT. IN THE CASE OF 18 TO  21-YEAR-OLDS, WHAT HAPPENED IN  THIS CASE IN UVALDE, THIS YOUNG  MAN, EVERYBODY KNEW HE WAS A  TICKING TIME BOMB, A WHOLE HOST  OF PROBLEMS, BUT WHEN HE TURNED  18 IT'S AS IF HE WAS BORN  YESTERDAY AND HE WAS ABLE TO  PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK, THERE  WAS NO INSIGHT INTO POSSIBLE  DISQUALIFICATIONS THAT WOULD  HAVE OCCURRED IF HE HAD BEEN AN  ADULT. SO, THAT'S THE AREA WE ARE  FOCUSING ON, PROFILE IS ALL TOO  FAMILIAR. >> John: SENTIMENT OF AMERICAN  VOTERS APPEARS TO BE WITH YOU,  DO YOU BELIEVE TOUGHER GUN LAWS  WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF U.S.  MASS SHOOTINGS, 56% SAID YES,  39% SAID NO. IF REPUBLICANS CAN'T COME  TOGETHER IN THE WAKE OF A  TRAGEDY LIKE UVALDE AND DO  SOMETHING TO FIX THIS, WHAT DOES THAT SAY WHERE THE PARTY AT  LARGE IS COMPARED TO AMERICAN  SENTIMENT? >> JOHN, I THINK THAT'S ONE OF  THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ANSWER BECAUSE I THINK A LOT  OF PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING  WHETHER OUR INSTITUTIONS,  INCLUDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF, CAN ACTUALLY FUNCTION,  WHETHER WE CAN TRY TO FIND THAT  COMMON GROUND WHERE IT DOES  EXIST. SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T. SOMETIMES THE MOST IMPORTANT  THING YOU CAN SAY AS AN ELECTED  OFFICIAL IS NO. BUT I THINK IT CRIES OUT FOR A  SOLUTION, UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE NOT EASY TO COME BY. IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK AND GOOD  FAITH ON BOTH SIDES. BUT I THINK WE HAVE THREADED THE NEEDLE IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS  THE RIGHT OF LAW ABIDING  CITIZENS BUT TRIES TO GET AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM THAT  PRODUCED THE SHOOTING IN UVALDE  AND ELSEWHERE, AND ULTIMATELY  WILL SAVE LIVES AND TO ME THAT'S THE ULTIMATE TEST. >> John: WE WILL SEE HOW IT

so this early morning or evening on the Fox News Channel good to be with you reports of big layoffs in the Sanders campaign tonight that he will meet with President Obama in Washington on Thursday what do you think he will see in a few minutes will he pack it in will he continue will he end his candidacy and say this may be suspended but not his movement or as he has said do you think he will still move on to the convention and try to contest it and grab some those super-delegates away from Hillary Clinton well Hillary Clinton is won a majority of the pledged delegates a majority of the super-delegates he will she's won a majority of every kind of delegate I am a super delegate there's no way that there's going to be a rush of super-delegates over away from Hillary Clinton she is our nominee I don't know whether he will keep running for one more week because we do have a primary in the District of Columbia but I think whether it is this wednesday or next wednesday that we're going to to see him play a historic role and that is do everything he can to prevent a man that's appealing on the basis of racism keep that man out of the White House and you're referring to Donald Trump up but how does he do that how do they get together potentially when he has said such nasty things about mrs. Clinton he's had a movement against her and certainly recently questioning even the Clinton Foundation I think that the attacks on our side have been very modest compared to what you saw on the other side Trump has unified a a chunk of the Republican Party but obviously he's a problem I there's nothing Ben I it would prevent one candidate from supporting the other so you believe that the senator will eventually support mrs. Clinton I think back to this month and by the middle of this month but it may not be tomorrow or the next day and it seems tonight if you can put the numbers back up it seems kind of a blow out by your side by mrs. Clinton 61 percent to thirty-seven percent so far with not one hundred percent of the vote in you've got about five million absentee ballots with the Maryland vote you know the polls showed that was so close just two points apart you surprised by the apparent huge lead there it is we have it up on the screen now that apparent almost nearly double getting up there that mrs. Clinton has against the senator so far i am very gratified and a little surprised at how well we're doing at this point in the evening i think now and when all the ballots are are counted and i think that by hillary winning in california which was sanders last stand it will be easier for for him to bring his people aboard and unify behind a eight not only a historic candidacy in the good sense of the term no i mean we have a nominee who is by temperament and by experience the most qualified person in the country to serve as president but also a historic candidacy and turning back the first avowedly racist the candidate for president that we've seen in my lifetime and i'm over 60 years old well just over a third of the vote in the viewers can see it now 61 percent a thirty-seven percent for senator sanders surely not what the polling originally predicted some even said that maybe senator Sanders a wood California that apparently so far is not this situation tonight representative brad Sherman Democrat of California who has endorsed mrs. Clinton we thank you

Thank You Mariah for your heartwarming introduction Shalom J Street and God bless you for being here I've been traveling in America for 45 years once or twice a year lecturing to Jewish communities and campuses and for 45 years they were always trying to hush me by telling me that well in Israel you may have your differences but here in America we ought to be United my answer is United by all means absolutely let us all be united but why unite under the militant hawkish extremist banner of AIPAC let us all unite let us all unite behind the pragmatic humanistic and peace-loving ideas of peace now and J Street now to me the significance of J Street is that it represents something in which I have always believed there is more than just one way to be a good Jew there is more than just one way to be a good Zionist there is more than just one way to stand for Israel Zionism has always been a surname not a first name always a Federation of Dreams a conglomerate of blueprints and master plans and visions no one can claim Zionism to themselves it's a surname ever since 1967 I claimed that the israeli-palestinian conflict as opposed to the broader israeli-arab conflict the israeli-palestinian conflict is a tragedy in the purest sense of the word tragedy a clash between right and right a clash between one very powerful claim over the land and another no less powerful claim over the same land a clash between right and right sometimes as it happens it becomes a clash between wrong and wrong the Palestinians are in Palestine because Palestine is the homeland of the Palestinians in the same way in which Greece is the homeland of the Greeks and Norway their homeland the homeland of the Norwegians we Israelis are in Israel for exactly the same reason Israel is the homeland of the Israeli Jews in the same way in which Italy is the Norway the homeland of the Italians and Spain the homeland of the Spaniards as individuals Palestinian people and Jewish people founds home in other countries as a nation they never had another homeland we never had another homeland it's a clash between right and right time and again I am getting wonderful invitations to spend a rosy weekend in a beautiful resort in Europe with Palestinian counterparts writers and intellectuals so that we get to know each other we get to like each other we drink coffee together we realize that no one has tails and horns and the trouble will go away this is based on a very sentimentalist Western concept that every conflict is essentially no more than a misunderstanding a little family a little group therapy a touch of family counseling if the trouble will go away and everybody will live happily ever after well I've got bad news for you the clash between Israeli and Palestinian is real rivers of coffee drunk together cannot extinguish the tragedy of two people's rightly claiming the same land as their one and only homeland what we need is not coffee coffee is wonderful especially Arabic coffee a coffee together is wonderful but what we need is not coffee what we need is a livable compromise now I know the word compromise has a terrible reputation especially with young idealists they tend to think that compromises dishonest compromises lack of integrity compromise is somehow soft not in my vocabulary in my vocabulary the word compromise is synonymous to the word life and well there is life there are compromises and the opposite of compromise is not idealism and the opposite of compromise is not integrity the opposite of compromise is fanaticism and death and when I say compromise I don't mean capitulation and I certainly don't mean turn the other cheek to your enemy when I say compromise I mean meet your adversary somewhere halfway and believe me I know one or two things about compromises have been married to the same woman for more than 50 years now now some new voices are heard recently advocating a one-state solution why can't the Israeli Jews and the Palestinian Arabs become one happy family and live happily ever after as a united nation of Jews and Arabs well we cannot live like one happy family because we are not one because we are not happy and because we are not family we are two unhappy families it is unreasonable to expect Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs to jump into a honeymoon bed together after more than 100 years of bitterness and hatred and pain and suffering and bloodshed what we need is not a honeymoon but affair if painful divorce and by a fair and painful divorce I mean a two-state solution now let me tell you let me tell you this is going to be a funny divorce because the two divorcing couple are definitely staying in the same house no one is moving out and we have to take two take the really painful decision of who gets bedroom a and who gets bedroom B and what about the living room and the apartment being very small we have to make special arrangements about kitchen and bathroom very inconvenient but in definitely preferable to the present condition of submission and domination rather than Israelis and Palestinians live this way they have to live this way it is very simple we are destined to divide the house into two smaller apartments I think it's called in English a semi-detached house look at former Czechoslovakia I envy the Czechs and the Slovaks for conducting a peaceful divorce once they decided they cannot live with each other and they don't want to live under each other they split the Czechoslovak former Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and the Republic of Slovakia this should be a lesson for us and this will happen it will take time but it will happen I hate to make prophecies there is too much competition in the prophecy business in my country and it's dangerous to make prophecies especially about the future but let me give you one prediction one day there is going to be a Palestinian Embassy in Israel and an Israeli embassy in Palestine and these two and these two embassies are going to be walking distance from one another because one will be in West Jerusalem and the other one in East Jerusalem there are some painful issues there is the issue of the disputed holy places my grandmother had the formula for the holy places many many years ago she died fifty years ago but she had the formula for the disputed only places when I was a very little boy my grandmother explained to me in simple words the difference between Jew and Christian not between drew and Muslim but within drew and Christian she said you see my boy we Jews believe that the Messiah is still to come they the Christians they believe that the Messiah have been here once and he will come again one day over this said my wise grandmother you cannot imagine my child how much hatred and persecution and bloodshed why she said why can't everybody simply wait and see if the Messiah comes saying hello it's nice to see you again the Jews will have to apologize to the Christians if the Messiah comes saying how do you do it's good to meet you the entire Christian world will have to apologize to the Jews until then leave and let leave and this this ladies and gentlemen is the answer to the problem of the disputed holy places let us wave no flag over the disputed holy places let us make the necessary arrangements that everyone can pray freely and comfortably and proudly in the holy places and let the Messiah come and decide as my grandmother said which flag will wave over those places let us learn how to live with open-ended situations now I've got some good news for you you are all used to bad news from the Middle East we have help from staff and from Michael good news and bad news from the Middle East let me be the bearer of the good news the majority of the Palestinian Arabs and the majority of the Israeli Jews according to reliable public opinion surveys month after month both in Palestine and in Israel the majority in both people's accepts sadly and unhappily the two-state solution the majority of the tooth to Communities is ready for a partition this is a tremendous step forward when my colleagues and I my friends and I started campaigning for a two-state solution in 1967 there were so few of us we could have conducted our national conventions inside the public telephone box and let me tell you by the same token when I started advocating the two-state solution here in America in Jewish communities in America in the early 1970s they treated me as if I was preaching the Jewish people to convert to Islam no less this is gone the cognitive bloc is gone the majority of the Israelis and a majority of the Palestinians know now that in the end of the day there will be two states if you passed a public opinion survey between the Mediterranean and the river Jordan asking every individual Israeli Jew Palestinian Arab Israeli Palestinian Arab every individual not what is your ideal solution not what do you regard as a just solution but simply what do you think is actually going to happen in the end of the day 70 percent or more will say a two-state solution a partition and many will add immediately this will be a disaster this will be a crying injustice we don't trust the others but they know it now painfully they know it if I'm to use a metaphor I would say the following the patient Israeli and Palestinian is unhappily ready for a painful surgery that doctors are cowards the cognitive bloc that existed between Israeli Jew and Palestinian Arab for decades is gone now for many decades and I'm an old man I remember those days the Palestinians will not even utter the dirty word Israel they will use euphemisms they will speak about abdullah al masud ah the artificial entity in order to evade the explicit word Israel the Israelis for their part and majority of the Israelis would not even use the term Palestinians they will say the local Arab inhabitants of the country in order to evade the explicit term Palestinians no more the Palestinians and the Israelis are now capable of looking ours eyes they know now both in Israel and in Palestine that the other is real and that the other is not going to go anywhere this is a very good beginning when I said that doctors are cowards I was pointing out at the painful fact that the problem is the leadership on both sides the problem is the leadership I can tell you that if mr. Netanyahu beloved mr. Netanyahu and his right-hand man mr. Barack beloved mr. Barack if they have turned to the Israeli public saying yes two-state solutions yes 1967 borders with modifications yes to capital cities in Jerusalem they have the majority in the present government in the present Knesset and in the people and I'm very pragmatic this will come the leaders will emerge who they are I don't know perhaps they don't know yet but history is full of such surprises nobody ever expected Winston Churchill of all people to dismantle the British Empire nobody ever expected child the goal of all people to take France out of North Africa nobody expected Anwar Sadat of all people to come to Jerusalem address the Knesset and offer Israel peace nobody expected Menachem Begin of all people to give back to the whole of Sinai in return for peace nobody expected Michael Gorbachev of all people to dismantle the Soviet the Bolshevik bloc people are open-ended ah I say this professionally I say this is a storyteller I say this is a novelist people are open-ended you are open-ended every one of you is open-ended people are capable of surprising not only their immediate friends and family people are even capable of surprising themselves so I don't know who will be the leader or the leaders who will carry out the necessary surgeries but I know that those leader this leader of those leaders are already amongst us they are alive I wish I knew how old they are my friends visa vie the Palestinians I don't want to idealize the relations some people say first we have to get to love each other first we have to forgive each other first we have to embrace each other first we have to hug each other then we can make peace as long as we don't hug each other in tears saying o brothers rather what have I done to you will you ever forgive me as long as we don't engage in such a Dostoevsky and scene of reconciliation peace is not real throughout history the opposite is the cause first nations make peace with clenched teeth and sometimes with Mal intentions then gradually over generations the hard feelings deescalate there is an emotional de-escalation you know visibly the Palestinians my slogan has always been make peace not love we ought to go back to what has been thousands initial proposition to the Palestinian inhabitants of the land of Israel of Palestine recognition for recognition security for security statehood for statehood Jerusalem for Jerusalem now a few sentences about about Iran the Iranian regime is ugly fanatic extremists and aggressive it's one of the worst regimes on earth if not the worst but this is not true of the Iranian people Iran has a stronger Iran has a strong meaningful secular pragmatic middle class millions and millions of Iranians are not enemies of Israel they are enemies of their own regime now the Iranians have the know-how and the motivation to build a nuclear weapon it's impossible to bomb the non know-how and it's impossible to bomb the motivation you can only only bomb the installations so I think it will be a mistake for Israel to launch an attack on Iran and let us not be misled by the demagogic all comparisons between the present condition of Israel and the Jews during the Holocaust it's enough to say that today's Israel is far from being defenseless and the world is far from being indifferent about the Iranian problem Iran is the problem of the whole world not a problem of Israel alone I said earlier that the clash between Israelis and Palestinians is a tragedy in the precise dictionary sense of the world tragedy a clash between right and right now tragedies can be resolved in one of two minutes there is the Shakespearean manner of resolving a tragedy and there is the Anton Chekhov tradition of resolving a tragedy in a tragedy by Shakespeare in the conclusion the stage is covered with dead bodies but justice prevails somehow high above in the conclusion of a tragedy by Chekhov everybody is disappointed disillusioned bitter melancholy said but alive ladies and gentlemen we are not seeking a happy ending to the israeli-palestinian tragedy there can be no happy ending but my friends and I and you j-p-j Street people we are engaged in a struggle to find a Chekhovian not a Shakespearean conclusion to the israeli-palestinian tragedy and finally let me tell you something about Israel which is not represented in the false world of the CNN today's Israel is undergoing a remarkable golden age in the arts in literature in theater in the music in technology in the science usually golden ages are viewed in perspective in perspective once they are gone people say AHA this where our finest years not so in today's Israel the nation is bursting with creativity the literature the theatre the art the visual arts the music the science the technology the inventiveness is amazing on a universal and international scale all we need all we need now is two things to finally conclude the tragic conflict with the Palestinians by achieving a compromise and to renew the social solidarity which Israel had to some extent I don't want to idealize the old time but to renew the social solidarity which Israel had to some extent in the early years and lost in the course of years without social solidarity and peace with the Arabs Israel is a great existential danger with peace with Palestine and a renewed social solidarity Israel is paradise on earth J Street I have been waiting for you all my adult life thank you for being here thank you very much and God bless you thank you

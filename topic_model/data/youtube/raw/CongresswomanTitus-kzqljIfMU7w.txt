CONSENT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE   FOR ONE MINUTE.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE   GENTLEWOMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR  ONE MINUTE.  MS. TITUS: THANK YOU.  MADAM SPEAKER, I RISE TO HONOR   THE LIFE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR,   INKNOW VETERANS DAY TORE, AND  PHILANTHROPIST WHO TRULY LIVED   THE AMERICAN DREAM.  IN 1975, NICCOS RECEIVED A   $6,000 GRANT FROM HIS BROTHER. HE TURNED THAT SMALL LOAN INTO   A COMPANY THAT WILL BECOME ONE   OF THE WORLD'S MOST PRESTIGIOUS  COSMETIC MANUFACTURERS AND   DEVELOPERS.  A PROUD GREEK AMERICAN, HE   DEDICATED HIS LIFE GIVING BACK   TO HIS COMMUNITY.  AND HIS SPIRIT DEMONSTRATES  THAT WE ALL BENEFIT WHEN WE  OPEN OUR DOORS TO HARDWORKING  IMMIGRANTS WHO BELIEVE IN THE  PROMISE OF AMERICA.  NICCO SAID WE'RE SUCCESSFUL NOT  BECAUSE WE'RE SMART, NOT   BECAUSE WE WORKED HARD, NOT  BECAUSE WE WERE LUCKY, BUT   BECAUSE WE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE  OF BEING ABLE TO STAND ON THE  SHOULDERS OF OTHERS. AS HIS LOVED ONES MOURN THIS   DEVASTATING LOSS, WE CAN TAKE  COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT AN   ENTIRE COMMUNITY WILL BE   STANDING ON HIS SHOULDERS. I YIELD BACK.  THE SPEA

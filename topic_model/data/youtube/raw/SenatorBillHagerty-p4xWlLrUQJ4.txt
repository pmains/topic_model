tennessee senator bill hagerty also former u.s ambassador to japan for his perspective on today's proceedings and the news out of china as well senator good to have you with us it's great to be with you again shannon thank you okay so just about everybody agrees that the democrats are not going to win over an additional 17 republicans that they need to get to conviction so what is this about this is about politics plain and simple shannon what's happened is the democrats are chosen to stop the work of the united states senate in the middle of a pandemic in the middle of a recession at a time that we're going through a presidential transition and what they're doing is they're putting us through an unconstitutional in my view an unconstitutional show trial you know the remedy for impeachment is removal from office president trump is no longer the president the chief justice isn't presiding president trump is a private citizen and they are continuing to pursue this because really what the aim is i think is to humiliate president trump to discredit his policies and to shame the 74 million people who voted for him into conformity want to read something from a couple a couple of comments from one of your democratic colleagues senator chris coons he said this first about the video today he said how can you watch this and not vote to convict he also told one of our capitol hill producers i believe there are more republicans open to conviction than is publicly clear at this point your response well watching the videos was very painful the violence that occurred that day was immediately condemned by me and by every other member of the republican conference in fact i don't know a single senator who didn't condemn that violence and in fact over 200 people are now being prosecuted under criminal statutes for the violence that took place that day that's the venue to deal with this there's civil laws they're criminal laws for private citizens to be dealt with it's not an unconstitutional impeachment trial that's not what the senate should be designed for we've got serious work to be doing instead we're going through a political partisan show trial the president having his first conversation as president with president xi jinping over in china you are very familiar having worked as our ambassador in that region for a couple of years and very recently politico says this the longer that biden takes to make any big moves related to china the more he risks letting beijing dictate the course of events abroad while leaving political openings for his republican critics to exploit back home this readout of their call tonight says that they talked about beijing's coercive and unfair economic practices crackdowns in hong kong human rights abuses climate change uh and many other things what do you think this administration needs to do moving forward on china well more than talk i i read the readout as well and i was pleased to see that president biden called out xi on some of the nefarious actions that china has undertaken but china is moving aggressively every day they're moving against us they're moving militarily they're moving diplomatically and certainly they've been moving economically in a very predatory manner they don't play by the same rules that we do and we've got to be present and pushing back what about pushing back when it comes to the issue of covid and and what they knew about it the who apparently having spent a little time there after being blocked essentially for a year by china has said they want to rule out the lab leak as a possibility they're going to continue to look into other avenues they say but are you convinced that china has been transparent with us about what they know and what they could have done to possibly prevent the spread shannon they've been anything but forthcoming you recall what happened back in january of last year or february it was a huge cover-up they silenced doctors they destroyed samples they did everything that they could to prevent us from finding out what was happening they knew what was going on they even halted internal air traffic you couldn't get a flight from wuhan to beijing but they still allowed air travel to go from honda italy to you know north america so the chinese have been hiding this they've been again suppressing doctors scientists they destroyed samples they have not been forthcoming from the very beginning you know my hopes have not been high for the who and the progress that they might make you know the leadership at the who has been strongly linked to china and they've been touting chinese propaganda from the very beginning i hope they'll get to the root cause of this i certainly think that should happen but i'm not very optimistic senator bill hagerty thanks for stopping in tonight good to see you thank you so much and great to be with you

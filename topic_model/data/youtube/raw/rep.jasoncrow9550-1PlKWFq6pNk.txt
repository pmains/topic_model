leading off our discussion tonight john brennan former director of the cia he is an nbc news and msnbc senior national security and intelligence analyst also with us democratic congressman jason crowe colorado he's a member of the house armed services committee and he is one of the seven house managers of the impeachment trial of donald trump in the united states senate uh director brennan let me begin with you we finally got the question uh about his discussion with vladimir putin and of course the answer was we don't ever talk about what we talk about uh and we know that's not true uh what was your reaction to the way donald trump handled it today well good evening lawrence and first of all i do think it's important for the presidents of the united states and russia to be in regular contact i think that channel communication is important for bilateral as well as international issues that need to be discussed but it's particularly important during periods of tension or problems and clearly the recent reporting about bounties that have been placed on the heads of u.s servicemen and women in afghanistan is very very troubling and at a minimum even if those reports have not been confirmed donald trump had an obligation to the american people and to the women and men serving in afghanistan in a harm's way to let him know in no uncertain terms that those reports if true are totally unacceptable they're outrageous and that russia will pay a heavy price if in fact it continues with this effort to try to have americans killed in afghanistan it's clear that russia has has been supporting the taliban for quite some time but these most recent reports about bounties donald trump had an obligation to the american people to let putin know in very clear and direct language that this has to stop and that we're going to get to the bottom of this but it's clear that with his answer at the press conference today donald trump continues to give putin a pass even on something as appalling as russian efforts potentially to spill american blood uh carson crowe uh you're a combat veteran what is it like for you to have this question asked of the president today and it's one thing for him to hide behind uh we don't talk about what we talk about which is not true he has in the past talked about his conversations with vladimir putin but there's an opportunity for the president of the united states to address this country on this report about intelligence reports indicating uh that russia had been paying has been paying uh to kill american soldiers in afghanistan and donald trump does not say one word to this country about that does not even attempt one word of reassurance uh nothing when he's given that opportunity today yeah lawrence there's three really important takeaways here for me one is the impact on our soldiers the over 8 000 men and women that we have in afghanistan fighting right now as we speak i know because i used to be one of those soldiers so i don't go with a without thinking about the impact on them and they have to know they have the confidence that the commander-in-chief is looking out for them in their best interests and of course the president is not giving them those assurances the second is the the message that the president continues to send to russia it's very clear that message is very clear if you're vladimir putin and that is he will not hold you accountable he will not bring the issue up uh it's really a free pass for them to continue to get involved uh in uh our elections and meddle in our elections as they're doing every day and they're doing right now and the third is just the general invitation for foreign governments and foreign leaders to help him win reelection uh you know john bolton has indicated that he's done it with china that he's done it with turkey we know that he did it with ukraine and of course uh all the indications are that he does it uh with the the president of russia with vladimir putin as well and then i will say one other thing that you know john brennan knows better than anybody uh on this uh on the show tonight and that is the practical impact on our national security there's a reason why you have people in the room who prepare notes and gather information about a call between the president united states and the president of russia it's to make sure that information is getting to our intelligence agencies to the state department to the pentagon and we're keeping ourselves safe this president has gone to extraordinary links to derail that process and we are now less safe because we don't have the information that we need john brennan you've been in the room when information of this kind has been presented to a president and in fact more than one president in your career uh what do you say to people who who say well look if it's not proved beyond a reasonable doubt then there's no role for the president in information that isn't absolute certainty that's a specious argument intelligence over the years is rarely 100 percent certain but it's the obligation of the intelligence community to bring that information and intelligence to the president and to senior national security officials so they can act upon it and i think it's quite clear that from the reporting in the press that there is in fact information out there about reports of russian providing uh bounties to individuals to kill american troops and so therefore there were meetings at the white house according to press reports about it and there was a fair amount of discussion so i think donald trump continues to just turn away from problems and he cannot do that and i think congressman crowe had it exactly right the words of an american president matter whether he's talking privately to a russian president whether he's at a press conference and talking to the american people in the world what he says or doesn't say really does carry weight and i think he continues to send signals that he's going to allow vladimir putin and the russians to continue to trample upon our national security interests and he's not going to do anything about it uh congressman crowe the what is the house capacity to investigate this matter is there anything the intelligence community is gonna committee is gonna be able to do uh to get at this information about russia's activity uh with the taliban well i can't speak for chairmanship for the house intelligence committee but i do know that they are actively looking into it they continue to uh hold accountability hearings and look for that information um and you know here's the other really important thing that we know we know that the intelligence community and dod knew about reports of these potential bounties months ago we actually know that there was an interagency process that was started where dod the intelligence agencies state department and others actually prepared contingency plans options started to prepare options for what to do and options to give to the president in the event that this actually uh were real reports and the bounties were actually occurring and then it kind of stops the process stops right there uh so what that tells me is there's no will within the white house uh either the president or his advisors or likely both to actually continue to look at this which again uh sends a very strong message if you're vladimir putin that the united states has no will to hold them accountable uh that they're gonna get a free pass between now and november to do uh what they've been doing for years uh carson crow quickly before we go to this break i just want to get your reaction as someone who's been in combat on the ground uh what is it like what would it be what would it have been like for you while you were in combat to be reading reports like this and a president uh having nothing to say about it well you know it's lonely uh it's scary uh it's isolating uh and you know when you're one of those men and women who's walking you know the mountains of afghanistan uh working on the border uh you know you have to know there's this um there's this trust that has to occur between the soldier and his or her commander the soldier and the commander-in-chief a fidelity that knows that you won't be abused that you will only be asked to do the things that's necessary and that you will give your life you will do anything for this country so long as people are asking you to do it for the right reasons and the president undermines all of that if we don't know that he's doing it for the right reasons you know that trust that implicit trust that's necessary over hundreds of years uh between our men and women in uniform and the commander-in-chief that breaks down carson jason crowe and john brennan thank you both very much for joining us tonight we really appreciate it thank you

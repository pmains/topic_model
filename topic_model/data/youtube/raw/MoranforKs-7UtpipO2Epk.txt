part of Republicans 2014 strategy to retake the Senate involved retiring Harry Reid well the majority did turn for them and today we learned the Minority Leader will indeed be retiring chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel looks at Reid's decision and who may be next in line Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he will retire next year after 30 years in the Senate there were questions about whether he could win re-election and if he had the stamina after suffering serious injuries while exercising on New Year's Day this accident has caused us for the first time have a little downtime I have had time to ponder and to think we've got to be more concerned about the country the Senate the state of Nevada than us and as a result of that I'm not going to run for election the National Republican Senatorial Committee pounds saying quote on the verge of losing his own election and after losing the majority Senator Harry Reid has decided to hang up his rusty spurs during the 2014 campaign part of the rallying cry for Republicans was fire Harry Reid as Majority Leader it worked with nine republicans winning what word Democrat seats kansas republican senator jerry moran served as NRSC chairman in 2014 it was a significant component this idea of new leadership and certainly in the political vernacular it was very much about fire Senator Reid my guess is that it's much less fun for a former Majority Leader to be a former Majority Leader once you lead the United States Senate I doubt that you like being in the minority today President Obama called into a radio interview to praise reads work and surprise them is this Harry Reid he is Harry this block will all be damned they damned Quran says a big part of reeds leadership was keeping fellow Democrats from tough votes on the president's policies in my view that the Democrat leader Senator Reid was protecting Democrat senators from having to choose between the President's agenda the White House and many of their voters back home the next Democratic leader will be selected by secret ballot in November 2016 Illinois's dick Durbin yorks Chuck Schumer in Washington's patty Murray are potential contenders read in durban endorse Schumer today yet he is seen as close to Wall Street so expect a strong liberal push for Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren while many liberals would love to see Warren run for president some outside groups have already floated her name to replace read at this point her office says she doesn't plan to run to be Senate leader either Shannon all right we'll talk about it with a panel my Camino live on the hill thanks Mike

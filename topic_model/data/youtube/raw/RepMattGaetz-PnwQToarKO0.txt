[Music] Dandy's my best friend in Congress now that doesn't mean I'm his best friend I just have far fewer friends joining me now congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona co-chair of the border security caucus just in Arizona 40% of drugs interdicted in this country come in that corridor in a small corridor in Arizona we know it's a real deal we know that they're sending people in as decoys to overwhelm our Border Patrol agents and then they Brits in the drug smugglers right in other portions of the border this is happening it is real I wanted to ride with you guys for reason I want to know what was up I think it was on the first day of the conference committee coming together the Nancy Pelosi said there would be zero dollars for any physical barrier at the border if you've got a bill that can pass with Democratic votes to secure the border put it on the floor we're tired of negotiating when the goal posts keep moving when the terms keep changing and when Democrats do not appear sincere about securing our border that's what we're dealing with and you tell me if that wall is doing us any good that's Obama's two miles that he added yeah it's just it's just poles you can walk underneath yeah you can't you need to get in in case you need to get it and then when you turn around and raise your contacts that's yeah absolutely when you turn around and you walk another 20 feet guess what it stops then you can just walk around it so a lot of our colleagues right this is what we hear what we need more judges what we need to build more detention facilities and I like listen I got schools in my district that need to get built we're gonna go down there like build a ton of this detention facility I mean I don't know I love your thoughts on madmen and also like we've got a brand new federal courthouse here yeah and no judges ha ha seriously no federal judges I'm not kidding you well you tell me how many judges you need to process 300 process 3000 cases and then take a day I mean well it's impossible right I mean how do you it's impossible you've got a million people waiting for a case ostensibly and then you have a million people with deportation orders or removal wars are do you have 2 million people one man's already been through the system but they but there's nothing for them to do right right [Music] so this is the number one dropping place so what's that thing super water is on the whole border like most people just give up right here so they can claim asylum and so what they've been doing in some of these AG fields and further down the river where it's a little bit wider and you don't have the steep banks they've actually been stealing our all of our AG equipments these half-million-dollar yeah and then driving them across if you looked at an aerial all of that water that we have to send over to Mexico on the other side there's lots of farms and we have a lot of Ag that's on the other side of the border with us growers and they've moved a little bit more over there because of the problems at the border and the wait times and so 10 Amir Nano and two of the other big growers / shippers have actually just completed over a million square feet of cooler space five miles down the road in the mixer on the Mexico side in order to pre cool and pre prepare the product before it comes to the United States because of all the problems that we were having on this side of the border caused by the congestion but they just they just hide out right they just hide out in the tree this is a road that goes from the California border which is Los Algodones and that's Baja California right there and you can see all the debris that they're leaving over there as well so three miles up you'll see a lot of homes and that's the border and that's where you have every single day probably three to five thousand winter visitors across the border for health care because they can't afford it here in the US and tonight two to three hundred will cross the border and then tonight two or three hundred yeah but it's just really interesting what happens right here in this area and we'll have people showing up all the time saying yeah I'm just here for the weekend to get my dental done or to see a doctor so Jonathan just down here is where it goes down with across the river here you just saw a white Bronco move off the road into this treeline area they're moving in between those areas where our law enforcement is saying now there are hundreds of people waiting for nightfall to cross the border what is just below this Ridge is what is left of the Colorado River that functions as the border and in some places it's only shin deep and so we're seeing the well-traveled paths where illegal aliens are smuggled into these tree lines they wait for nightfall cross right through this area and then into the United States and what we've heard from some of the law enforcement officials is that their goal is simply to present themselves to a Border Patrol official US official and then say the magic words to get asylum we now know that we're apprehending 3,000 people a day under that process our court system cannot handle that it could not possibly handle that and it's troubling to just see how they're there you got right there on the Mexico side you know sort of people moving in and out of these tree lines and what we're hearing is that this is one of the principal areas that we see human smuggling and so without question the only barrier that we have is insufficient it is a world war two Normandy style vehicle barrier which obviously no vehicles are coming through the Colorado River so it's a it's the silly wall that President Obama erected and we're hoping we can do a lot better who has seen a Louis principal rival you know used to be chapathi yeah might mean there's two down there but sinaloa still controls the majority of so it's a it's a monopolized oh yeah under Sinaloa yeah for this area absolutely and how that leadership structure works at the top is an unknown and then given the unknown given El Chapo's lack of management availability when we look at Normandy barriers up there they're supposed to to prevent the the vehicles from coming with this there's no vehicle there's no vehicles coming I mean it's just and when it has cut down on tractor theft so they'll go to a staging point right they'll put them on a tiny little bus or into a car they'll drive them up they'll wait and I'll tell them wind across and I'll come across together and then the cartel says we found valium when I was down here with this count like the super heavy valium that they only give for in institutions not things that you'd subscribe my scouts brought to me and you look at these located socks you know I hear you as a lawyer well I think that you are putting at least in this evening we got somebody coming back our way here so we got one guy up at the camera this guy you said running code what did that he's not ranked oh so he doesn't have his lights on but he's hauling butt and that means he's moving everybody out of my way [Music] [Music] he's got stuff all over working on his ankles we're gonna have that the just a few moments ago we witnessed a border apprehension in this canal where a two single men were trying to get across the border that works no family unit and they were apprehended by Border Patrol back this way you see the end of sort of the Obama era a fencing extension and then just a ways down here you get a Normandy style vehicle barrier but as we're hearing from the property owners and law enforcement you're not really encountering a lot of vehicles coming over it's a lot of people on foot this is just a funnel where they say now as night is falling they'll just be a steady stream of people that will roll through the space these guys that we saw apprehended today will be out in four days we don't have any space to help you know 3,000 of them a day there we gonna put 3,000 these people are dead I say the cartels know what they're doing when they get when those 600 people get caught they're counting on that hundred man hours per agent that they're getting in gap time and so if we hire if we hire five fuels and more judges and send them down here then you know they'll just send 10,000 more asylum-seeker right I mean it it's a math problem for the cartels build around stressing the system [Music] yeah yeah this doesn't uh this doesn't strike me as an informal meeting yeah so that's yeah body's right there so that it's not a small group you know hungry hi Tony or ami ten wheels were here yeah oh my word well they were hiding across the thing they were hiding across that's that's how you we usually work one in just one guy for thirty people how do you know well I mean you've already searched them for weapons that yeah I'm assuming they didn't yeah they wouldn't leave him there then search those people for weapons I mean what you're looking at right there is a is a response to US policy clearly clearly the fact that there's not a single male down there without clutching a kid is if you show up with a kid it's gonna be different at guatemalan man allegedly paid about 130 dollars to rent an eight-year-old boy after he was told it would be easier to get into the united states with a child smugglers and traffickers have caught on realizing that the outdated laws lack of resources and bad port decisions effectively give them a free ticket into america a criminal complaint said what a mullet illegal immigrant manor of alaska's molina allegedly paid an additional 1000 Quetzales or 130 US dollars to have a false birth certificate made for the boy as a result the flow of families and children has become a flood in the past five years we have seen a 620 percent increase in families were those posing as families apprehended at the border this last fiscal year was the highest on record and of great concern to me is that the children are being used as pawns to get into our country in Yuma Arizona Border Patrol has detected 550 fraudulent family it's so far this year and we know we've missed many many more and so those are kids that are being rented for lack of a better word to a an adult to format a fraudulent family unit so that they can be released in the United States and then that child be recycled we have encountered recycling rains where innocent young people are used multiple times to help aliens gain illegal entry they're onto something else right now whoa let's go small so right now that's how it is you know you're on one group then you move onto the next they might have crossed over oh wait no they're on them up there the body yeah there another kid another adult another adult another kid they just carry their money the docks and that's it and some of their long I guess when they get dropped off they can't drop off without reaching army and they get I guess they get food and they get it everything restart to them yes Wow so between here in the fence is like five ten miles and you just think if we run this doesn't write anything we're gonna keep seeing people we're still here in the area controlled by the Sinaloa cartel right over here you'll see what was at one point a Kentucky Fried Chicken it was purchased closed down and actually turned into a tunnel system by a cross-border tunnel that was used to smuggle a very significant quantity of hard narcotics k-9 was called conducted a sniff of the truck at the trailer lured to to toolboxes in the bed of the trailer HSI agents had previously observed those troops toolboxes being taken out of and abandoned no longer operating Kentucky Fried Chicken just a quarter of a mile here to my right on the Mexico side drugs are inserted and then all along this corridor again Mexico just on the other side of these lights the United States here they found three tunnels in the last four years just within a few miles stretch so obviously a hotbed of activity [Music] actually I've got a lot of people getting hired now it's been a process over the last four or five six years cbpo fo has taken on a very good project in hiring these folks and getting them on board but it takes about a year and a half at max just to get them here and then I've got to put them through about 16 weeks of OJT so I'm not there I'm about 40 well about 45 people short right now yeah doctors about the demographics what you see aged men's women children we're seeing mostly you know women and children and men and children of us late 2008 23 24 24 both men and women yes and what about children what Oh anywhere from newborns all the way up to 16 and make sense I do have cases here where I show up with a male I have a child he claims to be the father and we find out that's not yeah can you and what were the credible fear questions how do you I don't we don't we don't know is that we simply ask you know you fear returning back to the country that you came up for psych who says no no no they all say yes because they used to if they say none we go okay and then that goes before someone sees that well you said this before some 100 percent of the people we're about 90 I'm gonna say about 98 percent sir because I'm sure sound will sound oh I'm not afraid to go back to my country I just don't want to be that I'm afraid to be what's happening I'm afraid for myself and my economic security cuz I don't have a job so afraid of my help because over there I can't get health care so the other part of the problem and it just touched us personally is the sensible and our housekeepers son Cody two weeks ago you can die eight in one week in Yuma new ones this is pretty standard for what we see in Arizona on a regular basis the guys here in Yuma sees a boatload of dope as you come to this piece here in the middle that spent a lot spent on powder and I ran the numbers on it before that right there is enough fentanyl to to hypothetically kill about 11 million people up here we have heroin heroin is the other opioid that we're seeing a lot of now because of our opioid addiction problem obviously that the heroin the airlin stuff starting to plateau out because everything on the phantom cheaper the profit margin is huge lighter carry it's synthetic so you can manufacture it yourself you off the growing poppy plants and let that anybody process it you can have a couple of jokers in the garage they can get the precursors they can manufacture it themselves by so this is the meth and you can see methods generally a yellowish substance in here and this is a pretty standard packaging that they do menthol itself the street value the profit off of that you're looking at between 7 and 9 million dollars per key just see 25,000 every day comes here so I have seven guys that cross every single day and right now the wait times are three to seven hours to cross - cries - come to order yeah see then they're doing there they're trying to be legal yeah and those are the ones we should facilitate it's down to two justice it's the meltdown that Nielson was talking about [Music] you got people we're rocking a roll again got it joining us tonight - congressman there in Yuma Arizona this week where they have witnessed firsthand the state of emergency at our southern border joining us tonight congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona and congressman gates we are right here at a funneled point in the Yuma Valley loo and Border Patrol jokingly mock what's behind us as the Obama wall because it's not doing anything to stop the floods of migrants we could literally hear the cartels you know zooming back and forth spotting us on their ATVs and here's the tragedy the 42 people that we saw apprehended last night will be out on the streets before the end of a week in four days they are released so today are the policy we witnessed last night was catch and release and what's so sad is these migrants these cartel members these smugglers whomever they are that are crossing the border they simply turn themselves in they don't even run they don't even fight because they know that our laws are so broken that they'll be released out into the public anyway it is a total joke they're laughing at us right behind us and I'm glad we've got a president and an attorney general that's willing to fight to preserve the country they walked so much they wore a hole in that carpet shoot you put it on over your booth you shoe mass detection plus it trakula TV on patrol and in the jail this is not a sanctuary city if we determine that they're here in this country legally then we notify ice and ice will then issue a warrant for that person and then we will then put a detainer on that person the size of Connecticut Pinal County is not on the border but close enough that it impacts the county's crime rate with these plans if they were here this morning but you figure you can't see these guys from the freeway let you stop you're not gonna see them you can see it's hard on them a lot of them will carry electric lights I think when they get their pack they will get electrolytes toilet paper if you look at all this what they've started doing is they've started packing a lot of their stuff out so they're packing their clothes so that we don't figure out where they're loading out that obviously some of them still relieving it but a lot of the groups will pack out all their stuff you have guys that come through here that this is what they do for a living yeah they bring groups across they bring drugs across some of them get hurt and they realize it's good money and they're willing to do it again a lot of the people we get here are still human beings being trafficked by the cartel so they paid the cartel money and then the cartel made them transport drugs with them and so they've been taken advantage of by the cartel exploited you can see it's look at the look at the terrain this isn't easy three four five six packs that's a six-person crew right there let's say my guys are doing it something in Casa Grande well if they hit our sensors or we pick them up how much time do we have to get here and they're mobile and they pull up and boom they're in the car they're gone then it's a matter of trying to find them on the freeways which is it's like finding a needle in a haystack sometimes my fellow Americans tonight I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border that is Mexico right over there they come up the sandy embankment walk up this way before too long they could be right inside Yuma we are out of space to hold them and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country build a wall that will save American lives and preserve our sovereignty America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who would reach our society and contribute to our nation but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration he'll use the national emergency taxi completely wall so he's gonna get it done Lou and and and so but it but it shouldn't be this hard it shouldn't be this hard to make it happen call Congress and tell them to finally after all of these decades we're seeing that had we built the wall we would be protected secure our border across our southern border we have thousands of miles of unprotected terrain this is a choice between right and wrong this is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve it is so obvious to everyone here we don't know why it's not obvious to our fellow members of Congress in Washington when I took the oath of office I swore to protect our country and that is what I will always do so help me God thank you and good night [Music] [Music] [Music]

Thank You mr. chairman first first statement I want to make is marwan's in sorrow than in anger I'll get to the anger part at a minute the sorrow part is that director coats in response to a question from Senator Collins you gave an eloquent factual statement of the activities of the Russians and the fact that they're continuing around the world and that they're a continuing threat to this country all of you have agreed to that if only the president would say that I understand the president sensitivity about whether his campaign was in connection with the Russians and that's a that's a separate question but there is no question we've got before us the entire intelligence community that the Russians interfered in the election in 2016 they're continuing to do it and there are a real imminent threat to our elections in a matter of eight or nine months my problem is I talked to people in Maine who say the whole thing is a witch hunt and it's a hoax because the president told me I just wish you all could persuade the president as a matter of national security to separate these two issues the collusion issue is over here unresolved we're get to the bottom of that but there's no doubt as you all have testified today and it we cannot confront this threat which is a serious one with a whole-of-government response when the leader of the government continues to deny that it exists now let me get to the anger part the anger part involves cyber attacks you have all testified that we're subject to repeated cyber attacks cyber attacks are occurring right now in our infrastructure all over this country I am sick and tired of going to these hearings which I've been going to for five years where everybody talks about cyber attacks and our country still does not have a policy or a doctrine or a strategy for dealing with them and this is not a criticism of the current administration the prior I'm an equal-opportunity critic here the prior administration didn't do it either Admiral Rogers until we have some deterrent capacity we are going to continue to be attacked isn't that true yes sir we have to change this current dynamic cuz we're all wrong into the cost equation and we are trying to fight a global battle with our hands tied behind our back director coach you have a stunning statement in your report they will work to use cyber operations to a tree to achieve strategic objectives unless they face clear repercussions for their cyber operations right now there are none is that not the case there are no repercussions we have no we have no doctrine of deterrence how are we ever going to get them to stop doing this if all we do is patch our software and try to defend ourselves those are very relevant questions and I think everyone and not only at this table but in every agency of government understands the threat that we have here and the impact already being made through these cyber threats we our role as the intelligence community is to provide all the information we possibly can as to what is happening so our policymakers can take that including the Congress and shape policy as to how we are going to respond to this and deal with this in a whole-of-government way it just never seems to happen Pompeyo you understand this issue do you not yeah we are not going to be able to defend ourselves from cyberattacks by simply being defensive we have to have a doctrine of deterrence if they strike us in cyber they are going to be struck back in some way it may not be cyber I would agree with you I would also argue that and while I can't say much in this setting I would argue that your statement that we have done nothing it does not reflect the responses that frankly some of us at this table have engaged in and the United States government is gauging both before and after this is me but both during and before this administration but deterrence doesn't work unless the other side knows that the doomsday machine in the in dr. Strangelove didn't work because the Russians hadn't told us about it's true that it's important that the adversary not is not a requirement that the whole world know it and the adversary does know it in your view I'd prefer to save that for another woman well I believe that this country needs a clear doctrine what is a cyber attack what is a act of war what will be the response what will be the consequences and right now I haven't I said senator I Greer's I haven't seen it III agree with you we we collectively it is it is a complicated problem given in nature who knows by the way yes I would - and as when as I said as a member of the House of Representative six years I take responsibility for not having been part of solving that - there is a lot of work here to do we do need a US government strategy and clear authorities to go achieve that strategy I appreciate it I just don't want to go home to Maine when there's a serious cyber attack and say well we we never really got to it we knew it was a problem but we had four different committees of jurisdiction and we just couldn't work it out yes sir that's not gonna fly yes sir thank you gentlemen for yourself senator I might just add that we don't want to learn this lesson the hard way we nine-one-one took eleventh took place because we were not coordinating our efforts we are now coordinating efforts but we didn't have the right defenses in place because the right information was not there our job is to get that right information to the policymakers and get on with it because it's just common sense if someone is attacking you and there's no retribution or response it's just going to incent their attentive eyes more contacts all right now they could a lot of there are a lot of blank checks there's a lot of things that we need to do director coach thank you I appreciate that thank you John

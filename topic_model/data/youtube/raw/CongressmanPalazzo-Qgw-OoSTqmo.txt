this Mr Speaker I yield five minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi mr. pallazzo who is the chairman of the space subcommittee of the Science Committee gentleman from Mississippi is recognized Thank You mr. speaker and I want to thank the chairman for the time I want to echo the words of chairman Smith and ranking member Johnson of the Science Space and Technology Committee this is truly a bipartisan bill the house should be proud of the work the committee has done to be inclusive of members on both sides of the owl the authorization levels are responsible and consistent with the consolidated appropriations act of 2014 any time of increasing partisanship on Capitol Hill both Republicans and Democrats came together on the House Science Space and Technology Committee to craft legislation that moves beyond congressional districts and parochial interests this bill provides a clear mission in the resources necessary to support that mission it also continues looking to NASA to provide a strategic roadmap space subcommittee ranking member Donna Edwards and I work long days to put this legislation together and while Ms Edwards and I don't always agree we are united in our unwavering support for NASA and space exploration during this crucial time in our nation's history we are committed to once more launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil I know many of our colleagues agree that American leadership in space as a matter of both national pride and national security yet over the last decade the human exploration program at NASA has been plagued with instability from constantly changing requirements budgets and missions says President Obama cancelled the constellation program in 2010 NASA's human spaceflight program has been adrift we cannot continue changing our program of record every time there's a new president we must be consistent our commitment to human exploration that commitment is reflected in today's bipartisan bill and I'm confident it will continue into the future the bill before us today requires NASA to develop a human exploration roadmap and provides a framework to build an executable plan for future exploration efforts the plan required in this bill will serve as a pathway to Mars with multiple missions or mission sets that may be used to demonstrate those technologies and capabilities necessary for deep space exploration NASA must use this plan as an opportunity to utilize assets from all the mission directorates to find the most efficient and effective ways to build technologies and capabilities within constrained budgets both the Space Launch System and Orion crew capsule are reaffirmed in this bill consistent with the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 which laid out very clear guidelines in direction for the development of these systems this bill authorizes ample funding for the Commercial Crew program to ensure safe and one-time development of domestic access to the International Space Station there are also oversight provisions to ensure transparency in the contracts and processes used to develop these systems this agreement represents an understanding that both our Commercial Crew partners and those developing SLS and Orion has a crucial role to play in ending our reliance on Russian Rockets a concrete plan for the future of human exploration beyond the earth-moon system must be developed if we have any hope of ensuring America's leadership in space while this bill does not require NASA to return humans to the moon current federal law is still in place that provides guidance on the best path forward into our solar system as a recent study from the National Research Council pointed out a return to extended surface operations on the moon would make significant contributions to a strategy ultimately aimed at landing people on Mars this bill is not perfect I will continue to raise questions and concerns over NASA's budget increases in earth sciences funding at the risk of space exploration budgets costly and complex distractions such as the proposed asteroid retrieval mission and maintaining adequate funding for the space launch system as the next generation of deep space exploration rockets and vehicles our bill represents a serious bipartisan commitment to space exploration at a serious time in our nation's history American leadership in space depends on our ability to put people and sound policy ahead of head of politics that is what we have tried to do with the House bill I urge our friends in the Senate to move forward with us by adopting our common-sense compromise and passing the House bill our nation's space program needs this legislation space exploration has always had its challenges but the United States has always risen to the occasion this country was built by people who dream big and do the hard things i believe the decisions we make today will determine whether the u.s. maintains its leadership in space tomorrow that's why i'm proud to stand by this responsible proposal alongside chairman Smith and ranking members Johnson and Edwards and supported this bill Thank You mr. Speaker I yield back the gentleman from Mississippi yields back the gentleman from Texas reserves the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas thank you Miss

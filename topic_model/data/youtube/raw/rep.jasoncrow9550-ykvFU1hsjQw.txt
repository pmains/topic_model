wanted to just check and see how you're doing I'm doing good I am wondering behind that flag you had that old school filing cabinet back there do you have pulled all your papers all your all your paper files in there I have lots of files in there and then I have about three more old filing cabinets they're all fireproof in case something bad were to ever happen I have from my old Senate days I've got some of my early congressional years in the other office and you know just really dealing with sort of the growth that's why I have so many files in there and then I got double the files there because you know my districts been growing and you know that this year we're doing the census and it's so important that we make that we really communicate with our districts about how important the censuses and I found it very interesting that people are more responsive in my district about filling out their census forms because they take it very seriously then in your congressional district that we are still I knew that was coming the setup was just so obvious you know I mean I I don't want to gloat because there still is time for the 6th congressional district to catch up in a house the second congressional district in terms of how many people are you know signing out and providing census information well it's so far your district just hasn't done very well well you know we're we're nipping on your heels and you know we're only last time I checked three tenths of a percent behind you and as much as I appreciate your file cabinet of files and I had to aspire to one day have to file cabinets worth of files but I you know I'm building up to that you know this is really good to know what I really appreciate is that how well you moved beyond the drubbing that we gave you over the holidays by beating your office and the holiday competition you've emotionally moved on from that it doesn't have any you have any baggage whatsoever from that well I do because I knew you would bring that up and I just want to remind you how we were the first ones to really pursue you know great holiday decorations in our hallway and we managed to stay a step ahead of you the whole time even though you would like to claim to the contrary and that's exactly what's going to happen with the census that you may try but you're not going to catch up and and I think what we ought to really be thinking about are guys like Jonah goose and Scott Tipton roosters are you know sixth and seventh in terms of participation and you and I are sort of neck-and-neck and I'm going to stay ahead of you and the second ahead of you but we are light-years the two of us ahead in the goose and Tipton and I don't know what's the matter with those guys in terms of getting their people you know to file their census reports I I agree with you I we need to reframe this issue I think instead of beating each other up you know the two leaders need to join our forces and really help out you know the other the other congressional districts that are substantially lagging behind our efforts there's no doubt about that oh they truly are laggards in this there's no question and I don't know what it is that will spur them on other than a challenge from the two of us as you just laid down that gauntlet but I I intend to let them know that they are really falling far behind and even though you're within shouting distance of me you're gonna remain just within shouting distance me and the seventh congressional district time will tell I'm hotel you

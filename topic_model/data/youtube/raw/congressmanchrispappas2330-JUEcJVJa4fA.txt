[Music] welcome to mcdavid trucks we've been here since 1974. we're very heavily vested in new hampshire and we greatly appreciate you taking up the topic of the federal excise tax it's now up to 12 which happens to be the highest uh excise tax on any product in the country bill that we've introduced is the modern clean safe truck act of 2022 and what we're asking for here is for us to find ways to support small businesses in our economy we're all talking about supply chains and what better way to support our supply chains and helping to create some efficiencies within them and making sure that modern clean safe trucks can get out of the roads and ensuring that our local businesses can grow and thrive they can't afford that additional significant 20 plus thousand dollar tax on the vehicle um just thank you for taking the time to again hear us out on this and taking the lead it is so vital like i said not only to our own businesses but to the u.s economy as a whole you're taking the lead and the appeal of the fbt is tremendous so i think it's time to revisit it again so i'm really grateful for the feedback and advocacy that you all do and uh we're going to continue to fight for some fairness with this particular tax thanks for uh thank you showing how this will make a difference [Music]

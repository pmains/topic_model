house minority whip steve scalise uh congressman scalise thank you so much for for being with us let me just share with you and the audience a little bit of what the washington post had to say um here's a quote from within that article the fact check fact checker piece acknowledges that senator tim scott may not have known his full family history and that historical record regarding the lives of black americans are often scanned nonetheless our reporting adds information found in official records to scott's public remarks and writings about his grandfather the fact checker occasionally delves in the origin stories of politicians often without reaching conclusion about their completeness or veracity congressman scalise what do you think this is really about well good morning good to be with you and look tim scott's a wonderful person a dear friend but he's also a rising star and there's nothing that scares the left more than a conservative african-american leader who's gaining respect nationally on his own not pushing the false narrative of the left but talking about individual opportunity uh tim scott was the one who authored opportunity zones uh you know and i'm sure they'll try to now fact check that go get it tim is a wonderful person the fact that they're going after him shows how scared the left is of him and they should be scared of him because he's a great person and he's a rising star in our party yeah a republican black american who dares to think for himself that's exactly who they just went after congressman i have to ask you about this as well we know this directly impacted your life the shooter at the congressional baseball game is uh being qualified or being termed by the fbi designated as an incident of quote suicide by cop this is even as we know the shooter's own letters put a dent in the fbi's theory he seems to lay out his own motivations it didn't seem to be suicide by cop did it congressman this was not suicide by cop anybody who's studied the police report who was there on the ball field that day all of us know what happened he went to that ball field to target and kill republicans he made it clear that was what his intention was he actually had a list of republican members of congress in his pocket who he was targeting to kill and for the fbi to have classified it as that uh it's disturbing it's offensive and it's inaccurate and so we're asking that the fbi uh correct this record my colleague brad wenstrup uh was actually in a hearing with the fbi director last week fbi director ray who was not the director at the time this happened and actually to his credit director race that he would look into it so hopefully we'll get this fixed uh because it's a disservice to police as well to classify it that way absolutely well hopefully we'll wait and see what the fbi's response is but congressman scalise thanks so much for joining us this morning great to be with you thanks still ahead you bet

with republican congressman adam kinzinger of illinois he's a key member of the foreign affairs committee he's also lieutenant colonel in the u.s air national guard he served in both iraq and afghanistan congressman what's your reaction to the u.s now sanctioning putin and foreign minister lavrov directly it's good it should have been done yesterday it should have been done a while ago uh sanctions look i mean the more we can do the better this inflicts pain on russia sadly it also inflicts pain on the russian people it will help to skyrocket the price of energy which also benefits vladimir putin but there is no doubt every sanction we can do we should do we should including ban them from using swift that is a decision that has to be made with our european partners that's what we can do to make it painful stopping the attack quite honestly wolf the ukrainian people are fighting much harder than i think putin expected but they will be outmatched and outgunned ultimately by somebody that is very willing to lose his own troops and he doesn't care vladimir putin i heard general clark and i agree that i think this is time where we need to at the invitation of ukraine declare ukraine a no-fly zone enforced by nato in the united states we certainly have the capability to do that the airspace is still contested by the ukrainians we could certainly shut down russian air operations even if we don't directly engage russian troops on the ground because president biden keeps saying the us and the nato allies will not send troops forces directly into ukraine since ukraine is not a member of nato the ukrainian president only moments ago and you heard this congressman warren russian forces are advancing on kiev the capital and said quote the fate of ukraine is being decided he said and i'm quoting him right now can the ukrainians do you believe hold their capital or will it fall well let me let me add to even what the president said i think the fate of the west is being designed and determined tonight i don't believe vladimir putin will be able to hold ukraine we have seen in their fighting spirit that even if the troops basically take over kiev and all their strategic positions the ukrainian people are not russian the ukrainian people do not identify as russian and they will fight russian troops in the streets until russian troops similar to what they did in afghanistan will tuck their tail and go home but listen what is next is it the country of georgia a third of it which is occupied right now by russia is it the baltics is there continued meddling in the balkans are there other countries not in nato that vladimir putin lays he has threatened the use of nuclear weapons that shows you how dangerous this man is and he only stops when his bayonet hits a brick wall the united states and nato must be that brick wall tonight i would love to see us declare at the invitation of ukraine that ukraine is a no-fly zone and we will enforce that and i gotta tell you wolf for anybody that thinks that somehow we're going to be equally matched with russia nato in the united states would crush russia in the air in a second we have to remember how good we are at that that can be the thing that can give the ukrainians a fighting ability to prevent the occupation of kiev but they won't go quietly into the knights but if u.s and nato warplanes shoot down russian planes flying over ukraine right now that could trigger a growing an escalation of this conflict between nato including the united states and russia and let's not forget congressman russia's a nuclear power well that would be a determination for vladimir putin and i think the fact that you and i here have to truly com you know determine whether or not you know vladimir putin would be willing to you to use nukes or to threaten nukes shows how dangerous this man is and if we give him ukraine and say well now he's satiated we're gonna be once again in this position whenever he determines it's the rest of georgia or it's whatever other country he lays a determination on next i think this is the moment when the russians have been defeated in some cases in the battlefield when you see these ukrainian heroes that have risen up blowing up bridges or the 13 on the island that told the russian warship to basically screw off like this is the moment where if we step up and i'm not saying we have to bomb stuff on the ground but we declare this is a no-fly zone not because we want to fight russia but because the legitimate government of ukraine has determined that they want our help to defend the skies then it's on vladimir putin he knows trust me wolf he knows he cannot win a direct engagement with the united states at some point we have to be willing to stand tough and to have him back down he's not going to do it until he knows we're serious all right congressman adam mckenziger ominous situation unfolding as we all know thank you very very much coming up we're going to get a lot

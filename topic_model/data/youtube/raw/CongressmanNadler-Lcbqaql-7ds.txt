therefore five minutes Thank You mr. chairman before I begin my questions have a motion at the desk mr. chairman on July 10th 2001 the Phoenix field office of the FBI folded the memorandum to headquarters to advise the Bureau of an effort by Osama bin Laden to send associates to the United States to enroll in civil aviation courses in the words of former CIA director George Tenet the system was blinking red for a host of complicated reasons the Bush administration did not follow up adequately and two months later on September 11th in my district the World Trade Towers fell mr. chairman last Friday special counsel Robert Muller indicted 12 Russian nationals for hacking into the Democratic National Committee the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in several state election systems this indictment is a remarkable piece of forensic work with the aid of the intelligence community the special counsel can name the specific Russian military intelligence officers at the keyboard on a given day and in the words of the director coats a distinguished former Republican senator and president Trump's hand-picked Director of National Intelligence our digital infrastructure is literally under attack unquote by the Russian government as we speak mr. chairman this latest indictment can surely be seen as the equivalent of the Phoenix memo about 9/11 it is a warning we must heed it yesterday in Helsinki President Trump said he does not believe it he sided with Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence community and he continues to undermine American law enforcement proclaiming on the world stage that our laws are meaningless that the work of investigators has been worthless that no one should take the special counsel seriously this is a catastrophe in the making if we do not take any action the American people may not trust the outcome of the next election and instead of taking action in this committee instead of refuting the president with information you and I have both read mr. chairman we spend six more hours questioning Lisa Paige about Cheryl Mills laptop and Hillary Clinton's email this is a national emergency and our silence is unacceptable our nation is under attack accordingly under committee rule three B and House Rule 11 G 2a I move that the committee going to do now go into executive session for the purposes of discussing the evidence in our possession speaks directly to the special counsels indictment and to the president's apparent submission to the Russian government

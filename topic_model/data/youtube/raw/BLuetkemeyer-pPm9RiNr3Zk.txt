hi this is connection work tomorrow the no additional blame bus thanks for joining us this week this week the main vote that we took was dealt with the sequestration transparency act which basically asked the President to sit down tell us where the cuts are going to be at the end of the year here with regards to the defense budget and all of the other national security bill budgets that are going to be affected by sequestration as you know sequestration is the amount that's being taken out of the budget as a result of the debt negotiations from last year and the amount is six hundred billion dollars over the next 10 years in cuts to national defense most of that being in the defense budget self although some of them that with National Security department's like homeland security and sandals of them so it's very concerning to us we passed a bill back in March that was the sequestration replace reconciliation Act that's a mouthful and basically showed that the house had some other ideas of ways that we could alleviate these cuts to defense that you would cut these other areas of the federal budget and therefore putting ideas on the table from which to begin the discussion on how we can find other ways to not cut defense but the president seems pretty adamant and the sentence he's pretty adamant I'm going with this sequestration of the Defense Department and as a result we'd like to know where the president's going to cut and it's only fair we believe that that's what we thought the American people need to know that and they need a note for the election because it could be a big issue that could make a difference from the standpoint that if they know that we're going to cut out all of our missile defense for instance we're going to cut all of our aircraft carrier or going to cut out all of our Marines or whatever I mean we need to know that because this is a huge huge amendments can become how the defense budget if he goes through with the sequestration which he says he wants to do so we believe it's only fair that he come up with his own plan and explained that to the American people and they need to know that before the election because this is something that is going to happen if he's forcing the issue and as such American people need to have a transparency that he so you know preaches about all the time and we believe is important and picked particularly in this situation which is defending our country offending our country is the number one it's a constitutional duty at lils they were elected that's the case in writing that you know so with that have any questions about but this did give us a call look forward seeing you next week take care

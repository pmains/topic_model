for senator angus King 600 miles from Washington this is where the rubber meets the road we've been running around with you if you've been on your motorcycle through Maine every weekend during this break you've been talking to a lot of folks people like the ones here at Sunday River what have you heard that surprised you people are still talking about health care and they're still saying thank you for your vote thank you usually when I need people traveling around and sort of how you're doing what's going on you know isn't it crazy in Washington but when they start talking about individual issues like health care that's somewhat unusual thanks for your thoughtfulness I'm working at it you're going to grab kings pushing plenty of horsepower on its Harley at a time when it's usually much slower pace in PC but this August recess has been one headline after another revolving around the president's decisive response the violence in Charlottesville where Cain went to law school have you been satisfied with the president's response to this violence no yes and no cleaner no his first response on Saturday when Charlottesville happened and he said well there's problems on both sides I didn't think that was the right response then I think it was Monday he had a press conference where he said all the right things and then Tuesday he started answering questions and went back to Saturday's they're not fine people marching under the Nazi flag and I think it was a false equivalence that really muddied the issue there's nothing good about bigotry and hatred and anti-semitism these people were chanting you can't replace us with Jews I mean come on the president would say he condemned neo Nazism he condemned the KKK that he did nothing he did on Monday but then on Tuesday he got back into this thing about well a little bit on both sides and and both sides were violent and and sort of tried to make it sound like it was it was equivalent I don't know I think it just it was just he was just talking about what he felt was on the top of his mind you believe that the President believes in some of those views I don't think so I think part of the problem is being president and talking anything you say is policy and I think he's used to just talking you know talking with his friends and and thinking off the top of his head you can't do that when a president you're setting a moral tone for the country you can move market you can start a war I mean you have to be really careful about every word you say and I don't think he gets that so what you need you now number one I think you should stop tweeting we have really of course it is you can just stop it so it's sort of crazy but isn't it sad when being reasonable is a remarkable question Twitter yeah you're going to have a very busy fall after this August recess okay we have three weeks to do a budget and do the debt ceiling can you yes it can be done really seven months and Congress is good course well Congress only operates just like everybody else on deadline so you think given that the pressures at the end of September come and you guys are going to I'm not so sure about the budget the budget could be done we could do a budget in a week it's all that all the preparatory work has been done the question is will the leadership have the will to do it and just get it done the debt ceiling that's a pretty straightforward vote the tax reform realistic in the fall that's something that's very important some surprise it in Trump with some Republicans I think it's going to be very tough there's a reason tax reform hasn't been done since 1986 because it's hard and they're winners and losers and Congress isn't very good at making those kinds of judgments the last two weeks of recess in Maine flying by I can tell you seeing Maine buy motorcycles a very way to go because the phone never rings

last week I shared with you my hope that we were reaching a point where we could see light at the end of the tunnel and this week was in fact the beginning of that light we saw the curve in Texas even in New York and in California began to go in the right direction California is a little behind Texas but Texas has had a whole week of decline what that means in Texas is the governor is beginning the process of putting people back to work and work safely the same in Georgia and other states we in California have to be prepared in days not weeks or months to go back to work in some fashion already we've seen some of our elected officials begin loosening our ability to go to public parks or beaches or other areas and that's a good start but it's obvious that if our economy is to prosper we have to get back to work safely every week people have continued to do the right thing our health care workers have done a great job of dealing with the the victims of covin 19 and that's the right thing and I want to thank them today for the hard work they've done at personal risk for those though that have been laid off some 26 million getting back to work is important for another 26 million or more that are still receiving pay but in fact are not in their workplace that means that we have an unemployment rate that effectively is 30% or more our economy cannot long endure that so as we continue to deal appropriately with limiting the spread we have to plan to go back to work for those who think that we that we can't go back to work let me share a few facts with you we have limited the spread of this disease by places like Costco and Home Depot and your neighborhood grocery store providing antiseptic and other items that in fact have limited the spread and that has worked those same techniques going to be used in the workplace I've talked to economic development organizations chambers and many of our business leaders and they're putting together those plans and those plans need to be executable in the next few weeks for all of us who stay at home but may go out and go to these essential services and see how they're doing it we need to observe and be ready to do the same thing know that appropriately we may be wearing a mask and certainly we're going to be disinfecting areas more often than in the past let me share with you though the reason for hope in addition to knowing that we're in decline we also know more about what the actual mortality rate is now for someone who loses a loved one clearly the mortality rate is too high but let's go over for example the USS Roosevelt because there we had 5,000 naval personnel almost well over 800 of them were infected and only one died and of the more than eight hundred who were infected more than sixty percent were asymptomatic meaning except for the test they wouldn't have known they had it that tells us two things the disease can spread without us knowing it that young healthy populations are at relatively low risk and that in fact if we're going to go back to work we we have to accept that let's remember when you're older or infirmed we're going to have to continue to have special isolation and guard for those people and that's going to be part of the governor and everyone's plan so that those who cannot take the risk do not take the risk but for those of us who are younger and healthy we've got to be prepared to go back to work to that end I will continue working with our business leaders our county executives and and all of the those who have the ability to help plan prepare and execute that and that's going to be this next week so until next week thank you all and stay safe

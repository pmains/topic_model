Thank You mr. chairman guess what question I'm gonna this be a Russian associated question yeah in a deterrence related quite sir on to say on December 23rd of 2016 the Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act in it was a section that required the Secretary of Defense to file a report on just the questions we've been talking about within 180 days which was June of 2017 about the definition of a cyber attack what would be the response it talks about operational authorities what operational authority is delegated to the United States Cyber Command for military cyber operations how the law of war applies the whole whole list of the the the purpose of the amendment which was which was in the law which is in the law was to establish a clearly articulated doctrine of response in this kind of situation I'm asking you as an operator have you been asked have you been tasked with drafting any part of the response to this requirement I've been as well I've been part of the part of the dialogue about responding particularly the operational piece of this in terms of overall responsibilities this is the office of the secretary defense as a responsibility for but I'm asking a sentence are you working on this we're eight months in we're eight months late now I apologize I don't know the specifics of the timelines were you given a deadline saying we need this by June I was part of this I don't remember I honestly don't remember if we were given into I take this one as a action yeah but but here's here's what's frustrating is here we are still talking about this issue when the Congress made a specific instruction to the Secretary of Defense and the president by the way was then required to respond to the Congress within 180 days from that reported that should have been coming in June of 2017 hasn't come so you know we're we're way late and we keep talking about this you and I have been in probably a dozen or 15 hearings on this and we don't seem to be any further ahead than we then we are were before and the problem is you've testified today and I think quite accurately and repeatedly until we have some clearly articulated doctrine of response to these kind of attacks they're going to continue if all we do is try to patch our software and they're gonna continue and and and and you know that and I know that what's it gonna take is it going to take the destruction of the electric grid or the financial system in order for us to finally get to the point of taking this seriously like I said sir there is an ongoing I'm participating in this I just apologize I just don't know the specific timelines yeah and and and I'm not I'm you understand you're an operational guy but you have to understand our you're you're the nearest thing they've got I know my lucky enough to be here today but this this is serious business it's in and well let me let me turn to some little more specific question that I think underlines what what we're talking about here what would happen today if you on your way back to your office got a call and said the US financial system has been taken down all the computers on Wall Street are off the markets are in chaos I don't mean from a policy point of view I've known about what would be the execution who's in charge what would what would what would the results be so DHS would have overall responsibility for the provision of federal support in response to this my role would be help to make sure I understand number one who is the actor so can we identify who did this because if I'm gonna respond I have to know who I'm responding to or what I'm responding to so one of my first questions is cyber command would be let's make sure we understand what's the characterization of activity who's the actor what what did they do who would take the lead who's in charge how did that DHS would have overall response to DHS would be in charge do have you do have you wargame this yes sir and in fact I made it a broad reference it that the finance sector for example the the scenario you posture here I've we've actually undertaken some very good tabletops specifically as I reached out the DHS to the financial sector and look we have got to get down execution level work your team so well that's and and done repeatedly talk about integration of what worries me is that whether anyone is in charge and I guess the follow-up is do we have a serious red team war game process to be sure we're not surprised about how to react when one of these things happens I don't know if I'd use the phrase do we have a serious red team do I is this part of our mission responsibility yes is this something we train and exercise against yes is this something we continually assess looking for indicators of this but I pub activity before it occurs yes well I want to thank you this may be our last time to talk about this and thank you for your your service and your straightforward response always and just leave you and you know I I hope as you leave this job you will leave a memo behind that says we are not adequately prepared we need a doctrine we need it to be publicly available we need our adversaries to know that if they strike us in this room they're going to be struck back and it may not be cyber as you say it may be a whole range of things but right now we're not we have not done that and I deeply hope that this is something you can take on as a kind of exit interview sir thank you thank you mr. chairman

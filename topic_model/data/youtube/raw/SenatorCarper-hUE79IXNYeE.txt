is as well there are state and local governments in one area that continue to be under enormous and unprecedented strain according to the department of labor state and local governments lost i think in just in september alone 180 000 180 000 and without some additional federal support many more jobs are going to to be lost this means that fewer frontline workers like firefighters like ems workers police uh as epidemic continues to sweep through our communities your teachers your bus drivers your janitors in the school school nurses as we try to open safely a recent report cbo confirmed what former governors like senator has said in myself already know from experience and that is that state and local government aid is one of the most effective needs of economic stimulus dr let me just ask if i could for you maybe the first question could you tell us why aid state and local governments has such an a multiplier effect and discuss the importance of these governments for economic recovery please dr schweiber aye yes sir uh senator carper um so our analysis of the assistance for state and local governments uh enacted so far especially in the cares program found that those monies by and large were spent immediately you know not every penny but by and large they were spent quickly and so at a rapid and high um large impact you know additionally the money given to state and local governments headed off or reduced the tax increases and other spending cuts that state and local governments would have had to do so it had an important impact in sustaining demand in that way as well all right thanks so much i want to turn to uh uh control controller general talk a little bit more about improper payments something that he is uh his folks have been on forever uh all over for as long as i can you have to on the homeland security governmental affairs office but uh general daderow and i think in fiscal year 2019 uh agencies across the government made an estimated 175 billion dollars in proper payments up from about 151 billion in the fiscal year of 2018. it wasn't that long ago that number was under 100 billion it wasn't that long ago that number was actually under 75 billion and today we're talking about 175 million in proper payment and further as part of the care zone the terrorist department as you know issued over a billion dollars worth of checks uh 1200 checks to deceased person one of them as i recall being your mom your mother your late mother and uh but uh simply but given our correct physical condition we're in no position to continue issuing these kinds of error payments earlier this year legislation that i co-authored with senator cassidy's colleague from our college from louisiana uh john neely stacy and also a hand from uh rand paul authored the co-author legislation comprehensive uh update to um uh no i'm getting ahead of myself earlier this year that's more recently but earlier this year uh something called the payments integrity information actually signed into law into law it's a comprehensive update to the proper payments law which will divide agencies with the tool provide agencies with the tools that they need to curb improper payments further the stocking and proper payments to deceased people has passed as a separate piece of legislation that's uh passed the senate and now pending in the house that's the one co-sponsored by senator kennedy correspondents by uh senator paul over in the house now and this bill would more widely share the death data available to the social security administration to agencies to help them prevent payments to deceased people um general diderot what actions did the executive branch and congress need to take in the immediate term to address this particular issue and that is important uh sending payments to the deceased person well first uh senator carper i think that the executive branch needs to effectively implement the uh payment integrity information act 2019 that you alluded to this would require a government-wide estimate you know i'm concerned that 175 billion dollars is an understatement because there are several programs like temporary assistance for needy families where there are no estimates made at all also it would require more rigor in doing risk assessments because there are some programs that because of their risk assessment they don't make estimates either and i think that might not be appropriate and also improve the estimates which will allow for these areas to be able to detect what some of the root causes are the problems so that they could be addressed one of the reasons that this is growing so fast uh is because the two largest areas of improper payments are in medicaid and medicare and actually the jump between 150 and 175 billion in the past year or so has been largely due to medicaid for the first time since the patient protection act uh of looking at uh eligibility beneficiary determinations and provider screening to make sure everybody's properly there and so that's why i'm very concerned because those are two of the fastest growing programs in the federal government we need to get on top of that there are some recommendations we made there could be some additional prior authorizations in medicare that would make sure that the payments are appropriate before they're being made that this is demonstrated to be effective and to not harm anybody's care there should be more timely auditing of the medicare advantage program in medicaid the big growth has been in in the medicaid managed care and that has received virtually little scrutiny uh and i think that needs to be more uh rigorously pursued in that area with the help of state auditors which i've been trying to work with uh the center for medicaid medicare studies to get them more involved in this process over time and the legislation that you mentioned um to stop payments to deceased people if we could get uh treasury the proper master filed a more complete master file this can be done very easily which was what was done uh with the stimulus payments once they decided they weren't going to go that route anymore uh they were given temporary access to this file and it stopped it right immediately so those are some of the areas uh thanks for those kind words i uh again with my recovering treasure hat on i have a long time believe the things that were happening

good afternoon my name is Dan de Meyer I'm the Provost of the University of Chicago and today it is my great pleasure to welcome you to our discussion on jobs and the economy with US Senator Mark Warner this is certainly a timely and relevant topic that deserves all of our attention and I'm particularly happy to see so many faculty and students in the audience today thank you for joining us and to take the time to participate in this important event and today's event is organized and hosted by the Becker Friedman Institute for economics or as its affectionately known the BFI it was launched in 2011 to provide a collaborative platform for the large and very diverse University of Chicago economics community with over 250 PhDs in economics working on campus and a whole variety of additional scholars and students engaged in research relating to the economy having an institute that can bring our scholars students and researchers together around the common research topics allows us to coordinate and leverage our work in a way that can have real impact at the University of Chicago as you all know we're committed to rigorous inquiry with impact and the Becker Friedman Institute models this approach in an exemplary fashion by promoting and supporting the highest caliber of economics research while also focusing on the translation and dissemination of that work to policy makers business leaders and other instant interested stakeholders my great thanks goes to Michael greenstone and Eric Hurst for the leadership of the BFI and now I am particularly pleased to introduce our accomplished undergraduate economics student Lindsey Correa who will tell us about today's speaker Lindsey is a fourth year undergraduate here at the college majoring in economics and mathematics she's an active amendment economica you knew Chicago's undergraduate organization for economic and research she has worked as a research assistant and most recently she was a summer intern for uber na mcc's which Uber's economic research team so you can see Lindsay is a real slacker and so let's all welcome her for joining us here today and with that I'll turn the podium over to Lindsay first of all thanks to the BFI for hosting I'd like to introduce our moderator Michael greenstone and our speaker Mark Warner Michael greenstone is a director of the BFI the Milton Friedman professor of economics the college in the Harris school and the director of the Energy Policy Institute at Chicago he has conducted groundbreaking research on the costs and benefits of environmental policy and energy choices credit markets and trends in the changing American workforce professor greenstone was chief economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama and has been a leader in bringing new economic research down from the ivory tower to Washington Senator Mark Warner is the senior senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia he has served in the Senate since 2009 and prior to that served as governor of Virginia from 2002 to 2006 Stanley the Warner is a vice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence and a member of the finance banking budget and rules committees that's both sounder there and as governor senator Warner has demonstrated an understanding of emerging economic issues and has work to find bipartisan solutions to financial reform us deficits minimum wage new business growth and more recently Senator Warner has introduced legislation to encourage skills training for low and middle income workers and separate legislation to explore solutions to the lack of benefits for workers in the gig economy to talk about the challenges facing American workers today we brought together an academic with the strong understanding of policy and the policy maker who has made it a priority to address economic issues please join me in welcoming Michael greenstone and Senator Mark Warner [Applause] welcome senator warner we're pleased to have you here today thank you Michael we're sorry it's not a little bit warmer but we're working on that first just get business out of the way everyone has a note card and theirs will be time for questions at the end and if you have a question right on the note card and will come by and collect it so I was doing a little background research on you not opposition research friendly research we'll see if the question yeah and I noticed that you I had forgotten this I thought you'd been in the Senate longer but you became you became Senator in 2009 the economy was losing at that point in January 2009 700,000 jobs per month today its gaining about 300,000 jobs per month - what would you explain the million dollar a million jobs per month reversal and what role has the federal government played in it or I think actually I remember getting hired November 2008 and my background had been in business as a technology venture capitalist I had been involved co-founder of a company called Nextel and the wireless business had gone off and make him governor and I was aware obviously as I was running for Senate of the financial meltdown but when I got hired and I got put on the Banking Committee and realized how close we had come in the fall and that winner to complete economic collapse it was a little it was a little frightening I will always remember at first being on the Banking Committee we were looking at issues of how we're gonna grapple with this and I asked a couple of good questions a couple guys commitment means fellow senators and said gosh Warner you really get this stuff and I kind of puffed up for a little bit and I thought oh my gosh I understand a little piece but not nearly the ramifications of what we had to grapple with and I actually think that history will treat under both President Bush secretary Paulson and the final couple of months of the Bush administration and those first six months of the Obama administration as well by no means perfect by doing the right thing by having recognizing that the the system was teetering on the brink brink of what could have led to a depression and taking at that point extraordinarily bold steps in terms of bailing out the financial institutions putting in place the stimulus actions I think particularly President Obama having a calming effect with a you know a rational approach some would say to rational approach I could only imagine what would have happened if we'd had our current presidents elected at that moment in time where our economy might have headed and while it took longer than we would have liked you started they see the staunch inge of that of that growth or of those job losses you know within the first six months of the Obama administration on top of that you had obviously with a lot of credit should go as well to Bernanke Tim Geithner on a very much' quantitative easing strategy in terms of multiple monetary policy and all that combined led us to where the economy has recovered now while we're approaching full employment we've not seen and we can get into this as the discussion goes on job growth go along with with the economic recovery at the level that I would like to see and we have this moment in time where in effect you know the whole world's economy seems to be in a bit of sync in terms of moving forward that's the good news the bad news is and what I think is Lindsay was kind of the same warner since he's been in the Senate has been working on fiscal discipline yeah on that category I think I get a d-minus because I was very involved in the efforts to try to grapple with our debt and deficit and if anything I would argue you the loose money monetary policy combined with lack of fiscal discipline which has led our nation to a 20 trillion dollar debt you put that on top of a tax policies that took place in December that I think history will treat is a disaster even though the goals were appropriate where I would argue we we will add about 2.2 trillion of additional debt on that that 20 trillion dollars of debt and I think we are in a sense living on borrowed of time at this moment in terms of the very curious with what happened you you were a leader with a gang of six and throughout your career on fiscal discipline and doing it in a bipartisan way what happened to fiscal responsibility and you know you know the numbers better than I do but I looked it up this morning you know the debt to GDP ratio for basically 50 years was 34 percent it's now 75 percent and then with the tax bill in the spending bill its projected to be in ten years maybe a hundred percent and if some of the things are made permanent maybe even more right and history has always shown any industrialized nation once you get above 80 and shirin above 90 debt to GDP you got a crisis I think that what has happened has been a couple things one we've had you know historically low inflation and we've had this loose money policy for a long period of time and those of us who have been like myself who have been folks saying you know the debt is gonna kill us the debt is going to get us we-we've keep running up this debt and it's not gotten us so far and that that has I think taken a lot of the air out of out of the balloon in terms of being fiscally responsible you've also had the fact that the Republican Party which has been based on a you know let's spend a lot and cut revenues you know America prior to the tax reform effort and in December we were 32nd out of 35 oacd nations in terms of total debt bird tax burden state local and federal combined so we are at the bottom of the barrel in terms of revenues collected in terms of our industrial competitors and after the tax cuts in December we will go even further down yet our spend items particularly around entitlements where the Democrats have refused to acknowledge the math about the fact that we are growing older and that great programs like Social Security and Medicare everybody loves but the math just doesn't work anymore when I was young there were 15 people working for every one person on retirement today there are three people working for every one person on retirement the problem of that is not the politicians fault it's actually the doctors faults because we're living longer that usually it's a little tells an economics crowd here but you know but what we've done is by this spiraling amount of spend that doesn't get contained in terms of entitlement reform and dramatically cutting back on our revenue rote growth means that as a nation if you look at you know the United States government as a enterprise for every dollar you send Washington right now only six cents is spent on education infrastructure and research and development now if somebody was a venture capitalist longer than a politician I would never invest in a venture that spent six percent of its revenues on its workforce plant and equipment and staying headed the competition which again education infrastructure and R&D in a global economy so I think we're living on borrowed time you know and it's been frustrating we're now you know the the fun factoid I like to run by and have to be careful with my factoids again with this group but you know interest rates go up 100 basis points and they will that adds just in additional debt service about a hundred and sixty billion dollars a year per year in additional debt service on that 20 trillion dollar base you know that 160 billion dollars off the top before you pay Social Security before you buy guns and sure cept before you invest in education is more than we spend on defending homeland security and federal department education so I don't think we're on a sustainable business plan but the attitude towards you know all of the efforts to control that with a balance of revenue increases and spending constraint has completely gone out the window matter of fact we've gone the opposite direction so how do you think that happened what is you know there's people like to glorify the past and leave it better than you found it that doesn't seem to be the attitude certainly now what you're describing I think it was what do we owe this the shame this will come as a shock but politicians love to promise I'm gonna cut your taxes yet I'm gonna spend more money and you know and let's again acknowledge this is not a new phenomena you know in the prior two kind of I was very involved in the what was called the simpson-bowles plan which I not while not perfect had a balance of entitlement reform and tax reform that would have generated more revenues I started something called the the Gang of Six in again I work in the only place in America where being a gang members a good thing I'm part of every bipartisan gang there is we had moments in time in the 2010 2011 2012 period and when we didn't act and you know again we did cut the deficit but I work again and the only place in America when we're high-fiving each other that we were only 500 billion in the red for a couple of years that number will go back to a trillion and the red you know I am distinctly worried that the tax bill and then quite honestly as the spending bill of two weeks ago you the spending bill of two weeks ago ended up pushing discretionary spending back up a little bit more to where I think historically it should be but this is again borrowed time and I would even argue I know we may get into this later we hit in this last defense spending bill about 700 billion dollars on defense alone 10x some of our nearest competitors and I'm not sure we even spending it on the right thing but this area of fiscal discipline and I don't think the I think Ludacris growth assumptions that have come out of the administration that says that we're gonna get 4% 5% I mean it's there's I don't think there's any legitimate kana miss to thinks that growth alone is going to solve this problem in terms of our federal spending and federal balance sheet yeah I think the evidence is pretty strong on that I wondered what is there the one thing that BFI really tries to do and that we're going to turn to liver marks in a minute but is take research that's policy relevant or relevant for the real world and kind of make it that just but what are the questions that you think academics are not delivering answers to that would be useful to address some of these questions well I think there would be I think more proof on dollars spent on you know I would argue the three areas we've got a lot of data but the more compelling we can make on spending money on education spending money on infrastructure and spending money on basic research in terms of the payout on that I think would help us I mean moat we all know are we all have our arguments but if there was a way to make that more forward-leaning it would be it would be important one of the areas that I'm that I've tried to flirt audience for the post facts really there I think there may be an audience you know I for one who you know we may get later into the Russia investigation since I know that's the only reason most of you are here but is you know when you point out China's investment levels in artificial intelligence machine learning quantum computing and 5g technology versus ours and you post this in a national security context the one area or you can get politicians to agree to spend is national security so if you will look for example while we've seen some increases in medical research in the last few years actually this last budget we did put a little bit more into NIH but the vast majority of increased medical spend in the last decade has been strangely enough put into the Department of Defense budget because it's a hell of a lot easier to get people to vote for a department offense budget spend than it is to get it to vote for NIH spend now that may not be rational but that is you know that is the reality on the question of revenues you know it is it is it's hard to make the case I mean we are you can show all the data in the world that America's overall tax burden falls in the bottom tenth and now closer to thirty fourth out of thirty fifth after the tax cut but most Americans don't believe that you and we misuse a point in time such as the fact that until the tax reform our corporate tax rate was nominally the highest of the industrial nations in the world the effective tax rate was much lower but the reason why our tax rate on the corporate side was much higher is that every other nation in the world has a VAT or some version of a consumer tax or value-added tax we don't have that that until they've put in place that kind of taxation system their corporate rates were just as high if not higher than ours so the you know the argument you're gonna have to have really good economists to art start making taxation a little more popular but the notion that we can have stuff for nothing you know we've run that streak and remember that coming up to the point of the crisis we'd run 65 out of the previous 70 years on an annual deficit basis so there is no there's no solution set here that says all this is all the Democrats fault or all the Republicans halt there's plenty of mutual blame didn't blame to go along but we are able to sustain that and and we have been able to sustain that until we don't and in the volatility period that we have right now the notion that at some point whether we you know if America's ever question is a reserve currency or people decide that they don't want that our our debt to GDP ratio get so high that people don't want to continue to buy the promise that America is going to pay it's in a rational basis ie our bonds then all hell could break loose hey spike in interest rates makes our current operating system unsustainable now one idea that it floats around at least in the rooms that I'm in in New York Chicago is uh there's a great solution to all of these properties budget problems it's so simple it almost it's almost embarrassing to say it aloud but a carbon tax and that get rid of a bad and help solve the budget problems and I it feels to me like people aren't lining up to support it you think no I think carbon obvious except for the fact that you know listen your carbon tax be part of the mix of the discussion absolutely should we tech should we tax externalities in a rational way and could you do a progressive carbon tax that actually return money to low and moderate income the the two-part answer I give you though is one we've yet to see that instituted you know in a realistic way anywhere in the world and even the Europeans who Bruce Colombia was pretty close well British Columbia is getting there but if you look at where you know if you look at even where some of the Europeans tried to move on on their initial move towards a cap-and-trade system it didn't work out and then cap-and-trade was too easy to be gamed I think a straight carbon tax would be a better solution but if anything you know the country is moving in the opposite direction when it appears the Trump administration is trying to release the auto industry from the cafe standards in terms of the 55 mile per gallon coal and the vast majority of the automakers didn't even ask for that relief so so we'll keep that on the sidelines it's going to check into the game later check well whether it's whether it's a carbon tax whether it's a value-added tax the notion of a of a taxation taxation system that fits us in the 21st century you know is long overdue I mean but remember we are we are in a nation right now in America where we still have been unwilling the tax internet purchases their sales tax the same way we do bricks and mortar now I was an internet guy in a tech guy longer they've been a politician there may have been a reason to give that nascent industry in the late 90s some advantage but that advantage has long since passed and you are basically robbing states who a lot of times k12 and infrastructure Falls to their responsibility more than the feds you are robbing them of an you know one of the few remaining revenue growth areas just by having that that ban on what's called again the Marketplace Fairness Act one thing I want to turn to is it is true that since you've arrived in the Senate the number of jobs per month created has gone up by million a month to which you deserve a lot of credit and but not all Americans seem to have been benefiting in Minh dating further back maybe to 1980 or so and you know there's my colleague Eric Hurst and current Charles just released a paper employment among men aged 21 to 55 has declined by about five percentage points from since 2000 if you have less and high school degree it's maybe 7 or 8 percentage points there's also all the reporting about the opioid crisis dissolution of families single parent the children being raised just by one parent and like visceral pain for lots and lots of American families I know there's something you've thought a lot about I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what some of your thoughts on what we should be doing both for the people who are already post schooling or post traditional schooling and the people who make sure this doesn't keep happening well here's here's my theory of the case I mean and I actually thought this is where I was gonna spend all my time I got rehired to the Senate in 2014 it was a closer election that I expected you my observation was that that what creates a trump war the ascendancy of our bernie sanders on the left is people in a sense losing faith the system we've got is work exactly have that view that that this mass of people is not unrelated to the difficulty of long run planning and we're having a budget that appears kind of rational that a venture capital some think wasn't crazy and i think it's kind of all the same but yeah but here's what I mean I got interested I know we're probably gonna get to this later in kind of early 2015 and what at that point was like the cool new hot thing the gig economy you know and you've got lots of folks here more expert than I on it gig economy is still relatively small as a percentage of a workforce but what is not so small is the fact that starting in the 90s as large firms and I would argue started to take any job that was not core to its purpose and outsource it either literally out sources in terms of moving in abroad or outsourced in terms of taking non core functions and turning them into the independent contractors I mean name me a fortune 100 firm anymore that still has its janitorial staff its kitchen staff or anyone else on the company payroll they've all been on out sourced and what that I would argue part of that is based and I hope we'll get this to another question is it and I say this is somebody who's who's absolutely been a pure beneficiary of our free enterprise system I first of my family to graduate from college Law School went out failed miserably a couple times as an entrepreneur third time was successful in cell phones doesn't better than I can ever expected but I had to tell you a modern American capitalism I don't think it's working for enough people and I think there are a variety of outgrowth of that part of it being the enormous business focus on short termism over long term value creation and there's a whole set of policy changes we could get into there but if we stay on the work force what has grown since the mid 90s to where it is today is the growth of the contingent workforce and we set up a system in the 1930s and 1940s in this country which was a social contract that worked really well for 80 years it was a deal between business labor and government that presumed that once you got a job at one firm chances were you going to stay working in that firm for most of your career my dad worked for the same company for 38 years never made a lot of money but he had relatively security in that job and with that job came health retirement and if we were to lose his job you had unemployment workman's comp disability a silly a series of state-run programs to provide that social safety net starting in the 90s and I would argue partially forced by short-termism as companies took more and more jobs that were non core and outsourced them we've seen this enormous growth in a contingent workforce and post financial crisis that ramped up started going like this now some people have moved into this contingent workforce by choice the flexibility of working when you want or how you want is is is a unique difference that is made possible by technology some of that is being forced by Millennials who don't have that abhor the idea of working for the same firm for 30 years but depending on the data you got anywhere from 20 to about 38% of the American workforce that is working either there is gig part-time independent contractor you know trying to be an entrepreneur themselves doing a start-up and what's happened with that section of the workforce is that they have no social safety net we may be the only industrial nation in the world that really means your social insurance is contingent upon your worker status you got to be a long term w-2 employee so what I've been working on to give to give two examples is I don't think we're gonna go back to the economy where folks look for the same firm for 30 years let's meet the workforce where it's at not getting involved in this backwards looking 20th century labor classification battle between 1099 and w2 and let's recognize we've got to create a portable benefit system so from that first job you get at 16 or 18 some portion of those some portion of your pay would go to you now who runs that portable benefit that's a jump ball I'm not saying it has to be the state I'm not saying it has to the government it could be private-sector it could be FinTech it could be run on your phone but I would argue that part of the disillusionment in our society today is not only based on income inequality but income insecurity because if you are in this contingent work not only do you not have any social insurance but your volatility of your income has gone up dramatically and unless we can create a portable benefit system as well as income smoothing tools for a workforce that I've seen data that says you're gonna go from a third of the workforce in this status to about 50% of the workforce by 2025 the amount of social unease is it going to exponentially rise the second point and then we'll move on but if you accept the premise that nobody's going to work for the same firm for 30 plus years then it becomes and again for a University of Chicago economist crowd you know this is right up your alley there is no rational reason why anyone would invest in upskilling anyone that's a low and moderate-income job because those jobs are the most likely to be eliminated by technology or to potentially be outsourced and if you're not going to work for a long period of time in that position why upskill you whereas historically even if you weren't the world's brightest bulb you've got to work on the line you could bump up on the line up - you're kind of Peter Principle point now that's disappeared so one of the great mistakes amongst many that was made in the in the ridiculous thing that passed is tax reform last year was I would have been happy to give corporates you know maybe not 21 or 20 but a reasonable competitive corporate rate if you would have traded with them the notion that every firm that takes that rate and maybe we all might even give him a lower rate if they would install this a meaningful upskilling and workforce training program because most of what we've done in the past has said it is the public's goal of training you for that first job and we're still not even getting that fully right but I would argue even once you're trained for the first job you're gonna need ongoing training the McKinsey study that said you know there be plenty of jobs even with AI still says 35 to 40 percent of those jobs are radically gonna train change over the next 12 years so we don't put in place an incentive system and I think government would screw this up an incentive system for business to upskill those folks it's not gonna slow down technology or AI but at least try to equalize and for example what we've gotten of that bipartisan legislation on this just as I do in part our portable benefit system that said let's take a very successful tool the R&D tax credit and that tax credit being much more lucrative than a simple tax deduction and apply an R&D tax credit for human capital up growth for people that make frankly I don't have as much I have lots of compassion for you writ large but if you're getting out of University of Chicago chances are you gonna be doing pretty well but why not put in place and a human R&D tax credit for people who make less than $90,000 here and say if you want to get the lower corporate rate put that in place and how you deliver that whether it's through a university whether it's through a community college those are all things we could experiment on but if less we start even if we think about terminology you know I buy a computer that's an asset I can depreciate I spend the exact same money on training someone that falls on my balance sheet is a cost as a liability just start from from accounting to tax if we're gonna make capitalism work for more people again we've got to not get rid of the incentive system around capitalism but at least rebalance human capital visa vie plant and equipment and more traditional intellectual capital Oh terrific now here's the master tricky question related to all this then statistics are most disturbing I find for men rather than women women seem to have understood the signal from the labor market about get your skills no matter how you get them maybe they don't have the benefit of the nuance program you're advocating for but I think the toughest question in all of social science currently is what the heck is going on with men and why are they doing so much worse and anytime I start to think of policy it's very hard because right away I think of some politics can affect both genders and there's something that is not somehow the signals not getting to men you may just want to say it's a great social science mystery that's a really hard question for another I where that is particularly happening it's just proportionally happening in rural America yeah and I think what happened was and I think all of us myself included haven't have been victims of this or have been victims but advocates of this we have so advocated the building of an interconnected world we have so advocated the benefits of globalization we have Sola advocated you know I'm one of the last pro trade folks and think it was crazy for America to get out of the TPP but what we have not and I think as a policy maker we have to acknowledge is we've done a really crappy job of helping people that have been hurt by trade we've done a really crummy job of selling we've shown you can build it in Mumbai and Shanghai we've done a crummy job of showing you can build it in Springfield Illinois or Danville Virginia and I think what we have we have lost our opportunities and again here is where I would put it would have changed the tax well I strongly believe in the notion of repatriation that American tax profits that were caught offshore will be brought back but the deal should have been to Apple if you want to bring a couple hundred billion dollars back fine bring it back I'll give you a really low rate but you've got to be willing to invest some of that capital in areas that have been losers from trade and not winners we disproportionately argue the benefits because the benefits have dis importantly fallen to metropolitan areas and the communities have been left behind have been rural and one of the things you know the promise of an interconnected world was you shouldn't have to move from your hometown to find a world-class job we've not proven that to be a reality so I've got legislation now for example it would take Appalachia which has been some of the hardest areas were some of the most statistics whether it's opioids or male employment that used to be cold and other energy dependent and says you know is there a version of it TV a 21st century TV a I've got some that would try to double the amount of economic development efforts there that would actually require our collaboration between different counties because too often in a lot of rural America the goal is still we're gonna build a shell building and hope for some miracle to happen and a whole bunch of manufacturing jobs to come that's probably not going to be the solution set but I think if you can restore some of that hope and a lot of that hope comes from from jobs it's one of the reasons why I know this is not the topic but let me get this bit into why I'm not a fan of ubi because it sounds like a Silicon Valley dreamed up dreamed up solution for a group of folks who've made a lot of money and then want to transfer transfer the responsibility back to government to take care of everybody because I think there is what we have to recognize is there is not only material sustenance that comes from work but there is value that comes from work and particularly amongst men I would argue more so even than you know [Music] women have you know they're still family raising men still have I think more of a reliance on work from self value and we need to do a better job of creating me helping to create meaningful work I think that is possible I think it's it is hard to challenge the notion of someone who is late career what you're going to do but the people I find in Southwest Virginia in my state Appalachia is that even if they folks have lost hope they want their kids to have the choice to remain in the community they grew up in and frankly the promise of an interconnected world should give them that choice and we have not done near enough to make that a reality okay we're gonna we have some questions that when I from the floor but before that way I thought we should probably talk about the pink elephant in the back of the room the rush investigation your co-leading there is no really pink elephant not a red elephant your co-leading Senate committee that's investigating the election there's the molar investigation I guess the house is now concluded its investigation I you know there's like an endless series of questions and I'll try and just try and turn it into one or two here so the first is what do we actually know at this point among the swirl of everything that has been found out what do we know about what happened in it we here's what we know and here's what we know not just mark corners of Democratic senator but virtually every senator Republican in an independent Republican and Democrat all of the heads of our law enforcement and intelligence community both Obama appointees and Trump appointees even though this is may not be acknowledged by the White House three things we know for sure one the Russians massively intervened in our elections in 2016 they hacked into both political parties and this sometimes is not recalled they hacked into both parties and then they selectively chose to release information to hurt one candidate Clinton and to help another candidate Trump and we should have been more aware of this beforehand and frankly the American government was somewhat caught flat-footed because if you go back as far as 2011 when the Russian equivalent of their chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General get her mouth off basically said Russia could not keep up with the West in tanks trucks ships planes but where they could keep up is in the realm of cyber warfare and misinformation and disinformation they even used terminology like misinformation disinformation spreads like radiation there is no ability to keep it up and the techniques they used in America in 2016 where had been honed in the the Baltic States and an Eastern Europe long before 2016 first the first point second point we know they either hacked into or at least scanned the voting systems of 21 states and one of the most vulnerable being Illinois and what was amazing and almost Kafkaesque from the Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security to start with the 21 states they wouldn't tell the top election officials in the 21 states that they'd been attacked because they said the top election official didn't have the appropriate security clearance there's a week but no hey they did not desert here's what happened she did not change vote totals if it's almost as if they wanted to leave enough digital dust to know that there had been intervention without changing vote totals because you may recall back in the 2016 candidate one of the candidates for president even before the election started to say well he might not accept the results of the election and if there'd been evidence digital dust that elections had been tampered with that candidate might have lord knows done whatever but it was evident that most of our voting systems are extraordinarily vulnerable I made sure we had state elections in Virginia last year we had voting machines that didn't have a paper trail I changed that we made sure we changed out all the voting machines the president if in a normal case you would have had a White House now then after this evidence of our vulnerability in our election system would have created a working group to try to take this on and make it a top security concern unfortunately none of the Trump officials the FBI had the Director of National Intelligence the NSA have been given any direction so we have our Senate Intelligence Committee bipartisan has came up with a series of recommendations make sure every voting machine has a paper trail make sure you've got appropriate security clearances have people share information we had 386 million dollars put into upgrading election security third thing and this is really where things get even more sketchy is we saw you know this whole new creation around social media and on Me State at the front outset you know Facebook and Google and Twitter these are enormous iconic American great companies and they've created a means of communication in social media that unprecedented in terms of its growth and its power of connectivity but what we saw was the use of that social media it's dark underbelly it can be used for good it can also be used for evil so while we at first we thought it was mostly paid advertising the paid advertising is the tiniest point of the Russian intervention what was the most important point was the use and the creation of fake accounts so somebody could say they're Michael from Chicago and it's actually Boris from st. Petersburg and what they would do is they would create these accounts and not they wouldn't mask their political nature it might be you know University of Illinois football or it would be gardening or it would be a host of other issues and then once they solicited people's information and gain followers then they would start seeding it with with with political content let me make two quick points I saw it's time to move to questions won't give you an example they created one site in Texas called secede Texas far right-wing sites saying you know the country's going to hell in a handbasket we should succeed from the Union they created a similar site that said United Muslims of Texas then they created on the Texas secedes exercise they said these Muslims want to bring Sharia law so we need to go down in protest and they set up a protest date at a particular mosque in Houston on the same date they said to the United Muslims of Texas there's a bunch of folks coming down gonna protest we need to protect our faith hundreds of people showed up but for the fact that the Houston Police were there you could have had a tragedy like we had in Charlottesville last year happen in Texas all generated out of at least a single location in in st. Petersburg and the companies are still unwilling to fully come come forward with all the data so for example they use the techniques in America then they went to France and the French were a little bit more weren't as asleep of the switch so Facebook took down 30,000 accounts in France in advance of the French elections they've so far identified only 470 accounts in America that were Russian connected I think there were more and we're just at the outset we also recently had parliamentarians from the UK come in and saying there have been misuse in the brexit vote and what's remarkable is if you add up all the money the Russians spent in the American elections the French elections and the British elections is the cost of one new f-35 airplane take for a moment another data point America just put a seven hundred billion dollar defense budget in place Russia has a sixty eight billion dollar defense budget we're spending 10x yet in the realm of misinformation and disinformation we are behind in the realm of cyber and we haven't even gotten to the threats posed by China this is an asymmetrical conflict that our near-peer adversaries believe is being waged right now and we are not ready we are not prepared and we are still grappling last point I'll make on this is we're still grappling with fake accounts being set up how many of you have heard of deep fake technology deep fake technology will come up you know mm 18 19 and 20 that's where you can put my face on Michaels body appearing in a video and Lord knows what he does in his off hours or if you're a public figure they will if you have more than 20 hours of videos someone you can have a video of me sitting there speaking and my mouth will be moving but the words that will come out have nothing to they'll be my voice but there'll be nothing in terms of the actual words I'm saying so the notion that this is not going to get exponentially worse we're kidding ourselves and unless we can find a way to sort through this and I don't want to kneecap the American companies because right behind them there are twenty five-plus Chinese tech companies all with asset values north of 20 billion dollars many of which do as much if not better at using some of these tools than the American companies so this is a this is in many ways the realm of where the the new security fight will be and I feel that times we're buying them the world's best 20th century military in terms of tanks guns and chips when the conflict is going to be social media and misinformation and insular let me ask one and I'm still in turn for the questions one related question I think part of what disturbs me the most out of recent events is I think one enduring feature of the United States that has served it very well first a couple centuries has been very strong institutions be they the judiciary the press separate branches of government and you know candidly it feels like the they're under attack the fake news the attacking government officials attacking career staff is their real de munition of institutions and what does that mean for you know what should we make it up all that you know democracies don't have to go on forever DeMarre yeah there is no predestination about America's preeminent role in the 21st century just because we earned it in the 20th century and it is cannily it is more frightening than you think when when you know the press a free press has always been viewed as the Fourth Estate when the president United States and his allies wake up every day and denigrate a Free Press in this free then you're interning in in frightening times when you have ad hominem attacks against not just a molar investigation but when you have broad-based ad hominem attacks against the integrity of everyone who works with the FBI or for that matter the very underpinnings of our Justice Department you then end up in an era when individuals start deciding which laws they want to abide by and which ones they don't because if they're all subject to being you know manipulated with or they're fake or there is this deep state then we're in a period of uncertainty unlike anything our countries see I've repeatedly gone tried to go to the floor and talk to my colleagues about you know the red line has to be molar or for that matter getting rid of Rosenstein who supervises Muller or if this president starts pardoning thin family members I can't sit here and tell you where this is gonna end you know our investigation is still open I'm reserving judgment in terms of what level of collaboration cooperation whatever took place I will hold off but the thing that's so frightening is that when you make these comments and undermine institutions and then that undermining is accelerated by foreign entities and the the game plan that Russia is in 2016 other countries and entities can use that it is pennies on the dollar and that is then reinforced by other fake accounts and those fake stories or comments are pushed to the top of your newsfeed newsfeed by automated BOTS then that pervades your thinking and the the intent of the institutions get undermined and once you've done that even when this president is gone the undergirding foundation is somewhat questioned and I believe that there may be times I believe in the next eight our country may be tested unlike it's been in my lifetime and I say that as somebody too old enough to remember you know the the darkest times of the Cold War and reminding myself of the challenges around Watergate and Nixon but there are challenges we could face and I think we're all gonna be have to be called upon what I hope and pray on is that that that most of the people I work with are people of good faith regardless of where their political views fall but at some point we're gonna have to determine whether we are a nation of a rule of law and whether any person is above that law and whether we are a nation that respects our institutions that doesn't mean you shouldn't criticize your institutions that doesn't mean we shouldn't point out there flaws but pointing out flaws or bad actors is different than impugning the integrity of everyone who works in our Justice Department thank you just to cheer you up on a Monday afternoon okay so we have some other questions for you this this is just a perfect universe Chicago question for you it's from the floor as a recovering entrepreneur what has led you to think government can allocate capital more efficiently than the private sector in seemingly all areas of research it's a great that's a classic Chicago Chicago question yes um well I let me first of all start with them the basic market is always right presumption I think the market is right most times if you fully baked in all our externalities you know if you bake in the cost of carbon to our atmosphere you make it in then the market would respond appropriately I think the market is oftentimes right when it over depending on what time horizon you know if my time horizon is only the next quarter and trying to get that extra two cents that I promised Wall Street then where when will I ever invest in human growth or infrastructure or research and develop because they by nature are not short-term based returns so if we get the the market fully adjusted on it on the right time horizon you know it is we say on a corporation of corporation is a is a creature of the state there is no such thing as a corporate entity without a state and charter maybe the state charter needs to say a corporate responsibility and fiduciary duty is to not only shareholders but stakeholders and maybe there needs to be a redefinition of a fiduciary duty so does the government always get it right on Rd absolutely not but what we've have seen in the last 20 years and since the decline of the Bell Labs and others we've seen a dramatic decline in basic research for market sizes and it's all been pushed to the public sector so there's a strong case for public sector yeah but but that's where I get upset with something the market only solution if the market was going to bear the full cost of development if the market was going to bear the full cost of human capital development then that would be fine but what I find particularly from some business is this let's push everything that's long term on to the public's responsibility and at the same time an effort to starve the public of the resources it needs to do that basic job okay next I'm going to sneak in two more before we start getting a look yeah which country did better or is doing better or will do better in the tariff battle between the US and China and I had a trade question too but I think all the UH I generally think and should we be engaging then I brought in a question a little bit should we be engaging is there anything wrong with trade with China like no I would argue that the trade battles usually end up with more losers than winners but I would also argue because we've failed to have a cyber doctrine of response you know we knew what the rules of the road would be in chemical warfare and landmines cyber we've not so we have had for a decade plus in particularly visa vie China enormous theft of intellectual property we've had a willingness of America companies to go in they've been so seduced by the size of the Chinese market they've been willing to do joint development and give up the family jewels in ways they would never do to enter into any other nation and we have in the sense of many of the Chinese tech companies a willingness for them to collaborate with the Chinese government is we know what many of the Chinese tech companies are now doing is they are creating because there's not the equivalent of financial credit in China they are creating social credit that monitors you all of your behavior to the point of how well you are how good you are at being loyal to the regime so I think they're operating that wholly different set of rules and if I was going to pick a challenge to fight back on China would be it would be around intellectual property it would be around technology it would be around recognition that that they we need a a willingness to actually occasionally cyber punch back we've been so afraid of using any of our cyber tools because of our technological advantage I mean New York goes dark for 24 hours into crisis Beijing and until recently goes dark for 24 hours it's a problem but with but it has been basically a free lunch to come at that come out of American intellectual property the last decade plus and that's where I put my efforts okay now this is a last question of the day I think it's a good one to end on reflects our undergraduates as someone who can live and work pretty much in any country do you think I parentheses 21 years old obviously not me should move to another country like China India or some other place why should I stay United States I think the if that's not a softball for Paul listen I think you know one thing I have enormous respect for China at this point there is an organized plan there is a plan and a kind of a rowing in one direction then you know that does not exist in the same fashion here today what you have to give up in terms of intellectual freedom liberty the ability experiment the ability to take risks you find nowhere else with all the challenge we got I wouldn't bet against our country on on any basis but to maintain that I would ask you here's my here's my three asks of you guys one is as much as you when the news comes on probably many of you at this point want to throw a shoe at the TV I feel the same way and I'm inside the TV but don't tune out because if you tune out and say to hell with all the politics and being involved all you do is turn the keys over to the extremes and the one thing our history had they screw this country which is different than India or Russia or China or most other countries we for our you know 270 odd years have been basically we go back and forth we've kept it relatively down the middle and and we don't veer from extreme to extreme and our countries the whole front premise was based upon the need to compromise and what I see increasingly in politics are people who believe their side has a monopoly on truth and patriotism so it asked you please not to tune out second thing and this one's actually even a little bit harder although with a bright bright group like this it shouldn't be that hard just because somebody says they read it on the internet doesn't mean it's true and I mentioned that because it's like when we allow garbage out and not call on it when we allow actions of politicians or false information of misinformation to go unchallenged we put one more in that armor that holds up the edifice that holds up our society and the last thing is on this is more on the political front you know I would argue that we want people to get things done the biggest difference between being in business and politics is in politics you know you can have your whole career and just be against something in business used to get measured by what you get done and I argue if we want to get stuff done we've got it then reward people of goodwill in both political parties so that means occasionally getting out of our own political foxholes and yes that means if you're a Democrat vote for a Republican if she's willing to do something around financial responsibility about paying for rather than saying everything's for free and if you're a Republican vote for a Democrat is willing to acknowledge that our entitlement programs are not sustainable until we reward good behavior from elected officials who will actually want to put country first then I'm then you're going to get more of what passes for political debate and most of the political debate we have right now is totally caught in the twentieth century when the challenges that you're facing your students and professors is how we do forward leaning and our country is at its best when we're forward leaning thank you all very much [Music] [Applause]

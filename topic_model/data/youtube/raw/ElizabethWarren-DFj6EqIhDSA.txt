hi i'm elizabeth warren and this is bailey and we know there are a lot of kids at home right now who are missing their friends and missing their teachers so we decided to make a video just for you let's hear what your questions are [Music] hi hi there senator ward nice it's nice to meet you when can i see my nana and papa again did we miss them i miss them i love you bye hi linus it's nice to meet you too i know it's hard not to be with your nana and papa they love you very much and they miss you but right now we're trying to keep everyone safe we're trying to keep you safe and we're trying to keep your nana and your papa safe too so the best way to see them right now is to do it over the computer or over the phone and just tell them over and over and over how much you love them i know they'll love to hear that too right bailey that's what people like to hear yeah let's hear our next question the caring virus is making me feel disconnected from my family's friends and teachers i also have a question the question is when do you the scientists and the government think the current virus is going to end that's a really good question mia and the truth is nobody knows exactly how long it's going to last so there are two things to do the first keep yourself healthy wash your hands a lot stay inside and if you do go out wear a mask and the second is try to make this time work that means do your school work read books but also stay in touch stay in touch with the people who aren't in your house people who may miss you and people who would love to hear from you because together that's how we're going to make it through this and we are right bailey absolutely uh i miss my friends in quarantine it's just not the best way to hang out with people over face time and just seeing their faces and hearing their voices so how long do you think the quarantine is going to last and when it does get lifted is there going to be any like restrictions it's good question liam like i said i don't know how long the virus is going to be around and how long the quarantine is going to last we know that before we can lift it we've got to make sure that most people are going to be safe that's the key thing um and i think it is like that when it gets lifted there will still be some restrictions some people who may not be able to go out when people do go out they may need to wear masks it just depends on what happens day by day and week by week i know that's a hard answer especially when you miss your friends but you know when you make the best of it when you talk to your friends however it is you communicate with them it makes a difference and if you keep yourself safe then we're going to be able to get through this a lot faster hang in there liam bailey and i are glad to hear from you and so send us your questions and in the meantime stay safe right bailey all right [Music] you

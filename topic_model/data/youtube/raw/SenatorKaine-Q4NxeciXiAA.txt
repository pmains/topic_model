Thank You mr. chair and again to the witnesses appreciate congratulation for your nomination governor brownback you you are supported by a number of people I really care about and respect and you are suited for this position in many ways I do have a couple of concerns and so let me just jump right to him in 2015 you issued an executive order retracting an 8-year executive order in Kansas that provided protection in the state work force against adverse employment action on the ground of sexual orientation describe why you did that that was an order that created a right by the executive branch that wasn't available to other people and it wasn't passed by the legislative branch I believe those sorts of issues should be passed by a legislative branch do you commonly issue executive orders what's that do you commonly issue as governor executive orders some but not isn't that isn't that kind of the point of an executive order issue an executive order on something that the legislature hasn't passed if it was clearly in statute you wouldn't need to issue an executive order yeah but if it's this is a foundational issue that you were creating a right for state employees that wasn't available to the rest of the people in the state and also my's that's not that was a bad to get state employees that right what I just I believe you these sort of things ought to be passed by they ought to be passed by the body I have one that feels like you ought to create and have the law passed itself can I ask you this answers why we did that is is the governor of Kansas as the governor deal appoint cabinet secretaries I do do a point agency heads most not all but I do and in do you take those appointments seriously interview people to make sure they're competent honest that they can do the job well to best of my ability you feel like you have high standards and the people that you appoint yes wouldn't it be appropriate in terms of setting a standard for your workforce for your cabinet secretaries and agency heads for you to say to them I don't think you should discriminate against people on the grounds of their sexual orientation if you're hiring for honesty if you're hiring for competence wouldn't that be an appropriate thing that the governor is the chief of a state personnel operation would would want to know about leaders in state government I think it would be a rational thing I just don't think it's a right that the executive branch should create without the legislative branch when I was governor the first day I did an executive order that protected people in a variety of ways including on the grounds of sexual orientation first order I signed about ten minutes after I was inaugurated in Williamsburg and I had an attorney general who made the same point to me he said well the legislature didn't do this and I said but I'm hiring agency heads and cabinet secretaries who are administering say government and I think as the chief executive one of the things I want to know about them is that they will not discriminate against employees can't you see that the retraction of an executive order like this that had been placed for eight years sends a message that that is not a value non discrimination against folks on the grounds of sexual orientation that's not a value that you share I don't think it sends that message and furthermore as being the Ambassador on religious freedom I look forward to working with people working with you working with everybody regardless of their ideas or views on how we can advance the agenda of religious freedom there may be differences on other topics there are differences that ambassador Saperstein and I have on other topics let me connect it to religious screen the beautiful this topic has been that people we tend to focus on what bipartisan things are that we agree upon and I pledge to you to do that in this role as ambassador for religious freedom let me connect you to continue the work that ambassador Saperstein religious freedom are you aware that there are countries around the world where you can be imprisoned and even executed if you are LGBT I believe that's correct do you see and are you also aware that in some of those countries the asserted justification for criminal treatment of people based on LGBT status is a religious justification that's what's cited as the justification for the criminal punishment of people who are LGBT I had a lengthy conversation yesterday with Randy Berry who worked with ambassador Saperstein our administration who has Kansas roots as as you do some as well and we had a good conversation about how these two offices work together and I don't see doing anything any different than what they work together on for as large the topics too that wasn't really my question but that really is the point is there is there any circumstance under which religious freedom can justify criminalizing imprisoning or executing people based on their LGBT status well I agree with what Randy Berry did around the world on that topic I'm not fully briefed on the various in the specifics but what he basically did described to me yesterday and the work they did back and forth with ambassador Saperstein I would I wouldn't see changing okay but let me just I'm gonna close just with this question I'd like an answer to this question is there any circumstance under which criminalizing imprisoning or executing somebody based on their LGBT status could be deemed acceptable because somebody asserts that they are religiously motivated in doing so I I don't know what that would be in what circumstance but I would continue the policies that have been done in the prior administration and working on these international issues i I really would expect an unequivocal answer on that but my time is up

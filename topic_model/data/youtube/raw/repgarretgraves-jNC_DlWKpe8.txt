hurricane season is just five days away as we head into what noaa is expecting to be a very active season the new orleans area is safer than ever before thanks to a flooding risk reduction system wdsu's lee southwick joins us from the surge barrier with more the new orleans hurricane and storm damage risk reduction system is officially complete it was a huge project that took many years and it involved multiple agencies local leaders and state leaders it was very expensive 14.5 billion dollars but they say it was worth every cent it's worth it to me because 1500 people lost their lives from hurricane katrina that number should have been zero and and so how much are those lives worth how much is the saving that personal just just loss and destruction to families all across this region secondly those people who say we can't afford to do this have no idea what they're talking about we spent 150 billion dollars of federal taxpayer funds responding to recovering from picking up the pieces after hurricanes katrina and rita in 2005. so people who say i'll say it again people who say we can't afford to do it they don't know what they're talking about we can't afford not to this is one of the best investments you can make as taxpayers construction on the risk reduction system is complete but it will still need to be maintained and improved upon in the coming years as a matter of fact just last week we authorized an additional 1.8 billion dollars to further strengthen to further raise further improve this protection system for the five parishes saint bernard plaquemines new orleans st charles and jefferson this is a great investment it's one of the best protection systems in the world it's the best system we've ever had in this region and we're going to keep making investments building on the lessons learned that this works hurricane season starts next week and the new orleans area is now more protected from flooding than ever before i'm confident this system is going to perform as it's intended to perform in new orleans lee southwick wdsu news

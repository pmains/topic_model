um and that I'm inspired by the man I'm inspired by the the effort so you describe here today but what I'm not inspired by are these numbers in a in a country in a world where we in the United States have less than five percent less than five percent of the world's population we've recorded more than 25 percent of the world's deaths from covert 19 I like I have a friend you asked me how he's do any I says compared to what and I'm just say I just want to compare the u.s. to what and we're 117 thousand and Counting New Zealand 22 Singapore 25 Taiwan 7 Australia 102 Canada 7800 South Korea 274 Germany 8800 Japan 916 China I don't know that I believe these numbers but with on 1.4 billion people there reporting less than 10,000 death even if you double that it's still only 20 and the thing that I have a hard time getting my head around in understanding is how by comparison do our deaths have they reached these kind of staggering numbers by comparison to these other nations I've just mentioned and I'm not a real partisan guy but I'm just going to share with you what maysun partisan but it's the truth and I want to use these words from our president February 28th 2020 is what he said he says it's going to disappear one day it's like a miracle it will disappear that was February 28th 2020 March 6 the president's words anybody that wants a test can get a test that's what the bottom line is really March 6th here's March 10th the same president he said this was unexpected and were prepared and we're doing a great job with it he added and it will go away just stay calm it'll go away March 24th we've never closed down the country for the Floop so you can say to yourself what is this all about in May 20th when you say that we lead in cases that's because we have more testing than anybody else I don't look at that as a bad thing I look it as a badge of honor that just flies in the face of the truth you've been asked and handed an incredibly difficult challenge incredibly difficult challenge and if truth be known it's because we were really late how to the starting gate realizing what we faced and addressing it right up front right up front fellow used to be the head of the General Motors used to say leadership is staying out of step when everyone else is watching to the wrong turn well the people that you have to lead have had too much a lot faster because of the lack of leadership that we had in February in March into April so I just want to thank you I Hercule an effort to try to get us out of this out of this crisis finally and we're not there yet but because of your efforts will be will be someday

well thank you first of all congratulations to Jeremy and to all of you for getting to the end of dinner and the conference everybody loves to come and talk on the stage after dinner right senator Mitchell that's right that's that's a specialty of our politicians so I I think we're all in good hands with Senator Mitchell tonight uh I figure we might as well jump right out of the ballpark while you're eating your dessert and start with the T word it hasn't gotten that much attention this evening but yes I'm talking about Donald Trump just the other day of course when he announced his strikes in Syria he had he had a comment that I wanted to read to you about the prospects for peace in the Middle East it was not a super optimistic comment he said no American no amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East it's a troubled place it's a very troubled place so is America out of the peacemaking business or is this just a temporary dieter sir I don't think we can or will be or should be out of the peacemaking business but before I go further I want to join in congratulating Jeremy all associated with J Street on your 10th anniversary secondly I want to note that by my count I am the eighth speaker this evening so I feel like czars are gerberas eighth husband on their wedding night I know what to do but I began dif I know how to make it interesting but on the theory that although everything's been said not everyone has said it and so I'll be glad to give you my thoughts on the question back the United States is the dominant world power will be as far into the future as humans can see indeed I think contrary to much current commentary notwithstanding the nationalistic views of the current administration I believe that the next several decades will see an expansion of American influence an increased spread of culture other forms of internationalism in our by our country because it is in our national interest the international regime established in the aftermath of the Second World War led by the United States created a period of relative prosperity relative democracy if I greater than had existed in the world prior to that time a long way to go to universal success in any area and although the world is a very dangerous place the fact is that by the most important metric human lives the world is now much safer than it was in past centuries in the 20th century in a world in which the total population was a third to a half of what it is now 100 million people died in conflict there are too many deaths now but there in the dozens the hundreds and the thousands we have to do our best to advance democracy and our interest the president takes the view that treaties and alliances and agreements with other countries harm the United States because we don't quote we don't get anything out of them the fact is treaties alliances have been extraordinarily beneficial to the United States because we do get enormous benefit from them we derive tremendous health from helping others and and let me get to the Middle East we have a vital national interest in a stable Middle East in many respects first we have an unshakeable commitment to Israel's security the right to exist behind defensible borders we can best serve that interest by having a presence in the region secondly although we all know that the world must in the coming decades transform to a carbon-free economy under the most optimistic of scenarios that will take decades maybe longer and in that time they continued steady flow of petroleum and natural gas from the Middle East remains vital to a fully functioning world economy less to us because we've had a huge increase in our own production and thirdly and finally we do well where democracy does well I reject the notion that it is somehow wrong or arrogant for us to encourage and promote others to pursue the same democratic values that we want and that the proof of the pudding is one of the great problems in the world today is the large movement of people across national borders fleeing their countries looking for freedom and up in other places and I'm constantly reminded by questions from sometimes hostile audiences who say we're in decline in China's rising that when is the last time you heard of anyone trying to break rest their lives trying to break into China well it happened four years ago two guys escaped from a North Korean concentration camp and they swam the river into China yet one of our greatest problems one of the greatest problems in Europe is the flood of people coming and they don't they don't risk their lives to come here because we have the best cruise missiles they come here because what they see is freedom and opportunity the same thing that led the grandparents and great-grandparents or everybody else here in the world and that's our great strength I can see and I'm glad to know that you're still an optimist senator I think to be a politician is an optimistic thing to be a peacemaker is an even more optimistic profession so glad to see that you're in the right profession but let's talk a little bit about where this two-state solution lives today it's it's an object of catechism in in this group yes it is it is something that you very much believe in but we've been talking really for the last decade about whether the two-state solution is dead or merely on life support so I'd like to know first of all you know where your view of it is right now is it in temporary suspension and life support because of the Trump administration or do those poll numbers that Senator Durbin was telling about us about suggests that this is a long-term trend away from this as being politically possible anymore it is a long-term trend and it's as disturbing trends about a year and a half ago I published a book precisely to make the argument that the only realistic solution is the two-state solution and Israel secured behind defensible borders the with people free of the fear and anxiety that so much dominates their lives and a Palestinian state independent sovereign non militarized that does not pose a military threat to Israel now it is a fair subject for criticism because it's been around for a long time and it has been achieved but what I and my co-author did in the book was to carefully analyze the alternatives and when you analyze them neither of them and it's basically a one state solution or a a sort of status quo extended and neither of them can produce a desired result both of them will inevitably have adopted end in a huge and violent outbreak and the only possible answer is a two-state solution as the type I've described and so I wrote the book to try to stem the tide that Victor have been mentioned and to try to reverse public opinion it is noteworthy in his comments that a plurality still supports a two-state solution in Israel somewhat less so among the Palestinians but I think once you get into a serious negotiation with a prospect for success in Northern Ireland where over a span of five years I shared three separate sets of negotiations very difficult we had 700 days of failure and one day of success and you just celebrated the 20th anniversary just last week four days before we got the agreement a public opinion poll appeared on the front pages of every newspaper in Northern Ireland and it showed that 83% of the people believed no agreement was possible seven percent believed it was possible ten percent had no opinion they had gotten they had been let down so often they were super cautious and somewhat negative in their attitudes and I believe that's the case with respect to a two-state solution if you had a serious negotiation with the United States deeply involved and there were some prospect for success I believe those numbers would reverse themselves well that's a really interesting point the events in recent months would suggest though that you're moving in the opposite direction do you think that the unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as the capital by the Trump administration has made it less possible to have the kind of real negotiation you're talking about for decades the policy of the United States has been in favor of a two-state solution to be achieved by direct negotiation between the parties themselves with American support and in pursuit of that policy we have adopted certain principles the first is that issues will not be decided outside of the negotiations the so-called final status issues and that neither party nor the United States will predetermine those issues until the negotiation begins president Trump has said he wants a negotiation and he's keeps and he's going to get the best deal ever out of that negotiation now with respect to moving the capital Jerusalem laws is will be forever the capital of Israel there is no doubt about that nobody questions that the only question is will there be in East Jerusalem a Palestinian capital of a Palestinian state so the president's defenders are rhetorically correct in saying all he's done is recognize an existing fact but in fact what he's done with it what I believe to be an unwise and premature decision has made getting negotiation started and getting an agreement in negotiation far more difficult than it was in the absence of that and the significance of it is the two groups that have been the most outspoken in favor of the decision are or are the very right-wing in Israel including many in the government who are publicly opposed to the ever being a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Hamas because both of them don't want this to end with a two-state solution and so I think that for many Israelis of course they see it as a welcome thing because it recognizes of what they know to be the real the true capital of Israel but it makes achieving the ultimate goal far more difficult and therefore was my judgment unwise so you and I know we're talking a little bit beforehand and you actually have some surprising views about why there are actually some positive developments in the region when it comes to the positive Roz there are I I do a lot of speaking and a lot of interviews and I'm often asked well what do you think about Jared Kushner being over there and being negotiated my answer is I hope and pray he succeeds and the fact is that probably more important than the identity of the American representative are the circumstances in the region there are many moving in a very negative way we can see of course the tremendous upheaval and convulsion occurring within Islam the the divide between Sunni and Shia which existed for 1400 years was not a political at a religious difference it was a political difference a fight over power between two groups on the death of the Prophet Muhammad over 1,400 years that's had periods of remission and then intense conflict that's now very intense spreading but there are other countervailing factors I believe that the Arab leaders the leaders of the Muslim world are increasingly coming to recognize and to accept that Israel's theatre State the statement by the crown prince soon to be king of Sarajevo recently was significant something that their leaders would say in private but never before in public well do you think Donald Trump should get credit for that he thinks he should get credit for that well you tell me anything that he doesn't think he should get credit but seriously you you were President Obama's envoy to the region I'm sure you've you've looked back on this for whatever complicated reasons there was a feeling in Israel you look at the numbers this is one of the only countries in the world along with Russia by the way where Barack Obama is less popular than Donald Trump that it's gone in the opposite direction why do you think that is and did that hurt the prospects for peace well III think respectfully in your question you stated a few facts but didn't state all of them the fact is that the only two countries in the world in which Trump has a favorable rating yes and that's Israel and Russia President Obama had a favorable rating in the vast majority of countries in the world so I think though no absolutely that's the constant yeah that's the full context well the reason is obvious I mean he's doing what the current government wants and what their people think there's helpful things about reason for that I suspect that his ratings are plummeting in Russia right now but we don't know that and I don't know what there was a outcomes gonna be in Israel but but I think it's pretty clear so you're talking about the broader picture in the region and a new openness of some kind for the Sunni Arabs to possibly recognize Israel how do you think that would actually affect the ability to make peace with the Palestinian Authority with Abu Mazen do they really have the ability to someone like Mohammed Ben tell them and have the ability to influence the process inside yes think about this fact the highest priority foreign policy of the government of Israel is to resist the drive hegemony by Iran for control primarily of the petroleum resources of Persian Gulf but political controls throughout the region there's nothing new about that you go back 2,500 years to Greek history and it's a struggle between the Greek city-states and the Persian Empire for control of the eastern Mediterranean every country seeks to exert influence in its own region and we should not be surprised that Iran being one of the largest countries in the region seeks to do that we have to resist them now the same foreign policy objective that Israel has is also the highest foreign policy objective of Saudi Arabia and most of the Gulf Arab states in a quote normal political circumstance to countries who have the identical objective in the same region would cooperate actively to attain that objective that doesn't exist now there were some private talks underway they get along much better they don't have the public exchange of negative comments but there isn't the over cooperation you would accept a because in part the Palestinian issue it isn't like the Arabs really care about the Palestinians but it is an overwhelming political issue for them and keep in mind it isn't just the Palestinians it's Jerusalem Palestinians have independent authority to make a deal with Israelis on all subjects on their own except the Jerusalem Jerusalem is a Muslim issue and it requires the approval of asylees Egyptians the Jordanians the Moroccans and many people in the Muslim world so there is a basis for a common some common security arrangements as they both try to resist the drive for Germany originating in Iran the the Arab states as part of the Sunni Shia and the ancient hostility between Persians and Arabs and Israelis because of the direct threat to their existence and on that next to the last point most Americans underestimate the ancient hostility between Persians and Arabs when Saddam Hussein went to the gallows and the noose was placed around his neck the last words he spoke were damned the Persians it's a tremendous hostility their Augmented intensified by religious differences but independent of them as well well so let's talk about the Iran deal Senator Durbin talked a little bit about this but we're facing this deadline very soon in in may may 12th yes it's it's a self-imposed deadline in many ways all indications are that the president's new national security team agrees with him that the array intent was not a good deal and that he should do what he can to abrogate it is there as you put your negotiator hat on is there any way for the Europeans to figure out a way to work with political figures here in Washington and actually convince Trump to save it what would you do if you were in the middle of this negotiation well first the context the United States led the world into the nuclear age and for the past seven decades has led a worldwide effort to restrain the dissemination of nuclear weapons with considerable success there are dozens and dozens of countries in the world today who possess the capability to produce ninja weapons but who refrained from doing so in riots upon the United States and the nuclear non-proliferation regime created under the leadership of the United States it's a remarkably successful story a brief digression of the many disturbing statements that were made by President Trump during the campaign the one that disturbed me the most frankly and that to my the best my knowledge has never been modified or reversed is when he said it might be a good thing if Saudi Arabia Japan and South Korea got nuclear weapons I cannot imagine a policy more destructive to the national security in seas the United States or instability around the world now yes he what he has he has her but he hasn't reversed it either well thank God for small things now with respect to this agreement first it was not an agreement just between the United States and Iran it was the United States Russia China Germany Britain and France versus Iran it was the sanctions which drove Iran to the table the reason the sanctions were effective is because they were universal we have a long history of sanctions in our country one time when I was Majority Leader's someone toted it up for me and we had half the world under sanctions most of the time they don't work because the unilateral although US sanctions unilateral still have some effect they do not have the coercive effect of universal sanctions so as other speakers have noted those who oppose the nuclear arms the nuclear treaty said oh well just reimpose the sanctions and they'll come crawling back well as Senator Durbin pointed out we couldn't reimpose the sanctions because the other five countries publicly stated they would not reimpose the sanctions if the agreement were rejected so we then go from universal sanctions which were effective to unilateral extensions which would not be effective so the idea that you could have got a better deal is frankly doesn't hold any water now is it perfect of course not it's a compromise does it last for all time No one of its weaknesses but it is indisputable that Iran has changed its course and its policies and is in compliance with the agreement and as it seeks to extend its domination of the region it is far less effective without a nuclear weapon than it would be had they achieved a nuclear weapon there's only two ways to keep a country from getting a nuclear weapon by negotiation and agreement or by war and if in fact that agreement is abrogated we're going to be confronted with that decision and will we then having withdrawn from the agreement we will then place ourselves in a position of great difficulty in organizing the international coalition necessary to prevent it through armed conflict so talking about deals you've had a lot of time to think back at your own moment as a would-be Middle East peace maker as you think about where we are now talking about the potential of war with an actual war in Syria with the two parties not only not talking to each other but not looking like they're going to be talking to each other anytime soon do you think there was any chance to have done things differently in the Obama administration was there a moment that you look back on and you say you know if we'd only spent another hour in that meeting if we you know what were the or the hinge points that you think about late at night when you're thinking back to your turn I think if I had a little more authority we might have gone further but the I was in the room in September of 2010 along with Secretary Clinton with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas I'd spent dozens maybe hundreds of hours with each of them separately and I came to the following conclusion their societies are divided on the question we've all heard all that we heard the statistics earlier and we've discussed them so any political leader about to enter into momentous negotiations affecting the life and future of their society knowing that the slightest compromise will arouse the hostility of half of his society knowing also that in order to get an agreement there has to be compromise has to have some sense of confidence that it will be worth it that we can do it and get an agreement and in the case of these two leaders it's completely lacking now is it what I'm bout to say speculation on my part is based on many hours of personal discussion much study in the subject I believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu thinks that Abbas does not have the personal or the political strength to enter into the kind of agreement needed and most importantly to implement it and therefore he's got to ask himself why am I going to go through this one I know it won't work because of him Abbas I believe reaches the same conclusion for a different reason he doesn't trust Netanyahu he doesn't believe a word he says and he doubts Netanyahu's commitment to the two-state solution and cites did cite to me personally he was against it he was forward he was against it he was for it and now he's for it sort of and so he believes that they can't ever reach an agreement because Latino doesn't really want one he wants only to placate the United States and therefore why should he endure not just the political heat but the tremendous personal threat to his own life and safety that would come with reaching an agreement and therefore they both seek to create the impression that they want negotiations when in fact they're staying away from them now it will take maybe new leaders maybe a change in heart maybe a change in circumstance but I believe it will happen because I believe that societies like individuals ultimately act on self-interest and it takes a while sometimes to figure out your self-interest the voters in Kentucky and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin are now finding out how their self-interest is being served and so I think that the people of Israel and the people of the Palestinian people and at some point some leaders are going to figure out this is in the best interest let me describe to you one of many conversations I had with Prime Minister that you know I tried to make the case for the two-state solution he made the sensible argument look these the states are collapsing around us and this was in the early stages of the so-called Arab Spring much worse now he said if we create a state it could collapse and with have Hamas right on our doorstep and that's a serious thing you can stand on the West Bank with a shoulder fire rocket and hit Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv my answer was it is far more likely that the Palestinian Authority will collapse in the absence of an agreement then as a consequence of an agreement and you can see that happening today as the the standing of a bias in the post and if R is declining among his people and the single most important reason is they think he's an enforcer of the Israeli occupation because of the intense security cooperation that still goes on to this day when when you recall when corporal Saleem was kidnapped but Hamas made a raid on Israeli territory killed two Israeli soldiers and captured one and it became a huge symbol of national concern within Israel and so for years the Israeli government negotiated with Hamas through Egyptian and German mediators and they finally negotiated an agreement 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for core partially I begged the Prime Minister give some prisoners to Abbas give some prisoners to them that there's about 12,000 Palestinians at all times in Israeli prisons that rotate in and out so they have a stock there and I said to him give about some prisoners because if you don't the message to not just the Palestinians but to the whole Arab and Muslim world we the only thing that works is violence Hamas comes in commits an act of violence kidnaps a soldier and you give a thousand people are from Abbas for whatever his faults and weaknesses and they are many has for 25 years stood up and said we are opposed to violence we accept Israel's right to exist we honor prior agreements and he has pursued a very aggressive internal policy of suppression of Hamas when I was over there one of the constant complaints I got were from these NGOs and international good'cause groups who complained about the harsh that the Palestinian Authority was handing out to Hamas arrests detention without charge because they cycle them in and out - you know they let him and arrested him in the front door they let him out the back door and so that can't go on forever well senator your point I think it's really well taken that it's not so much the terms of the deal that were the issue when you faced it it was the politics and the politicians who would make it and if you didn't have the politicians who had the strength to make the deal they weren't going to make the deal well that's exactly right so what I was going to say is we're getting the red light we know you've been a very wonderful and patient audience senator my guess is the group would like to recruit you as an American mediator and call you back into our divider [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

Hello, I'm United States
Senator Joe Manchin. During this season of
giving and reflection, Gayle and I are reminded
of the importance of family, the source of
life's greatest joys and deepest bonds. Thanks to
the resilience and innovation of the
American people, our country has led the
world in the creation of multiple safe and
effective COVID-19 vaccines, allowing West
Virginia families to safely gather together
this holiday season. I encourage any and every
West Virginian who has not received the
COVID-19 vaccine and booster shot to protect
themselves, their loved ones and their community
by getting vaccinated. Despite the challenges
we face this year and the ongoing COVID 19
pandemic, we have so much to be grateful for.
We are blessed to have a beautiful state to call
home and the knowledge that we are truly a
resilient statewide community who looks out
for each other during good times and bad. My
parents taught me that if you can count your
blessings, you can share your blessings. Gail and
I encourage all West Virginians to join us in
praying for the safety of our fellow West
Virginians, frontline workers, health care
professionals, servicemembers and
Veterans and thanking them for their service
for our nation. Let us also pray for peace,
safety and a greater understanding of one
another that brings our nation together. As this
year comes to a close, let us all reflect on
our many blessings and look forward to a
healthy, happy and safe New Year. On behalf of
Gayle, myself and the entire Manchin family,
we wish all West Virginians a Merry,
Merry Christmas and most happy holidays.

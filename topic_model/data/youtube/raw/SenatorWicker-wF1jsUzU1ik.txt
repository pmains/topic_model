chairman Dunford do you support providing lethal defensive aid to Ukraine I do senator and have made that recommendation as I understand it DoD has officially made an affirmative recommendation and State Department also so where is that decision and and can you enlighten the committee senator my understanding is that decision is at the White House and do you have any idea when we might be able to get an answer on that I don't senator I will ask when we get back today we've been asking for the last couple weeks but I'm not sure well I think it's very important that the Ukrainian government succeed in in resisting further Russian expansion of what why did you recommend YES on providing lethal aid in my judgment from a military perspective the Ukraine needed additional capabilities to protect their sovereignty as you probably know a senator in 2016 we trained a number of their battalions 2017 trained additional battalions we provided medical supplies night-vision goggles counter Whorton mortar radars and other things but we felt like their ability to stop armored vehicles and so forth would be would be essential to them to protect themselves and so we just looked at it as a military gap that existed that if that gap was filled it would increase the probability the Ukrainians could defend themselves and I agree I would just encourage members of administration to move forward on that with regard to Russia's asymmetric threats such as information operation cyberattacks and jamming I want to ask you specifically about the 173rd Airborne Brigade which is said in a report to be under-equipped undermanned and inadequately organized according to an army review three years after Crimea why is was this the case is it the case and what can we do about it sooner I I read the the media article and asked a couple of questions after I saw it I think what the leader was doing was describing you know the current character of war and indicating that he believed that we ought to make some organizational changes and some equipment changes to make the 173rd base in Vicenza Italy more competitive I think you could make that statement more broadly so this was a leader looking at his particular unit I think you can look at that that statement more broadly and say that we need to adapt the US military really the entire US government to be able to compete at that level below war where the Russians have so successfully integrated information operations cyber political influence economic coercion and information operation so really I think what the 173rd was describing is a force that is designed for conventional war and in needing to make some organizational changes and add different capabilities to be competitive in this space that we're describing now so writ large actually this fairly accurate statement about the 173rd actually could be said about the entire Department of Defense is that what you're telling this committee but the senator I think I would broaden it what I would say is today Russians Chinese and others or on a day-to-day basis - and what I describe is they are conducting adversarial competition a level that falls below conflict and they have integrated the entire government to be able to do that and in my judgment we need to improve our ability to compete in that space and in the areas specifically I'd mentioned from military capability would be our electronic warfare capability our cyber capabilities and our information operations capability but those those all have to be integrated with those things that we don't have inside the department defense of course the economic and political tools but in my judgment bringing all those together in a day to day basis more effectively is something that we do need to do and finally general with regard to the 355 ship requirement this is a requirement that's been developed by the generals and admirals in constant consultation with our around the world this committee in the form of the NDAA has put the ships act in in the senate-passed version it makes the 355 ship requirement the policy of the United States Congress the House of Representatives has has also done that and I expect this will be coming out of conference very soon this requirement is in fact a serious requirement is it not and can you assure us that that from the level of the administration we're serious about getting to that number and getting in fulfilling that requirement rather than the 276 ships we have doing it as quick as practicable senator I don't think there's any question that all of us know that the Navy is is smaller right now than it needs to be to meet all those requirements and that requirement that you've identified is one that's based on analytic rigor and it should be a target that we shoot for it'd be good to get there as soon as we can and of course many of the conversations we're having about the budget will inform our ability to do that but we certainly appreciate your leadership in that regard thank you Thank You mr. chairman

Biden is looking to Outsource U.S coal production axios is reporting that the U.S and its partner countries will fund around a dozen overseas mining mineral processing and recycling projects it comes as the White House is delaying and canceling major mining projects in the United States the administration canceled two leases for proposed copper and nickel mines in Minnesota just this past January joining me right now is Louisiana Senator a member of the Senate energy and natural resources committee Bill Cassidy Senator it's great to see you this morning thanks very much for being here walk us through what the administration is doing and its impact yeah the administration is choosing not to develop jobs and Economic Opportunity in the United States of America but to take U.S taxpayer dollars and go not to the Congo or some undeveloped country but to go to Australia for example a place which has the same environmental standards as do we so it's not as if this is like some sort of okay we're not going to look at it therefore it doesn't occur it's it's a developed country that is that we're going to spend U.S taxpayer dollars to create jobs in those countries and I'm all for those countries but I want those jobs here I want that job in Minnesota that you just described that job in Louisiana they are saying to the American worker drop dead that well that is just horrible I mean I I don't know what the ultimate goal is here he knows that we need the coal production but he doesn't want it in America so he's willing to just cut those jobs it is a mindset of the left that it doesn't if it doesn't occur in the United States therefore it doesn't occur anywhere in the world and they know that so they move those jobs that Economic Opportunity for our people they move it overseas in order to satisfy their environmental left it is wrong now if you're going to create those minerals if you're going to create that opportunity create it in the United States but they're choosing it is an act of deliberate policy to create jobs elsewhere and not the United States when we could do it here well there's even more than that I mean much of the business is going to China in this climate change agenda I mean this week we were talking with Rick Perry about the worry that Chinese companies have dominated manufacturing of big portions of uh of our economy like Renewables uh like um like solar batteries made in China and now we see that in that infrastructure package that you and your colleagues uh voted for it's giving 200 million dollars of taxpayer money to a chinese-controlled company microvest microvest does much of its business in China so why are we giving 200 million dollars to this company I can't argue why we're doing 200 million dollars to a Chinese country company but what I can say about the infrastructure bill is Byron and large that got it right with that said to the American worker we're going to invest here for example if we want a lower carbon intensity future we actually have Provisions in that bill which help a company in Louisiana take its carbon and sequester it or to reuse it that's saying to the American worker we're investing in you we're making you more competitive we're making the jobs here in the United States not elsewhere now that's the good way to do it not what they're doing with these mines which is invested in South Korea investing in Australia investing everywhere again saying to the American worker drop dead we don't care about you well the journal is out with an op-ed this morning and a piece titled all Biden's Green Job losses they highlight what's happening at the stellantis Jeep Cherokee plant in Illinois the company has to lay off more than 1300 employees now because it has to comply with the administration's mandating ESG rules they're blaming the rising costs for electric vehicles uh for the reason that they're cutting all the other jobs senator yes and so that also says you can't compete with government subsidies so if the administration makes a decision to subsidize the heck out of other vehicles by the way given a 7 500 credit for an upper income American buying a brand new expensive vehicle as opposed to the poor guy who would rather have the job rather drive his old car they are subsidizing expensive vehicles for richer Americans and putting the burden of paying the subsidy as well as the loss of the job upon working Americans it is a wrong policy why because because they've got this kind of allegiance to their environmental left that really doesn't care about the American worker oh they put some kind of spin up on it yes we do we're going to send you some place to put a solar panel up but for the person who's making good money doing mining or doing manufacturing they're saying I'm sorry we're shipping that job overseas they that's too bad let's peek good morning Senator isn't this just part and parcel of this entire administration's mixed up energy policy and climate agenda where we are constantly relying on China for the minerals that drive our climate Vehicles Etc and by the way that the Outsourcing of mining is no different than going to Venezuela Iran Saudi Arabia and everywhere else in the world rather than drilling here in the United States for oil it's the same policy I mean I don't understand how we can continue to hold this Administration not accountable for shipping these jobs overseas when they talk such a big game about on sourcing yeah so one they don't have an energy policy ice cream ad hoc yeah it's an ad hoc kind of okay what do the people on our base want us to do and so therefore we'll react we want to lower the price of oil so we're going to release from the Strategic petroleum Reserve we're going to get Venezuela to give we're going to beg the Saudis but we're not going to create American jobs off the coast of Louisiana as one example where where we will generate not only American jobs but revenue for the for the federal government to lower our debt and deficit it is a policy which lacks any Focus except appease the base I mean it seems to me that one of the problems is they know in mining Enterprises and also in oil and gas and construction of pipelines they're going to run into the same people they're trying to appease that is to say the environmental activists who will not let this kind of work go forward I mean that and you know at the end of the day they've got themselves in their own box they can't they can't move forward with the agenda because they're the people who are promoting it and who are backing it uh won't let them actually open minds and build pipelines on all the things that we need to do I agree with you totally and I take a different prison by which to look at things there is a competition worldwide for jobs for working working people wherever you live China United States you name the country and so you've got to always have the prism what is good for jobs in my country we know that that non-college educated working folks typically get their best money at mining manufacturing and construction now they have declared all-out war if you will upon Mining and upon construction if you will for that construction related to manufacturing we need all three of those segments to provide better livelihoods for the people our neighbors the people we go to school with the people when we're in high school the people that our children go to school with now we need those jobs and this Administration turns their back on them so what happens to those people now Senator will they be able to get another job in mining of cold no not in America because he's shutting down the coal plants yeah so they will go to a lower play job probably in the service industry and you can look by the way at where there is uh higher rates of of death from overdose those counties perishes in my state with higher rates of death from overdose are typically where manufacturing or mining jobs have left it's called Death from despair now this Administration is contributing to that by not focusing upon those jobs again you can install solar panels someplace getting paid half as much learning a new career at age 50 or you can stay where you are with your core competency this Administration ignores that well not to mention allowing all of the fentanyl to come into this country which of course is the source of some of those overdoses certainly the poisoning of American citizens by fentanyl as a result of his border policy or lack thereof and I would argue again the concept is death from despair where people non-college-educated men also women now but typically men are are destroying themselves with overdose liver disease other things that are so-called lifestyle choices and there's a strong correlation between where there has been a loss of manufacturing the loss of the Dignity of a good job if you will and and a turning towards that sort of that sort of Lifestyle well we're going to keep a spotlight on this failed energy policy center it's great to have your take on all of this thanks very much for being here this morning Senator Bill Cassidy is in D.C this morning and I will continue this conversation on energy policy

to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district oh I'm congressman bill Pascrell and I would like to welcome you to this latest edition of to the point there was a renewed global threat of terrorism and the wake of sand bar dino and the attacks in Paris the world powers are engaged in military missions in Syria and nation engulfed in Civil War for almost five years the geopolitical ramifications of the Syrian conflict are significant significant at the same time militant extremists are targeting freedom-loving nations this confluence of events as all our full and undivided attention in this country President Obama has asked Congress to authorize the use of military force against Isis or ISIL or dash and we'll get into that in a few moments what we call them you can call it whatever you prefer new developments require us to re-evaluate our policy decisions every day submit with me today is a gentleman extremely capable of wading into the particulars of these topics representative California's twenty eighth congressional district congressman Adam Schiff Adam thank you for being here he's with us today he's a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles he is the ranking member of the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a member of the Benghazi select committee congressman Schiff has been a leader on national security and foreign policy with an emphasis on diplomacy intelligence reform in efforts to stabilize countries that are at risk and becoming the future failed States and havens for terrorists so Adam welcome aboard thank you with you and let me let me say some things in the beginning let me both smoking arm I can be critical and many many times but you are a voice of reason through the discussions and debates that we've had on national security and what in God's name is going on in lease and how it affects us and I thank you for your service in your country I you're not only important on CNN on Sundays and Saturdays but you're important all the time and I think you're doing a hell of a job I trust your judgment I don't agree with you all the time which is unimportant but I do agree that there's no one in the Congress that's more apt of talking about what we're talking about today can you give us a summary from the Intel point of view as to where we are today realizing that this show is going to be on for the next few weeks but where are we today in the second week of December of Bank of 2015 as we look both at what happened in California the disaster what happened in Paris give us an Intel quick brief across the course the lines as to what's you know what's the truth of what's the fiction here bill thank you for inviting me to be on your show and my greetings to your constituents in New Jersey as well as mine out in California you do a fabulous job in the Congress you're a great representative well respected in both sides they also it's a particular pleasure to join you today I'd be happy to do my best to give a nutshell I'm sure you on the situation in Iraq and Syria as well as the threat to our homeland but it's very difficult because obviously so many international players and the fight in Iraq and Syria is predominantly about Isis or dash but it's also a proxy fight of many of the major powers and this is what makes it so difficult ultimately to resolve by the way these murderers don't like to be called dash they don't they don't like that reference that means the this person who plays on discord that's an insult today that's why I use the term dash well it's why I don't like to refer to them as the Islamic state that gives them more credibility than deserve am i barking up the wrong trail I think you're exactly right and all right i prefer the term dash as well I often use Isis because not as many people are familiar with dash but I like the fact that it's derogatory it should be it's a brutal meet evilly evil or ization and so no epithet is too too critical from my point of view but in terms of what's going on there we have a similar challenge politically on both sides of the Syria Iraq border and that is there's a large Sunni population in both countries that feels it has nowhere to go in Iraq the Sunni population feels like it has been disenfranchised by the ruling Shia government in Baghdad they think it's basically being run out of Tehran that was a primarily mr. Maliki right yes he pours the discord which caused the vacuum which allow these characters to take advantage of that vacuum so I mean I want to go back and point fingers about Iraq but we're talking about what's happening right now in what the result of a vacuum what it what happens well bill I think exactly right i mean our troops went in there they helped establish a government and security there Nouri al-maliki who was then the Iraqi Prime Minister though I decided to take that opportunity to consolidate his own power to marginalize and exclude the Sunnis to weed out the the Sunni officer class and what resulted from that was a hollowed-out Iraqi military in which the Sunnis really had no meaningful role and a Sunni population that felt disenfranchised and that paved the way for a return of what had been al Qaeda in Iraq which we now know as Isis right and until that political problem is fixed in Iraq there's going to be space for Isis in Iraq similarly on the Syrian side of the border you have a Shia an Alawite government led by Bashar al-assad with a majority Sunni population that is being barrel bombed by Assad so that Sunni population has a choice between the Shia regime of Assad that's barrel bombing them or Isis or any number now of other Islamist groups javed al-nusrah which is the al-qaeda franchise aha Alshon which is a very militant Islamic group and then about a five hundred other rebel organizations and these militant groups are trying to outdo one another it seemed to me reading about them the really the founder of debt of dash I was a Jordanian who's now dead as a collie yeah ah and and he was too radical for al-qaeda he was too radical for bed Laden so this is what we're facing now isn't it that's exactly right it's our cal we used all these brutal attacks killing mostly Muslims killing a lot of [ __ ] Muslims you know that's an important point I can't stress that enough when I talk about the Middle East and I talk about these very violent radical groups that mostly Muslims get are being killed by Muslims you know we're looking--we're looked at as infidels but the fact of the matter is Muslims are killing Muslims aren't they absolutely absolutely and not only is Isis or dash killing Shia they're also killing Sunni Muslims for you know if you don't adopt the caliphate if you don't swear ligious to Baghdadi you're an infidel even if you are a Sunni so they have about as limited tolerance for any diversity a viewpoint even within their own faith as you can imagine if we go back to this map if you look to your right up here on the top part of Syria raka dash has used this as their headquarters that's exactly right and we just cut off you know some paths of communication there with rock and other towns up there and Mosul but what do we do how do we get and defeat dash in their own capital that would be a big victory to me oh it would be and you know running Isis out of the caliphate business would be huge in several ways it would be huge in that the fact that they hold land that they call themselves a state or Caliphate gives them the propaganda advantage of recruiting thousands and thousands of foreign fighters were really attracted by this idea of a caliphate you obliterate the caliphate you obliterate a lot of the magnet for recruitment right it also though holding that territory between Syria and Iraq and cumulative Lee it's about a third of each so that it's a huge land holding that allows them that time and the space and the resources they derive from oil from taxation to plot attacks against us here in the homeland we're a harder target to reach than Europe right so we're not in his immediate risk of a peristyle attack but if they're given the time and luxury to hold that territory they aspire to attack us with a multiple style attack like we saw in Paris and they'll have the capacity to do it so the clock is ticking it i think heightens the importance of us really taking the fight to them and and as we saw so painfully in california just about an hour away from my district in san bernardino they also are very potent terms of their ability to use social media to radicalize people at a distance we're going to talk about that and then your perspective in terms of an intel i look back at when i look back at this situation and you know 88 million syrians are dislocated for over four and a half million left the country moving to Jordan Lebanon and now into Europe any countries that country is devastated a civil war created another vacuum for these murderers for these people who so hate as well we're not going to beat that hate buy more hate we're not going to beat that hate by hating God's children all of a sudden they're no longer God's children I guess or one religion is better than another religion we're not going to solve anything that way are we know we're so not and and I think we're doing a couple things that are very counterproductive certainly the horrendous comments by Donald Trump that we ought to bar all Muslims from coming in the country even our own citizens even Muslim members of our military that are deployed overseas he would deprive from the ability to come back home that just feeds into Isis propaganda and it's obviously antithetical to who we are as a people right but beyond that you know we've had this rush to pass legislation to bar refugees from coming to the country I voted no well you me both and as you know bill it's a long vetting process for a refugee it takes about a year and after two years to get through that I've shown this before you'll have to put up with for two seconds this is the vetting process this is the the bureaucracy and it should be that a up a refugee wants to come into this country has to deal with 13 14 steps we've added another you know step for those folks and they're mostly young people they're mostly children and mostly woman who have come here with it so they got nothing but the clothing on their back and this is the result of what this group is this group dash has done well and this is an important point bill because this is a really really a body below two dashes propaganda you have millions of people millions of Muslims fleeing the caliphates current if life is so great under the caliphate how come there are millions of Muslims are voting with their feet and then be millions more who want to get out and that's what gives me Isis threatens them with death and I look at Ramadi this town in Iraq which rocky forces are encircling held by Isis Isis is telling the civilians we will kill you if you try to flee and why because they want to use them as human shields yeah that can't last too long I I think that from within dash will destroy itself whether there or here or anyplace am I being too optimistic well I i think they contain the seeds of their own destroy action but if left to their own devices and with the repressive kind of really police state they run it will take too long for it to disintegrate on its own so I think we're going to have to up the effort to defeat them militarily but also solve that political problem we talked about at the outset we've talked about the physical things that we see in what's going on their forces whether we should the president wants and what her eyes ation for him to use military force I want to talk to you about the philosophical and psychological aspects of this which Intel deals with I taught a cat class and on philosophy losophy and psychology in high school this was and I taught philosophy in college as well but and I they had a read for me Eric hoffer's book the true believer and he was a longshoreman that had a very interesting perspective about radical radical folks who who try to use violence to pursue their their goals he wrote this about radicalism and fanaticism for men to plunge headlong into an undertaking a vast change they must be intensely disconnected yet not destitute and they must have the feeling that by the possession of some potent doctrine infallible leader or some new technique they have access to a source of irresistible power they must also have an extravagant consumption of the prospects and potentialities of the future finally they must be wholly ignorant of the difficulties involved in their vast undertaking experience is a handicapped so the big thing that changed in these past six the years is that you don't actually have to join a mass movement anymore you can follow it online and participate that way now I I took this from an article by David Brooks a conservator right if at a time so i really like i think he is also a voice of reason like yourself and how radicals are made and you look at what happened in San Bernardino and you say to yourself what the heck could possess people this couple had a baby for crying out loud I mean what the hell were they thinking or was that in material were they that detached were they that disconnected and they went out and killed all these innocent people who were there trying to have a nice time for that day what do you think about what Eric Hoffer right so what do you think about the concept and how do we really fight this do you fight this will bullets and guns is that the only way you fight this well that's a very interesting quote and obviously a lot of elements you could apply to the radicalization yes going on today I don't know how to explain how human beings are capable of what this couple did in San Bernardino as you say how do you drop off your baby with a family member and go out on a suicidal mission to kill in this case one of the shooters co-workers co-workers who had a baby shower for them not long before the killing how is that even possible you have to be detached you have to be detached from from humanity to do that you also have to be under the spell of some powerful doctrine that you think justifies these kind of horrific crimes you know how do we fight this well in part you fight it militarily by depriving the basically the control center of this evil organization of holding land driving resources to send out those social media urgings to help radicalize people apart though you fight it domestically by working in this case with the Islamic community so that they can work closely with law enforcement identify when people are at risk of radicalization often people at the fringes of society now hear this was not someone at the fringes of society right this is someone who looked like they were enjoying the American dream so even with the best of things with the best intelligence putting military pressure on Isis with a good cooperative relationship with the Islamic community still may not be enough in all cases there are other things that we can do too i think frankly to cut off the easy access of assault weapons and high-capacity clips and whatnot that will be important not only in these kind of domestic terror cases but you know all kind of shooting cases measuring cases in America but we also to get to your point bill we need to fight the ideology right are we best do that well does they'll look at that oh absolutely absolutely and you know I think the reality is we're ill positioned both as an ax government and is the American government right on the ideological battle field because Muslims aren't going to listen to the US government tell them what it means to be Muslim right and what the Islamic faith has to say about killing innocent people Muslims have to tell other Muslims about that right but we can play a role in empowering moderate voices in the Islamic world leaders like King Abdullah and Jordan and others who are you know broadcasting a message of tolerance and and and talking about this this is antithetical to Islam so make no mistake about it we're going to we need a strong military force using it smartly we we should and I support the president's been attempting one year to get us to authorize the use of military force you're working on a bill like what I've heard so far I would support that bill I'd vote for right now if I had that opportunity you you can do these things and you can pass the you know the people on the watch list don't let them that doesn't get to the heart of the issue look I got enough problems at the end all right but I'm not looking for more problems I'm looking for an approach that I think you're capable of because I know where you stand and I know I know how you know somewhat how you think of going after this ideology we can win that war why should we think that were any less able to confront that ideology and were more capable of confronting militarily the enemy I don't know this is our mentality we thought we were going to do this in Iraq and we thought were going to do this in Afghanistan we've a we had to abandon ship against there forever and yet there was a vacuum when there's a vacuum hateful people take advantage of or try to take advantage of it and this nothing points out again the central importance of trying to resolve the political problems because we can send our military and I movie could send in the Marines and send in large armed forces and we can we can defeat Isis on the battlefield we've done that before right but those battles don't stay one unless you solve the political problem that the Sunnis have have been disenfranchised there's nowhere for them to grow and that's what happened on their Maliki when he took over why we allowed Malik a why the United States supported him when he had no intention whatsoever of making Sunnis part of his government and having a truly democratic government well you can't impose democracy I mean we can't do that on the other hand though you couldn't expose people to democracy well and we can use our leverage on the new government in Iraq not so new anymore but al Abadi to really maximize the pressure to include the Sunnis to form National Guard units of Sunnis to make sure that the Sunnis are active participants in their own security there's a lot the Iraqis want from us militarily in terms of our support the things we need from them politically to encourage Sunnis to depart from Isis so there are a lot of dimensions to this but you know just to underscore one of the challenges we talked about kind of broadly getting the Muslim community to weigh in as the president talked about the other day on this fight within Islam against this perversion of Islam but we also probably need a crowd or Singh effort to attack the social media that Isis is providing a cow well because you know the government the government is lousy at tweeting and Facebook posting and you know it's messages are not very credible we don't have the manpower within the government to you know be responding to each and every post or tweet but but the vast majority of Muslims around the world don't agree with Isis the vast majority of the civilized world doesn't agree with Isis we ought to be able to not only counter but drowned out the social media campaign why has and I want to mention any names because you can mention a lot of names Donald Trump is not the problem he's just a face of it but you know we're accusing we're bringing up things that happened 15 years ago that didn't happen with rumor of what happened I come from Paterson New Jersey and Patterson has been accused like jersey city was accused of Muslims marching in the street celebrating the streak that did not happen in fact I just talked with the police chief of my city it was the police chief at that time Larry Spagnola and he was on duty he sent the force down there you know what to expect after the second building was it he said the reason why we did is they weren't informed by the FBI that there may be people on the way down into cause problems not Muslims people like you and me Wan non-muslim and this was a fact of life and yet that story just got wheels got legs and walked out there something like that shows the seed and you know it feeds into it feeds into dash becoming even stronger what doesn't you know we're in this crazy world now bill where the facts just don't seem to matter yeah why is they don't matter to a lot of the candidates that have a matter to a lot of the media and in fact you know this allegation of you know Muslims celebrating 911 when when it's pointed out that there's no evidence of this those who want to believe it nonetheless say well of Cour that's what the left wing liberal conspiratorial media has to say you would expect that that's all the more proof that it really happened yeah how do you how do you overcome that kind of conspiracy thinking I am looking at the situation very carefully and I would hope that our intel has ears and has voices I mean we had Voice of America what are we doing in the communications field and in terms of conflicting with this ideology which is very hateful and and and the murderous ideas that come forth what are we doing that you can talk about besides dropping leaflets yeah well we're not we're not doing very much and that which we are we're not doing very well we've had a lot of turnover I think in the State Department effort to combat Isis propaganda I think our ideological pushback has been a very ineffectual we're still kind of groping for what the response ought to be and part of the problem is again with no history we don't know culture yeah do you know what i mean by that do i do know what you mean by that and i think you're right which is you know part of the reason why I think we're uniquely ill-suited to be the messenger but we need to help empower those that are credible voices within Islam that can talk about these issues that's probable died in our Wars for crying out loud these folks there in that they're in the military service right now how dare we segregate one really we we did this in the Second World War we had interment cans for the Japanese and Italians people forget that Italians were in some intern camps on the west coast we have short memories or we don't know maybe we don't know history as well as I thought we do but the fact of the matter is that we're Americans and we need to come together how do we how in our final final moment here how do we stop sandberg Buried Dino yes from happening again even though they're looking for soft targets there's no seamless system we're all fallible human beings just the word about well you know we are combing through all the facts of this investigation to figure out just when were these two radicalized who are they in contact with were the things that we should have seen can this inform us into how to improve our security in the future that that investigation is still very early but we're hoping that the results of it will improve our defenses here at home ultimately though you know I think we have to recognize a couple things and one is that it's dependent on a good relationship with the American Muslim community very ready ally in this and the second thing is that when people just talk among themselves and are radicalized in their basement it's a very tough problem to deal with I want to thank you adam for coming on the show today and i hope you come back again because i'm sure a few

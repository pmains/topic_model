let's speak about more of this with one of the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee the site of tomorrow's impeachment hearing congresswoman Karen bass from California congresswoman we appreciate taking time this morning thank you so we're about a month into the formal impeachment process here and if you look at the polling support public support for impeaching and removing the president from office did not budge an inch from before and after those public hearings if we put the numbers up there it was 50% before the public hearings it's 50% after I just wonder does this show us that Democrats failed to make the case convincingly to the American people oh I don't think so at all and we are still in the middle of the process however 50% of the people feel that the president should not just be impeached but removed that is a profound number you know if you look back to the Clinton impeachment that have never got above 30% of the American public so the fact that we are starting with 50% I think is huge and I do take your point but to be fair during the Clinton impeachment parties some members of the opposing party changed sides you had Democrats vote along with the majority of Republicans to English even for some of the articles of impeachment and based at least on public statements this if it does come to a vote in the house is going to be a purely party line vote you may very well as you did on the first vote laying out the ground rules for the impeachment inquiry lose some Democrats how concerning is that to you well I think it would be most important that it is bipartisan and if you look back to the Clinton impeachment it was a handful four or five Democrats that voted for it if we had a few Republicans I think that that would be a very powerful situation and I just think it's sad because they do know that this is a serious problem they know that which is why they only argue about process they can't argue about content they are several of them as you know even came forward and said they don't think what the president did was right and then he blasted them so they are left with nothing but to defend him and I think that it doesn't look very good for them because they know the facts are there the facts are very very loud and for them to just focus on process I think is really pathetic given that that's the reality though and again based on public statements you're heading for a party line vote what it makes sense for Democrats to consider a step short of impeachment perhaps a censure vote where you could then get possibly again and I know this is no guarantee but get some Republican votes on board I think until the Republicans decide that they have the power amongst them to stand up to this president I don't see why it would make a difference whether it was sensor or impeachment and that's one of the things by the way that is profoundly different we have never had a president before that was abusive that was a bully that was threatening and I just wish that my Republican colleagues would have more courage you know I recall a time in California when the Republicans had to vote for taxes and they knew if they voted for taxes that they would never be an elected official again but we had a 40 billion dollar deficit and they voted anyway I want to see my Republican colleagues have a backbone and say is this seat that I hold so important that I would compromise the national security and I would compromise the next election I think what's at stake here is so much more important than their individual elections and a one final point if all of them stood together or even 20 or 30 of them stood together and voted the right way voted the way they know is right he can't defeat all of them so I think at the end of the day you have to make a decision in your conscious what's more important my individual seat are the health of our election process question before I let you go after this impeachment process is over as you know it is not high impeachment is not high on the list of concerns of American voters polling shows that consistently health care at cetera name one piece of legislation that you believe that Democrats should focus on and perhaps work with Republicans on to get past after the inquiry is over well I mean I could tell you several but if you want one lowering the price of prescription drugs that is an issue in everyone's district and Republicans should work with us on that you know that we have passed over 200 pieces of legislation so the question should really be asked to McConnell why won't he even look at some of the legislation that was passed here in the house and some of it has been bipartisan congresswoman Karen bass they should another you're also the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus thanks for joining the program this morning thanks for having me on

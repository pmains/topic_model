Mr Speaker I rise today to support the farm worker Modernization Act let me first thank chair person zoloft gun and ranking member Dan Newhouse for their hard work in forming this bipartisan compromise farm workers are some of the hardest-working individuals you will ever meet I know as a farmer's son I've done that work it is hard but it is skilled work and it's simply wrong that they are subject to living and working in the shadow of uncertainty and fear of deportation just last month in the city of Madera in my district I met with members of the United Farm Workers organizations to tell them of the promise of this bill I spoke with these hard-working men and women their young children who worked to put food on America's dinner table every night and I could see the hope in their eyes hope for a normal life free from the dread of possible family separation and deportation that hangs over them every day when they leave to go to work hope for a chance to change their reality and reshape their story we owe it to these individuals who do so much for us these monumental this monumental bipartisan compromise is a unique opportunity to provide us for the first meaningful reform in immigration system in over four decades now many of us would like comprehensive immigration reform for our dreamers and to fix our broken immigration system but for now that is not possible but this legislation that would provide legal status for seasonal and year-round farmworkers is I urge my colleagues to stand with me and support the farm Modernization Act

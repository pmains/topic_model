BY SENDING ELECTORAL VOTES BACK  TO THE STATES WAS NOT  CONSTITUTIONAL, NOR WAS IT  LEGAL. YET, TRUMP DID IT ANYWAY. FOR MORE ON TODAY'S HARING, I  WANT TO BRING IN CALIFORNIA  CONGRESSMAN AUDIOM SCHIFF. MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6th  COMMITTEE, AS WELL AS CHAIRMAN  OF THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE. SO, CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, WE HAVE  NOW HEARD FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE  WHO WERE CLOSE TO VICE PRESIDENT PENCE. WHY HASN'T THE COMMITTEE  ACTUALLY BROUGHT MIKE PENCE IN  TO TESTIFY EITHER LIVE OR  RECORDED TESTIMONY? OONT HEARING FROM HIM DIRECTLY  PROVE THE COMMITTEE'S CASE SO  MUCH MORE VISKDLY THAN HEARING  FROM HIS AIDES! WE ARE NOT EXCLUDING THE  POSSIBILITY OF BRINGLING HIM IN. BUT AT THIS POINT, IN THE  INVESTIGATION, AND OUR HEARINGS, WE BROUGHT IN THE WITNESSES THAT WE DID AND I THINK THEY WERE  QUITE COMPELLING. THE VIDEOTAPED TESTIMONY OF HIS  CHIEF OF STAFF, THE LIVE  TESTIMONY OF HIS ATTORNEY. YOU CAN OFTEN GET, YOU KNOW,  EVERY BIT AS GOOD INFORMATION  FROM SOME OF THE NON-PRINCIPALS  IN THE ROOM THAN FROM THE  PRINCIPAL. BUT AGAIN, NOT RULING OUT THAT  POSSIBILITY, AND WE WILL JUST  HAVE TO TAKE IT AS IT GOES.  >> WE LEARNED TODAY THAT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN  ASKING THE COMMIT CREE AND IN  FACT BEGAN DOING SO IN APRIL, TO TURN IT OVER ABOUT A THUZ  WITNESS TRANSCRIPTS BUT YOUR  COMMITTEE HAS, SO FAR, REFUSED. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THEY NEED THIS INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR THEIR PROSECUTIONS  AND INVESTIGATIONS. WHY HAS THE COMMITTEE NOT  COOPERATED WITH THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT? >> YOU KNOW, JAKE, I HAVE BEEN  ENROLLED IN SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE INVESTIGATIONS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT SAY "GIVE US ALL YOUR FILES." AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO  MAKE SURE THEY GET WHAT THEY  NEED CONSISTENT WITH OUR OWN  INVESTIGATIVE NEEDS BUT WE WANT  THEM TO APPROXIMATE SUCCESSFUL. WE WANT THEM TO BRING TO JUSTICE ANYONE WHO BROKE THE LAW AND WE  ARE CONFIDENT WE WILL BE ABLE TO HELP THEM PURSUE ANY OF THE  LAWBREAKERS INVOLVED. BUT -- BUT AGAIN, I THINK THE -- THE CHALLENGES, THE BREADTH OF  THEIR REQUEST, WE ARE GOING TO  WORK THROUGH IT AND MAKE SURE  THEY GET WHAT THEY NEED.  >> THEY HAVE PROSECUTED MORE  THAN 800 PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY  STORMED THE CAPITOL THAT DAY IN  TERMS OF LAW BREAKERS. ARE YOU LOOKING AT INDIVIDUALS  ABOVE SNEM INDIVIDUALS WHO  ORGANIZED PEOPLE TO COME TO  WASHINGTON, D.C.? ARE YOU LOOKING AT JOHN EASTMAN  POSSIBLY COMMITLING CRIMINAL  OFFENSE? WE LEARNED TODAY EASTMAN  E-MAILED JULIA THINK ABOUT  GETTING A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON  AFTER JANUARY 6th.  >> OF COURSE, IN HIS OPINION  NOW, I THINK MULTIPLE TIMES  EXPRESSED THE VIEW BASED ON THE  EVIDENCE THAT HE HAS SEEN THAT  BOTH EASTMAN AND DONALD TRUMP  VIOLATED TWO OR THREE FEDERAL  LAWS. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT IS CERTAINLY  MY VIEW THAT THOSE ISSUES NEED  TO APPROXIMATE INVESTIGATED BY  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. OUR JOB IS NOT A CRIMINAL  RESPONSIBILITY. OUR JOB IS FIND THE FACTS,  EXPOSE THEM TO THE PUBLIC LIGHT, AND DEVELOP REMEDIES TO PROTECT  OUR DEMOCRACY GOING FORWARD. BUT I CERTAINLY BELIEVE, AS  JUDGE CARTER ARTICULATED, THAT  THERE IS ALREADY EVIDENCE  SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOING ITS OWN INVESTIGATION.  >> I WANT TO PLAY IT MOMENT  WHERE FORMER-WHITE HOUSE  ATTORNEY FOR TRUMP, ERIC KESHMAN DESCRIBED A PHONE CALL WITH RUDY GIULIANI.  >> THE MORNING OF JANUARY 6th, I THINK HE CALLED ME OUT OF THE  BLUE, RIGHT? AND I WAS LIKE GETTING DRESSED. AND WE HAD AN INTELLECTUAL  DISCUSSION THAT -- I DON'T KNOW  IF EASTMAN TO SAVE THE VP'S ROLE AND HE WAS ASKING ME MY VIEW AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF IT. AND WHEN HE FINISHED, HE SAID I  BELIEVE THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE  PROBABLY RIGHT. >> YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. UH, FIRST OF ALL, IT MUST BE  WEIRD FOR YOU TO HAVE ERIC  KITSCHMAN SAYING SO MANY THINGS  YOU AGREE, GIVEN HOW YOU GUYS  WENT AFTER EACH OTHER, AND  SQUARED OFF IN THE FIRST  IMPEACHMENT OF DONALD TRUMP. UM, BUT TALK ABOUT THAT, IF YOU  WOULD, FOR A SECOND, ABOUT RUDY  GIULIANI TELLING KITSCHMAN YOU  ARE PROBABLY RIGHT, AND THEN  GOING OUT PUBLICLY AND SAYING  THE OPPOSITE. WE SEE A LOT OF THIS GOING ON IN THIS HEARING.  >> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND FIRST OF ALL, ABOUT MR.  HERSCHMANN, PEOPLE WHO DON'T  REALLY HIS ROLE IN THE FIRST  IMPEACHMENT MAY NOT REMEMBER HE  WAS ONE OF THE MOST BOMBASTIC OF THE TRUMP LAWYERS AND IT SHOWED, LIKE SO MANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WORKING AROUND THE PRESIDENT,  DEFENDING HIM, THAT THEY GOT TO  A POINT WHERE THEY COULD DEFEND  HIS CONDUCT, HIS MISCONDUCT NO  MORE. SO SOME GOT THERE SOONER THAN  OTHERS. WAS VERY LATE FOR MR. HERSCHMANN BUT, NONETHELESS, WE SEE THIS  CONSISTENT THEME OF GIULIANI  ACKNOWLEDGING TO HERSCHMANN  THAT, YEAH, THIS IS PROBABLY A  BOGUS-LEGAL THEORY. EASTMAN ACKNOWLEDGING TO GREG  JACOB, YEAH, THIS PROBABLY WE  LOSE 9-0 IN THE SUPREME COURT  BUT WE ARE DOING IT ANYWAY. YOU KNOW, THEY UNDERSTOOD  EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING BUT  NORTH MATTERED TO THEM SO MUCH  AS KEEPING TRUMP IN POWER, NOT  OUR DEMOCRACY, NOT ANYTHING  ELSE. NOT IF IT PROVOKED VIOLENCE. THEIR ONLY OBJECT APPARENTLY,  LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S, WAS STAYING OFFICE AND -- AND DEFYING A  TRADITION AS OLD AS OUR COUNTRY  AS A PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER. >> JUST TO DEFEND ERIC  HERSCHMANN, IN THE IMPEACHMENT  TRIAL, HE WAS A ATTORNEY DOING  HIS JOB. IN THIS, HE IS A WITNESS. SO, THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A  DIFFERENCE AS I KNOW YOU  UNDERSTAND FULLY -- FULLY WELL. CONGRESSMAN --  >> BUT, JAKE, YOU KNOW, MR.  HERSCHMANN WAS WORKING WITH  DONALD TRUMP ALL THAT TIME. HE DIDN'T START WORKING FOR A  DEFENSE LAWYER FOR HIM BUT  AGAIN, IT IS A PATTERN, THE SAME WITH BILL BARR.  >> YEAH.  >> BILL BARR, YOU KNOW,  INTERVENED IN THE SENTENCING OF  ROGER STONE. INTERVENED TO MAKE CASES GO AWAY AGAINST MICHAEL FLYNN BUT HE G

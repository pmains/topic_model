thank you madam chair um ms aquifer i have a social media post from your facebook instagram account the image says you posted it on june 16th 2020. here we have the seal of the bureau of al alcohol tobacco firearms and explosions and next to it you said quote we said what we said hashtag goa gun owners of america hashtag abolish the atf that's what your post says correct correct then underneath this atf seal your post says in big letters defund correct correct defund the atf so just to be clear you say defund the atf and then abolish the atf on july 4th in highland park illinois just very close to my district in the chicago suburbs the shooter shot and killed seven and injured 30 with an ar style rifle ar-15 style rifle the shooter fled the scene but despite this he was identified and caught because atf agents were able to quickly trace a weapon he left at the scene back to him using the atf's national tracing center yet ma'am you want to abolish this agency you want to abolish this national trade tracing center that is a extreme and radical viewpoint unfortunately some folks on the other side have introduced the extremist bill quote eliminate the atf act i respectfully submit we should help keep our law enforcement intact we should have helped keep our communities safe and we should be investing in the atf in law enforcement not defunding and abolishing it as you would suggest ma'am mr daniel i want to turn your attention to a tweet on your account this tweet says it it's actually from march 2nd depicting the delta 5 pro precision rifle your post reads quote rooftop ready even at midnight then a smiley face emoji follows that statement mr daniel this is what your tweet says correct yes that's correct sir and the tweet shows what appears to be a night vision gun scope trained on a parked car at street level mr daniel this tweet is not depicting anyone hunting for wildlife is it no sir and it's it's not depicting anyone acting in self-defense against someone attacking them correct that that remains in the eye of the viewer sir i don't see anyone attacking somebody here mr busy can you uh verify that nobody appears to be attacking the person who's supposedly operating this ar-15 or this sniper rifle correct yes sir that appears to be an ad which in some way glorifies the idea of becoming a sniper with that rifle mr daniel this advertisement appears to depict premeditated violence or murder from a rooftop as you know the highland park shooter in illinois rained down bullets from a rooftop eight-year-old cooper roberts was paralyzed from the waist down when he was shot from a rooftop mr daniel two-year-old aiden mccarthy was orphaned when both of his parents were murdered when they were shot from a rooftop sir this tweet appears to suggest a planned murder and i would respectfully ask authorities and law enforcement to see whether this particular advertisement is is even legal mr busey according to various outlets including the daily beast the sig sauer corporation is selling a new weapon called the mcx spear rifle in fact mr busey you were recently quoted saying quote it'll shoot through almost all of the bulletproof vests that are worn by law enforcement in the country right now you stand by that statement correct sir sir the stated purpose for sourcing that rifle was to defeat body armor on the field of war um so i'm not stating anything that the company advertisement and that the sourcing information did not state mr daniel i presume you don't want your weapons to be used to harm law enforcement will you commit that you will not sell a weapon that tears through bulletproof vests congressman we sell the very best products made for self-defense in the world so you're not answering the questions yes or no question mr kaloy same to you i presume you won't sell a weapon that tears through bulletproof vests will you congressman with all due respect the ability to pierce body armor typically relates to the ammunition not the firearm and and and so you will not sell that ammunition either will you uh congressman we do not sell ammunition we sell firearms we sell in a variety of calibers but we do not currently sell ammunition gentlemen's time has expired

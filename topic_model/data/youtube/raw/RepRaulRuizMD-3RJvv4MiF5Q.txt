as an emergency medicine physician and representative of a large veteran population i'm committed to ensuring our service members receive the highest quality health care possible over the years i've been especially focused on making sure that veterans that have been exposed to toxic bird pits get the benefits and care that they need i actually founded the bipartisan burn pits caucus in congress bird pit exposure is this generation's agent orange and it continues to threaten the health of service members and veterans many of whom become severely sick permanently disabled or die from respiratory failure cancers and autoimmune diseases due to their burn pits exposures i was introduced to the effects of burn fits when a constituent jennifer kepner a 39 year old air force veteran with a healthy lifestyle and no other risk factors came to my office for help she was battling pancreatic cancer which her oncologist determined was likely due to exposure to burn pits at ballard air force base in iraq she later died leaving behind her husband and two young children and has been the inspiration behind my burnt pits advocacy i'd be remiss if i didn't mention that this issue touches countless families around the country in fact president biden has indicated numerous times that his son both biden's cancer may be related to his exposure to burn pits also at ballard air force base during his 2009 service in the iraq war it's time to act mr secretary and i hope you'll be a partner in taking urgent actions veterans in this country need advocates not obstacles when seeking the care they deserve secretary madonna and your testimony you mentioned that you initiated an internal review of the va's current process for establishing presumptive of service connections for veterans who may have been exposed to airborne hazards during their military service can you elaborate on what that review entails and your plans to work proactively with congress to address exposure to to burn pits and other toxic exposures yeah thanks very much doc and thank you for doing the vaccine work that you're doing um the what i s what i said is um in the first meeting of the veterans administration executive board on tuesday afternoon this was the topic uh burn pit toxic exposure we agreed a number of things in that meeting one is that we would be active rather than waiting for new uh research uh that means that we will seek additional partners including the national institutes of health and national cancer institute uh organizations like uh the firefighters who have been exposed to the similar kinds of chemicals and may have access to research and science that will help us uh in our deliberations uh and this is on top of our own research out of va and in coordination with dod uh to figure out precisely uh what uh our vets and our active duty have been through thank you thank you mr secretary and i would love to be a very involved engaged partner in your decisions in creating the process for that but just to be clear you know our veterans are dying right now uh and they cannot afford to wait decades for that perfect 20-year longitudinal double cohort study like vietnam veterans were forced to with agent orange in the next few weeks i will introduce the presumptive benefits for war fighters exposed to burn pits and other toxins act with senator gillibrand this bill will give veterans who develop respiratory diseases and cancers from toxic exposure to the health coverage that they need and deserve by establishing a presumption of service connection and i look forward to continuing to work with you we had a medical fellow in my office that did the literature review identified the respiratory illnesses that have some association with bird pits we also know that there's carcinogens in the smoke of burn pits and therefore we have people dying of brain cancer pancreatic cancer gastric cancer all kinds of cancer this is different than asian orange because there's hundreds of toxic chemicals that can produce different array of illnesses so um getting a grasp of this and giving the veterans the care and the benefits that they've earned and deserve is going to be life-saving and i look forward to being a partner with you personally in uh establishing this this process with the leadership of charitable who i understand is also very committed to this issue uh so thank you and i yield back you

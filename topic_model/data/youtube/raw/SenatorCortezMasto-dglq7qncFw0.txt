thank you Miss Cher welcome back Thank You secretary Carson and I'm gonna harp on the same thing because it is a crisis in this country particularly in Nevada which is affordable housing crisis nearly every community in this nation has an affordable rental housing crisis and it's worse in Nevada families earning $30,000 a year and are unable to find an affordable home for every 100 extremely low-income families there are only 15 affordable apartments high rents are driving thousands into homelessness our waiting list for public housing and section 8 are in tens of thousands with families waiting years for help yet this is the second year in the role that this administration plan to eviscerate they already enact what funding that we provide for affordable housing I thank goodness Congress is the one that provides the funding and saw the need to ensure that we are shoring up those resources for affordable housing but what I'd like to know now that you have those resources what is your plan to help us address the affordable housing crisis in this country you know what one of the things that has really impressed me as I've traveled around the country are places like Liberty Square you may be familiar with that in Miami one of the notoriously horrible public housing sites that through the public-private partnerships is going from 700 units to 1,600 and developing a complete holistic community those are the kinds of things that I like you look at Eastlake in Atlanta one of the most crime-ridden places with schools that were failing and now one of the two top charter schools and a neighborhood that is flourishing and trying to you know keep people from the outside from coming in and taking over thank you and secretary Carson I don't mean to interrupt I only have so much time I'm talking about affordable housing not just section 8 I'm talking about housing for individuals that want to rent a home because they can't afford to purchase it and they can't even afford the rent so those are affordable housing right and there's workforce housing that we need in this country that is not affordable as well so talk to me about what HUD is specifically doing what programs what are you doing to address this need in our in our communities and working with our state and local communities oh one of the things that I think has been quite effective is push to enhance section three and make it more than just a suggestion what do you mean by a push to enhance well section three has been on the books for 50 years has been seldom used because it's easy for people to find excuses not to use it so we are tightening that up to make and use it then for example I was in Chicago recently an entire building was being redeveloped by section three workers they were incredibly proud of the work they were doing but more importantly they were gaining skills would allow them to then move out which made room for others so besides section three housing and a push to enhance it what else are you doing well we're trying to increase the number of units that are dealt with through the rad program this has proved to be incredibly effective other types of public-private partnerships especially going to be enhanced through the opportunity zone with enormous amount of infusion of private capital into these distressed areas okay so can I get a commitment from you that you will work with us on addressing affordable housing and specifically identify the programs within HUD and within your agencies that are geared towards addressing this issue I would be more than happy to do that that's what we're trying to do thank you when you appears before this committee prior to your confirmation you promised me that you would make sure that lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people were not faced with discrimination at your confirmation hearing on January 12th in response to a question from ranking member Brown about some of the concerning comments you've made about LGD P LGBTQ people you assured this committee saying quote I would enforce all the laws of the land and I believe that all Americans regardless of the new things that you mentioned should be detected by the law but instead you've continued to undercut provisions HUD efforts had HUDs efforts to end discrimination on July 6 2017 I along with 28 other senators sent a letter to the Department requesting that you reinstate resources that were on your agency's website that protect LGBTQ people from housing discrimination and I still have not received a response what's been the delay is it normal for your agency to take nearly nine months to respond to 28 US senators well first of all we've finally got a General Counsel in December I don't know that you can can have it both ways that mean that means you can't tell us to deal with this complex legal issue and not give us the people that we need to do it a complex legal issue that was already determined by legal counsel and the administration prior to you you fail to make changes and then think that you need to have a complex legal issue that must take into account the rights of all the constituents who are involved and not just from one point of view I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about but I would appreciate a rapid quick response now that are you saying you will need legal counsel before I'm saying we should that you want to prohibit discrimination we have spent a lot of time talking about this issue since the general counsel has been there and I think there's going to be something going back up very soon we've already got something going up about a homeless children who are being affected it's an issue that we're truly concerned about but it has to be done all cancer right boy secretary Carson I know my time is up I appreciate the ranking member and the chairs indulgence thank you

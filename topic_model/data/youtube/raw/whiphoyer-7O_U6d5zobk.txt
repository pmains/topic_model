I'll let mr. Hoyer for five minutes without objection thank you very much mr. speaker mr. speaker a March 24th I was in Morristown New Jersey with former assistant US attorney Mikey Sherrill where we attended the March for our lives the March for our lives was organized by students around the country to speak out against gun violence and call for action in Congress to strengthen our gun laws this march came just days after a deadly shooting at great Mills High School in st. Mary's County in my district and it came in the wake of horrific incidents of mass gun violence at a school in parkland Farlow and that places of worship entertainment and even public streets across the country Congress can and should act 9 in 10 Americans 90 percent of our fellows believe we ought to do so we have the ability right now to strengthen background checks and ban the kinds of assault weapons that make our communities unsafe law enforcement wants us to get this done so do parents so do teachers in Moorestown we heard directly from students nine of whom spoke at the March that Miss Cheryl and I attended I was moved by their words because they're too long to insert here together mr. speaker I'll be submitting these student speeches individually into the congressional record for in the coming days but today let me just share with you some excerpts with from each of them that capture the spirit of the March and the fears and hopes of these young Americans one student Bella bahama summed it up very well and she said this quote all we want all we want is to make the world safer which is something I think everyone can agree on would that that were true mr. speaker another Caitlyn Dempsey said this and I quote we have been learning that actions speak louder than words since kindergarten so we walked out so we've written our Congressman so we planned this March they took action senior Isabella bus rock from West Morris Mendham high school lamented and I quote again it is horrible that as adolescents we have become used to the idea that gun violence is a method of dealing with our problems another student may abound a sophomore at Chatham high school declared and I quote I am NOT old enough to vote yet but I am old enough to speak out against gun violence she concluded I will not be silent now Burch a student at Marston High School shared that he's hoped that and again I quote piece by piece we will inspire other students to gain the courage to stand up for what they believe in what a lesson for all of us Luna Aguilar declared we the youth the future of our country are deciding right here right now that our lives are worth more than the right to own an assault weapon one of the students Benjamin Douglas spoke about how he rides with team 26 a group of cyclists who ride in memory of the victims of Sandy Hook elementary school where so many children and teachers lost their lives and stopped along the way to raise awareness of gun violence he said this we must continue to organize these events and never stop making noise until until until our representatives get it Ron Yamada a junior at Ridge High School spoke about how many students now live in fear how tragic she told us this most of us are just teenage we should be worrying about doing well on our AP tests and finals at the end of the year not about being shot by someone who can enter our school what parent is not terrified at that possibility finally the needle loop as a junior at Dover High School chose instead of delivering remarks simply to read aloud the names of the victims of the recent parkland Florida shooting when he concluded he expressed what we are all feeling by saying let us hope and pray that they're in a better place and we will always remember let me suggest mr. speaker remembering is not enough action is required we stand on this floor and have a moment of silence for those we lost we've said for them for their families and yes for our country but a moment of silence is not enough action is required to ensure that future moments of silence will not be necessary the nine student speakers in Mars down mr. speaker like those across the country that day gave voice to the millions who are scared but determined to see things change these speeches represent God of what Americans heard on March 24th at the nationwide March for our lives I hope my colleagues will read these extraordinarily imposed and thoughtful students and what they had to say and I hope we can listen to their fears and their hopes and come together to take action that's what they want us to do that is our responsibility that's what we ought to do

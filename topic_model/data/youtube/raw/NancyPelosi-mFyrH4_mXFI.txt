madam Speaker the clock is ticking now the clock is ticking on the need for us to raise the debt ceiling so that we do not default on our past obligations that we uphold the Full Faith and Credit of the United States of America as we continue this debate today one thing is very clear to me if our goal were to find deficit reduction in a balanced bipartisan way we could certainly do that we've had models simpson-bowles we've had the Gang of Six we've had the president his conversations with Speaker Boehner we could find a path to very serious deficit reduction but I think it come very clear that that is not the goal of the Republicans in the House of Representatives they keep moving the goalpost making it very evident that their goal is to reduce the public role in the lives of the American people that's why in legend other legislation on the floor like the Interior bill that has been debated today you see you see abandoning clean air standards clean water food safety I've said before I come to this Congress as a mother and a grandmother and we all want to do the best for our children personally but we need a public role their education again clean air clean water food safety we can't do that for ourselves but part of this is to unravel the Republican plan is to a rat unravel 50 years five decades at least a bipartisan progress on behalf of America's middle class families flat out flat out the this bill and the other bills accompanying it will end Medicare well end Medicare will say to seniors you will pay more for your health care costs to get less so that we can give tax breaks to we of tax subsidies to Big Oil we will say to those families we're going to cut Medicaid and what that means to seniors in nursing homes so we can give tax breaks to corporations sending jobs overseas we will say to the young people you're going to pay more for your college loans so that we can give tax cuts to people at the highest end we all know that we have to participate in reducing the deficit everybody has to ante up why is it that the Republicans insist on having the middle class pay the price so that the high end is off the hook if concerned about the addressing the problems of the American people we would end this debate this bill is going nowhere it is a total waste of time and every day that we spend on these waste of time that are not going anyway is another day we are not talking about the highest priority of the American people which is job creation job creation job creation that is their priority we have an obligation an obligation to reduce the deficit and get on with it so it can create jobs if we're concerned about the economic security of the American people and their families we rec'd we must recognize that since the Republicans most recent walking away from the table they've done it on more than one occasion but last Friday when the speaker and the Republicans walked away from the table since that day the stock market has dropped 483 points American the American people have lost over 400 billion dollars in their personal assets 400 billion dollars and every day that goes by and if the market goes down anymore it comes right out of what the American people have have in their 401ks and their pensions and other pensions their savings for their children's education and that and so you know I remember when we had the debate on tarp that was president we cooperated with President Bush at that time too legislation for very unpopular probably the most unpopular vote any of us will have to take but we were on the brink of a financial crisis and we had to act but the Republicans did not step up to the plate and the market went down over said well 777 points the next day is that what they're waiting for for the market to go down not 485 points in the last few days but it's appoints more diminishing the personal assets and wealth of the American people I certainly hope not you know when the speaker walked away and he made his statement Speaker Boehner our speaker said we couldn't reach agreement words to that effect we couldn't connect because we have different visions of America well I believe the speaker when he speaks but I don't believe they have different visions of America President Obama's vision of America is one where we commit we are committed to the education of our children so they can reach their personal fulfillment in our country through innovation continue to be number one that we are committed to creating jobs good-paying jobs for America's workers I think that vision is a vision of the American people the high ground of where we share values the education of our children jobs for our workers the dignified retirement and health security for our seniors and a personal safety and national security for our people all done in a fiscally sound way I think that that's common ground on the high ground of values with and if you believe that if you agree there with those values as I think Speaker Boehner must agree with President Obama on that vision of America you couldn't possibly vote for any of the legislation that the Republicans are bringing to the floor in the in these few days you couldn't possibly because they do they do undermine the education of our children the financial and health security of our seniors the deep cuts early on curtail hurt of the economic recovery and the creation of jobs and it isn't in a fiscally sound way we've taken revenue off of the American people at least think we should have a balanced bipartisan agreement to end this default and to do so in a way that doesn't take us down this path again so let us you know let's be a clear what is on the floor today balanced budget balanced in what way balanced in whose favor it looks like a seesaw to me in favor of the haves at the expense of the great middle class in our country it must be reject

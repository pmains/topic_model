this muslim van 3.0 has caused immense damage to families seeking refuge United States our nation has always stood as a beacon of hope and opportunity a leader in the free world unfortunately over the past few years those values have been tarnished by cruel policies that separate children from their parents wives from their husbands and siblings from one another I'm encouraged to see the judiciary committee moving forward with HR 2 to 1 for the no ban act to repeal the Muslim ban and the broadened non-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to include religious based discrimination I'd like to share a couple stories today of my constituents who have been impacted by this cruel law Ramez alga Zhu Li married his wife Asma in 2015 the war in Syria caused Ramez to move to Mesa Arizona to study Business Administration and management at Mesa Community College while his wife moved to Istanbul Ramez began to create a life for himself in Arizona and started working for the state of Arizona by becoming a business analyst at the Arizona Department of Economic Security yet there was always one thing missing his wife Ramez was a legal permanent resident and petitioned for his wife to join him in Arizona but in 2017 president Trump signed the executive order banning citizens from seven Muslim majority countries from traveling to the United States Syria was one of those countries and despite being eligible for a waiver his wife ESMA was denied a visa with no explanation Ramez wrote to the State Department Department homeland security members of Congress even to the president himself but nothing worked it was not until Ramez went public and decided to share his story with the media that there was moving in the case after three long years ESMA was finally granted a waiver and visa into the United States media attention shouldn't be the mechanism by which immigration cases move forward unfortunately spouses have been the only families impacted nnedi fo helene : and her five-year-old son arrived in Arizona in 2014 as refugees from Somalia in 2016 she filed the appropriate paperwork to request her husband and two children to join her in the United States but because of the Trump administration's Muslim ban what used to take about six and a half months to process can now take years and years to this day three years later he is still waiting for a decision about his children that's unacceptable her now 10 year old son uses mobile apps to talk to his father and siblings and the DFO is watching her two or two other children grow up through Facebook pictures our nation should be building an immigration system that doesn't discriminate based on origin or religion families like nnedi foes should be considered at the heart of our immigration policies not be left behind by them arbitrarily keeping families like these separated does not make our country safer instead it causes undue hardship stress and trauma to families that have already experienced it experienced unconceivable circumstances and simply want to be together i'm proud to be a co-sponsor of HR 2 2 1 4 and hope to see the house consider the bill as soon as possible because hate should have no home here in the United States I yield back

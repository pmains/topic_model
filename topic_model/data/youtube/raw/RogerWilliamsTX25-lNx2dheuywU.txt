treasury secretary jack lew who recently testified before our committee has called the u.s economy a well-oiled machine taking into account stagnant wages the lowest labor participation rate since the 1970s and a national debt of more than 18 trillion dollars i believe we can do better i believe we must do better for hard-working taxpayers and those with low and middle incomes as a business owner of 44 years i see firsthand the effects of washington's policies on job creators every single day ironically the federal regulations passed after the financial collapse of 2008 that were supposedly aimed at wall street are actually crippling main street even though texas is one of the healthiest economies in the country my state has 115 fewer banks today than we did just four years ago the burden of washington's one size fits all regulations are wiping them out in fact on average one community financial institution closes every day in the united states inefficient regulations are not just hurting community banks and credit unions but also the customers who depend on them for example in dublin texas a small town just shy of 4 000 people community bankers have told me that regulatory overreach has made it nearly impossible to make mortgage loans for an average price house which costs around fifty thousand dollars that hurts not only the community bank but also the seller and the buyer it hurts the plumbers the electricians local contractors and hardware stores too who all might benefit from the sale of a home the list is endless my colleagues and i on the house financial services committee care about community banks but we care about their customers even more that's why are we committed to providing much needed regulatory relief to community banks and credit unions this will help grow our economy and will help consumers by ensuring they have access to affordable credit when they need it inefficient top-down regulations from washington limit our choices they make it harder for small businesses to grow thrive and hire workers instead let's grow our economy let's preserve customer choices and let's make it easier for hardworking americans to achieve financial independence i am committed to protecting the free market personal choice and our individual freedoms

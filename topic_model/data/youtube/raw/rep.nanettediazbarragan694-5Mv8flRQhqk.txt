thank you I'm definitely concerned with climate change and what it's doing to to the region and the impact it's going to have on national security with the time remaining left you know if you take a look at the chart as I mentioned there's a pretty remarkable difference between the icebreakers the Russia has in China has should the u.s. be concerned that it's lagging so far behind Russia and China maybe one of the other panelists want to start I won't speak to Coast Guard specific points but yes is the short answer to the question one of the reasons the State Department is working to enhance its presence in the region and diplomatic engagement is precisely because we see our adversaries doing the same and we have to move beyond a point where we're focused solely on the one element of Arctic policy that we've been focused on over the past 20 years as important it is the work of the Arctic Council to ensuring we we we inject respect for and concern about our security into what we do every day and that's precisely what the secretary has asked us to do and that's what lay behind for example our decision to open a new consulate in Greenland Admiral do you want to chime in before I yield back well I think what we propose in a Coast Guard is six 3 1 so we're I think trying to catch the 53 is not something that we think is that aspirational for us talk about six icebreakers total we need to do the job we need to do it both polls three of them need to be heavy icebreakers and we need the first one right now as we've talked about

from Illinois Madam President I might be just a luckiest person in the world because I get to wake up this Sunday and spend Mother's Day well being a mom I'll probably spend the morning helping my one-year-old take a few wobbly steps then in the afternoon watching my four-year-old draw or chasing her around the house celebrating the holiday surrounded by the people I cherished the most but that isn't the case or far far too many other moms and kids around the country that isn't the case for women like Denise Reed Sybrina Fulton or Valerie Castillo who lost their children to gun violence that is in the case for the hundreds of children born in the past year alone whose mom died of preventable pregnancy related deaths and that certainly isn't the case for the families who the Trump administration separated at our southern border and who still have not yet been reunited the kids who were thrown in cages because their parents had the nerve to strive for a better life this Mother's Day I'm thinking of those whose hearts are hurting those mom who would give everything for another lazy Sunday with their sons those daughters who'd do anything to hear their mothers laugh one more time the truth is the women moms or otherwise in this country deserve deserve better than the status quo we deserve more than the term administration which in just two plus years has already changed title 9 sexual assault role rules to favor the accused over the survivor tried to defund health clinics that provide prenatal care and mammograms push forward health care proposals that would have gutted maternity coverage and handed employers the power to decide whether women should have access to birth control all this well it's shocking but unfortunately not surprising because we knew who Donald Trump was when we elected him he's the man who's long made clear he does not care about women or our autonomy he's a man who once argued that women should be punished for taking up the right to choose who's taken pride in trying to put the government between us and our doctors and who would rather throw those doctors in jail than even pretend to care about the women who make up 51% of this nation he's someone who just days ago stood on a stage in Wisconsin and lied lied lied prioritizing a roar from the crowd over the safety of patients and providers at health clinics nationwide and we just last week issued two rules that would make it easier for doctors to either discriminate against women or deny them care altogether so don't tell me that Donald Trump is quote pro-life when he's pushing for rules that endanger women's lives when he spent years trying to strip health care away from Americans don't claim that he's just trying to protect families when he's the one to blame for the inhumane policy that's ripping toddlers and babies away from their mothers arms and don't you dare argue that he's leading the party of life when he won't lift a finger to stop first graders from getting massacred in classrooms by the Dozen now Donald Trump's anti choice dance isn't about looking out for families it's about getting a slap on the back from his base and exerting even more control over women's bodies it's sexist regressive and flat-out dangerous but even while this administration's agenda is a travesty it's not an anomaly rather it's just the latest step in the far right slog March to strip away women's rights and I'm tired of it sick of them trying to shame women when they are the ones who should be ashamed so enough with the apocrypha with the misogyny with some men and hallowed halls and d.c arguing that they know better than moms in Illinois or Arizona or Missouri we can and we must do better that means fighting for everything from equal pay to better parental leave to better parent to leave it means proving that we care about women every day of the year not just on one Sunday in May that's the least that our mothers and daughters and sisters deserve thank you and with that I yield the floor

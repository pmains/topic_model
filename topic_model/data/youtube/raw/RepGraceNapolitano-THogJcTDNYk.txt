my colleague from California mr. Paulo Tom Thank You mr. chairman and thank you the witnesses for being with us today I've no objection to the hearing and its emphasis but the concern however remains that this hearing only looks at one side of the coin it only looks at new surface storage it doesn't look at groundwater storage efficiencies water recycling desalination and of course education this is our second here specifically on this issue since the last period we have not looked at any of the other options if we're looking for solutions to our water problems and for certainty for our communities then we must all have full consideration of all other options including storage and other alternatives such as desalination and recycling we cannot just prioritize the option that is the most expensive least efficient takes longer to create and increase the most environmental conflict there is no argument that the about the impact reclamation projects have had on on the west nearly 40 million people now depend on water from reclamation projects but the enormous fiscal environmental cost of these projects was the development of prime locations for surface storage projects has led us to look at different alternatives our majority will argue that environmental regulations have hindered construction new facilities in the West the biggest issue to dam construction is of course cost how can Congress guarantee this community's the billions the federal appropriate dollars that are necessary for construction it's also important to note that 22 billion dollars reclamation is already spent on major water projects only twenty-five percent or 5.2 billion have been repaid to the federal government any authorization of new storage projects will have to compete for funding in Reclamation's limited budget which is probably a million billion some billion and a half I can't remember the exact amount and add to the federal debt associated with the private water projects the biggest impediment to dam construction is limited federal funding new starts when appropriate is not impossible in California said to 5.6 million acre feet in New groundwater and surface water storage in the last 20 years this includes new water surface water storage like contra costes water district los Vaqueros project which has 60 thousand acre feet construction completed last summer on time on budget and no litigation in my own district the multiple water district completed diamond valley reservoir in 2003 adding eight hundred thousand acre feet of capacity to our local water supply system and they did so with no federal funding and in compliance with all environmental regulations however water managers have already realized they cannot wait to compete for limited federal dollars or the 20 30 years or so it will take to construct the facility they need to solve problems now water managers are looking for projects that involve limited federal involvement and can produce water wet water on a faster scale this can also be seen in the 53 water recycling projects Congress is authorized since 1990 to help facilities recommission is already held facility facilitate the conservation of six hundred and sixteen thousand acre feet of water from 2010 2 2013 2012 with title 16 water smart grants and other conservation programs Reclamation's current goal is to conserve accumulation total since 2009 of seven hundred and eighty thousand acre feet of water by the end of 2014 the threat to our water supply is real we have many challenges like climate change decreased snowpack increased demand and development of alternative water intensive fuels like oil shale not all of the water needs in the West can or should be met by new dams or bigger dams new storage is not always the right answer or the only answer and the same can be said of water recycling your desalination what works for what community may not work for others and we must select the most effective and affordable solution to know the right solution for the communities to have all options on the table and looking at surface storage does not provide our water managers with a baseline data you need to conserve for all our communities and mr. chairman I'd like to introduce the record

Right now, it costs one-hundred bucks to fill
this up and a thousand bucks to fill this up. We're all feeling it. Families and businesses getting squeezed because
of broken supply chains and corporate greed. I'm Congresswoman Kim Schrier and I'm leading
the fight to suspend the federal gas tax to get prices down. And I'm holding big oil accountable so they
stop ripping us off. I approve this message and I'll keep fighting
to bring down gas prices for you.

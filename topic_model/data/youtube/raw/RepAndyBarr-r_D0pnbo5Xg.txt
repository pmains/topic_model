say this is an interesting conversation and when i hear some of the testimony i do i do detect a paternalistic hostility to what i consider to be the found the foundation of our free markets and that foundation is the freedom to take risk it's paternalistic because i hear an elitist sentiment that only sophisticated only highly educated or institutional investors know what they're doing and government should intervene to restrict commission free trading to protect retail investors from themselves that government knows best and retail investors are simply not smart enough to allocate their own capital for themselves i think there's hostility because it sounds like some of the witnesses want to pull risk taking completely out of the system let's be honest that is code for doing away with free market capitalism now this is the second of what is expected to be a three-hearing uh episode on this topic the majority has concocted a series of villains in this saga the first it was the hedge funds who supposedly collaborated and colluded with robin hood then it was the practice of short selling then it was payment for order flow now it's the so-called gamification of investing as if creating user-friendly platforms that attract wider swaths of investors is a bad thing provided that no securities laws are broken or consumer protections are compromised it's not the role of congress or regulators to dictate the constructs of a user experience if investors like the platform it will succeed if they don't it won't mr peterbar how might additional poorly tailored regulations on financial technology like app based investment platforms slow the expansion of retail investor participation in the capital markets yes thank you congressman barr for for that question um one of the concerns about um you know slowing down uh access for retail investors is is the equitable access what different impact will it have on low-income households who are already put at a disadvantage um from the accredited investor definition uh and if i may just address uh i think there's a straw man argument brought up by congressman heinz um there there's not this world where people are putting all their money into a robin hood app and trading all of their portfolio all the time or they're putting all their money into a vanguard index fund what we see is that a lot of investors are very sophisticated put some of their money into passive index funds low cost and then take a little bit of it and and try to create a little bit of alpha and see how they are at in some ways mr people are that's a that's a very good point and i think we we shortchange uh the intelligence of some of these retail investors when we just assume that they are not diversified let me ask you another question about payment for water flow would restrictions on payment for overflow or an outright ban on uh payment for overflow impact price uh improvement for retail investors and if so what would that impact be well so the first the first likely event we're going to see is that we're going to return to commission-based trading free commission trading would go away again that would have different impact and the second point i would mike is that if we're back into a world where there's another conflict of interest and that's the turning of accounts in order to generate commissions right so it's been said in the testimony that there's an incentive to generate revenue by more trading for payment for order flow that same incentive exists in in a world where you have commission-based trading and in a prior part of my career i actually worked as an expert witness on behalf of plaintiff who were um arbitrating against um in broker customer disputes and offender arbitration uh returning accounts and so again that's another thing that just has to be monitored for compliance and important i i i don't have time to ask the question to mr grujic again but i think his point about forcing a combination of retail and institutional flow uh will have a negative impact on price improvement for retail investors and i think that stands repeating and an unintentional consequence of excessive restrictions on pfop a final question um mr pipivar mr kelleher and some of the other witnesses have argued today that existing best execution requirements do not sufficiently address what they consider to be conflicts of interest associated with payment for order flow uh do you agree and has payment portal in any way canceled broker dealer's duties to route customer orders to achieve best so execution answer to your last question is no they have not canceled that um what i've said in my testimony is that of course the sec should revisit its best execution rule in in light of um zero commission trading um best execution is a multi-factor multi-dimensional thing that the scc looks at and so markets change markets evolve um technology evolved of course the fbc has to represent that but there's been no there's been no diminishing of it in fact the sec vigorously enforces the best execution rule thank you my time is expired i yield

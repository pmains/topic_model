fifty-three years ago on July 30th 1965 President Lyndon B Johnson signed landmark legislation to establish Medicare and Medicaid to essential programs that provide health care to over 120 million Americans and over 1 million Nevadans when President Johnson signed this historic bill he said no longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine no longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years no longer will young families see their own incomes and their own hopes eaten away simply because they are carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents and to their uncles and their aunts and no longer will this nation refuse the hand of justice to those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and labor to the progress of this progressive country on that day LBJ declared an end to an era in which health care was denied to the most vulnerable members of our communities and so I rise today to celebrate the incredible progress we have made since President Johnson created Medicare and Medicaid we lifted hundreds of millions of Americans out of abject poverty and provided hundreds of millions more with dignity security and peace of mind and then in 2010 passed the Affordable Care Act which was built on the foundation that President Johnson laid and gave 20 million additional Americans including hundreds of thousands of net Nevadans access to affordable health care coverage but today is not just for celebration because our work is not done yet prescription drug prices premiums and co-pays are still too high too many Americans can't afford the medicine they need to live too many Americans can't find a doctor whose office is less than a day's drive away too many Americans are still struggling to get health care that meets their basic needs instead of trying to expand access to health care some of my Republican colleagues here in Congress are working every single day to attack the Affordable Care Act and strip health care coverage away from tens of millions of Americans some Republican leaders are now threatening to cut Medicare and Medicaid in order to pay for president Trump's massive tax cuts to torque corporations and special interest groups the Republican tax bill exploded our deficit by 1.5 trillion dollars and now they're demanding cuts to critical health care programs to pay for their lavish corporate CEO giveaway so it's not enough to celebrate our progress when President Johnson signed the Social Security Administration justice and inequality today we have to rededicate ourselves to that fight we have to protect strengthen and improve the Affordable Care Act we have to lower the cost of prescription drugs and invest in the health of every community we have to create an affordable public health insurance option that would be available to everyone in the United States regardless of their income level and we have to fight back against cuts to Medicare and Medicaid because the fight to protect our health care is a fight to protect our dignity our security and our basic rights and with that mr. president I yield the floor

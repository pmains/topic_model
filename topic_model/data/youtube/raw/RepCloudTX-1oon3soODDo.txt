mr. cloud thank you kind of picking up where we left off one of the issues we were talking about was housing I appreciate it you mentioning the trailers we had conversations about that offline about the amazing cost of it one of the other issues that was kind of complicating it was the FEMA staff that would be deployed would often take up the available temporary housing that residents could use for recovery my question is meanwhile trailers were sitting on an airstrip waiting for the approval process to be placed in where they could with residents who need recovery so has FEMA considered using those trailers to house its own employees freeing up the temporary housing space to allow residents back into their communities meaning would have to stay at hotels two hours away because the local ones were taken up by FEMA employees and then not available to help with their own recovery projects and and and that's a very fair and great question it's something that we have to balance it very delicately the last thing that I want to do is have my response staff taking up rooms that we're also trying to utilize through our transitional shelters capabilities and so we want to be able to access those hotels for disaster victims or disaster survivors and what we try to do is set up base camps we try to for our own responders but it always takes us a couple days to get our feet width under you know underneath us when we when we respond the second part when it comes to utilizing trailers here again we're having two stage trailers all over the country right now because of what's going on in Paradise or what's going on and Michael and still you know the issues that are coming in Texas the biggest thing that stands in the way of us typically getting trailers put into place is local permitting and ordinance is like the not in my backyard ordinance is that that actually delay us from being able to get getting into the property and then if you look at you know paradise California which is the worst disaster I've ever seen in my life and all of you should take a trip over there and go see what the devastation was and in California is that there's nothing to hook a trailer up to there's no supporting infrastructure whatsoever and you know housing is incredibly difficult so I go back to what I what I think would be best is granting Authority you know if I if I could block grant that funding to Governor Abbott and Governor Abbott could follow his own procurement laws to go by every travel trailer that's in the state of Texas that's the way the model should work rather than me having to go through a large contract and purchasing manufactured housing units from some other you know company located wherever Governor Abbott ought to be able to go to all the Lots in Texas that sell travel trailers and buy them in a market you know competitive market rate that's how it should work thank you we talked about the process the length of the process if I can just as a visual aid that's the FEMA process yeah and very very complicated in in spite of what people are going through you know I'd talked someone in Smithville they had three different site visits to the same site each with teams of seven people each not aware of what the previous team had done and Wharton they had seven site visits to the same River each time with a different team there was a ten thousand dollar grant that one small community was applying for that had the same thirty-two approval touch points as as someone applying for a million dollar grant so my questions really is how can FEMA reform the process so that it's streamlined but also so that there's a single point of contact in a single warehouse of information so that you know ideally staff won't change but when it does have to change that there have access to what's been done to this point because so many times it just felt like starting from scratch eight months into the process yep so so goal number three under reduce the complexity what I think would be best is that if we submitted for the record what we're trying to do to reduce the burden of in the process you know if you go back to I believe it was Harvey and we need to go back and confirm the but I think as a result of Harvey we had to physically perform 2.3 million home inspections why can't we just use technology well here's why because if we if we use technology and we get something wrong then I get hit with a negative OIG report well and so we're having strike the right balance so your point there would be residents who had the forethought to think before I start making my own home repairs I'm going to take pictures of my house right the very thing why can't I use satellite imagery as it wasn't yeah FEMA taken by a FEMA Rep those photos were not submissive exactly and that's where FEMA wants to go trust me we want to make things streamlined and cut down the time frame but you know and I learned this Harvey I'd been in office two months and Harvey was my first real disaster of going through and I will bloom I mind that it it takes 17,000 people to go do 2.3 million home inspections that's a ridiculous process do we not have technology satellite imagery or aerial imagery or you know take the word for of the citizen to be able to do it and rapidly approve it now we get hit all the time because we're not protecting against fraud but I would argue that fraud has print that the the fraud that my planet is know minimal compared to the contract it takes me to do the home inspections so it's a balance but then I'm caught in a rock in a hard place because if I don't protect against fraud I'm dragged in front of a committee and told you're not protecting against fraud so we have to strike the right balance and I agreed that process is too long we have to do what we can to cut forward I'm not a fan of 2 CFR that the guides how money is put forward I think it's there's two different standards there's a double standard for the federal government or the state governments and the local governments and we need to go through that fine-tune it and streamline it and put put money forward I think after a disaster everybody is trying to do the best that they can and to move as quickly as they can and I know my agency is working on it it would seem to me that for all the best intentions of eliminating waste that we've created a system of waste I look forward to your report to see the specifics that's being done I know my time is limited so I'll submit further questions and to you and look forward to response but thank you trust me we're after the same thing we want to accomplish sainthood streamlining gentleman yields back

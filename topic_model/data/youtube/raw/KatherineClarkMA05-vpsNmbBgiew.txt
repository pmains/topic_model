i can tell you that the house democrats understand this to their core and that was one of the reasons that uh mitch mcconnell gave why wouldn't uh wouldn't make a deal he did not want to spend a single dollar increasing programs to feed hungry americans just think about that one in eight families over thanksgiving went to bed hungry people are actually putting their children as one mom told me to bed early so they have less time to feel the hunger pains as we go into this holiday season let's think about our neighbors and what builds strong communities and it starts with those pillars the basics we have enough in this country to feed everybody we can make sure that people don't fall into poverty that they are able to keep a roof over their head and even gain one we can make sure that americans have what they need in unemployment and stimulus checks to weather this pandemic while we wait for a vaccine and improvements in testing and treatment but this doesn't happen without congress and mitch mcconnell and the senate republicans have been opposed at every turn so we will take this opportunity if they're having a change of heart to make sure that we do the most we can until we can get to an administration that is going to turn its focus on the security and the prosperity of the american people

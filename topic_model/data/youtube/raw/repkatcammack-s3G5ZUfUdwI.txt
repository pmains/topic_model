this time I would like to recognize myself the gentlelady from Florida for five minutes uh I I approach this in two ways as kind of the baby of the group The Millennial uh here on on the committee but also as the wife of a first responder my husband is a swap medic a firefighter medic and actually I was texting him and I said uh you know did you have an overdose yesterday and he said yes Squad 3 had an overdose and he's working in overtime today and he's on sequad 3 and he says inevitably without fail you can put money on it we will have an overdose today as someone who has been married to a first responder who sees this I think one of the one of the elements that's been kind of left out today is the first responder I know Elio's you guys do a tremendous job and there's so many resources that are out there for other things except for this you know and I feel like sometimes with the Narcan issue we we continue to push Narcan as a Band-Aid and it does save lives without a doubt it does save lives but I think we're we need to do far more than continue to put push Narcan because we are now seeing and Sheriff I'm sure you could probably it talk speak to this we're now seeing Narcan parties where people will go and they'll buy the Narcan from CBS or from they'll get them from the public spaces that Leos and and our First Responders place them in public restrooms and then they'll have Narcan parties to see how far they can push that High um so that's a real a real issue Sheriff I'd like to pose this question to you about resources I know a few um I think representative Duncan asked about grants particularly with with you guys is there a grant that you can use perhaps like a cops Grant to have specific training done for your techs is there anything in this space that is specific to combating the fentanyl poisonings that we have and the tech element so for the tech element um absolutely I think um I don't I am unaware of any Grant through the cops office or through uh Bureau of Justice assistance that would specifically provide funding for uh employees with the expertise to monitor social media honestly that is how I ended up you know hiring and employing seven investigative analysts who are civilians because they had the expertise I didn't have the time or ability to train my commission law enforcement people to do it so I think a grant like that particularly in some smaller communities that could be a very effective way to allow law enforcement to get on top of this problem if we can resolve some of these issues at the tech and may I add it's not just the physical risk to our the people on the front lines right there is a real mental health issue here yes um and I know just receiving calls speaking to parents it takes a toll I cannot imagine what many of these First Responders are going through having to walk into homes every single day to find dead children thank you for for mentioning that um the the mental health and PTSD issues within our first responder Community is a huge issue but since my time is limited I want to try to get into some other issues um we talk about Snapchat extensively here today obviously Snapchat is hosted on either the Apple store or Google Play is there any issue within the terms of service because these apps have to be hosted on these platforms and that's a whole nother issue in itself but is there a terms of service that we can put pressure on say the Google Android side of issue or apple per se to force them to say if this app is not complying with XYZ we will de-platform you well so Google and apple both say that they don't they can have terms of service but they have no obligation to actually abide by them they'll still say that that they're just a um an online Marketplace um but interestingly when we were preparing our um our legal complaint against snap we realized that the Apple Store says that snap users can be as young as 12. wow um which even snap says that users have to be 13 and also you raise such a great point because Apple and Google have so much user information so they know how old a user is that same user can go install snap and lie about their age there is so much here that I feel like we don't even we haven't even began to scratch a surface geofencing we talked a lot about the advertisement I know that there was a judge in Virginia that rejected a warrant that was using the geofencing advertising scope as as a means to get that information I don't think I've heard anybody talk about geofencing yet today and I think that would be a huge part of the way that people can be targeted particularly with Snapchat and then um another issue and I know I'm running short on well my time has expired but um metaverse we are now seeing uh the the dope Wars where they're talking about crypto highs in the med overs and now we're seeing where people are able to go buy drugs in the metaverse and then they are delivered to their home um I think that's the next generation of of where we're going to see this issue going so um I know my time's expired so we can't really talk about that but um just thoughts and we can talk afterwards but thank you

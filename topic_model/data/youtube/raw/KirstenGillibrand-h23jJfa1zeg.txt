it's the right to a safe and affordable nursery one idea I really like is the baby bundles idea because it means when you're taking home your infant you're actually gonna have everything with you you need for the whole first month as a young mother I would have loved a baby bundle and what it is it's a box that can be used as a crib filled with the items that your infants going to need and that just gives enormous relief to a parent who doesn't have a lot of resources and particularly first-time parent who might not know all the things that baby needs [Music]

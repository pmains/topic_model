good evening hello everybody I'm Ethel evening and I'm honored and delighted to be with you so many of you at the opening of J Street an anniversary conference I along with Abbott Alma Brown my friend to represent women wage peace a movement began began to enough years ago just by a handful of women after the last war in Gaza the protective age saying enough is enough today today we number now and now thirty five thousand registered members from across the spectrum of is of Israeli civil society that number in proportion to the USA population would be the equivalent of two million people not a negligible amount during my time as a Knesset member representing the secular party Jinhui I served on the security and foreign affairs committee one of only two women among 15 male generals how did I get to be in a member of this committee a very prestigious committee Tom millipede who was then the leader of my party asked me when I came to the Knesset which committee I would like to join in the Knesset I immediately answered security and foreign affairs there was silent on the other side of the phone and then a long laugh what do you know about security in my dear friend 18 he asked me and what do you know I answered he hang up the phone the next day I became a member of the coma [Applause] I believe it is crucial to have civilians especially women involved in security decision when women influence decision about war and peace we can break the endless cycles of violence and bloodshed like the tragic escalation we are saying now on the Gaza border my involvement in politics especially on behalf of women and peace taught me that achieving real lasting agreement bringing to security to Israeli and Palestinians would require a broad movement because Israel in order to build support from the ground up and/or hold our leaders accountable to finding a sustainable solution so several friends and myself we began to envision such a movement a womb a women's movement for peace we knew that to be effective we had to emphasize a lot of quality we cherish inclusiveness compassion looking at the need of the others and the fact that all of us are mothers all mothers are all side free the same about their children we consciously decided we would leave behind the burdens of history as well as the blame game we started to talk to more women all kinds of women women we would never encountered in our day-to-day lives women whom I previously had no real opportunity to meet women I never thought I would consider sisters in a movement for peace I met Donna from Damona and Yael forms the road both for my Hakan and right wing backgrounds the ethics and applicants were so different for mine but they like me are mothers who just want the children to be safe and are open to looking for different solutions I met me Harlan tomorrow religious women from the settlements whom I thought would be opposed to what I believed in only to discover that they too long for fair solution I met Goodell and a man brave Arab women citizens of Israel who were not only willing to join a group of mostly Jewish women but who are also already in able to act as an important bridge to Palestinian women in order to advance an acceptable agreement today I work with a team of women which piece member to convince political leader at all level that yes peace is possible and that they already have the support of tens of thousands of diverse Israeli women who want them to take immediate step towards negotiation our team is now supplemented with 5,200 women who come to Jerusalem every week the Knesset is in session to discuss one-on-one with Knesset member the connection between peace security and Israel future indeed every MK now recognized the persistent tireless women of women wage peace during the Knesset Monday plenum MK is often waved to us from the speaker's podium as women bridge piece sits together in the gallery in solidarity women who have traveled from all over the country some with the herd covered in hats or scarves other than rosado's other bell all wearing white turquoise like me MK is from across the political spectrum have expressed the gratitude allowed for our having returned the word peace to the national conversation here is what I can tell you for sure after three and half years of activism with women which piece we Israeli women learning to collaborate in the struggle to find a way to peace I know that what we have in common is greater than what separates us this realization has transformed me it has made me more tolerant attentive and open to new possibilities we can work I believe I totally believe that we can work together to achieve a peaceful outcome and a better future thank you [Applause]

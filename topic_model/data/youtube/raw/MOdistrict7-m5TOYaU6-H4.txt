Mr Speaker I rise today to address an important issue the attack against America and its citizens by terrorists in Benghazi four Americans including our ambassador Chris Stevens have been killed the American people deserve the truth about Benghazi and who was responsible not convenience stories blaming some the violence on some filmmakers free speech the people who died deserve justice as we investigate this attack and those responsible and their excuse me as we investigate this attack and the response of this civilians and military leaders in command we must determine whether the paralysis that seemed to characterize the government's reaction with result of individual bad decisions or a broader institutional problem our military and our soldiers are the most capable in the world but if their commanders refuse to send them into battle they cannot safeguard American lives or interest the American people and our allies abroad need to know the United States has the resolved act in the face of uncertainty our enemies need to know that when they attack Americans they do so at great danger because Americans do not leave our people behind times for purposes gentlemen

report on the unprecedented supreme court leak rocking the nation politico obtaining a draft majority opinion suggesting the high court is set to strike down roe versus wade republicans are accusing a liberal law clerk of leaking the document to intimidate justices in order to change the outcome of the ruling constitutional law expert jonathan turley calls the leak a breach of the most fundamental obligations and traditions of the supreme court florida congressman michael joins us now congressman good morning to you how does a draft opinion like this from the supreme court get leaked and what happens to the leaker well i think that's that's unclear at this point because it's never happened before to my knowledge this is just this is just so outrageous uh that this draft opinion was leaked it's clearly an attempt to influence uh the outcome but guys be prepared for the scorched earth tactics of the left on this issue they truly believe the ends justify the means no matter what laws or what norms they have to break and be prepared for a kavanaugh like approach to the supreme court on this one and they are going to burn it down as you're hearing the activists say in order to try to stop this and what's such a shame is that many pro-life activists many people who believe in the sanctity of life abided by the law for nearly 50 years uh even though they believe that child uh life was being unjustly taken but i would not expect that same courtesy from the other side for our nation's system and for its rule of law you know congressman democrats are pushing for a full-blown power grab on this they're urging congress to take action without any republican support bernie sanders is tweeting this congress must pass legislation that codifies roe versus wade as the law of the land in this country now and if there aren't 60 votes in the senate to do it we must end the filibuster to pass it with 50 votes you're a republican in congress do you think this is something that democrats can do and will try to do oh i think they'll absolutely try to do it it's quite ironic right if you actually read the draft opinion it's basically saying this is in the purview of lawmakers but yet then you're hearing the left saying lawmakers should be the one to take action uh i don't see it getting through uh the senate at the end of the day uh but again this is going to be burn it down scorched earth you know whoever we have to trash and whatever we have to rip up in terms of this country's traditions and laws they'll do it because this is ends justify the means congressman it is primary election day in ohio how does this leak impact the midterm elections and does this give democrats energy you know i don't i don't see it impacting the primary in ohio necessarily i depending on what the supreme court says if they do overturn roe versus wade how would that impact the midterm elections oh look i i think that's absolutely one of the reasons it was leaked in order to politically impact the elections and and what the democrats are hoping is this will re-energize a base that has been so disappointed with the biden administration so that was absolutely one of the aims of this leak yeah carlson let's turn to ukraine i know this is a topic that you've been very passionate about yesterday i spoke with brett velikovic uh he's his former special operator and intel guy and he made this shocking allegation i hope when president biden visits lockheed martin very soon who are the guys that make the javelin missile that somebody asked him who exactly within his administration is blocking the release of the javelin training simulators from going into ukraine it's making it so they are less effective in the field and in some cases even failing on the front lines when being fired there's a lot to kind of read into there congressman that's what can i ask you a little bit more point blank is he saying that we are purposefully or somehow in in the lodge in the log train sending not our best equipment or faulty equipment do you understand what he's saying and do you agree with him there yeah so there's multiple components to the javelin and i'm hearing from veterans that are on the front lines with ukrainian special forces as well that sometimes the missile shows up but not the launcher sometimes the launcher not the appropriate batteries or systems and in this case uh what he's saying is that the training uh component isn't showing up that would make the ukrainians much more effective so what you have to understand is when those items go across the border we are losing all visibility uh and we're losing chain of custody and we don't know really where it's going and how effective it is and on the visit from biden we have to look at the irony there it was the obama and biden administration that blocked the javelin refused to send the javelin in 2014 when russia invaded it was only president trump that sent this system in but now biden's going to go to a defense contractor and try to take credit it's the height of iron and congressmen from ukraine to china chinese officials reportedly held a meeting last month and they're looking at ways to protect their economy and the in the event that the west sanctions china the way that we have ukraine i'm sorry rather russia does that mean that they are already preparing for an invasion of taiwan oh they're absolutely preparing uh they're preparing militarily they're preparing diplomatically around the world and they're preparing economically and one of the ways to do that is to sanction proof their economy i don't believe it's imminent in the next year but i do believe it's imminent in the next five years uh and we're seeing that from from the intelligence economically they have to sanction proof their economy that means moving away from the dollar we're seeing that in terms of how they buy their oil there are reports that they're looking to buy that in the yuan and their currency they're moving to a digital currency but the biggest thing they're doing is creating dependencies on china that the rest of the world can't do without that's why they produce 90 of rare earth minerals that's why they produce 90 of computer chips pharmaceuticals and we can go down the line we have to bring our supply chains home

without objection the gentleman from Texas is recognized for one minute mr. speaker yesterday I introduced a bill that would authorize a request the president toured our nation's highest military honor to a Texan who served this nation with distinction and bravery Chris Kyle a Navy SEAL protected countless American troops as they went into battle Chris Kyle voluntarily put his life on the line when he completed his first tour in Iraq and when he returned not once but three more times make no mistake the Medal of Honor will not bring back a husband father son in a model Texan but the Medal of Honor will show Chris Kyle's family our gratitude for his relentless devotion to our country mr. speaker since its inception the medal of honor has been awarded 3507 times I challenge someone to tell me Chris Kyle didn't show the bravery that is prerequisite for this high honor I challenge anyone tell me that his courageous acts are undeserving of this recognition Chris Kyle is someone who we should strive to be he is a true American patriot whose acts of Valor must be permanently etched in our nation's history In God We Trust I yield back

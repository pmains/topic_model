hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update busy week in DC coming off the Thanksgiving holiday so a couple quick updates so number one we had a hearing with secretary minutia and Treasury secretary on a handful of items I focused specifically on the World Bank and China's influence over the World Bank the reason why this is important to me and I think it should be important to everybody is because we the US taxpayers are the largest funders of the World Bank so everything that goes on at the World Bank your taxpayer dollars are supporting and the way it's operating today we the US taxpayer through the World Bank are funding discounted loans to the Chinese government to develop their economy and spread that development model across the world let's remind ourselves as to what that development model is this is a communist country that in turns its own people in concentration camps has social credit scores were there monitoring literally every single thing their people are doing and scoring them with respect to their loyalty to the Communist Party and not to mention the crackdowns that you're seeing in Hong Kong and so if that development model is the dominant development model across the world we are all in a world of trouble and we've already seen what China's done to our manufacturing sector in Northeast Ohio imagine if they become the global leader writ large across the entire economy we're all in trouble so I'm doing everything I can inside of the financial services committee to stop that we have jurisdiction over the World Bank and so I I press secretary manoosh in on that specifically how we were gonna get China to stop using American dollars subsidized loans from the World Bank to develop their economy and so it was a good hearing we'll continue to beat that drum I did an interview on CNBC which we posted earlier so if you want more details I'd direct you there but but at a basic level I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that China's influence over our economy and the world is as minimal as humanly possible and secondly and and closer to home and horrible unfortunately am we we got a word the other day there was an article written on a priest in Strongsville who has been trafficking in child pornography a couple weeks ago the New York Times released a report that basically highlighted how prevalent this is in our society and and a lot of the images that are being trafficked are being done over social media so I think Facebook submitted 20 million images to the federal government for investigation the reason why they were looking for him so they the fact that they found them is actually a good thing the fact there's 20 million there's obviously a horrible thing but but we I read that report and I read that article and I thought let's look and see if this is happening in our own community and unfortunately we were alerted that there were some people in the community that were trafficking in this and so we put a bill forward to help fund the tracking and the cracking down on this specific thing it hasn't passed yet but but that's an initiative that were working on and honestly I in a million years wouldn't have expected it to come out so quickly and for for this to happen right in our backyard but a priest in Strongsville an Akron ativ was just arrested on these charges and so we are going to do everything we can to obviously assist law enforcement make sure that justice is served and that this never happens again in our community and we'll continue to work on legislative solutions as well but there's simply nothing I can imagine that would be more horrifying for a parent than to get a phone call that at your school at your child's school there's somebody priest no less whose trafficking and child pornography just absolutely horrifying so if you have any issues with that or if you're into the Strongsville community and this is affecting you directly please do reach out to us because we are like I said we're gonna we're gonna track it down and do everything we can to assist law enforcement make sure justice is served as quickly and as forcefully as possible and and then with that as always I just want to thank you for for sending me here it's been a great week and hopefully buddy has a great weekend

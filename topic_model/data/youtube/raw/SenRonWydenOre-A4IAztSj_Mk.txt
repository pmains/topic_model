madam chair and I very much appreciate your holding this up this hearing and I think we both know that reminiscing around here could just be insufferable I do just briefly want to note that you and I have a history on this topic when I was chair we held a hearing to discuss our comprehensive bipartisan bill the Murkowski Wyden critical minerals Policy Act that bill was smart minerals policy because it demonstrated that efficient predictable management of US mineral supplies and protecting America's land and water are not mutually exclusive that bill showed it is possible to do both now today's hearing is especially important because in my view the president has embarked on an about-face on both fronts the Trump administration is now promoting an unfair policy on tariffs that means that because of his approach with respect to tariffs on critical minerals US companies will be needlessly hurt in their ability to compete and this is going on while simultaneously there is an effort to gut the environmental laws that is a real combination hurting family-wage jobs and clean air and water in my view foolish even by Washington DC Beltway stands here's why the u.s. imports most of these key minerals including 100 percent of rare earth metals the imports come mostly from China critical minerals are at the heart of technologies like solar cells wind turbines and batteries that are moving our country to a more efficient lower carbon energy future they are essential to creating more red white and blue jobs as a clean energy economy already supports 6.4 million jobs across the country now as the chair just noted it's especially important this morning to also talk about trade issues and as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee with jurisdiction over trade my trade philosophy has been real simple Make It in America grow it in America add value to it in America and then ship it somewhere one sentence instead of that kind of approach which means you have to have a level playing field for our red white and blue manufacturers the president is now taking a bad situation and making it worse our manufacturers are already heavily dependent on Chinese supplies and China has made it difficult for them to obtain raw materials now the president wishes to make it even harder for US manufacturers with a flawed tariff approach that would impose new u.s. tariffs on the raw materials imports making it yet more expensive and Poe had potentially prohibitive for US tech manufacturers to make products here at home in 2010 China tried to restrict the export of critical rare earth minerals causing both price spikes and supply shortages across the tech sector the United States successfully challenged China before the World Trade Organization and we were able to restore a measure of stability in the market but now thanks to the Trump administration US manufacturers that depend on China for these and other critical materials are once again in great jeopardy to basically have that trade policy that I just outlined growing things here making things here American manufacturers have to have access to critical minerals the president's trade strategy is almost impossible to divine but what I know for sure is that we get a daily dose of trade chaos and that kind of chaos particularly here threatens access to minerals and it will be American workers and American companies who suffer for it our countries come a long way inefficiently locating extracting processing and using critical minerals and I want to come back just as we wrap up because I see senator Manchin is here enjoy going to West Virginia and talking about energy policy with him colleagues this does not have to be an either/or choice making sure we have markets for our companies while not harming our land air and water those things are not mutually exclusive we can have smart policies that do both and I think I remember miss trigger we talked about this some already once here in this committee so I am very much in favor as I know the chair is in developing domestic supplies of rare earth and critical minerals and the two of us showed back in 2013 how to go about doing it we also called for a review of federal hardrock mining regulations permitting which the chair noted in leasing procedures so I really look forward to this morning's discussion we shouldn't have to wait another six years to come out with the kind of smart policy that I thought the chair and I were striving for back in 2013 madam chair thank you and look forward to tackling this issue and I know a number of others with you senator

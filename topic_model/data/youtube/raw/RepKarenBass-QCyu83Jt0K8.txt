california congresswoman karen bass is on a mission to make sure that the legacy of the late john lewis lives on by getting the voting rights act restored before november's presidential election which just may have her and also her name is one of the names that could be on this ticket we have to say thank you for coming and please welcome chair of the congressional black caucus karen bass good morning thank you thank you for coming today thanks for having me on you thank you you you and and john lewis were were colleagues and friends for many years what's what's your favorite memory of him well actually taking him to an organization that i started in south central los angeles 30 years ago because i wanted him to meet two generations of young people that he influenced and i wanted them to tell him specifically the impact that they had had that he had had on their life and that was a really sweet moment i'm so glad we did that so um congresswoman upholding voting rights was john lewis's life's work but the voting rights advancement act which he championed has been sitting on uh mitch mcconnell's desk for over 200 days and we are just three months away from the election uh is he going to just sit on it what can you do to make sure this bill passes well really it just amounts to public pressure but you know what we're going to introduce another bill because when we did it before it was before covet now it's even more important because we're worried that a great way to suppress the vote is to make people have to risk their lives to go vote and you know people should be able to vote from home and so we're going to introduce that uh also very soon next few days congresswoman bass i have to ask this question it is rumored that you are on the short list to be considered for joe biden's vice president is there any truth to that are you being vetted and what would a biden bass ticket look like what do you think he would bring to it and i i would really love a straight answer so many people dodged it i know and i'm so sorry but you know we'll refer those to the campaign i wish i could be more forthcoming but let me just tell you that i am so concerned about the way this country has been torn apart over the last three and a half years and we need to heal this country literally because i am worried that when president biden is sworn in in january and i don't want to to take it for granted but we're going to do everything to get him elected that we could be facing not only a depression but how many more people have to die and you know i worked in the medical field for a number of years right at the beginning of the aids epidemic and so i empathize number one for all of those families that have lost relatives but also for the hospital workers who risked their lives and so i am willing to do whatever it takes number one to get him elected but also to make sure that he has a successful presidency we have so much to do in this country congresswoman uh vice president biden said this week that there are four black women on his list for potential vice presidential picks i believe it would be a very smart move quite frankly for biden to choose a black woman to be his vice president given that black women have long been the backbone of the democratic party yet that support has not been reflected in who is representing the constituency in the white house i mean every single uh voting block asks and demands for representation yet when black women ask for that representation uh they're questioned about it and told that they're asking for too much um your thoughts well absolutely i mean i would love to see that i heard that too about four women uh i would love to see that but you know at the end of the day who knows better who to choose to be the vice president than a former vice president and i'm hoping that whoever he picks that they have a relationship together like we saw with obama biden i think that was one of the nicest things about those eight years it seemed to be such a camaraderie and you know that's not always the case and so somebody who will work with him as a good partner and somebody who is willing to take on some of the challenges we face you know another big challenge that we face is the racial divide because this president from the time he wrote down that escalator he has attacked every ethnic group lately he's focusing on asians by calling by saying that the virus was caused by china and you know there's been this whole upsurge in anti-asian violence and so the healing that needs to take place in our country is racial healing as well and you know let's see i want to talk a little bit about this crazy virus because the state of california now is is experiencing a surge in the coronavirus cases right gilgar city is warning that uh la is on the verge of shutting down again i mean i feel like i know what happened but what do you think happened and how did you get back to that place and and what do you need to do to get it to a level that is workable again yeah you know i think it's so sad especially when you see all these other states who are doing all the wrong things and california did the right things and we did it early we were aggressive on the state level the county and the city level and so what they're suspecting now is is that maybe when we opened up it was a little too soon you know we also have extra problems in los angeles i mean in los angeles county on any given day you were talking about over 50 000 people that are homeless and then you know you also can't stop people from coming into the state so the i the analysis i think is underway but i think the current thinking is is that maybe when we decided to open up we did it just a little too soon so i think it's very sad that we might have to close down again it's kind of outrageous that 50 000 people are are homeless in just that one state in this greatest country this rich county but i know but you know trump has decided to bring back his daily coronavirus briefing and uh and i believe this is just a way for him to hold daily rallies because he can't go out there he's afraid you know that he'll get the virus so he's doing it on television if there was not one doctor there yesterday so you know these are not uh um the task force is about the virus at all it's about him but why do you think he's bringing the briefings back at all and i'm sure that a lot of people in his team have told him it's a bad idea because he always sticks his foot in his mouth and yet he keeps doing it what do you think is uh right he's doing it for well well first of all we know that he fundamentally doesn't believe in science but also that he just can't survive without adolation and and i know he's not going to get adolation from a briefing but he will when it is repeated on a particular tv network and when they lavish on the praise i think it is so sad you know it just hurts my heart a hundred and forty two thousand people have died you know i say that several times a day because i think it is so profound and sometimes you know you can kind of become numb to it but those were individuals those were families and uh and the idea that he doesn't seem to be capable of empathy he has never even made reference to the people and he's also has been willing to subject his own supporters to danger as well by wanting to hold rallies and after every rally what happens people get sick including his secret service so i think he does it for adolation and i think he does it for adolation that's going to take place in the media on fox afterwards throughout the day in the evening how sad well there we go and you know what you're we're not letting you go we want to come back because we've got more questions for you okay we'll be right back all right

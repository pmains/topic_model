turn it over now to my ranking member the distinguished senator from kansas thank you senator marshall well thank you so much and good morning everybody i want to thank our subcommittee chairman bennett and his staff and and my staff for holding today's hearing and all the work they've done i want to thank all the witnesses sincerely for making the trip out here taking several days out of your daily life as well and again i'm honored of course to have our ranking member bozeman and and all my colleagues here senator tuberville for coming as well we appreciate that it's been almost a decade since drought was a key focus on the ag committee hearing and i'm hoping we can gain some real insight today on how to address the challenges we're facing out west with regards to drought wildfires and conservation senator bennett the western third of kansas the eastern third of colorado look a lot alike these days and they always have and you mentioned the colorado river but the arkansas river is very important to us now the our kansas river is filled like arkansas but we pronounce it our kansas river as it goes out of colorado through through kansas i'm not sure what the okies call it they call it arkansas i thought they might but i've enjoyed fly fishing in the in the headwaters of the ark kansas river the may the mayfly hatchery up there is incredible but much of the riverbed is dry my uh my wife is from uh arkansas and her grandfather told me a story of coming to colorado when he was a lawyer railroad lawyer of some kind coming to colorado and having the arkansas river between his legs at the headwaters he just couldn't believe it because by the time it got to arkansas obviously it was much much wider than that but but unfortunately through much of kansas it's literally literally a four-wheeler trail ride for us in 1935 after surveying the aftermath the worst dust storm ever recorded in north america robert geiger was an associated press reporter from washington d.c he summed up the life in our region with three the quote from him three little words actually familiar on a western farmer's tongue rule life in the dust bowl of the continent if it rains if it rains this is not new but it's certainly exacerbated even today these three words dictate entire livelihoods on the high plains especially in our home state of kansas in colorado just last month the national oceanic and atmospheric administration deemed april is one of the driest months on the record in the last hundred years currently over half of kansas is designated moderate drought and over a third of the state is designated as severe again as the the chairman commented already so much of kansas and colorado in those extreme drought conditions just last week the capital the topeka capital journal reported that the projected wheat yield in kansas expected to drop by over a hundred million bushels i think that's about uh 30 of our of our average yield is going to be impacted by drought this year that's a value of over a billion dollars to the state of kansas this lack of rain only hurts farm production at its most crucial time but it also adversely affects ranchers and families who fall victim to raging wildfires and yes we've had horrible prairie fires the past several years this lack of rain hurts the farm production at its most crucial time but it adversely affects farmers and ranchers who fall victim to raging wildfires across the plains occurring hundreds of thousands of dollars millions of dollars lost in assets and at the worst the lives of homes and the lot and and the personal lives as well as genetics of cattle will never be able to replace many of our friends in the private sector and our region's universities have been working on solutions and drought resiliency and fire mitigation and i'm excited to hear from them hope this hearing will yield positive results for the future of the western united states thank you and i yield back thank you and i now recognize ranking member marshall who will introduce our next two witnesses all right chairman bennett i'm pleased to introduce two panelists today hailing from kansas mr earl lewis and mr tom willis in full disclosure these gentlemen are both good friends friends i've known for decades they live eat and sleep conservation and i appreciate both of them being here today earl lewis is of course the chief engineer of the kansas department of agriculture's division of water resources and a member of the western state water council he's dedicated his career to water resources in kansas and his role he's responsible for any laws in the states which are related to water conservation management and control in addition to his role as chief engineer earl has served on the governor's water vision team developing the long-term vision for the future of water supply in kansas and is on multiple councils and boards related to water policy and conservation now tom willis he is a titan of agriculture he's an entrepreneur a businessman and again a lifelong conservationist before it was in vogue he has many ventures but one of them is the owner of tno farms just south of garden city kansas where he tries to grow crops on about six or eight inches of rain every year tom was the first to establish a water technology farm in the state of kansas in partnership with the kansas water office since 2016 tom and his son a veteran have been studying and implementing new technologies such as soil moisture probes drip irrigation and aerial photography to manage irrigation methods on their operation as we continue discussing solutions for water managements and usage i'm confident that the perspectives of these two kansans will provide beneficial to the committee and one final shout out i want to shout out to dr herbert and d.u you've been a lifelong partner for my family you've been one of our choices for for charitable contributions we've helped establish hundreds of water a water habitat for decks on our personal property your work has not gone unnoticed no one does a better job of taking the monies you're giving them and establishing habitat which we all get to enjoy and we appreciate du being here and represented i think that's a great choice on your part chairman thank you you certainly wrote senator marshall okay thank you again i think i'll start with miss mr lewis on the same topic of managing flood events i think you know it seems like we're having more flood events how can we manage that water from rivers that are flooding and store them better we've talked about this in kansas for decades how do we take advantage of that situation any any thoughts well i think as we look at at the situation at least in our part of of the world uh the central united states what the the forecast or the long-term models would say is that we'll get roughly the same amount of precipitation but in more intense events and maybe in more time in between the events and really what that means if you're going to manage the water we kind of have to go back to where we're at maybe in the middle part of the last century with storage as as was just mentioned we may see much more intense rainfall and that can lead to more flooding if we don't have the infrastructure in order to capture that and then ideally put that to use uh once the flood passes us are you seeing anybody being successful this you know it seems like the corps just wants to build dikes higher and higher and i keep thinking about natural spillways and ways to manage that those floodwaters you know there are a few examples certainly as we see more and more uh demand primarily from our our cities and and um urban centers for water we are seeing certainly in texas and california uh in north texas there was recently a a reservoir that was permitted and is being built called lower boat arc which is is about 13 000 surface acres that's probably the largest reservoir of this kind being built in the united states at this point that had to be done by the local water supply district the federal government and in most of the state governments are not really in the business of building storage and managing that type of infrastructure at this point okay my next question it's kind of a generic one that we'll see if we have time for everybody against i wanna know what's in the in the federal government conservation programs tom and i'll come to you first what's working for water conservation what's not working how would you improve water conservation if you were king if you were riding the farm the next farm bill what would that look like to you that to give you more flexibility first of all yeah flexibility is the key to it maybe shorter term type programs uh the the key to getting in my opinion in production agriculture is to be able to incentivize the uh the producer to try new technologies without feeling like he's going to lose his farm if things don't work because we're an aging population in production agriculture and so that willingness to to step out of the box and say hey i want to switch the way that i'm doing things that's hard that can be a very hard decision especially again with overall farm income net farm income to projected to be down so what would i do uh with them i i think it i would mirror a little bit like we do in kansas where we say hey uh you know i go to them i'd like to put in some probes i'd like to do this there's some incentives for me to uh to try that but then they don't tell me what i have to do from there they look at the results i tell them what i what i want to do in my case i said i will reduce the use my water usage by 50 okay and we were able to do that and we were able to hold net income at the same level but i think that would be my one suggestion mr lewis kind of expand upon that what have you seen working uh from the federal level obviously the state's giving them some some flexibility your control if you were to help us direct the next formula dollars what can we do to give you more flexibility or to make this work for your people our people well i think this will hit on it pretty well frankly um you know much of the programs that are are dedicated to this type of activity really weren't built for irrigation efficiency or water management they were primarily built coming out of the the 30s and the 50s with with dust bowls and they were focused on soil conservation and those kind of things very laudable goals and very important activity they're really difficult to then take those same programs and then apply them to the type of things that that tom just talked about i think some some more focus on irrigation technology on water management uh maybe uh dedicating some of the the resource and some of the the programs towards that would be would be helpful in trying to to move us in the right direction from the federal side thank you all yield back yeah

all Republican from austin of course the chairman for the House Homeland Security Committee as always good to have you get a beer please what's the current status of Isis the Islamic state and its threat towards the US where do things stand right now have we made a dent in you know combating them well I think it still remains the number one threat to the homeland I think overseas we see more of a policy of containment rather than to defeat and destroy them we need it we need more of the Sunni Arab the countries to step up to the plate with the ground force under US leadership with a special form of ours embedded with them and the airstrikes needed to tick up we were not we're not seeing now it's really a stalemate as general adorno said as he was getting ready to step down and so it's a threat over there we need to stop it over there so it can't get here but the fact is it is in the United States we've arrested over 60 Isis followers over the last year that's more than one arrest per week last week we arrested three here in the United States and the other phenomenon Paul is not just the foreign travel there and back to the region but also the internet directives the radicalization over the Internet these literally changed the game completely they're using social media that we never saw bin Laden using social media like this and now he's young sort of savvy if you will Isis internet commanders sending directives into the United States to followers to radicalize them and they're very effective at this and they're all coming out of Syria at a rocket the radicalizing young and predominantly young disaffected males in the United States to attack military installations and people asking what keeps yep at night well we stopped a lot of this stuff that's a good news we stopped the fourth of July terror plot in the United States but it's a one case that you don't know about that the flags have it going up on and I would argue Chattanooga was that kind of case where we didn't see the flags and warning signs and then we had unfortunately for Marines killed and a sailor is the president and the administration right now doing what you think is advisable in the sense of as you mentioned Ground Force Coalition is going to be critical is the effort there to try to get that done now I don't I don't think we have a coherent strategy in place when I meet with our foreign partners in Turkey Jordan Saudi they want to send a strategy first and it has to include Assad as part of the ultimate solution them to put a Ground Force in there after all they are Sunni and as a she had a side of tracks he's a magnet for a lot of these extremist and then on the homeland front you know I passed a bill out of my committee countering violent extremism we need to make this more of a focus and priority in the United States we spend billions of dollars to the militarily defeat Isis and keep them out of this country we do very little in terms of prevention and in terms of spotting the warning signs reaching out to the Muslim community so that we can stop these threats before they can kill Americans in the last case unfortunately military they have a list of 100 military targets on their list and we know they're very intent on achieving that goal you wrote an op-ed recently the premise was you were watching the GOP debates and kind of thought back to when you were a young man seeing the debates during I guess the 1980 presidential election tell us about that this OP ad because you feel like this is one of the key issues that should be talked about on this campaign well I think it's it's become the number one issue I i hearken back to the first election I got to vote in and the debates and Reagan said are you better off than you were four years ago I think the question today is are you safer today and overwhelmingly most Americans don't believe that we are and we need to change that foreign policy as well that I think has made the world a more dangerous place today and I think this I think I predict this will be one of the number one certainly top three not number one issue going into the presidential election that's out there because because of this radical movement that's global because the threats that I see and it when I talk to people across my district it really is the number one issue to them Iran the Iranian nuclear deal i know you're opposed to it what what is the biggest problem dealing with verification that i know there was word that the Iranians themselves would be perhaps looking at one facility in terms of inspections for example I think inspections a big part of it there's a secret deal between the IAEA and Iran we don't have access to that goes to verification you're dealing with the country doesn't a very good track record it they have cheated consistently we don't have access to military sites and in your right in this one case it's self verification I think it's a bit naive and I think you know senator Menendez lead Democrat on Foreign Affairs in the Senate came out against this because it's there's really a bipartisan opposition to it it does not dismantle their nuclear weapons program that was a whole goal of the sanctions was either dismantle or destroy it it doesn't achieve either one of those and it lists the sanctions so we have hundreds of billions of dollars going to the largest state sponsor of terrorism which concerns me the kids force that killed hundreds of Americans on the battlefield with their IEDs there they have a presence in Latin America secondly the ICBM capability is not on the table intercontinental is bostic missiles are designed to deliver intercontinental that means across continents to the United States to deliver a nuclear warhead the Ayatollah said that that that he will ramp up production of that as well and then finally when I'm in the middle east all the neighbors do not seem to agree with this deal in fact all the neighbors are against it because they're concerned about a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that would be sparked by this deal can we achieve a deal I believe we can but we need a better deal and I think we I'm hopeful that we can in the Congress override the President on this go back to the negotiating table and negotiate a better deal out of this got a minute left but I will ask you about a meeting you had today with Christy Craddock on the Railroad Commission what was the discussion about this dealt with obviously oil and share with us what you can well it's a bill that I and Joe Barton introduced in Congress to lift the ban on crude oil exports why is that important I think it's good for the Texas economy good for Texas jobs but at the same time it's a good foreign policy the European Union asked us to lift this band to get them off the dependence of Russian oil it will help us geopolitically with respect to mr. Putin in Russia will help Ukraine out and I think it also again senator Menendez through this ad is an idea with the Iran deal to lift this band because if there are more energy contracts with Iran that's going to lower the price and I think her Texas again as well congressman as always we appreciate you taking time during the the interim here before heading back I guess what in a couple of weeks when things ramp up again we appreciate it baseball Cocytus room and back with more capital tonight after the break you

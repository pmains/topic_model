spring in Wyoming Senator John barrasso he is the Senate Republican conference chair and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee so this live fire exercise literally surrounding the island of Taiwan what do you think China's game is here what's the message to Taiwan well China is displaying strength at a time that President Biden has displayed weakness and they're going to take full advantage of it China wants Taiwan they're focused on Taiwan it is the apple of their eye and when you take a look at the weakness of this Administration one with regard to Afghanistan two the slowness in the response to Putin and Ukraine and then having to go hat in hand to Saudi Arabia asking for oil that to me makes an invasion of Taiwan by China even greater and specifically while Joe Biden is still in the White House just yesterday at the Foreign Relations Committee in which I serve the administration tried to drag its feet and did drag its feet on something called the Taiwan Policy Act which was to name Taiwan as a major non-nato Ally of the United States and as and as others and the Democrats were forced basically to stop it because Biden didn't want to move forward when we had bipartisan support going in you know I think it's so interesting that we have yet to hear anything from the White House about any of this including Pelosi's trip in the first place uh the China China foreign Ministry called her trip manic irresponsible highly irrational and they say this punishment these these exercises uh is extremely lawful you know but should the White House if they can go back and redo this should they have said something when China threatened uh speaker Pelosi in the first place absolutely I supported speaker Pelosi's trip you know 25 Republican Senators came out with a statement supporting speaker Pelosi I mean think about that I've been to Taiwan to see President Tsai went with a group of senators Tom Cotton was part of it Dan Sullivan Joni Ernst Lindsey Graham and yeah China was mad about it and they put out statements and did a couple of things but bottom line is what we have now is China's being much more aggressive since president Psy in Taiwan beat the communist Chinese candidate in in 2016 and you have 25 Republican Senators standing with speaker Pelosi and the president doesn't say a thing I mean that is really upside down if the president the White House had said something from the beginning condemning China's threats against speaker Pelosi do you think we would be seeing these these same military exercises no no not at all when when China or Putin or anyone sees weakness they go at it and that's what's happened right here the president needs to show some backbone internationally and it needs to be doing a couple things China's watching they're watching really closely what's happening with Russia and Ukraine we need to make sure that Ukraine has all the weapons they need to defeat Russia and then the next thing is they're looking at what weapons Taiwan might have the United States must make a commitment to make sure Taiwan has the weapons they need to defend themselves into all the the the classified briefings and know exactly what's happening right there now we need to make sure that we want to prevent not provoke War and the way to do that is you make Taiwan into a porcupine make it painful if uh if China goes after them right uh you know we talk about the Biden administration's response to this we had Congressman Mike Gallagher of Michigan on earlier he said that in the in the face of of increased Chinese belligerence and aggression the Biden Administration really needs to recalibrate its spending priorities this is what he said this morning I would urge my Senate colleagues instead of passing this half a trillion dollars of more pork barrel spending let's pass the National Defense authorization act this week which includes enhanced authorities for providing Munitions to the indo-pacific commander and stockpiling key weapon systems that are designed to prevent a war so so we can see the contrails of Chinese missiles going up within easy site of of Taiwan uh and meantime the Administration has held in on pursuing this green agenda and spending more money that people say will lead to more inflation though the proponents of that bill deny that should we be spending more money on military defense and arming Taiwan the world is getting more and more dangerous we need to make sure that Taiwan has what it needs in terms of anti -ship anti-aircraft so that they can prevent anything happening from China that's going to take a while to get that all built up but you're right what we have happening now on the floor of the United States Senate is massive tax and spending by the Democrats they want to raise taxes in the middle of recession raise government spending at a time we're at 40-year high inflation families can't keep up they're falling further and further behind they can't afford to fill a tank with gas they can't afford a full week's worth of groceries and the administration wants to do things that in my opinion are going to make it a lot worse for American families Senator John barasso the great state of Ohio and good to see you thanks again great to be with you thank you thanks for coming thanks for having me yeah you bet

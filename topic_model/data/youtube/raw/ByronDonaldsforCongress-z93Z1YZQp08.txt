when it comes to immigration we have to adopt an america first policy what does that mean the first thing is we secure our southern border like president trump is doing right now why do we do that because we do have drug trafficking on our southern border we do have human trafficking on our southern border one of the great scourges in the world today and we still have illegal immigration that occurs on our southern border we have to secure america first second thing we do is we actually modernize our visa system most illegal immigrants are in the country illegally because they're overstating their visas we have to do far better at tracking and we have to make sure we modernize our system the third thing is we have to end things like chain migration chain migration came in in a 1965 immigration reform signed by lyndon johnson we should actually go back to a merit-based immigration policy one based on people are that are needed in the united states by us americans the last thing and this is very important immigration is a process a legal process that america has always supported i support it but it has to be legal if you come to america legally it is going to be difficult it's going to be hard but american citizenship is the greatest franchise in the world it must always be protected [Music]

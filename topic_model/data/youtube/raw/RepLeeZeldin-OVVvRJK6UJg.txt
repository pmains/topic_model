there is no room for anti-semitism anywhere in this chamber this past January the House voted nearly unanimously to condemn white supremacy and it named a Republican member as we did that I voted for that back in that in January around the same exact time we had a member apologize for remarks about how Israel had hypnotized the world an anti-semitic trope a month later apologizing for an allegation that if you support Israel then you have been bought off by Jews and now claiming that if you support Israel and that means that you have allegiance to a foreign government but this time there will be no apology I command to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have spoken out against it this chamber today should be taking action to condemn anti-semitism to be naming names and where that member in January was removed from his committees including a small business committee the member who has been putting out all this anti-semitic tropes should not be serving on her committees especially the House Foreign Affairs Committee for many reasons I encourage a vote today and to remove comes from nomar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee old back

thank you mr speaker yesterday it was reported that by the u.s officials were aware more than a year ago of russian bounties on the lives of our troops and further that president trump received written intelligence in february four months ago if true this represents a gross dereliction of duty i shudder at the idea that the men and women defending our nation might not have the full confidence that their commander-in-chief has their back i am the father of a young navy officer i represent naval station great lakes where every enlistee receives basic training on their journey from recruit to sailor i feel a great personal responsibility for everyone who volunteers to risk their lives in service to our nation i wish i had confidence that the president felt the same congress needs answers as to the truth every member of congress needs to be briefed by the cia and the intelligence community with the truth congress can better protect our troops fulfill america's role as a global leader and make sure that russia is held to account for their heinous actions i yield back my time

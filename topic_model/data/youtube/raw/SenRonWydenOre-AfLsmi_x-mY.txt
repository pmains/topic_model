when it comes to natural gas America is truly the land of opportunity first it's an economic opportunity an affordable stable gas supply provides a competitive advantage for American business that can spark a US manufacturing Renaissance second it is an environmental opportunity gas is 50% cleaner than other fossil fuels and it is a major reason why American co2 emissions have actually gone down in recent years finally it's an energy security opportunity for the first time in decades our nation will be able to rely on its own US energy resources especially new oil and gas development from shale instead of being dependent on imports from the Middle East and other parts of the world that haven't always had our best interests at heart this is a major change for American energy policy 36 years ago the predecessor to this committee was called the Interior and insular affairs committee and they held hearings on natural gas as the country faced a supply emergency that triggered shortages across the northeastern United States during that supply emergency hundreds of thousands of people were laid off as Commerce and Industry reduced hours or simply shut down all together and we in the northwest particularly senator Cantwell and I note that the committee was then chaired by our legendary senator henry scoop jackson and the committee released a report prepared by the department of defense predicting that liquefied natural gas imports would account for ten percent of the country's gas supply the view expressed in that 1997 1977 report released by the committee has dominated American energy policy and just until just a few years ago in 2005 Congress over the objection of some swept aside the ability of states to even approve the siting of lng import terminals and as recently as 2007 when the Congress last enacted major legislation the focus was still overwhelmingly on energy scarcity today the outlook could not be more different instead of scarcity in shortages the prediction is the domestic production will soon outstrip American demand given the dramatic change in the outlook for natural gas supply it is clearly time for a fresh look at our current policies and to start thinking about how to update those policies to reflect a very new reality as part of today's hearing the committee is interested in hearing from the witnesses what they think is needed to safeguard the advantages of affordable stable gas supplies for our country now some of our witnesses are going to say the best approach is to say that the market will take care of things others are going to say caution is in order just a few years ago investors were still betting on building new natural gas import terminals they now face in communities across the country billions of dollars worth of stranded investment it is hard to see the logic behind replacing that kind of speculation on gas imports with similar speculation on gas exports my own view is we have to make sure we don't miss this opportunity for our nation's economy and millions of unemployed workers who are now looking for good pain family wage jobs that you can get from the American manufacturing sector as a CEO of Dow Chemical mr. Andrew olivares will testify if unfettered exports drives the price of gas back towards the ten thousand ten dollars per thousand cubic feet price America saw in recent years that would essentially eliminate any competitive advantage for American manufacturers an investment that could be made here at home and it will essentially go to advantage overseas opportunities instead of a manufacturing Renaissance major gas consumers could find themselves hit hard with energy price hikes and force to sideline job-creating efforts it's also important to keep in mind the guidance the Energy Department now uses for evaluating gas export applications was originally created almost a quarter century ago for import policy it seems to me that it's now a time to have a serious discussion as to whether the guidelines that now are in place at the energy department for approving export applications are what they need to be a recent study commissioned by the Department of Energy to examine the impact of natural gas exports in my view raised more questions than it answered now export policy is not the only issue on the table it would also be a missed opportunity if the environmental benefits that natural gas can provide in terms of reduced co2 emissions were lost lost because of inadequate attention issues such as fracking methane emissions flaring and underground aquifers communities across the country have already been in touch with the committee to share their thoughts and concerns about whether the hydraulic fracturing process that's used to produce shale gas near their communities could result in the contamination of their groundwater supplies that type of situation would not only be tragic for the affected community but also could lead the citizens pressure to shut down not only unsafe production but also operations that were safe Colorado's governor who's here with us the Honorable John Hickenlooper who's been in the front lines in terms of grappling with these issues he's going to testify today on how he's worked to strike a balance between the economic and environmental interests in regulating natural gas production in a state and governor were anxious to hear about how your approach could be a model for the country here's my bottom line let's see if there is an economic and environmental sweet spot where US gas producers can make enough money to continue producing and US manufacturers have an affordable stable supply of natural gas and where the environment is not only protected but actually benefits from greater use of natural gas and lower co2 emission today's hearing gives us a chance to look at these and other issues I look forward to hearing from our witnesses senator Murkowski and I have talked about these issues on a number of occasions I tend to work very closely with her and Senator Mikulski's can be a pleasure to serve with you during this session and please go forward with any comments you'd like to make

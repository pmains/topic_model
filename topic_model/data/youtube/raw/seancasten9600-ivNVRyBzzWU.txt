is a microcosm for a much larger tree and the larger truth is that the energy is too much any time and that that sounds controversial so i gotta explain anytime you can give your mobility needs your heating your electric needs without burning fossil fuel is a time that you can reach your mobility needs your heating needs your electric needs without paying for fossil fuel it's really pretty awesome and that's the reason why we've seen this huge explosion in investment it's why you see all the wind turbines down in illinois all the solar farms it's because people are acting out of their own economic self-interest to do something that is good for the environment it's why bioelectric has already sold almost 600 buses to school districts around the country who who are sitting there saying yes i want to make a difference in the planet but i also would like to not have to pay for gasoline um in what you've been manufacturing since 2016. so you've got the route [Music] largest medium heavy-duty eb plant in the united states they're going to build over 20 000 buses here um creating 400 jobs as congresswoman underwood mentioned that is just the beginning understand that this battery technology that congressman foster talked about in our gun national lab is exploding thanks to the work that congressman foster and i've done we've got a billion dollars into the development of further battery energy research a lot of it's going to come to argon um if you all don't get the ripple effects then call us for doing something wrong but this is the technology of the future that's creating the jobs of the future the you've got the the ibw the international brotherhood of electrical workers who does a fantastic job of training people for these jobs in the future my first election i had my victory party up at ibw the 701 hall up in warrenville just to the north is making sure that that everybody can afford to buy electric buses electric vehicles electric cars the infrastructure the tax credits to make sure that the supply chains get to a distance to make sure that those jobs come here and the the infrastructure is going to provide seven and a half million dollars billion with a b for vehicle electrification 150 million that at least is going to come to illinois to make sure that there's no community that has these buses but doesn't have the charging infrastructure we are just getting started folks and to build back better which we haven't passed yet but i got another letter with 89 of my colleagues two weeks ago to really ask the white house to center the reconciliation investments on doing that we'll provide further incentives both for the charges what we did in the infrastructure bill make sure we get charges on highways we need to make sure it's in local communities as well folks who don't have garages at home that's all so we're going to keep pushing to get all that done but i i just want to leave you with with thanks and gratitude thank you for building here thank you for producing a bus that makes sure that when children get off the bus they're not built they're not breathing diesel fumes they're leaving the hazard and premature fatality on the back of that bus thank you for building a bus that doesn't emit carbon dioxide so that we can give our grandchildren children the chance to live in a world that's the kind of world that we grew up in um thank you for making every community a little bit richer because they don't have to pay for fuel anymore and thank you for your patriotism because everybody who owns one of these buses does not wake up saying what crazy thing is today this is how we make sure that we insulate our economy from metro dictators everywhere it's how we become interviewed thank you for doing it and with that i will bring back to my friend

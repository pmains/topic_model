joining me to discuss next steps is Democratic congresswoman Karen bass she's on the judiciary in foreign affairs committees welcome congressman ambassador Sandlin has already testified now given subsequent testimony that followed do you believe he perjured himself in that initial testimony well I actually think that he did I think that's why he rushed to clean it up I was there in the skiff for that testimony and I will tell you he came across a little Cavalier but I think after several other people testified to what he participated in he rushed to clean it up but it's possible that he didn't clean it up enough and so it will be very interesting to see what he has to say this week well and I you know I hope he's getting some good legal advice to tell the truth so this week what are you hoping to hear him clarify this week that he didn't already talk to the last time well first of all you know the last time he didn't say that the situation actually happened the quid pro quo he didn't say that he cleaned it up to add that but he didn't tell us about that phone call and so now this time what I would expect him to say and I'm sure his counsel were telling him this that he needs to say that that phone call took place the the phone call that was overheard in the restaurant and that we know that the Russians must have listened listened into can you imagine someone picking up a cell phone in a public setting and talking to the President of the United States it's just outrageous it's almost like these people don't know what they're doing I and don't care right I want to ask you about the Republicans defense that this is all hearsay it's an odd defense given that hearsay has led to the convictions of countless bad guys but it is also not hearsay the president told us what he did he's defended tying up the aid in exchange for investigations and and David Holmes heard him say it as well so your thoughts on that strategy well I think that they have been prepped in the president's method of responding which is you know to deny so first they said it was hearsay then they said you know we were meeting behind secret doors and no one was allowed in they wanted to see the transcript so we've done all of that and then it still isn't enough they are doing that because they cannot deal with the substance of what they are learning and so when they say it's hearsay and when you have the Ambassador come forward and say well actually I was on the call so what will they say then what I anticipate their next move will be will be to say well yes all that happened but it really wasn't that serious they can't deal with the substance and so they go around and if you think about it it's the exact same method that the president uses they are performing for an audience of one and it's very sad to see my colleagues lower the standards so far that they are willing to go along with what they know is criminal behavior yeah this week we heard a number of Democrats shift from calling what the president did a quid pro quo to a crime bribery because you're worried the American people are confused well no I think it's because the quid pro quo one might be complicated for some people to understand but it really minimizes it bribery is clear it is a crime it is in the Constitution and I believe that that's exactly what happened I mean he essentially told this new president somebody that had never been in office before whose country is under attack I am going to withhold aid from you unless you do what I need you to do which is to interfere in an upcoming election that's what I think is so serious about it because if you think about the Muller report the mother report was telling us about what the President had done in the past as far as I'm concerned this is the president in the middle of a new election attempting to interfere in an election and involved in criminal behavior what he did while the Ambassador was testifying to threaten her which to me I mean it was witness intimidation but I think that even bigger than that he was sending a message to anyone else that was thinking about coming forward this is what I will do to you if you speak up congresswoman Karen bass thanks so much for your time tonight sure welcome

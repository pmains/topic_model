yesterday one minute having been briefed at every stage of the negotiation of the Iran nuclear deal I was able to come to this floor just two hours after it was published and be the first to speak in opposition to the Iran nuclear deal today I rise to urge the president not to renounce that deal the question is do we want to liberate the Iranian government or sanction the Iranian government if we renounce the deal then the Iranian government is free to remove the inspectors to begin a program of building an unlimited number of centrifuges and can request the return of the fissile material several bombs worth of fissile material which under the deal they had transferred to Russia and which Putin might choose to return if we renounce the deal we do nothing to give ourselves additional rights because under the deal we are free to sanction Iran in full proportion to its non-nuclear evil the Iranian government is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths in Syria tens of thousands of deaths in Yemen that alone justifies every sanction every member of this body can come up with we can stay in the deal and sanction Iran I yield back

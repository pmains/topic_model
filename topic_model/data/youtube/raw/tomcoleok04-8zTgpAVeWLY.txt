Tom Cole and this is another one of our weekly Congressional chats we're back actually in Washington DC this week but I want to start with something a little closer to home obviously we had severe wind and some tornado damage in the fourth district this last week that's always tragic people get hurt and we certainly had a number of injuries fortunately no fatalities but we lost some structures had some damage and again much more importantly had personal injuries so anybody that happens to be listening to this it might have been impacted by that first of all please know you have our deepest sympathy these things happen with some regularity in the state of Oklahoma we've certainly had plenty of tornadoes over the years but you know when it happens to you it's personal and special and it's it fromatic so again you have our deepest sympathies if our office can help you in any way and everything from FEMA mitigation to request for assistance and support please contact us we're local agencies and trying to make sure the federal government does the things it's responsible for doing in in these kind of disasters and we've had good cooperation we generally do but we don't want anybody following through the cracks so please feel free to get in touch with us we can be of any kind of assistance in any way in terms of Congress a number of things underway a significant piece of legislation past the house it's called the rain in act and basically it's to mandate that when the executive branch issues executive orders that have an expense with them that they also issue a report about the impact on inflation the Biden Administration has spent more money by executive orders or circumventing congress than any other Administration in American history they've managed to do that in two years so this is a significant contributor to inflation and we simply want to try and make the administration accountable and frankly educate the uh American public that when these kind of actions are taken again outside of Congress and without thought about the amount of money being interjected into the economy we're already running record deficits then we want to I want people to be aware of that so there it was actually a bipartisan we gotten a significant number of democratic votes it also felt like again the executive branch are sort of going Beyond Congress so we appreciate that it was something that while there was controversy about it and the administration doesn't like it we think it'll it'll pass the Senate uh and then honestly it'll be up for the president as to whether he signs or not he's threatened to veto it no president likes to be held accountable but frankly every president regardless of party ought to be held accountable and in this case if it gets to his desk it'll be because there was bipartisan supports a Democratic Senate obviously we got Democratic votes in the house for this so we're hopeful that at least this discussion will educate the American public about some of the ways in which we think the federal government wastes a lot of money and contributes to inflation in terms of other legislative activities you know we've spent a couple of months constituting the Congress getting all the committee set up their regular hearings are are starting now and legislations being considered we had the Appropriations process begin this week in Earnest I said of course on defense Appropriations we had a really insightful hearing yesterday over the entire Ukrainian issue there's certainly people that legitimately questioned the amount of money we're spending and the consequences of this particular set of expenditures but important to note everything that's been spent has been approved by Congress usually on a bipartisan basis if it particularly if it was a standalone bill there's broad support for the Ukrainian people for in Congress on both sides of the aisle we can argue a lot about how we got here personally think the Biden Administration contributed to that President Biden was part of the administration the Obama Biden Administration that did nothing when the Russians seized crime via and then the Russians certainly watched this there was the botched withdraw from Afghanistan we turned over a country of 38 million people right back to the same folks that have given Osama Bin Laden protection while he was planning 9 11 and executing it uh you know I think Putin looked at that and said that's the American attitude they're not going to mind if I go into Ukraine and so I think the administration Bears some responsibility for that having said that I will say I think the providing of support robust support to Ukraine has been the right decision and the administration the president deserved credit for that I had the privilege as some of you know that listen to this broadcast they're despondents availability this chat on a regular basis to visit with Ukrainian forces and for training down at Fort Sill in The Patriot batteries that pretty moving experience every single soldier Ukrainian soldier that I met had lost you fellow soldier in combat friends or family in one case one particular individual lost both his parents and his spouse to Russian military activity this is a pretty brutal War uh you know over something like 200 000 Russian casualties our intelligence estimates 60 to 100 000 restaurants dead of course tens of thousands of ukrainians as well compare that to Afghanistan where we were at for 20 years and was certainly a tough hard slog but we only lost 2 400 soldiers in 20 years and obviously we haven't had another 911 since we went on the offense against terrorism all the way back in 2001 that's been a good thing and it's something that I think couldn't have been anticipated the ukrainians are are in a big fight and they're they're fighting to fend their homes their family their freedom their culture the Russians have been pretty brutal in this and so I think you'll continue to see by partisanship there's some other areas where you see some bipartisanship last night a brand new committee set up by the Republicans the select committee on the strategic competition between China and the United States at its first meeting and I expect this effort to be bipartisan we tried to persuade speaker Pelosi to set up a committee like this she refused to do it but now that we've set it up we think we're getting really good Democratic interest in participation and every American knows that some of the things China is doing around the world the almost genocide activity if not actually genocide against the uyghurs concentration camps in China the saber rattling in Taiwan a constant theft of American intellectual property frankly the production of the base materials for Fentanyl and ship to Mexico and packaged up by drug lords and into the United States is something that ought to concern us all and we're also beginning a finally a hearing on the origins of covet uh you know we finally had the energy department and one of our folks that looks at these type of issues that come out and say that they thought that that code had actually begun with a leak and labs in Wuhan that were focused on coronavirus there's a lot of questions about that my Democratic friends didn't do anything to hold a single hearing about that when they were in the majority we're going to get to the bottom of this because if indeed there was a leak out of the land Labs which I suspect there was uh you know China ought to pay because it didn't immediately let the world know what was happening it didn't let the rest of the world take mitigation efforts it kept things secret and quite frankly uh engaged and pretty outrageous activity in terms of cornering the market on personal protection equipment or PPE as it's known uh to the detriment of other people that you know needed supplies when they were dealing with coven so a lot of Investigation other investigations also beginning on misuse of the FBI and we'll see if the concerns that many people voiced uh you know have legs again I suspect they do but that's what you have an investigation for and I'm quite certain there'll be a robust effort in that regard probably for me personally the big activities will be again focused on number one the Appropriations Committee making sure government is appropriately funded we spend less but get better value for the money I have a new position on the Appropriations Committee in addition to being the vice chairman of the full committee I'm the chairman of the subcommittee that focuses on Transportation Housing and Urban Development huge jurisdiction about 90 billion dollars and of course has a lot to do with the construction of Road rail water Port facilities all kinds of infrastructure in the United States as well as public housing across the country and in Rural America as well as in urban America so we're digging into that seeing if we can stretch those dollars further and honestly if there are savings to be had achieve those savings so Congress is up operational moving I think tackling the real problems of the American public but there'll be a lot of contention about this it's a republican house very narrow majority but a Democratic Senate also with a narrow majority and obviously the president has a vote so to speak he has a voice nothing becomes law unless he signs it or is overridden and he's unlikely to be overridden if he were to cast a veto why a Congress that his party controls one house then and has a very substantial minority in the House of Representatives so there's going to be a lot of give and take but again I hope we can find areas like Ukraine like uh you know the the what will be generational struggle against uh with China hopefully peaceful uh contest and like a farm bill which needs to get ridden this year that we can find some common ground on we can get things done when we work together but the reality is Democrats have not had to work with Republicans very often the last two years they control both the house and the Senate uh you know they engaged in a lot of Reckless spending we're all paying for it now with record inflation and we'll see some more inflation numbers next week but right now it's running around six and a half percent uh when the target inflation is two percent so again very uncertain economic time but we'll be visiting with you about the goings on again I expect a much Fuller report much more substantive legislation reaching the floor in the weeks ahead on things like energy like the economy and certainly ultimately like funding the military and so we're going to be involved in those issues we'll keep you posted thanks for taking the time to listen and I look forward to visiting with you again next week

before we I want I want to get into to one other issue beyond your responsibilities for Housing and Urban Development you have other responsibilities under the Constitution along with other cabinet secretaries particularly section four of the 25th amendment and we all live by this constitution I the section four deals with the possibility that a president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office have you taken the time to get legal counsel to brief you on what your responsibility is as a cabinet secretary under the 25th amendment I have not had any in-depth discussions of that I would urge you to do so this amendment was written in the early 60s as a result of what we life that happens whether it's the dangers that our president faces whether it's the health problems a president can face I would urge you first to note to get legal counsel to know what your responsibilities are and second to discuss with other cabinet officers how you would implement a section 4 of the 25th amendment I'll yield back

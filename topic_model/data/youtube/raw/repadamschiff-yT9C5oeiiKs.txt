joining us now is congressman adam schiff democrat from california member of the january 6th committee and chair of the house intelligence committee he also served as an impeachment manager for donald trump's first impeachment trial he's also the author of the new book midnight in washington how we almost lost our democracy and still could it's good to have you with us and we're told that congress's criminal contempt referral of steve bannon was accepted by the u.s attorney's office in dc yesterday evening around 5 30. now the ball is in merrick garland's court what's your expectation for how quickly the doj will move on this well it's my hope and expectation that they will move quickly that they understand the urgency here and i think they're are good signs in what the justice department did with respect to some of the witnesses we wanted to talk to uh former top-ranking justice officials uh they did not assert executive privilege they did not assert any kind of work product privilege and made it clear that they view the public interest in getting all the facts out about that violent attack on our democracy to be paramount uh i think that same logic ought to apply here so it's our hope it's our expectation that they will move quickly i want to play for our viewers something that congresswoman liz chaney who's the top republican on the january 6th committee something she said on the house floor yesterday as she explained why steve bannon's testimony and her view is so critical look at this mr bannon's own public statements make clear he knew what was going to happen before it did and thus he must have been aware of and may well have been involved in the planning of everything that played out on that day the american people deserved to know what he knew and what he did so my question is how much of what steve bannon knew is really a proxy for what donald trump knew and can you get that information from other witnesses if executive privilege is tied up in the courts well first of all we think that steven clearly has relevant information he was reportedly in conversation with the president um he did apparently predict that there would be uh all hell breaking loose on january 6 as indeed it turned out all hell would break loose but whatever insights he have he has are only going to be a subset of the information about the president's conduct in the days leading up to that and including on january 6th so he is certainly not the the sole source of information about what took place and we are approaching others that can share information about that but i will say this also his executive privilege claims um are uh are very um uh remote and improbable of any success uh what's more he failed to show up uh and that's not an executive privilege issue that's a claim of absolute immunity and no one enjoys absolute immunity the courts have held that repeatedly so it's a very strong case to prosecute and we certainly hope the justice department will soon understanding that he may or may not have when it comes to executive privilege chuck rosenberg who's a friend of the show former u.s attorney for the eastern district of virginia he guided our team to a 2007 olc office of the legal council opinion that potentially could pave the way for an executive privilege argument for bannon i'm going to read some of it to you it says this that the communications involve individuals outside the executive branch does not undermine the president's confidentiality interests the communications at issue occurred with the understanding that they would be held in confidence and they related to decision-making regarding u.s attorney removals or replacements or responding to congressional or media inquiries about the u.s attorney matters so this is a very specific uh issue relating to 2007 but this idea that the subject didn't necessarily have to be a part of the executive branch which bannon certainly wasn't at the time is that in any way a complicating factor no i don't think so at all uh that olc opinion of course is not binding on the current justice department and as far as i'm aware no court has ever held executive privilege to apply to a presidential communication with someone who's not even in the administration even people who are in the administration it generally doesn't apply unless they're a top-ranking official and even then when it does apply it gives way in cases of extreme public interest and it's hard to imagine a more extreme public interest than an attack on the capital on the seat of our democracy so steve bennett's claims are going to fail they will inevitably fail but the whole point is to delay and this is why um the the criminal prosecution is so important uh donald trump for four years did everything he could to stonewall all the subpoenas and delay this is merely a continuation of that effort but they can't have the same success in terms of stonewalling when it comes to a prosecution and that's why our hope and expectation as i mentioned is that the department will pursue it and and with vigor i want to ask you about these other trump loyalists whom the committee says are cooperating that's mark meadows and cash patel uh when the committee says that these two gentlemen are engaging with the committee what does that mean exactly what level of engagement well it really differs with each of the witnesses that we have subpoenaed and i can't go into the particulars but i can tell you that we're determined to secure their testimony if we reach the point with any of them where we don't think that they're negotiating in good faith that they're merely trying to run the clock then we will pursue the same path we did with steve bannon um but if we can get to yes and i think with the with with some there there's a certainly the prospect that we will that is our preferred course but we will only wait so long congressman adam schiff thanks so much for your time i appreciate it thank you

we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks got a really awesome episode uh for you right now i've been trying to get barry weiss on the program for quite a while and uh this was ever since she left the new york times and um it was a big story at the time [Music] and she wrote a really uh really just what well-written eloquent reasoning for leaving the times that really kind of cuts into the current cultural debate about media about media bias where mainstream media is going can it ever be recovered and uh and barry's just a really interesting person uh writes for sub stack uh constantly puts out a lot of really good stuff puts a lot of really good interviews and barry thanks for being on thanks for having me dan so okay let me do a little bit more of your bio first for the audience uh from 2017 to 2020 you're a staff writer and editor for the opinion section of the new york times we're going to go into a little bit more detail on that of course you were an op-ed editor at the wall street journal associate book review editor there as well two years a senior editor at tablet online magazine of jewish politic jewish news politics culture and um we've been on the view morning joe real time with bill maher bill mars man he is he is getting like woke in a good way recently didn't he uh and he's getting what i call second woke yeah i feel woke real look so but you kind of got uh would you consider yourself as somebody who got second woke uh totally although i'm not sure i was ever first woke and and to be honest i don't think bill was first woke but there's got to be a term that's something other than red pilled for getting actually awakened to where real power lies in the country and some of the lies that are being told and you know being able to say obvious truths out loud which seems like a radical thing these days in america yeah and because bill is certainly not red pilled um i'm not sure you would consider yourself red-pilled either well i don't know what that word mean i mean all of these words have sort of lost their meaning they're so elastic red pilled woke who knows what they mean what i mean is that you know i think bill is someone who is so controversial right now in the current american scene because he is saying obvious truths out loud and in public and right now we're living in a country in which at least for many liberals and progressives or people in the center there is a very wide divide between the things that you share around your kitchen table or with your spouse at night and the things you feel are kosher to say on places like twitter or facebook or in bill's case on television and i think people are just you know grabbing on to every word he's saying because they're saying to themselves finally someone who is like me who broadly shares what i thought was my worldview is willing to say these things out loud and in public um and it makes people really mad i mean it makes people mad on my side if if i say something that isn't like the orthodoxy people people seem to have this aversion to finding truth lately um you know we have a very sensitive culture and that could lead us to a quote i think uh that i'm going to read from you and i think this is from your letter when you left the new york times so quote but the lessons that ought to have followed the election lessons about the importance of understanding other americans the necessity of resisting tribalism and the centrality of the free exchange of ideas to a democratic society have not been learned instead a new consensus has emerged in the press but perhaps especially at this paper the truth isn't a process of collective discovery but in orthodoxy already known to an enlightened few whose job it is to inform everyone else and that kind of gets at the heart of um your complaints there but maybe it would just run us through it in your own words um what what how you started at the new york times uh what they what they what your role there was what they saw your role there as and then would it be yeah um big picture i had been at the wall street journal as you mentioned before for a number of years and sort of two stints and i was the squish at a conservative editorial page i think that would be the way they would put it um i was the most left-leaning person in an otherwise conservative you know institution not not talking about the news side i'm talking about the editorial side and i was okay with that i was comfortable with that i would say that the election or you know the nomination rather and then the nomination and then the eventual win of donald trump sort of changed my calculus as i think it changed the calculus of so many people um it's a broader topic that could take a whole hour-long discussion but i would say that what happened inside the wall street journal editorial page was broadly what was happening in the republican party and certainly in the conservative movement the question over whether or not you know this is where the base was and therefore he should be embraced or whether he was anathema to at least to the wall street journal the motto of free people free markets and he should be rejected and there was a kind of i wouldn't call it a civil war but there was enormous amount of tension inside the editorial page about the right approach to him long story short in the aftermath of his um winning the presidency a number of people decided to sort of part ways go their own way some people went sort of more to the populace right other people went more to i would say the liberal center and then others were just like hey maybe it's time to try something else and and that was sort of me and i decided to go to the new york times along of course with my colleague brett stevens brett was hired to be a columnist i was hired to be primarily an editor and so my job was to bring in the kind of people who wouldn't otherwise think of the new york times as a natural home for their writing there was a brief period as you just mentioned of soul searching that followed the win of donald trump at the times but really i would say across institutions that are sort of meant to uphold um liberalism broadly defined across lots of places that you know are supposed to maybe a good way to say this is hold up a mirror to the country as it actually is so that their readers can be informed about reality and instead what the times and we could name a dozen other liberal newspapers and magazines were actually doing was holding up a mirror to the world as they wished it would actually be and so everyone of course remembers the infamous needle that had hillary clinton in 2016 winning by like 99.9 percent uh and instead of course trump won and so you know that led the people at the times to say hold on like are if we're claiming to be the paper of record if we're claiming to be the most important newspaper in america well we need to do a much better job of informing our readers about where americans actually are and so you know i i imagine many of your audience and many of your listeners will think it's hilarious because i assume they think of me as just a run-of-the-mill liberal but in the context of the times i was considered a conservative and i was brought in to bring in conservative voices libertarian voices heterodox thinkers people who really don't fit into a category especially given our sort of emerging political realignment and then also things that i've just long been interested in voices of dissidents from the middle east christians in places like hong kong running underground churches and high schoolers for example who had never written an op-ed for the first time and i would say that you know i was not naive about the biases of the new york times my dad has been a conservative ever since he graduated from kenyan college and sort of entered college as a maoist and left as a neocon so it's not that i've been in a kind of liberal bubble i i i knew the times had biases i knew especially on an issue i really care about which is israel that that bias was obvious to me so i didn't come in um totally naive um but i did come in thinking that a they were sincere about me wanting to fulfill the role that they hired me to do and that b even if my colleagues disagreed with me at least it would be a collegial atmosphere at least there would be sort of general civility and a sense that they were all on board for this mission of broadening the spectrum of opinions that we shared with our readers and i would say that i was quickly disabused of both of those uh presumptions that i had coming into it and for anyone that has been in a super orthodox environment maybe a religious environment or maybe a just a really close-minded political environment you can imagine very easily what happened to me which is to say in an environment of orthodoxy or true belief the person that's viewed as the heretic becomes sort of like a witch um and the way that you kind of if you're trying in the case of the times this is particular to it but again we could say this of lots of other institutions if you're trying to re-establish the boundaries of what are acceptable if you're trying to transform a party or an institution or a culture the way that you draw the boundaries around what's acceptable often is to make an example of the person that doesn't ascribe to every aspect of the new morality or the new orthodoxy and that was me you know so in an environment of true belief the heretic becomes the person you know you need heretics you need heretics in order to sort of say who's in and who's out who's in the community of the good and the side of the righteous and who's a baddie and that's why there's a direct connection i would say between the environment of forced ideological homogenization that happened there we can talk more about what i mean by that and the fact that me and others who didn't ascribe to every aspect of the new work orthodoxy that's come to dominate at the times that we needed to be bullied or cast out in some way and so to make a very long story short you know i was there for between three and four years um the that atmosphere that i'm describing just got more and more and more and more intense and i would say it culminated with the decision on the part of my the boss that had hired me to publish of course everyone everyone will remember in june of 2020 the op-ed by senator tom cotton at the height of the black lives matter protests and of course some of them those protests being violent rioting and the publication of that op-ed led to really what i would call an uprising inside the paper um an uprising that by the way you know there's no secret information about it because it all played out on places like twitter um and i wish an op-ed of mine would get canceled everybody would read it then i can't imagine a better public publicity strategy than to get your op-ed canceled exactly cancellation could be a very effective uh pr strategy very painful but can be very effective pr but in any case what happened was we published that op-ed something like 800 of my former colleagues signed a statement claiming that that op-ed literally put lives in danger never mind that the times has also run op-eds saying with headlines like yes we mean literally abolish the police or op-eds by the leaders of hamas or op-eds by opera you know by leaders of the chinese communist party none of those put anyone's lives in danger but this this put everyone's life in danger and i just thought that it was i don't know what other word to use other than insane and deranged and bore no relationship to reality and if you believe that an op-ed by a sitting united states senator puts your life in danger then maybe journalism isn't the right line of work for you but instead of the publisher of the universe sorry instead of the it's actually a good slip there i was saying university because it's the same case at the universities too if the publisher of the new york times had said in that moment to those people you know i wish you the best but if you believe that this puts your life in danger perhaps you should find another line of work instead the response and anyone who's followed what's going on in the universities this will be incredibly familiar the response was we're so sorry we should never have published this op-ed we essentially retract this op-ed they ran an editor's note that was as long as the actual piece and we are going to treat your complaint of danger of words causing violence as very as serious and so within something like 72 hours james bennett who had been the former jerusalem bureau chief of the paper was forced to resign the op-ed editor jim dao and these are people who had story storied careers at the new york times was demoted from the masthead and reassigned the 25 year old jewish editor who had worked on the piece along with many other editors was nonetheless hung out to dry and scapegoated as the one who was at fault and he eventually left the paper his name is adam rubenstein he's an unbelievably talented editor and i felt like i had a choice to make the paper had just made it abundantly clear to me what the price would be for taking any kind of political risk in publishing a piece that would offend the sensibilities of my colleagues and offend the sensibilities of many of our readers well if that's the stakes how was i supposed to do the very thing that i had been hired to do the other thing i'll add that i haven't really talked about because it's just like crazy was in the aftermath of the decision to run the tom cotton op-ed they instituted and i'm curious if this still is in existence i don't know how it could be because you really can't run a functioning op-ed page this way they instituted a new essentially editing by consensus system they called it the red flag system in which any commissioned piece if any other op-ed editor felt that it was um insensitive or needed to be red flagged in some way then well the piece wouldn't run and this literally made my job impossible because again i was brought in to write and to commission pieces that were explicitly meant to be the kind of pieces that wouldn't fit the consensus and so my then boss at the time the woman who replaced james bennett said to me you know why don't we make your job essentially a writing job because clearly the pieces that you want to commission won't get through anymore and so she was basically saying to me don't do the thing we hired you to do and so then i faced a choice do i want to stay here and hoard and cling to the prestige that comes at least in the world that i live in of saying you get to work at the new york times i know your world's quite different in that way but it is really means something to a lot of people and it does open a lot of doors or do i leave and leave to pursue journalism again leave to do exactly the thing i came there to do in the first place which is to follow my curiosity which by that point it was clear had become a liability and so now however many months later i'm on sub stack i own a podcast and i find myself in sort of on the pirate ship of new independent journalism and i have to say like if anything i regret waiting that moment to leave if anything i regret not leaving earlier because i think that you know say nothing of myself i think a lot of the most important and heterodox and independent minded journalism it just no longer can be found in the institutions that you know were the the prime journalistic institutions of the 20th century it's just totally different now one of the places i go to read breaking news the places i go to look for perspectives that provoke me and surprise me um and that just offer insight you know i know what i'm gonna read in the new york times op-ed page now before i've even picked it up that's not why i'm picking up an op-ed page so anyway that's that's that's kind of the long version and do you think there's any um saving it or is it worth saving a conversation that occurs on the right a lot is do we try to change these mainstream institutions or do we create our own um and the usual consensus is it's got to be a little bit of both but um not obvious how to change the new york times i mean it you know maybe was liberal leaning for a very long time has been for a very long time uh but it got more woke uh more recently and that's and that's and you mentioned the universities uh and what happens it seems is that there's a sort of this uh wokeness that occurs at the university level and then they instead of the institution changing the students that the students change the institution they can bully their way through it uh like like you've written twitter is the ultimate editor at the new york times and so it's it's this caving process that occurs and uh is there any way to to infiltrate it in the same way with more not even conservative but how about just you know reasonable objective uh journalism um to where that wouldn't be heterodox necessarily or is it just hopeless well i don't think anything's i i'm actually full of optimism and hope but that optimism and hope is coming for me from the decision to basically throw in my vote on the build new institutions front um and i don't think that should be the case with everything i think when an institution is just a little shaky when an institution looks like it could be vulnerable to essentially ideological capture by this new movement then we should do everything we can to scaffold it and rebuild it and try and save it because guess what building new things is like it's just about the hardest possible thing you can do especially with some of these institutions like universities and so on i think that every effort should be put into the ones that are could obviously be saved to be saved but a huge part of my decision to walk away from the new york times and this is really my own transformation that happened in the years that i was there was that i entered and for the first while that i was there thinking you know i'm really making a difference here and i think i did to some extent make a difference and you know if this thing can be sort of righted or slowly it's like a tanker like shifted shifting in in the proper direction back to old-school values of journalism like i want to do everything in my power to do that but by the time i left i'd come to the conclusion that at the new york times that simply wasn't possible um and if anything i i think that my sense of that has only been proven day after day after day as the paper is published i think that you know you ask i think i think there's a key ingredient if you look at the institutions that have caved and it's one word which is which is cowardice all that it would take for a lot of these institutions to not succumb to the nonsense of so much of what this ideology is about is by the person at the top simply saying no no my job is to be a steward of you know in the case of harvard veritas that's the motto of harvard truth or yale lux at veritas truth in light or i was recently looking up some of the mottos of these universities because the chasm between what they actually do and what they promise is just so so tragically wide and what would it look like for the head of one of these storied institutions to say no we're not going along with this in a very polite way and if you're looking for something else if you're looking to you know sit in a warm bath of you know ideological conformity that's great there's a lot of other places where you can find that but not here and what's so amazing to me is just how rare courage is how rare it is to find a leader of an institution that was willing to stand up and say no to the nonsense if they did this would go away very very quickly but instead the people and it's a minority of people at the times the people that are promoting this ideology are being coddled they're being promoted they're being elevated and you know the the weapon that they wield is a very powerful one it's the weapon of moral condemnation and of accusations of every ism and phobia in the books is this the inability to stand up to it in these liberal-leaning institutions but you know classically liberal let's say so you know maybe there's a the difference between the the liberal bias of old and the liberal bias of new is that of old was again more classically liberal you know open-mindedness uh was a virtue free speech is a virtue etc the the new woke left is much more tyrannical um in its in its methodology and so i guess you know the question is the old liberal bias is just saying conservatives are wrong and we're going to put our thumb on the scale of policies that they don't agree with the new bias isn't bias it's saying conservatives are evil and and that their worldview is diabolical and that their character is irredeemable that's what's at stake here like what's at stake here is that this ideology is saying people like me like we can't talk across the we can't talk to each other because the idea of talking to each other in a civil way oh that's just the tools of the patriarchy and the white man and white supremacy well chuck todd was trending on twitter the other day uh for that exact thing because uh i didn't see it what was it he had interviewed too many republicans uh well first he criticized biden okay criticized biden on this nbc and then and then he was trending um uh who who was the one who tweeted it it was uh i can't remember who but anyway it was it it was ridiculous because you see you look at the comments under under these posts and it was all you can't give them a platform it's not like you weren't hard enough on them see in conservative media you might get criticized if you just play softball with them you know when they come on but you never get criticized for having them on conservatives enjoy it we love we love the fight right we love to see it uh but it's interesting how the left is they don't want to see it at all they believe it's wrong to give people like me a platform i was listed and like you've had these republicans on i was like yeah but he was a jerk to me the whole time like i thought you guys wanted to see that you know it was it's ridiculous i think what's interesting is this listen there are things and people that are taboo and should be taboo it's the question of where you draw that line right like i you know there are people i think we can both think of like david duke are you going to have david duke on your podcast and share him with your million twitter followers of course not you're not going to do that because right his view is so outside what we consider acceptable um that like so i think it's important to recognize that deep platforming is a thing that everyone does the whole question right is who is fitting in like the normal 40 yard lines and what this new ideology is trying to do is to say normal mainstream conservative or even centrist views are well outside the boundary of what's acceptable right and the way that they police that boundary and this is where canceled culture i think is sometimes misunderstood cancer culture is the justice system of this ideology okay it's the way that they explain what is unacceptable and what is acceptable and if you're able to make examples of people who don't fit into the mold you're essentially sending a message to the millions of people watching and saying oh my god if i want to keep my shirt if i want to keep my job if i want to keep my reputation if i don't want my kid to be bullied at his basketball game or soccer game i better not say this i better make sure that i you know put my pronouns in my twitter bio and on and on and on and on until they've gotten everyone you know dancing along to their tune and that's what i think is really important to understand about cancer culture it's less about it's about the way that it's used as a mechanism by this movement and how it's it's it bypasses debate powerful yes it's used to bypass debate and conservatives get this wrong all the time right it's uh and in a reaction to cancel culture you know a conservative activist will just do something really provocative uh seeking to be censored in some way and say see it's cancer culture it's like now you're just being a jerk cancer culture is about standards uh you know free speech and our our defense of it you still doesn't mean you your your entire goal is to provoke and to piss off like that's that's that's going outside the it doesn't make your argument very strong either and uh it's important to explain that to people it is about the changing of taboos um you know and making making mainstream ideas taboo like you know what one kind of question i have to think about and this is this goes back to the the march through the institutions from our young woke radicals uh that happened in university and and then and then in a lot of corporate america my question is look so i went to school in in 2000 i went to liberal tufts university graduated in 2006. i just don't remember anything being overly political uh it just wasn't the case but years later of course it is the case and i'm trying to figure out what did people read what did what did young people read or come across that that got them to this point you know people ask me all the time why are things so divisive and i'm like look i'm speaking as a republican but i do think it's objectively true that the democrat party has just lurched way to the left uh to where there's just a lot less space between us and i don't think we've really just being a conservative we're sort of in a box at least in classic conservatism we can't change it too much i don't think our policies have shifted a whole lot in decades um and so i'm just trying to figure out where it came from though i'm not sure anybody knows do you have any ideas well i mean the universities and specific um departments in the universities we're definitely the nucleation point for what we think of as woke but really doesn't it's this sort of encode new view of the world that doesn't have a name yet i think you know rodriguez call it soft totalitarianism wesleyan i think has the best dubbing so far which is he's called it the successor ideologies and the successor to liberalism and he explains it as a kind of mixture of safetyism and the therapeutic mentality and post-structuralism and post-modernism and critical race theory it's all like in this stew and there's no question that that stew was first cooked up in our elite universities it's interesting because we're around the same age and i want to kill myself now knowing all that you've done in the same amount of time we've been on earth but when i was at columbia i very much encountered this ideology and i encountered it and thought like to myself this is like i took it pretty seriously because i saw the way people were being swayed by it i'll show you a share with you just a few moments that really stuck with me and we're kind of like my original maybe waking up to what this movement's about i remember going to a lecture um with a few friends of mine it was it had something to do with feminism i don't remember who it was and i always identified as a feminist and i still do and i remember after the lecture we were talking and we were talking about the light subject of female genital mutilation and the two other women i was talking to who both identified as feminists were justifying female genital mutilation because or explaining it i should say because of issues of you know cultural relativism and this is what other cultures believe and we don't want to impose our western view of the world on them and so on and so forth and i thought to myself wait wait what is going on here how am i having a conversation with so-called feminists who are justifying barbarism against women's bodies barbarism that literally allows them in some cases to never have pleasure again that was one incident i remember another incident i really remember was when i was on the one train going downtown i was thinking i was going to be a middle east studies major and i thank god changed uh changed the lanes on that once i realized what the what the department was all about but i was on a train going downtown and this young woman who was californian really you know probably had never read so much about the middle east definitely had never traveled there and she came up to me on the train and she knew me from known me from a small seminar literature seminar so she knew broadly that i was liberal that i was reasonable that i wasn't crazy uh certainly that i didn't ascribe to bigoted worldview and she came up to me and said listen like i know you you're cool like i i think we broadly agree on things how is it that you can identify as a zionist how is it that you could support israel and of course she asked that question because the only thing we were learning in this giant survey course about the whole middle east was that israel and of course the united states was the source of all evil in the region all pathologies in the region and that zionism was as she was learning in this course tantamount to racism and those were both my freshman year and so i realized that there was i didn't have a name for it yet of course and i thought like maybe these are just one-offs but as college wore on and as i saw that friends that were in particular departments and it wasn't just middle east studies it was anthropology it was sociology it was can certainly you know comparative literature that they were being fed this view of the world and you ask you know how did it win i mean the good news here in a way is that ideas really matter like what ideas you are exposed to what ideas and worldview you marinate in actually can shape the world and that is both a very optimistic and a very scary statement and what happens is that if the you know the people that are being cultivated to be the elites in our society at these ivy league universities and others besides are marinating in a political monoculture in which they are being told that america and the west are fundamentally bad that they are the source of evil in the world and that you know and i could go on and on but i've sort of just laid it out for you if that's what they're learning during the most formative years of their life from respected tenured professors why should we be surprised that as they make their way in the world that they're coming to shape the world in their image like i don't i what is shocking is only the fact that both liberals and conservatives are waking up to that so late like i think it was only until very recently that liberals and conservatives looked at what happened on campus and thought to themselves you know that's crazy and it's hilarious and like let's watch a funny news segment about it you know but certainly what happens in the janitor studies department at oberlin can't impact me but andrew sullivan said it best we all live on campus now we all live on campus now and everyone i think has has now awakened to that fact now the question is given that it's sort of so far gone what can we do about it and yeah that's hard because you know it's easy for me to speak out against it um you speak out against it but classical liberals still in the institutions are the ones getting cancelled if they speak out against it and you know i wonder if conservatives have a chance of reaching them because the reality is it seems to me and this is how it got worse and worse and worse this is how the caving happened because i think a liberal that's wearing the blue jersey uh as concerned as they might be over this sort of new woke radicalism they they're still wearing the blue jersey right and they're like yeah but conservatives are really bad you know so we really can't really can't agree with that so it you know and this kind of the old phrase goes if you're if you're so you're so open-minded that you stand for nothing um comes to mind and that seems to have tended to happen over time but do you think it sort of conservatives have any chance of of convincing liberals that uh we are more aligned than you think at least at least in the basics uh that the founding was a good thing that america is a good thing uh that due process might be a good thing that neutral justice might be a good thing uh free speech et cetera um or are they still too scared or and increasingly more scared of this sort of cancer culture on the woke left it's a very good question i think post-trump there's a better chance i think the past four years made it incredibly difficult because he just tainted everything and anything he touched liberals are going to run in the other direction and you know i just think that made it much more impossible um to sort of talk across the divide i think that if conservatives you know focus on issues like gay marriage which i feel is settled or abortion those are those are just going to be political losers with trying to talk across the aisle what i think and what i think you would agree with is that there's actually we're living through a very interesting political realignment where there are some core issues we actually feel like there is a consensus among them it's just not a consensus that's yet necessarily reflected in the culture like in meaning in the official narrative but like the the terrifying power of big tech that's an issue where like josh hawley and elizabeth warren agree with each other and where i think most americans see the power that these companies have over our lives and think to themselves this is wrong and i might not yet have the language to know why this is wrong but this scares me and it's wrong and i don't want every aspect of my life to be surveilled and controlled by three companies and three billionaire oligarchs like there's opportunity there big pharma okay we've now seen what the lies that big pharma has told about opioids to choose the most devastating example that's an issue that touches liberal and conservative families and that's an issue where you know it's it's not neatly cutting along the old partisan lines is that a left or right issue to think that big pharma lies and they should be held to account for their lies and they shouldn't be able to lie anymore like they're there and i would that that's that's to me where the interesting conversation is you know the the the sensoriousness of our culture the fact that you know i'm gonna get dinged by a lot of people from talking to you or that i ran glenn greenwald the other day on my sub stack as part of a broad conversation about whether or not vaccine mandates and passports are a good idea i lost a lot of subscribers because of that you know but like i think that that's a really interesting conversation to have where you have you know adrian vermeuel at harvard real conservative defending the biden vaccine mandates under the argument that it's part you know promotes the common good and glenn greenwald you know you know being very much against them so like i think it's we're living in a moment where it feels like everything was kind of thrown up in the air and things aren't quite settled yet and people a lot of people i know are thinking of themselves i think of myself as liberal and yet i really agree with the majority of what that person says and that person's a conservative like there's a lot of that happening right now so i actually think it's a very very ripe moment um and i would say that you know not trolling not acting trumpy and talking talking about the issues that actually affect all of us and where there's much more consensus than we actually realize though that to me would be a winning strategy yeah i oh but there's way there's way there's way too much there's just way too much like dunking drinking liberal tears like it's enough already i just i'm grossed out by that it's not i don't i don't think that's a winning strategy i think that's a winning way to talk to your base it's definitely a winning way to talk to our base i mean the line i i used a lot lately um and uh i i give it at events all the time is watch out for the grifters that claim to be fighting for you um because look it's easy it's the easiest thing in the world you just repeat a certain list of slogans and uh you you you show yourself as demonstrate yourself as angry as possible right because that's what people they want you to be angry you get a lot of clicks and uh probably a lot of campaign donations that way and um and and people say you know see that's what i'm talking about that kind of fighter and i asked like what what exactly are they fight how are they fighting for you or are they just fighting for their own donations whether it's on the campaign or maybe they're a pundit that's you know just gets that monetizes more clicks and uh is that really useful to you uh because it's certainly not it's certainly not producing a win for you it doesn't produce any kind of persuasion um but it makes you feel really good and that's what's scary about the world we're living in right now where it's it's just all about that dopamine high that you get from reading that tweet and liking that tweet and retweeting it and like sharing it with your friends and it's in the end like a lot of zeros and ones that go nowhere you know it bears really little relationship to people's actual lives and making their lives better but unfortunately you know these are just supremely addictive technologies and the feeling of like beating your chest for your team you know that's that's deep right like that's like what's abnormal is like what america has been at its best what's super normal is for us to get back into our jerseys and like go and like beat each other up online or in real life and you know that's the thing that scares me more than anything else is that it feels like we're sort of drifting back into the mean of history and the more i hear people sort of denigrate this country and and the virtues that you were mentioning before things like due process things like judging people based on their deed and not based on their lineage or the circumstances of their parents like these are unbelievably exceptional in history and i think that like i don't know if people realize what the world looks like what the country looks like when those are no longer things that we can take for granted and i sometimes find myself like writing pieces defending things like due process and i'm like isn't this obvious like how did we get to a state of affairs where we need to be making like core first principle arguments about not separating children in classrooms based on their race how did it get so far and it gets to the idea of standards too i mean when people you know when when general milly famously uh defended crt um as a as a post grad class at west point or maybe it was it was maybe as an undergrad class at west point doesn't really matter it's a class at an institution and you know what are you afraid of right it's just different ideas but like this this this falsehood of of academic freedom right that william f buckley was so so aptly talked about um and got him that really led to his rise which is that no look there are standards right and the re the reason i don't think you should teach crt is the same reason i don't think you should have a class on flat earth theory right because it's just it's just fundamentally wrong and we've spent hundreds if not thousands of years as a human race trying to come to some truth and it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of argument and it takes a lot of trial and error to see which ideas stand the test of time and which are objectively good and which are objectively bad and it seems like this new sort of age of 60s radicalism the the good news is about reading william f buckley is like wow things really haven't changed a whole lot so maybe they're not as dire as we thought they were because apparently this has been going on for a long time um but but i think the thing that's so different from you know where he was at his peak in the reality of the world and where we are today is that those ideas hadn't conquered like every sense-making institution in american life yeah it's true they were they were still pretty fringe they were still like isn't that a weird anomaly like let's have her on firing line to talk about it no now this is being espoused by every technology i mean it's that's show me a place where it isn't you know yeah cause i've been because i i i shared this uh chris farley skit with conan o'brien from the early 90s right after came out with tommy boy i shared it on my instagram yesterday because i was it was political in nature but it was hilarious and good-natured and he based it you know they were talking about how chris farley went to the republican conference dressed up as newt gingrich and did this whole 20-minute skit basically you know making fun of him and it was just it was just amazing it was hilarious and then and but on this late night comedy show uh they're talking about it and it's just hilarious there's no political leanings one way or the other and it was just like man i miss miss i miss when that was pop culture oh i mean you can't i mean if you wanna you can hear comedy you're just not gonna hear it on you know on television that often except for you know there are some handful of exceptions like chappelle and others who are still doing it but you know jerry seinfeld talks about how he doesn't want to go perform on college campuses anymore or brooklyn for that matter the thing i would say about just just circling back to crt for a second is that i do think that it's important for like i'm not threatened by the idea that a college campus would or a college would have a course about critical race theory and who is derek bell and why did they come up with this idea and who's kimberly crenshawn what was the intention of intersectionality versus what it is i think it's extremely important to understand all of that in order to kind of make sense of the world right now what i object to is the forced like it's it's it's not learning about crt sort of from a distance perspective it's that the ideology of crt and again there's the idea of it versus in practice of it we could have a whole conversation about that but it's like putting forcing that on children as young as kindergartners in american public schools that is what i just stridently object to and they call it something else and this is this is how the the the liberals right and then they say that you need to get them out of it well they love to play a semantic game where it's like that's not really crt or if you really want to talk about it you need a phd or law degree i call bs on that what you need to be able to judge this ideology forget the semantics of what we call it is is it re-racializing your child is it forcing your child to see themselves and their classmates primarily through a racial lens is it teaching them to hate themselves because of their race or just think about themselves obsessively because of their race a lot of the parents that come to me most alarmed in ringing ringing the alarm about crt are mixed race families where they are saying this ideology is literally telling my child that one of us is better than the other or that one of us has more claim to sort of moral authority or that one of us is a permanent victim and the other one's a permanent oppressor we don't think of ourselves that way we're married and this is our kid and this is wrong segregation is wrong and i don't care if it's packaged in all of the prettiest most social justice progressive language in the world segregation is wrong and the real heroes right now in this country are the parents of every race and class all over this country who are going to those school board meetings and standing up against this nonsense yeah and you know we had a this came up in a markup recently on my committee energy and commerce um and the denial amongst democrat politicians that there's any crt is is really unbelievable it they deny it's happening again they they squirm out of it by by saying well i mean it's not crt it's just diversity and inclusion training you know it's how can you be against that it's niceness training uh but it but it teaches these app these these core principles and you know the problem i have with teaching it at all i guess is it's never contextualized um so which i think is your point as well it's not you're not teaching western civilization first and why that's good like why that gives us all the foundations and good things that we have and then saying you know and then there's some other ideas here uh right and let's let's debate the pros and cons right and i guess what's what's hard often with this is like there's a nugget for me at least there's a nugget of truth at the heart of the woke critique which is you know i've been in environments where i'm like i wish people understood like how to make it a bit more of an inclusive environment because i don't feel comfortable speaking up in this environment like i've been in those situations and so a lot of this the the impulse toward it i think came from a well-intentioned place it's just that that bears so like it's it's a good thing to be tolerant of other people who look differently than you and if that's a good thing to teach kids right it's a bad thing to teach kids to obsess on their race and think that their race is the most important thing about them and the whole thing is how do you get from the the well-intentioned good thing to the thing we're all seeing play out right now that is so obviously bad bad for kids and bad for the country so um question you know from your perspective uh again being a you know squish at the wall street journal but a conservative at the new york times uh how can conservatives do better about talking about certain issues to to to this center we're never going to convince many on the left you know the democrat primary voters they will never be persuaded but there's quite a few other people that aren't necessarily those primary voters and uh for something whether it's like vaccine mandates uh response to covet because we try everything um we try everything whether it's was there it's scientifically demonstrating that look the unvaccinated are not necessarily a threat to the vaccinated as joe biden's speech today was egregious in that manner because i mean it's really i didn't think singling out and demonizing people who aren't vaccinated um and look i think you should get vaccinated but i also put to force that on somebody and so i mean what's the what are we missing i guess in this in this debate because we try to rely on first principles of personal freedom but it doesn't seem to resonate well that's a particularly hard one because something like public health i mean there's lots of precedent for people's personal liberty being suppressed for the sake of public health i mean it's that's a very very difficult conversation i think one never to this extent never to this one i think i think one of the things that made it's so hard to have a reasonable conversation out loud was that it was impossible to sort of separate the signal from the noise the noise coming from the right from my perspective a lot of it in the beginning was you know was this is a like there was a lot of people essentially and maybe you would say this is from the lunatic fringe claiming that this was sort of some version of a hoax and also claiming um that you know and also really pushing hard to not get vaccinated at all and so once that is out there as a very very loud voice or group of voices it becomes hard i think for people to then hear no we're saying you know get vaccinated but then we're saying you know get back to life and two years later the fact that you know people got vaccinated but they never got the second part of that promise which is get back to life and there's nothing wrong with this picture that's just a nuance that i think is very hard for them for people to hear i don't know what what do you think on this topic it's really well this one's really hard i'm always searching for the for what like the philosophical nugget is um to convince somebody to see it your way and you kind of have to understand what sort of world view they hold i mean people on the left just just have less of a problem with with collectivist action and and i don't think we're opposed to that um but you'd have to show me that there's like a you know again there's i think there's a certain pandemic where you could get a lot more conservatives to agree and some serious collective action shelter in place and forced vaccines if the death rate was like 50 you know what and and it was hitting children but when it's not even close to that the number one uh number two when the number of children that have died are in the couple of hundreds um and number three when you are actually safe when you take a vaccine and therefore it is it is illogical and irrational to believe that an unvaccinated person is a threat to you so we're laying all this out and it's a little hard for us to understand why you need the cost of collective action it's just it also just think what do you think is really driving it then like lay it out for me like i don't know we're trying to we're trying to figure it out i mean you know i just all i can do is sort of listen and and and again it's a comfort with collectivist action um there's there's a love of like of this sort of war-like footing where we all do things together and that this doesn't exist on that like we don't like that on the right we're very skeptical of it i mean the right like that in the aftermath of 9 11. so the left i mean americans like that in the app but i actually think that this is what makes you more of like but did we make but did we make everybody well well i i think one of going back to what we're saying about sort of the political realignment i think one of the things and why this this contribution that adrian vermill shared to the symposium that i did on afghanistan was so interesting to me is i actually think and and jd vance is another person that comes to mind that there's an increasing i don't know if you want to call it populism or collectivism or common good conservatism that is rising on the right that actually looks a lot more like the left and puts you in a sort of more i don't know like libertarian conservative position i don't know if you're feeling that squeak like i don't know if you're seeing that but that's certainly something that i am watching and i'm utterly fascinated by yeah i mean i'm not a fan of the the populist rise it depends on what you mean by a populist um and i define it as basically what feels good and pandering to that and i don't think there's a better way to define it like somebody who's defending it would say well you know it's what's right for the people instead of politicians and lobbyists and special interests well okay man like every political philosophy believes it's right for the people and what you think is right for the people is different than what for your neighbor thinks is right for the people so when we run we have to run on a set of principles that we promise to govern by and uh so so this this sort of whimsical notion that oh we're just going to do what's right well we all disagree on what's right that's the entire point of politics is to figure out what's right via debate and via persuasion of other people so um i find their arguments really um empty to say the least and it does seem to me that it's like it's whatever shallow reasoning occurred but got really popular on social media let's make it into serious policy you know like uh it and just do what makes up governing by twitter yeah do what makes you popular like imagine that like two thousand dollar free checks to everybody or popular can't imagine can't imagine why it doesn't make a good good good policy and so so that that popular swing becomes pretty untethered from tried and true conservative principles certainly doesn't make me a libertarian i mean i i view libertarianism as a bit utopian and of itself because you know it's a good domestic economy market theory like that's that's what libertarian i like libertarianism there uh everybody leave each other the hell alone here i am with some of the populace in being skeptical of trade uh because they don't have the same rules we do and so you can't that's why it's utopianistic to think that we can just go to economics 101 and talk about competitive advantage and things like that it just doesn't work that way in the real world so donald trump is correct to be skeptical of that especially with a nation like china um you know but but then the populists go in in some other directions and libertarians they they their blind spot is um the standards we were talking about frankly like moral standards uh standards of of taboo right because libertarianism too is it too it's extreme just doesn't doesn't believe in all that necessarily whereas conservatives definitely do and we do believe that it should be based in a in a judeo-christian moral framework and that drives a lot of what we're talking about and so you know i'm not sure what common good conservatism necessarily is maybe um well this is this is where it's so confusing it's like well who's defining what the common good is and again it's just like uh there's no i i have yet to come up exactly good answer but there's a lot of really smart interesting people i know especially you know catholic conservatives who are really banging the drum about this so for me it's just something i've i've been intensely curious and sometimes they mean like look we should we should promote you know the creation of families and the the the sustainability of a family right the the unit of a civilization and that's fine at all it that's a worthy goal and we shouldn't again a libertarian would just say no you know like a libertarian will always find an excuse never to solve a problem and i don't think that's what conservatism is conservatism says let's acknowledge that problem let's assess it and then we solve it within a framework of of of limiting principles that is conservatism it's a process-oriented governing philosophy populism again it veers from that right because it's it's very liberal in that sense it wants action now you know and it's mad and it's angry and it goes off emotions and our founders were very wary of this which is why they created a system that doesn't allow for that and um the troubling thing about our system is that it's been chipped away at by these sort of populist endeavors mostly from progressives i mean i think progressivism is pure populism that's what i think because i think it's purely based on feelings uh doesn't mean that what they what the problem they want to solve is necessarily wrong it just means that the way they want to go about it is unbelievably uh irresponsible uh for the most part and does and takes into account no it doesn't take into account second third order consequences it's very naive um even if it's well-intentioned and uh as of recent i i don't think it's well-intentioned i'm very concerned about the border and what their intentions are there but um so that's how that's how i would break apart all those differences and um and i don't know where we go from here i mean like the thing about like donald trump and you know america first and populist and all in in the end though his actions were very much mainstream republican actions you know with a little bit of a tinge of skepticism of on trade with china you know everybody's like for all his skepticism of of foreign wars i mean he led a pretty good one in syria killing isis you know good on him but i'm just like his actions just don't his actions just don't match uh what the the populist wing thinks they do and i find that uh i find that a pretty interesting phenomenon yeah i there's a lot to respond to there i was going to ask you if as you were talking i was just thinking about aoc at the met gala in the dress and i i just i do think that and i mean this in a in a good way i do feel like the hypocrisy on the part of some of these people has just become impossible to look away from and that even progressives and liberals are disgusted when they see you know the san francisco mayor talking about how she deserved to party mask less in a jazz club because you know she was feeling the spirit and kindergarteners in her city have to wear a mask all day i mean this is this is just like lunacy at this point you know going back to the vaccine thing that's part of it part of the reason there's such an uproar against it like part of it's politicized right there was a time we can go through there was a it's really funny to do the side by sides of liberal blue check marks on twitter talking about how they shouldn't trust the vaccine don't trust donald trump's fda and then being like you're a killer if you don't get the vaccine you know six months later so it's very politicized on both sides of in that but also i think there's just a natural tendency for people to to um just push back when when they're pushed too hard to resist when they're pushed too hard and i would love for the government and you know the department of defense to just acknowledge that whatever you were trying to do it's not working and you have there are again limiting principles you cannot do certain things you cannot fire people because they won't get vaccinated you just can't and you can't you can't reduce military readiness because of this it's not worth it you know just from on a practical level just accept that you haven't won the debate and that people are really mad about it and just take a step back you know i mean it just like use some honey instead of yesterday yeah i would say that it makes it really hard for those of us who generally want to be law abiding compliant with public health directive people when the rules you know it's like two weeks to stop the spread has led to like two years and rolling lockdowns in a booster every year like that would be easier if we saw that the public officials that are pushing them abided by their own rules but instead they're at the french laundry or they're in sonoma or they're at the met gala and i'm sorry like it's just it it makes it really really hard not to be skeptical and and cynical a little bit which is something that i try and resist in myself um going back to the journalism real quick that you know i was at a dinner with a a bunch of journalists and they would they do kind of this thing i guess they'll pepper me with questions i was invited to that i think um that couple there's so many yeah yeah michelle yeah michelle and jamie yep yes um so it was fun and the uh but but they're like what questions do you have and i was like well i wouldn't really prepare any um but i'll just ask kind of my basics which is is there any is there any self-awareness at a place like the new york times because at least one of them was from new york times another from new york magazine is there any awareness at places like this that or do they just not care about the lack of objectivity now are they just a a partisan platform and that's it and everybody's comfortable with that um and i didn't get an answer i i'm not even sure what the it was they were just talked in circles all day long um but well if it was on the record they aren't gonna say what they really think but i'll tell you what's really true of course there's awareness especially among the older generation and the people that just believe in kind of the old school values of journalism of course there is and there's a lot of you know i think anguish about the direction of a place like the times on the part of that cohort the problem is like i mean you you can it's not just take like a a genius a market genius to see how rough uh the the world of getting a job in journalism is is these days and it's not so easy to like you know if you're trained to be a certain kind of reporter and you know go to the middle east like you need to do that kind of thing inside an organization that can give you the legal and security support you can't just like go and start a sub stack and let's add on top of that the fact that you might have a mortgage and two kids you know like it's just it's not it's not as easy i think as people want to claim um and i understand the silence on the part of of some of those people i really do and look i think the other thing is if you haven't read it and if and if anyone's listening and i think it's one of the most important books to understand not just what's going on in journalism but what's going on broadly in the country right now and it's a book by a guy called martin guri used to work at the cia called the revolt of the public it's phenomenal and one of the things he's written about in city journal and other places that is just incredibly true he calls it post journalism is that it's really important for people to understand that even though the motto is the same and the logo is the same and the print is the same what they are selling has fundamentally changed and that's not because there's like some secret cabal cooking up like what what wokeness should be and what people should believe no it's it's driven by by the tremendous change in the business of journalism right like the once the once the pers that once the bills were no longer being paid by print advertisers the bill is being paid by you the subscriber and guess what 95 of new york times readers and we could do the same thing for fox we could do the same breakdown for another place they're liberals and progressives so you want us you want to keep those you want to keep that money coming in you want to satisfy your audience you know what they're going to love another op-ed about donald trump another investigation into you know p-tape and russia you know and if you're at the new york post it's gonna be about the hunter biden laptop but you get the point the incentives have just radically changed and i think that book is really important because it's sort of sobering it makes you realize okay wait sure yes of course there are major ideas there's a major ideological push but there's also just a much more simple materialistic explanation for the transformation that we're seeing yeah yeah it's you can blame the institutions and the elites all you want but there's there's some blame to go around um you know and we all i'm not sure i fall into it i'm not sure you fall into it but a lot of people fall into it where they're just triggered by different ideas and uh i always tell conservatives that like if you do think cancel culture isn't alive and well and snowflake culture isn't alive and well on the world on the right are you kidding me yeah it's yeah it absolutely is absolutely is no it's different um yeah and it's always geared towards your own side it's like i was asked a question like do you have any examples of yourself being canceled and i was like no i i'm uncancelable um but i am cancelable by my own side i suppose all right and i suppose i suppose there's some examples of that because you like you fall somewhat outside we both know that if you went after trump in a particular way or if you went after whoever the you know you get killed by your side right that's the truth yeah they can't nobody can handle it nobody can handle like a real debate but that's because cancellation is just about policing what your own side should believe or ought to believe or is allowed to say and you know people that want to think for themselves and think freely that's i think why a lot of people are describing themselves these days as politically homeless yeah because they don't want to they don't want to have to like bow to the sensors of their side because it's who wants to live in that world it's terrible joyless and you know to get a good indication it's like you know the cry of racism on the left is akin to the cry of rhino on the right like it's it's it's it's become kind of the same catch-all term for just like yeah you made me mad and i can't explain why because i'm just so mad but you just made me mad you know it's like guys get a hold of yourselves you know get a hold of yourselves which when you say that it makes it even matter which is kind of the only way you could deal with it like sort of a smile and some humor i think um and you know and and keeping in mind constantly that it's still a it's still a pretty small minority still a pretty small minority there's there's a lot of regular i have to remind myself of that constantly so i don't become jaded which is like there's there's still a lot of normal people out there that are that are really just trying to live their lives and have kind of normal concerns i think that's most of the country and and you know it's it's like going back to what you're saying before it's like how can we appeal to you know how you can appeal to people like make their lives better explain how your policies are going to make their lives better it's going to make them you know it easier for them to have a family be healthy have you know have a little bit of disposable income and make a good life like that's where most people are most people aren't on twitter most people don't give a sh about who's getting ratio who's trending they just want politicians and public officials to be able to answer that question for them yeah because activism politics the activists they want to care about who's on trending like they want to know who you're investigating next like they want to know if you're going to lock her up um but it's like it's not what normal people care about and so when politicians like me have to also talk about the things that normal people care about like healthcare uh you know it can make them mad right and they're like they're like oh you're betraying us you're betraying us like we're very paranoid uh on our side i think the left is extremely power hungry i think we can be a little bit paranoid um and then when we get really mad when we get really mad at the left we they get frustrated and we start turning inward and um trying to tear each other down it's very self-destructive um but you know but to your point about like how do we convince the other side it's one of the difficulties we find is that we can never out promise the left right we can never out bribe the american people and you know i think one of the biggest problems and cultural trends in america is is a degradation of personal responsibility and of the mental toughness that goes along with that i think these two things are very closely linked and when you don't have those things you don't really start to believe in freedom and you know and we're selling this sort of challenge of personal responsibility and with that comes being tougher because you can't live in a free place if you're not tough enough to compete in it because it's free um and so that that's a challenge really and uh it seems that the promise of not having to deal with that challenge the promise to end suffering and to give you more because they'll always out promise us right like i can be like look a child tax credit should be two thousand dollars i believe that was in the tax cuts and jobs act actually democrats like well we'll triple it unlike those horrible mean republicans and you're like you know if the american people are willing to be tricked by that um we're in a tough place i am the last person that has followed tax bills well it's just an example right it's just like who's willing to give more you know and like it because it gets the question of like how do you make somebody's life better but i i do think that the sort of the old school conservative messaging or certainly like what i remember at the journal of you know free markets personal responsibility yeah but also like a lot of people in this country have been screwed by free markets when they look at their jobs going overseas a lot of people in this country have been screwed by it's like personal responsibility well there's there's literally no main street in in your town anymore like i do think that that old messaging needs to be married to something i don't know a little bit more compassionate or a little bit more understanding that that sort of unbridled freedom especially of the markets has led to a lot of normal people getting really screwed over and that's where i think the opening has been for some of these people on the new right like josh hawley and jd vance and i think that's why some of their messages resonating with people yeah well and trade especially and again i think that's a healthy discussion i think um you know some some of the other things they tend to say are just ill thought out i mean you know josh hawley says abolish section 230 all that does is prove to me that he's never read it and doesn't understand the implications of that policy because it won't accomplish what he thinks it'll accomplish it'll just make them sense or more and so that's just frustrating to me but it's but it's easier to say that uh you know because it's easier sure but like the the you know the old conservative line on let's say a company like amazon deciding to censor a book okay that they feel it does not meet the criteria of woke ideology like the old conservative retort to that well it's a free market free company private company they could do what they want well that's insufficient now like if we're living in a world where like all of these major technology companies are essentially colluding to suppress certain kinds of ideas it's not it's just no longer sufficient to say like free market private companies and that's i think where there's a real challenge and interesting one for the right is like okay well if that is if that's true like what what is the conservative response to that question i don't really know i don't really hear a clear conservative response to that yet well it's just well in the case of something like that and and bring it back to section 230 the answer is you can take a scalpel to it instead of destroying the whole system it's not do nothing and i that is true like the old response was very libertarian in that sense which is which is do nothing but i think conservative principles do allow you to do something because fundamentally what are we conserving is the founding and so what does the founding say well the government's job is to protect your rights okay and we define what those are and one of them happens to be free speech and you know we have to get out of this box where it's just protect your free speech from from um from government well no maybe it's maybe when another entity has become so powerful that they can actually really suppress it then maybe we have to take action um and the question so so i think the philosophy allows allows for that um and i think i think most republicans are on board with that now i would hope so but you know i look back at the past four years and it's like well no one did anything about it and it's only gotten worse yeah well it's hard it's not it's not easy nobody we have in my particular committee on that particular issue we have that legislation now it just took some time to kind of figure it out to be perfectly honest and by the time trump was really focused on it we'd already lost the house and uh you know there was there was there was no real problem solving or compromise i was going to go through which is uh unfortunate you know see how it goes for the next few years i don't even want to think about that maybe that's another conversation for

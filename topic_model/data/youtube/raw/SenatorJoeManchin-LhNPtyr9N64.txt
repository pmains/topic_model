Congratulations on being a candidate for one of our nation's
fine military institutions. One of the most important aspects of
serving our nation is being fit to serve. And today, we will demonstrate three
necessary exercises that you will have to complete during your BCT
in order to achieve your candidacy. The first is the pushup. Make sure that your hands and feet
remain on the ground at all times and that no part of your body,
aside from your hands or feet, touch the ground. Hands
shoulder length apart. Keep your core and back tight. And go in cadence with your instructor. You'll have 2 minutes to complete
as many repetitions as possible. Next, we will demonstrate a pull up. You'll be allowed to do
as many continuous pull ups as possible. You will begin by engaging the bar palms facing out at an extended hang,
pulling your chin above the bar. Keep your core and back tight
during the entire motion. For female candidates
that cannot execute a pull up, You'll be allowed
to do a flexed arm hang. You will be assisted to the top motion
chin above the bar hanging as long as you can endure. Finally, you will do a crunch sit up. Your feet will be supported. Keeping your knees at a 90 degrees angle. Fingertips on top of your shoulders
with your arms crossed. Squeeze your core and do a full range of motion
to where your elbows are touching your knees. And that completes our demonstration.

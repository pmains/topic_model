as a parent i understand that this is a shocking reality the idea that you could go to a grocery store and not be able to buy the formula that you need to feed your baby and so i am laser focused on this i'm demanding action from the administration from the fda from the the manufacturers involved and i'll be continuing to follow up with this legislatively or otherwise in the coming days

we're sleeping in the bed that we we made that's what happens when you allow energy policy to be dictated by children in europe by woke investors on wall street and by politicians who actually think that electric passenger vehicles are going to solve an energy crisis and a climate crisis the policy we have is unsustainable and we're seeing the results of it when you look at energy policy it should do at least three things number one is be reliable this energy policy of the left is not reliable from a technical standpoint it's also not reliable from a sourcing standpoint as we're seeing now where we're dependent on russian oil and gas energy should be affordable and we see right now with all-time high gas prices and oil prices that energy is definitely not affordable energy affects everything we're getting ready to start planting crops across the world natural gas is the key ingredient to nitrogen fertilizer which allows us to produce the food to feed the world as energy cost goes up the cost of everything is going to go up food costs are going to continue to rise transportation costs are going to continue to rise and it's more than just the cost at the pump and finally this the less energy policy contrary to what they say is not cleaner they're buying gas from russia and other countries that produce it much less cleaner than what we produce we've all heard about the biden administration cancelling the keystone xl pipeline union welders in my district lost their job when that pipeline was closed but when i talked to them they said did you realize this pipeline was going to use total renewable energy to pump the oil from canada uh to the gulf of the united states it was actually green jobs being used to transport the oil we produce energy cleaner and more efficiently and we're better stewards of the environment here than any place else in the world we don't need to be buying russian energy but we sure don't need to be buying iranian energy or venezuelan energy we need to produce energy of all forms and all types here in the u.s and do it better than anybody else in the world do it where we have reliable energy we have affordable energy and where we have the cleanest energy and i want to recognize and introduce

[Music] good morning welcome back into wake up America the September consumer price index numbers not good for Democrats the bottom line Americans continue to pay more for Less under Joe Biden despite the administration's alleged anti-inflation efforts inflation rose again last month to 8.2 percent over the past year now that figure above expectations and turns attention to the Federal Reserve whose persistent interest rate hikes have clearly failed to tame the nation's surging inflation for more unless let's welcome in Nebraska congressman and Senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee Adrian Smith Congressman great to see you today good morning great to be here yeah thanks for joining us so that the feds has increased these these interest rates it's affecting everyone if you want to buy a home your credit card but it hasn't worked well it hasn't worked in in the pain for the middle class and lower income folks that the pain is very real the president is dismissive of this and that that concerns me the most probably the fact that the president is so dismissive of the damage to the economy yeah interest rates right now if you're trying to buy a house for example mortgage rates are almost at a 20-year High over seven percent uh on inauguration day the national average was 2.75 percent uh so this is affecting everybody doesn't matter if you're if you're wealthy or if you're not let's talk about gas prices uh we haven't seen this in several Cycles where gas prices are rising like they're Rising right now 25 days before really important elections how does that affect voters well you know everyone sees this at the pump feels it at the pump right the president knows this that's why he's kind of scrambling to to try to get the prices down but but just think about he's going to foreign countries right it appears and bad foreign and the fact that he's shut down domestic energy production uh when we were sitting very well and and the technology and Innovation to utilize and extract our own energy I mean it's great for our environment it is good for our economy uh so many different different approaches utilizing Innovation rather than this heavy hand you know the president has this heavy hand of the federal government shutting down this prohibiting that mandating other things it's a problem mostly for the middle class yeah absolutely congressman how do you make a prison in Biden yesterday saying that if Republicans win in November inflation is going to get worse you know he's trying to distract and and deflect I mean the it is so abundantly cleared that President Biden's policies have driven inflation uh even you know several Democrats now are running away from the college alone forgiveness yeah that that's more gasoline on the fire of inflation and he knows this but he's trying to you know play Both Sides in trying to change the The Narrative you know Congressman the other side of that and I don't mean to cut you off but the late Rush Limbaugh talked about low information voters uh so people that are out there that hear that and then believe it is that an issue it is an issue and I think ultimately history will not be kind to President Biden especially for things like this and in his approach that is so dismissive of reality Congressman I want to talk about disinflation reduction act because part of it is getting these new IRS agents 85 000 of them to essentially at the administration say they're not going to go after middle-class people but they really will because they're going they're going to audit almost everyone absolutely and you know I I question whether they could even fill those jobs but I I've introduced a bill to actually repeal that put more of a focus on customer service at the IRS right so the taxpayers can call in and their their calls are actually answered I think I think the latest statistic is one in nine phone calls is answered and that's after 20 some minutes on hold oh I'm part of I've never met somebody who's had a good experience right in dealing with the IRS and it was it was a nightmare yeah right um Congress just want to get your reaction uh this poll fresh off the press overnight the AP um out with a poll overnight 46 of the American people say their personal finances are worse off under Joe Biden 46 so that's half of everyone in this country that says that their finances are not as good as they were two years ago what do you make of that well you know as they say it's gas and groceries eggs are up 30 that and you know so it's painful enough at the gas pump the grocery store it's no better in fact I think it could be even considered to be worse than even on the energy side believe it or not and we've got we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that we we change this direction that we spend less and and you know prevent inflation by spending less yeah rather than thinking we can spend our way out of this like Joe Biden thinks we're doing more is never the answer it's it's basic economics Congressman Adrian Smith thank you so much I appreciate you coming in studio with us today have a good weekend sir thank you thank you

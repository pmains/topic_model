Thank You mr. speaker is cheering the Democratic whip Task Force on poverty income inequality and opportunity i rise to commemorate Black History Month and highlight the disproportionate impact still of poverty on the African American community sadly our nation has a long history of individual and institutional racism from slavery and Jim Crow to redlining over policing this is locked many many families out of opportunities even with the enormous progress that we've made with our great civil rights leaders and foot soldiers who we honored yesterday these deplorable disparities and inequalities continued every level of our society for example the African American poverty rate is twenty-six percent nearly triple the poverty rate Americans and one in three african-american children lives in poverty the unemployment rate in the african-american community is more than eight percent twice the unemployment weight of white Americans and the medium wealth of white household is 13 times the median wealth of African American household the widest gap since 1989 and poverty just doesn't hurt african-american families we know that communities of color are two times more likely to live in poverty and too many rural white and native americans have felt persistent poverty for generations these statistics paint a clear and stark picture that Congress cannot ignore we need to get serious about ending poverty and give everyone including african-americans that people of color to live the American dream

what happened on January 2011 should not happen anywhere else and yet it's been happening almost monthly over the last almost nine years the beginning of this new year 2020 there have been six mass shootings in our country it is becoming the norm when we can't let that happen so the action that Congress is taking hopefully would go a long way to minimizing or preventing gun violence in our country we have to do that

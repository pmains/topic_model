for the first congressional district Jim Hagedorn stops on by mr. Hagedorn are you today Paul just fine thanks for having us it's great to be here uh you know this is spectacular that you're here visiting Albert Lee today and talking with some local and civic leaders so let's talk a little bit about 2018 it's gonna be here before we know it right well we're we're halfway there if you want to go from the last election to this one yeah less than a year to go for those listeners out there let them know a little bit about yourself well I was the candidate for Congress in the last race the Republican on the ballot that almost beat Tim Walz we had forty nine point six percent of the vote in 2016 we kept going you know Walz is out running for governor so now the seats open and it's the best takeover opportunity in the country for the Republican Party but yeah my background is I was born in blue earth and that's where I live today one I always say one of your suburbs here in Albert Lea Blue Earth Minnesota and I grew up on a farm over by Truman my father grandfather great-grandfather were all southern Minnesota farmers so that's a wonderful experience that I had there being on a farm and so forth and worked for a u.s. congressman had some positions with the Treasury Department where I downsized the government drained the swamp and we've been running for the seat now twice in a row 2014 2016 and we're back in it the day after the election I said we've got this we're going to get this and so we're doing just like John Klein and Newt Gingrich going three in a row so here we are now this year 2018 it's gonna be here before we know it but right now if we focus on the current for the City of Albert Lea this area Freeborn County Healthcare is a huge issue rural health care Mayo Clinic Health Systems announced back in June that services were gonna be transitioned from Albert Lea over to Austin and I know it's kind of a state local issue but at the same time nationally rural health care has to be up there with certain ticket items people are looking for answers well it is and and you're right it is mostly a state and local issue here with the the local hospital I'd say overall though it's it's part of an even bigger issue one of the reasons that I'm running for Congress is to be someone that will go to Washington work on the Agriculture Committee to sustain agriculture and also sustain our rural way of life that we have here in southern Minnesota and if you look ever we're especially farmers are under pressure with sub $3 corn high input cost Obamacare cost for them our small rural communities are under pressure look at blue earth where I live we just lost the Walmart over in Laverne way honest on the west end of this district they just lost 200 poultry jobs up in Waseca they lost another 300 jobs and then here you see the the hospital under pressure and we could lose the hospital that happened in Fairmont I can tell you it's a big deal it really hurts towns I had something I don't want to see done I sure hope that Mayo and the local people and others can get together and come to some sort of a an outcome that will allow either the hospital to be purchased or some way we can continue this and I know they're a private entity and they can do what they want but I just hope that they come to some sort of conclusion that's good for all tax cuts that's been making a lot of news right now when it comes federally a large tax cut is planned right now in the beginning stages between the House and Senate what's your take currently and what is being proposed for those federal tax accounts yeah I think you know what if we're about one year into the Trump administration and and what what I what we've seen out there is there is a little bit of a bump in the economy and some of that is because of the work that's been done by Republicans and others in Washington to to streamline regulations to make sure that we do better and allow businesses to thrive and people to have high wage jobs but there's this anticipation out there with business leaders farmers everybody that Republicans are going to follow through on their big economic changes and one of those that I've always supported and that they're working on now is tax reform you know the tax code is very complicated people are paying too much in taxes in my in my estimation hard-working people especially middle-income folks and the code does needs to be simplified flattened we need to essentially do this transform it from where the bureaucrats the politicians and the interest groups in Washington tell people how to save spend and best their money and give that power back to the people and if we do that give the tax code by eliminating some of these deductions lowering the rates I think we're gonna see the economy continue to expand and if we get up into 3.5 4% annual growth in the economy we're going to start driving up revenues and it's going to be the best thing that we can do not just to help people have more income live better lives but also then be able in a position to attack this debt and our deficit and try to drive that down now you mentioned agriculture Freeborn County 8687 percents agriculturally based here countywide you mentioned you know helping out the farmers are there things that you could do if you're on the agricultural committee to maybe increase exports to other countries and help out farmers oh absolutely that's a big part of it I mean there are many aspects to being a representative here at southern Minnesota that can help agriculture and I think we need somebody like myself a little bit of a farm background a passion appreciation for farming and agriculture and agribusiness and that's what I want to do I'm going to be on that committee and when you look at the big policies in Washington of course you have the farm bill you want to sustain agriculture you want to have a you know you want to have the programs to just make sense to keep us going and then of course we have to look at other things regulations are really piling on farmers driving up costs and Obama care I said at farm fest last year Obama care is probably the biggest issue in agriculture at least it wasn't then yet farmers spending twenty thirty thousand a year for premiums with a deductible so high the underlying insurance was worthless and when farmers are losing money or at the break-even point that becomes a big line item in their in their budgets and it really hurts it puts pressure on the small communities puts pressure on small businesses and across the board so those are the types of things in in a big macro way that I'd like to do also you need to expand those exports because if we don't expand Agriculture's the u.s. agriculture around the world we're just going to have more and more production and lower and lower costs can't have that and then I think you just need somebody who who's gonna look out for the rural areas of this district you know Rochester is doing okay there's a lot of money flooding in there Mankato doing pretty good a lot of money going there too but our rural communities are under under pressure whether it's losing schools or hospitals or jobs you know it's under pressure and they need somebody at least that's gonna advocate for us and that that would be something that I I would make a priority talk with Jim Hagedorn he's running for the first congressional district here in 2018 stopping by Cait studios not only are you gonna be in Albert Lea today you're actually going to be coming back to Albert Lee on Monday next week for a congressional candidates debate right here in Albert Lee yeah well we're gonna have a little forum about an hour before our first district meeting it's gonna be from five to six over at Wedgwood Co Golf Club the public's invited love to have you there I always enjoy discussing the issues debating the issues we did that against Tim Walz two election cycles in a row so you know I kind of miss him I like the contrast with that Liberal Democrat but in this case we're just gonna talk positively about what we believe and what we stand for and and by and large I think you know what we're seeing out there when there's seven Democrats running for the seat and all seven Democrats are running around they want to resist the president they want to replace the president they want to take us back to the Obama policies that were failed and rebuked you know people in this district didn't want big government things like Obamacare and these is massive regulations like the clean power plan and things like that and it's a-you know I I offer a contrast on the other side I'm somebody it wants to be a conservative who will be part of the US House and the republican-led house who will partner with the President to do the big things to keep America safe by securing our borders and protecting us from Islamic extremists to make sure that our economy is prosperous and people have high wage jobs through tax reform regulatory reform budget reform work for welfare us energy independence those are big issues and I'd be for all those things and then protecting our god-given rights you know the right to life the right to keep and bear arms the right to religious freedom that's what I stand for that's why I want to go to Washington that's why I want to represent the people here of southern Minnesota we on Sunday there was a shooting that took place in Texas and when we look at that you're seeing increased calls right now for gun control and reform to gun control what is your stance on that well I'm a supporter and defender of the Second Amendment I believe that law-abiding Americans should have the right to keep and bear arms and protect themselves and to use firearms in a legal purpose for legal purposes as they see fit I think we have enough laws on the books that if implemented and properly executed can help us avoid most of these problems but some of it comes down to people the the person in Texas that walked into that church is probably of the most evil people that has ever walked this earth and what he did was despicable especially the people who were there just to worship God on on a good Sunday morning it was a terrible situation but I don't think the answer is gun control and I don't think the answer is more more laws on the books I think it's an application of the laws that we already have on the books talking with congressional candidate Jim Hagedorn here right here on kte and he is gonna be stopping by Monday November 13th and Albert Lee Wedgwood Co five to six o'clock a five-dollar goodwill donation will be collected by the Freeborn Republican Party to offset cost for the events and if you're gonna be attending has to get there about

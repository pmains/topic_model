we're back with congresswoman Karen bass and to talk about health care and health insurance a headline in the New York Times was saying that Trump tries to kill Obamacare by a thousand cuts after not repealing the Affordable Care Act the Trump administration proposes giving insurance companies leeway to sell low-cost insurance with minimal coverage exactly I think that is just awful so there are a lot of people that are going to think oh great I can get affordable health care now and they will find that the minute they need to go to the emergency room that they are not covered for anything and I am hoping that that will not happen in California I think we have enough safeguards here but you can imagine many of the states that refused to implement the Affordable Care Act that's where those people will be sold those policies that's what they fought for doesn't cover cancer doesn't cover maternity doesn't cover mental health you know that's so sad because you know that people are not going to be told that when they buy those packages well on this program State Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said that this is junk insurance and that it will put people in a death spiral if those words are used in Congress don't you think there's going to be some blowback against that well unfortunately I watched my colleagues fight fiercely to have that happen because they and they did it all under the guise that the Affordable Care Act Obamacare was too expensive we needed to lower premiums but what they didn't tell people was we were going to lower premiums but there was not any there was not going to be any meat on the bone you can pay $30 for your health insurance policy but try getting sick all right we're going to move on to another topic net neutrality this week the FCC published its december order overturning the obama regulations giving net neutrality Congress has 60 days to do something about it and what this will do is overturn rules blah barring service providers from blocking or slowing access or charging more for certain content I think it's a hard topic to tackle but when people can't get what they want on the internet they probably might realize what this means what if anything can be done well I certainly hope there's a huge up where I will tell you that net neutrality would of course I support is a huge issue in the Los Angeles area what it's going to create is it's going to create first class and second class access to the internet and I think as you just said when people realize that they won't be able to get the content that they were able to get a few months ago and when they realize there's going to be two different payment structures that that hopefully will create the uproar that will overturn the spot when the internet will slow down for some exactly well that yes you don't have a fast lane in the slow lane all right let's go into one final topic that we have here because we can talk about this for a while the Academy Awards as we air now will be coming up in a week there has been in Hollywood such a focus on sexual harassment there is also a focus on sexual harassment in all workplaces including Capitol Hill right and yet what does Washington do about sexual harassment where does somebody turn well actually in DC there has been legislation that we have passed and we'll see what happens over in the Senate but I think that there has been a tremendous awareness now what we are in the middle of in our country is we're undergoing a cultural change and I'm hoping that the these students that are initiating the movement around guns will create a second culture change so as our society relook sat how we interact in the workplace and in society hopefully we'll come up with a new set of standards that will become second nature in a few months right now it's very uncomfortable and a lot of people are falling because of it because of their past behavior but I'm hoping that it will set a new standard well in Washington what's being discussed I mean there's you know certain people who have been accused we could go through you know chapter and verse and that here in the state legislature there's been just a resignation so you know do you do they worry on Capitol Hill I think people the timers might fall I think people are very worried and so there's been two things that have happened you have had a couple of resignations but you've also had a number of retirements so there's a number of my colleagues men who have been accused of inappropriate behavior who have decided not to run again so they're still in Congress but they won't be there by the end of this year and getting back to the whole situation with Hollywood and the visibility that that has had do you think it's going to make a cultural difference oh I think it already has I mean I think we're in the midst of a cultural change right now and we have to ride this one out I think it's very difficult people are uncomfortable they're not really sure how to interact with each other right now but I do think a year from now we'll see new standards set in our society do you think the pendulum this is always the question that is being discussed has swung too far in the direction of under any accusation someone is being pressured to result well I am definitely worried about that and I'm particularly worried about young women because we could have a situation and I've heard a lot of anecdotal conversation and incidents where people are saying that they're going to be afraid to hire young women and we don't want that to happen at all so but that's why I think we're in the difficult stage right now and I know we'll get through this but I do think it's common when we undergo cultural changes that we have months of discomfort all right congresswoman bass 37th district thank you for joining us today having me I'm back again and see appreciate all right thank you

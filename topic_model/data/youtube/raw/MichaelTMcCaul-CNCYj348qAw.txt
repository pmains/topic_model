I think you have improved the department significantly we appreciate that I recognize myself for questions we also want to thank you for the discussing the authorization bills particularly the cybersecurity bill which I think was perhaps most significant bill passed out of this committee in quite some time and so I thank you for that I had a question now about the border in a letter you sent to Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter dated November the 30th 2015 you requested a fifty percent reduction of flight hours by the National Guard or the equivalent of three thousand eight hundred fifty hours less than what was provided last year and then a reduction in three hundred Border Patrol agents so as we look at trying to get the border more secure can you tell me why you have requested a fifty percent reduction in aviation assets chairman you're referring to operation phalanx this is something that the Department of Defense provided over the last ten years or so which includes flight hours with DoD assets DoD began originally supporting that effort some years ago when DHS itself had far less capability in that regard both in terms of people on the ground and surveillance equipment in the air in the intervening years because of the support of Congress DHS is in a much better place in terms of flight hours aerial capability and capability on the ground and so this past year the Department of Defense and I did agree that we could accept less from DoD because of the investments that had been made over the last several years by DHS itself so overall we're at a much better place in terms of total flight hours so we accepted less from DoD which represents about a five percent cut in flight hours from last year but longer-term were in a much better overall place we move on to another issue the Paris attackers and the garland case involved what's called dark space communications in encrypted space using apps without the ability to see these communications it's hard to stop it there's been a lot of talk with the apple case obviously in the federal court you at one point time talked about that if smart people were in the room together to ensure all stakeholders are represented in that discussion that that could be part of the solution as you know that Senator Warner and I introduced a bill to form a national commission on technology and security to address this very important issue and then report to Congress just as a 911 commission did with solutions to this very difficult challenge to a federal law enforcement Tim can you give me your opinion on that chairman I agree that excuse me there needs to be a discussion among smart people to arrive at the appropriate balance solution to the encryption problem I think that in response to demands from the marketplace the tech sector is gone pretty far down the road of encryption not to hide criminal or terrorist activity but in response to the demands of the marketplace for increased security and encryption you know by Americans everywhere that has in fact made it harder for us to detect terrorist activity and criminal activity I agree scuze me I'm like right i have the same problem i agree that there needs to be a conversation among smart people representative of all the stakeholders in this debate to arrive at the and i believe there is an appropriate solution to this i were to arrive at it that includes not only representatives of the law enforcement community federal state and local privacy advocates the tech sector the intelligence community and I believe we can arrive at that if you have the right people in the room to do that so I'm agreeing with the principle of what you're saying and that is that is principally than what the bill states last question and Syrian right excuse me sir just one sec oh sure so you can hear me right back excuse me in and I apologize I think I'm in a better place okay yeah I will many of us are suffering from the same illness so I think you agree conceptually with that with the bill represents I think there needs to be a recalibration and I believe that there is a solution to this problem that encompasses all interest and some smart people if they come together to consider this issue I think and solve this issue just going to the refugees a Syrian refugee issue and we had the safe act to pass a house but not the Senate you testify before this committee that it's a challenge we know that organizations like Isis might like to exploit the refugee program and then subsequent to that the Director of National Intelligence wrote to me in a letter indicating that quote individuals with ties to terrorist groups in Syria attempting to gain entry to the United States or or have already attempted to through the refugee program let me ask you just to two part question one do you still agree that that poses a potential threat to the security of the United States let me just ask you that question first in all candor I do agree that the refugee flow coming out of Iraq and Syria represents a potential opportunity for terrorist organizations to move its members into other nations for potential attacks so I agree that there is that potential which is why just within the last several months we have enhanced our vetting for Refugees that said just week before last I was in Turkey as I think you know you know one of the places I visited was a Syrian refugee camp the overwhelming number of people in that camp are women and children who left Syria because their homes had been ravaged and destroyed and want to go back there they're the victims of terrorism and violence and so I think we need to support the effort to we settle this population someplace else but we're going to do it carefully and we put on a number of security enhancements to the process which is already very cumbersome and time-consuming and we're evaluating whether more is necessary but my basic answer to your first question is yes sir well and let me just follow when I go home and I talked to my local communities state representatives you know federal law requires that the state and local governments be consulted with end when I go home they basically tell me as you move the refugees n and they are coming into the United States now and as you move the men the local communities want to know when you're wind removing the men and where for a lot of reasons safety and security and maybe you know the safety of the refugees themselves can you tell me why this is not being done well as young as I'm sure you know the actual resettlement in the United States is principally the responsibility of the State Department and the State Department is supposed to be consulting with state governments with local communities local not-for-profit organizations my observation just in the state of Texas and I've met communities that are have embraced Syrian refugees in particular in Texas is that it's going it's going well that the communities that have accepted the refugees are embracing up of refugees they're learning the language they're getting jobs their families are relatively happy to be here that has been my observation I know that there is friction with governor's which the State Department and I have been seeking to address and I think we're in a better place now that we were say in December well yeah I would encourage you to do as much consultation as possible before they are moved into these communities with that the chair recognizes a ranking number

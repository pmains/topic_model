Mr Speaker I also rise today to commemorate Military Appreciation Month this is the time that we dedicate throughout the month of May honoring and celebrating those who have served our nation sacrificed those of our military service members their families both past and present because families are a key part of those who have served our nation their courage and their sacrifice therefore should never ever be forgotten as a nation on Memorial Day later this month we will honor and remember the men and women who have given their lives of to serve our great nation every year I join in the Memorial Day ceremonies across California San Joaquin Valley this year I will participate in the Memorial Day ceremony at the San Joaquin Valley National Cemetery in San Anela hundreds will gather there with us and in Fresno I will be speaking both at the veterans Liberty Cemetery and the Avenue of flags of Memorial Gardens but I believe most members of Congress weekly I certainly do meet with veterans we meet to listen and to hear their concerns as well as men and women serving in active duty last week when I was in the district I visited the Veterans Administration clinic and Merced and the city amar said to listen to veterans getting their health care to their concerns their needs to ensure that they get the care that they deserve and just yesterday I spoke with a group of Valley veterans visiting Washington DC through to the Central Valley Honor Flight we have these honor flights all across the country it's the 16th Honor Flight in seven years from the San Joaquin Valley 22 of them were World War two veterans and they also served in Korea and Vietnam it's appropriate to say thank you to them and to those men and women we see across the country in uniform I always remember to say thank you as president John F Kennedy once said as we express our gratitude we must never ever forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them with these words in mind I call on my colleagues and my fellow Americans to come together America wants us to come together not only during this month but throughout the year and thank those servicemen and women the veterans and their families but also do more than just utter words of gratitude because we can do better we must and we should work to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and military families receive the resources the justice and the benefits that they have earned these are our true American heroes I yield back the balance of my time

and on the topic of health equity today i would like to focus on an area of health equity that doesn't get as much attention as it should the indian health service today we are considering my bill h.r 1888 the increasing access to indian health service act which extends 100 federal medicaid uh medical assistance percentage the f map to urban indian organizations and allows tribal health programs to receive reimbursements for services provided outside of the four walls of their clinic ihs provides healthcare to 2.2 million american indian and alaska natives every year across the united states 41 urban indian health programs provided medical services to over 65 000 people per year even though they are vital part of the indian health service provider network they only receive about one percent of the annual ihs budget furthermore urban indian health programs are the only ihs facilities that don't receive 100 f map for medicaid services under the american rescue plan i successfully advocated that for the next two years urban indian health programs will receive 100 fmap but this is merely a temporary policy we need a permanent fix miss man what is the current f map for indian for the urban indian health programs the services that are provided through the medicaid program would be at the state's regular medicaid match um congressman so in california that would be 50 and so a very significant difference from what the american recovery plan has provided and what your bill would provide on a more permanent basis and you're absolutely right it's the it's the one uh portion of that delivery system which is left out of the 100 percent match um and uh reeling is there any policy basis for this disparity and how the federal government funds services received through different indian health providers um i believe it is like the medicaid expansion it's sort of an accident of history right in terms of saluted and who was not excluded so i would defer to you to have a better sense of that specifically there's no policy basis that i know of congressman thank you thank you a 100 fmap for uios means the federal government would cover a greater portion of medicaid care is it fair to assume that this could help incentivize states to increase pay raise to these financially strained providers i i think it can i think it can help them increase pay for staff it can help them provide better navigation health it can help them address things like social determinants it can really provide a more robust platform of providing care and assistance thank you it is critical that we pass my legislation to ensure this long overdue policy is implemented permanently finally miss man i'd like to ask you about the other provisions of h.r 1888 that would permanently allow ihs clinics to receive medicaid reimbursement for services provided outside of their clinic the administration recently extended the grace period that allows for this type of reimbursement through the end of fiscal year 2021. my understanding is that there is nothing in statutes or regulations and guarantees that this ability to bill medicaid for these services will extend beyond that date ms mann would it be beneficial to ensure that tribal health care providers can maintain this reimbursement for care outside of the four walls of their clinics beyond 2021 absolutely and there have been steps taken um under the obama administration were taken to be able to extend that 100 percent fmap for contracted providers but but it has not uh been as even-handedly provided for as as as your legislation would do and i think there's been a lot of temporary flexibilities that have been granted during the pandemic that um states and the federal government and healthcare providers need to look carefully at and determine which ones ought to be made permanent you

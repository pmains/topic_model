here to welcome congressman Michael McCaul thank you Wow well thank you so much Nancy and it's not about me or Cris although that you were great Ally friend and colleague and thank you so much for your leadership for the cause I agree with you on the NIH issue I don't think we can that that's an area of research and development we cannot afford to cut and so we can work in a bipartisan way in those these issues this caucus is really designed obviously that it isn't by person caucus and it is designed to give the children a voice it's not about me or Chris or the member so much it's about these children that we see in the hospitals all the time that are dying it still remains the number one killer of children in this nation and that's unacceptable and there's only been one drug developed and that was in the 1980s that we haven't had one drug developed since the 1980s I should say and that's that is shameful and so we wanted to do something about it because I heard the stories you know Nancy I came to me and told me her story you know that Jacob and then Tim and Donna Culver out of my district and Brennan where are you right there in the front row they brought this issue to my attention in my first term in Congress it's hard ways my fourth are going on mate hopefully five that's all you need more sins and the story of Adam and Adams angels and and you have a net Leslie and her son Carson in the book care to me which is so dramatic you know it doesn't matter what your party affiliation is this is a human issue that deserves to be deserves the attention of the Congress and so we want to do something legislative wing him I must say Chris gave me a lot of the credit but it was really it was really Nancy's idea and she came to me with this right that was kind of a brilliant idea it didn't cost a dime but what it basically said was it a few a direct company because there is a market failure for orphan drugs for these these childhood cancer drugs there's that they can't make money off these drugs and you know money is the bottom line to some of the issues and so how do we incentivize them to do that well it's really Nancy's I dare you can do that if you basically they develop a childhood cancer drug which we haven't had since 1980s then you will get a voucher for a nother more profitable direct to put at the front of the line within the FDA a voucher that's worth a lot of value a voucher that will incentivize these drug companies to move forward with drug discoveries I think a voucher that will at the end of the day will save children's lives and at the end of the day that's what this is all about is making a difference in the lives of others I can't think of greater lives to impact than our children you have so much value to us and it was a process that was actually quite interesting I you would think this would be kind of an easy sell but nothing in these days in the Congress I'm sorry Chris love did not do that but nothing is an easy sell in these days in the Congress it's a very is you know bit erson a very partisan bitter environment unfortunately not very many bills have passed this Congress as you know this is one of the few bipartisan bills it's actually passed House Senate and signed into law when anciens here get to celebrate that with the present I'd stayed signing that bill into law we'll take effect next month and one of our addition to my wife Linda at one point the bills in trouble and she said you know what I'm going to fly she's yet we have five kids of her own I'm going to fly up to Washington and we're gonna get this thing done and so we set up meetings office to office with members to persuade them on the relevant committees that this is the right thing to do and she would say you do you want to be the one to vote against this bill which will save children's lives do you want to be that member of Congress because we will get the advocates out there and they're going to know that because you all have a lot of power yeah we'll get the advocates charged up and fired up and you're going to know your constituent from there you got it against this they did kind of pucker up hold it when Linda said that it's heaven it's pretty effective and then our secret weapon Brianna go Brianna 16 years old cancer survivor one of the best spokes persons I'd say spokeswoman I guess you're becoming a young woman now that I've ever seen in my life we took her on the house where I take my children on the orbit to take Brianna on the house Florida literally whip votes and we did see Nancy Pelosi and said hey that's a big fish you can get hurt it you sign on that'd be great she's I normally don't do this she says but she looks at brianna and she says okay I'll sign up on your bill and then as Nancy said ever rampal Nancy Pelosi in the same bill is an odd you'll see that very often but thank you Briana you're such a delight not know the day and I'm like Kelly here's great advocate is going to introduce you but the day the bill passed after she came up and helped this Lobby wounded I got the save this letter and it said Mr cash McCall hey it's brianna i just want to let you know that i heard that our bill passed and when I heard about it I stood up in the classroom and I screamed at the top of my lines there was this the cutest medic to get from a 16 year old and she said you know it's not that often that a teenager like me gets to work to get a bill passed into Congress what what a great experience that was for you and thank you for your advocacy and when de thank you for yours and Nancy and colors and everybody who's been a part of this dr. pop plaques out there we just it really came together at the end and it's a miracle and it's something I know we'll all look back to be proud of because it will make a difference at the end of day

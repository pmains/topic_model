rejoined by two congresswomen elect from the most diverse gop caucus in modern history we've got cat comic from florida's third district and we have ashley henson from iowa's first district ashley i want to start with you because it seems as if any expert on this last 2020 election would have told you that iowa was going to turn blue uh the same way that texas was going to turn blue what is going on with the demographics in iowa obviously president trump still carried the state journey ernst and was elected to her senate seat again is there a changing of the guard happening in iowa or is it just more wistful thinking from individuals as it's the same thing we're seeing down in texas well i think what it comes down to iowa voters are very discerning we are the first state in the nation obviously for the caucuses so we have unprecedented access to our candidates that's what iowa voters expect they expect accessibility and transparency and uh they were not getting that um here in iowa's first district and when i drove my minivan literally 60 000 miles around the district over the course of this campaign what it came down to is uh they were tired of what the liberals were doing with the chaos and dysfunction in washington dc uh just this week is a shining example of how out of touch the democrats in control of congress are with nancy pelosi's leadership uh instead of bringing to the floor this week covet 19 relief for iowa families and businesses that are struggling right now to get reopen and survive through this holiday season they were bringing up bills about big cats and cannabis it's not to say that conversations shouldn't be happening but boy their priorities are backwards and that's what i think people in iowa were tired of they sampled it in 2018 and they said no thank you

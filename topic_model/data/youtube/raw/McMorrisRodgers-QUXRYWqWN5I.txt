thank you madam chair and good morning everyone welcome to our consumer protection and commerce subcommittee markup as you've heard we're considering two bipartisan bills the first one I'm leading on is HR 47 49 or 47 79 to extend the u.s. safe web act and I want to thank my colleagues Robin Kelly Larry Bhushan and the chair Schakowsky for joining me on this legislation HR 47 79 extends the safe web act through 2027 and requires the FTC to report to Congress about how they've used the act how many cross-border complaints the commission has received and acted upon the identification of foreign agencies the Commission has cooperated with on on enforcement actions the litigation the Commission has brought in foreign courts and any recommendations the commission may have to advance its international mission this report will be critical to our oversight duties to ensure the Commission is using the tools we provide them to to protect people from spam spyware deceptive advertising data security breaches and importantly from foreign companies violating privacy protections it is critical that we ensure people have the information they need and the protections they deserve when it comes to online activities knowing who you are dealing with online is fundamental for people to have trust in the Internet as we heard at our FTC oversight hearing in May and at our legislative hearing last month the safe web Act makes sure the Commission has the tools they need to protect people from international schemes that can ruin lives unlike other international jurisdictions where they focus much of their efforts on regulations the FTC is the global leader in strong enforcement actions the safe web Act also allows the Commission to share information and provide investigative assistance to foreign counterparts for example because of the safe web act the FTC worked directly with UK and Canadian authorities to halt a sweepstakes scam targeting seniors the FTC also worked with Canadian authorities on qapla case against VTech a Hong kong-based company which was the Commission's first case involving internet-connected toys the safe web act has also been critical to securing and enforcing cross-border data arrangements such as the EU US privacy shield cross-border data fluid flows like this are essential to America's leadership in tech and innovation right now authoritarian countries like China have protectionist data regimes and are exploiting unlimited data server surveillance over their own citizens in a global economy these practices are dangerous and they threaten America's future global dominance to win the future it is critical that we with our allies have enforceable agreements to safely allow cross-border data flows this will ensure our innovators can beat beat China while also protecting people's privacy from scams spyware and other attacks we all know the internet knows no borders because of that people need to trust that they are protected from online threats that originate in foreign countries we need to know who we are dealing with ensure that the FTC can lead with our allies and also to make sure people are protected that's why the safe web act is critical it's empowering the FTC and the United States to be the global leader in combating fraud and privacy violations I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support HR 47 79 and encourage the rest of the world to follow our leadership for strong consumer protection and innovation the second bill today is HR 3851 led by MIT's mr. Welch and mr. bill raucous to extend funding for the travel promotion program brand USA brand USA promotes travel to the United States and does not cost the taxpayer a dime it helps drive international travelers beyond gateway cities and into many of our district America has so much to offer beyond the big name destinations such as one of the best wine destinations in the world Walla Walla Washington serving the right 31:51 as well and I thank you and yield back

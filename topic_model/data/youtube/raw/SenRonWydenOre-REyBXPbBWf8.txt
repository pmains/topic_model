under Whitehouse thank you very much not just for today when we're going to talk about wildfires but because you have year after year been on this floor prosecuting the consequences laying out the consequences of the failure to deal with climate change and certainly it is hotter and drier in the West and what I'm going to do is spend some of this short period we have together describing how these wildfires they're not your grandfather's wildfires they are bigger they are hotter they're more powerful in my home state last summer we saw a fire leap the Columbia River Columbia River has always been a break in terms of fire fire just leapt over it and we're seeing that around the country it's getting worse and today the fires are so bad the smoke is so thick people in my home state are fleeing their communities to find pockets of breathable air in Portland residents are being warned against spending time outside and advised to wear a respirator if they must those without homes to provide safe air are being told to seek shelter from the smoke in public places like libraries and government buildings so I'd say to my friend and the presiding officer is also Westerner a friend this is not the stuff of fiction this is real life right now for communities across the West that are just getting clobbered by fire this is climate change at work Center Whitehouse and I speak today they're more than 100 large wildfires destroying homes and businesses across Oregon and the West burning almost 1.8 million acres farmers have watched as crops are burned to the ground families located in evacuation zones flee their homes choking smoke throughout my state has left children and seniors afraid to go outside and schools cancelling sporting events because of unhealthy air quality I remember when I began in public service Westerners would prepare for individual fire seasons and some would be a bit worse than others but now we basically are in a situation where we have infernos raged throughout the year in California for example the Thomas fire set the all-time record wouldn't want to have it as the state's largest recorded wildfire in December not exactly a Christmas gift and the record didn't stand long my colleague just mentioned Mendocino last week in Oregon the Taylor Creek fire and garner fire led agencies to issue evacuation notices to more than a thousand people this is the second year in a row that air quality in Southern Oregon has ranked among the worst in the nation when I was driving to Southern Oregon recently to get a briefing from fire officials the smoke in effect was coming north drifting a hundred miles north of Medford so in my hometown of Portland now this week air is at unhealthy levels the fires have gotten so big that the plumes of thick choking smoke are showing up on Ned satellite images from space my colleague and I served on the Intelligence Committee together and I think increasingly we are going to see folks at the Forest Service and on weather agencies be interested in a lot of those kinds of satellite opportunities in order to better get a handle on the dimensions of the problem a huge portion of my state is blanketed with smoke and this is taking place when hikers fishers rafters and guides along with countless tourists from around the country ought to be enjoying outdoors talk about economic consequences senator Whitehouse recreation has become a big economic engine in the West I'm very pleased to have been the sponsor of a bill with chairman Rob Bishop who I think would be pleased if I called him one of the most conservative members of the other body our bill is called the R&R bill recreation not red-tape just sensible suggestions for putting permitting information online this sort of thing pretty hard to recreate in the West Senator Sullivan of everything's burn it up pretty hard to really cap the potential of this extraordinary new recreation engine but dangerous fires and unhealthy smoke are blocking right now recreation opportunities for folks in the West to get outside it's an economic night went nightmare in addition to being a danger to life and property now we don't remember wildfires this catastrophic happening 30 years ago and people want to know why my view is it is not a coincidence that the mega fires now happen routinely and are getting bigger and a significant factor in this is climate change according to research by Oregon State University our average temperature has increased by more than two degrees over the past century last week the National Weather Service issued an excessive heat warning for the Willamette Valley advising the heat could touch 100 degrees this is not Death Valley President Senate knows our area we don't get roasted by triple digit heat or we didn't used to but we are today the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency announced the contiguous United States experienced the warmest July in recorded history the temperature hikes baked forests and landscapes they dry out materials and they are magnets magnets for fuel for the inferno yet the Trump administration is Senator Whitehouse has talked about seems to be working overtime to say that this hid and the problem for starters the president called the United States out of the Paris climate agreement which would make us the only country to reject it and what I was particularly troubled about the center White House knows more about this than any senator is the arguments that they made weren't tethered to the facts they kept saying there were all kinds of mandates in the agreement as my colleague knows there really aren't it's voluntary there's a wide berth for countries to pursue strategies that make a sense for them and it's not just pulling out of international agreements at the Department the interior secretary Zinke is doing everything he can to rollback environmental protections I say to my colleague I was one who voted for secretary Zinke he said he was gonna be a rose about Republican president Senate would be interested in this he said that nine times in his hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and I thought he's a duck said he was a football player I'm basketball player I give it a shot I now consider that one of the worst votes I've cast in my time in public service because he's doing everything he can to roll back Environmental Protection's giving oil and gas executives free rein to exploit public lands and he's putting an end to common-sense regulations the curb emissions of methane a dangerous greenhouse gas story didn't get better at the Energy Department they're they're wrapping themselves into a legal pretzel to figure out how to waste taxpayer money to prop up the coal industry and then an energy source whose cost are too great for the market to bear over at the EPA the Environmental Protection Agency they're rolling back fuel standards for cars that's a double loser bad for the environment environment bad for the consumer we're gonna have to pony up a trillion dollars more at the pump and while the federal government is abandoning leadership they're also browbeating the states to do the same thing the Trump administration now threatens California's abilities set its own air quality standards under the Clean Air Act which affects 12 other states including Oregon how many times colleagues have we heard senators come to the floor of the United States Senate virtually pound on their chest and say the states are the laboratories of democracy basically on climate change senator Whitehouse what the Trump administration is saying is there for states rights if they think the state is right that is their position on climate so it's clear we're not seeing any real movement from the Trump administration two weeks ago the president tweeted several times that water from North Cal Northern California is being diverted that Pacific Ocean rather than used for firefighting state officials and Republicans California veteran Republicans said essentially that this was nonsense when the president asked his press office about the tweet they really went completely silent the megafires are the new normal so Westerners are gonna have to embrace new cooperative and collaborative ways of dealing with the effect of climate change our priority ought to be to work with the States government at all levels should continue to develop more efficient low carbon energy technologies renewables energy storage it's a winner all around for Oregon the West in our country not only are solar and wind cleaner they're also cheaper than a number of the plants that burn fossil fuels what we said in our tax reform bill is that they're more than 40 separate breaks in energy many of them just monuments to yesterday yesteryear we proposed throwing them in the trash can out they go forty billion dollars worth over a few years and substituting the 40 for clean energy clean transportation fuel and energy efficiency that is going to be in line with what Senator Whitehouse has said which is America can get more green for left green for fewer taxpayer dollars so I very much appreciate my colleague coming to the floor today and I want to close with just one point more than any other factor of my time and public service I think I've discussed this with both the president Senate and Senator Whitehouse what I have been interested in finding is what I call principled bipartisanship bipartisanship is not about Republicans and Democrats taking each other's dumb ideas anybody can do that then you can pat yourself on the back and say oh my goodness we're being bipartisan what it's all about is finding good ideas and what Senator Whitehouse has done and boy do the fires in the West right now convey the urgency is he has tried to in effect take markets marketplace forces and fuse them together with the best environmental practices we know of now both sides ought to find that pretty attractive conservatives can say senator Whitehouse is talking about using marketplace forces and he's attracting some pretty prominent Republicans to his ideas as well and Democrats can say we're not going to dawdle in terms of trying to improve the environment and we're not going to turn back the clock on environmental practices so I very much appreciate senator Whitehouse's a leadership I'm going to have to run off to another meeting and we'll just say that I appreciate him including me I would say to colleagues it might not be that wildfires are happening in your state this morning but climate change affects every single American in one way or another and we've got to find a way to create a bipartisan path to address its growing harm with thanks to Senator Whitehouse I yield the floor I thank

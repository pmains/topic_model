Mr Speaker we thank you for the opportunity to gather as Democrats in this special order 30-minute opportunity to discuss our nation's recent free trade agreements and I will note that nomenclature free trade there are concerns about fair trade being the outcome and we'll be talking about that here in this format this is more important now than ever before as our United States Trade Representative ambassador Michael Froman testified before the House and Senate today the trans-pacific partnership negotiations are being held as we speak this week in New York City and some members of course have suggested a trade promotion Authority bill that are referenced as a fast-track that may be introduced in the near future a fast-track that would deny the checks and balances of Congress one that would not allow us to actively overview the the impact of these negotiated settlements these contracts and would require a simple thumbs-up thumbs-down boat without again that interactive quality that serves that responsibility to the the members of Congress but before we give away Congress's ability to conduct proper oversight and review these trade agreements that are currently being negotiated including the trans-pacific partnership we need to discuss how free trade agreements from the past two decades have not delivered on their promises these trade deals will have far-reaching impacts on American life they could include impacts on food safety or perhaps affordable medicine or perhaps regulations with the banking industry the financial industry let's not be reckless and allow these deals to move forward without thorough and proper consideration by Congress and frankly these deals have not lived up to the hype President Obama indicated as much in his recent State of the Union message where I quote the first one to admit that pass trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype so whether it was NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement or the Korean Free Trade Agreement supporters of our past FDA's have promised these deals would create a good outcome create United States jobs create a lesser trade deficit and improve global labor and global environmental standards but tragically ly this has not been the outcome TPP's supporters have said this one will be different the trans-pacific partnership which could cover a great majority of the international economy has its support is saying that this will be a 21st century agreement far different from those that have preceded it but leaked information from the TPP negotiators shows that it is being modeled on or by the negotiations itself not by the negotiators showing that it has been modelled on trade policies that have proven to offshore good-paying jobs in our economy and force wages down for America's working families that is why respected economists including many that have previously supported free trade such as Jeffrey Sachs as well as Nobel Prize winners Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman have expressed skepticism about the trans-pacific partnership negotiation they are coming to realize what many of our constituents have long known these trade agreements do not respond favorably to the American middle class sack speech at a trade forum on Capitol Hill including comments that and i quote indicated that i don't think TPP and TTIP rise close to the standard of being 21st century trade and investment agreements not even close they are very much 20th century agreements which were already out of date by the time they were negotiated this is an apt a treaty with large or this is the same negotiations that we've had in many other cases mr. Krugman in the New York Times indicated and I quote i am in general a free try later but i'll be undismayed and even a bit relieved if the TPP just fades away the first thing you need to know about trade deals is in general is that they aren't what they used to be the glory days of trade negotiations the days of jails like the Kennedy round of the 1960s which sharply returned the world are long behind us and then mr. cichlids in the New York Times is quoted as saying and I quote based on the leaks and the history of arrangements and past trade pacts it is easy to infer the shape of the whole TPP and it doesn't look good there is a real risk that it will benefit the wealthiest sliver of the American and global elite at the expense of everyone else so tonight I hope we can have a thoughtful discussion about jobs about wages about environmental standards that could be impacted about child labor laws that could perhaps be implemented in thrust upon us that have been promised for every FDA in the past two decades sadly our constituents are looking for that sort of progressive outcome that has not really been realized and certainly our workers have been impacted I represent a district that is tremendously impacted by these trade negotiations so tonight it's a pleasure to work with my colleagues to get out the message about broken promises of our trade agreements and I see my good friend and colleague who has been a very passionate voice on speaking out about these issues and that is Tim Ryan our representative from Ohio from Ohio's 13th district yield to mr. Ryan so that he can share some thoughts with us welcome thank you so much I want to thank the gentleman from New York it's always fun to be here with you in the later evening hours but as I'm listening to you talk and about fair trade versus free trade and what some of these agreements you just got to go to the communities I mean this is not rocket science go to the communities that have been impacted over the last 20 or 30 years going back to NAFTA and CAFTA and all of these other agreements and look at look what's happened in places like Youngstown Ohio or upstate New York or in Connecticut up and down the East Coast we have in Ohio several companies that after the NAFTA agreement started moving wholesale their manufacturing facilities from warren ohio or youngstown ohio just over the border in Mexico just over the border with cheaper labor and no environmental Labor Standards to to be seen and ship the product right back over and decimating communities across Ohio like the ones that we represent there's a state route in Ohio that goes route state route 7 it goes from the lake all the way down the Ohio River and if you want to see what these trade agreements have done in the heartland go take a ride down Route 7 especially the southern part go through Steubenville and East Liverpool Ohio but on the Portsmouth you know go through Athens County you will see the erosion of what used to be the industrial might of the United States of America that has eroded communities in the ripple effect of the job aspect of it your unemployment people now there's no one to support the schools now there's no one to support the mental health levy now there's no one to support the libraries now there's no one to throw 20 bucks in the basket at church on Sunday the ripple effect throughout these communities has decimated the middle class and decimated our communities and reduced opportunity for our young people who we want to thrive in manufacturing in the United States so these trade agreements I don't want I don't want to see GDP I don't want to see numbers I want to see what it's doing for average Americans and middle-class people period end of story how does it help them and drive to the communities and you're going to see so we have not negotiated these agreements because if there's growth and there's increased profit and the stock market's going up where's that money going it's not going to the middle class people used to be middle class people in our congressional district and I've told this story before we have a billion-dollar steel mill that's located in Youngstown though why the company asked us to fight to put tariffs on the dump Chinese tubing steel tubing that was coming in and the President to his credit put the tariffs on they built the steel mill so when you level the playing field when you say if you're dumping or you're manipulating your currency which is something that we've got to get in this agreement is real teeth into the currency manipulation issue or the environment or labor then people and companies will reinvest back in the United States and you can reinvigorate State Route seven it going north and south in Ohio and to me that's the most important part what are we going to do how are we going to write agreements how are we going to structure our trade to operate in a way that draws investment into the United States one last piece the small and medium-sized manufacturers get hammered and this you want to be pro-business you want to be pro middle class small business medium-sized businesses the tool and die maker the mom-and-pop manufacturer that operate in communities like ours the people who treat their employees like they're family the ones that sponsor the little league team or the soccer team they're getting wiped out in these agreements and we're not factoring them in so if we want a small robust middle-class business community in color mid-sized cities in America these are the kind of things we need to factor in when were you know operating yeah we got to invest in roads and bridges yeah we got to invest in infrastructure we got to do research you know we got to make sure that we have an educated skilled workforce we should invest in the additive manufacturing all the rest but the trade agreements are ki and if you look at what Korea has done to our auto industry and to our trade deficit with Korea just those two things we've lost tens of thousands of jobs because of the Korean trade agreement and our trade deficit with them has skyrocketed the proof is in the pudding and if we want to bring back the state route sevens in Ohio of America then we need to do exactly what you're saying mr. Tonko and what rosa DeLauro is going to say and what others are going to say tonight we need to reframe the way we talk about this so I'm very thankful for the invite here and I appreciate your passion and how you believe and understand we got to do real economic development development in upstate New York in places like my community so thank you for being a leader on this issue well thank you representative Ryan for bringing it right down to the basic core ingredient that is the dignity of work for American families you speak it so well with those who represented Ohio and you know this is about broken promises it's about promises for jobs promises for worker opportunity promises for environmental standards promises for labor standards we need to let the American public know exactly what's happening and if you're a believer in fair trade not necessarily free trade if you believe in that fair trade and you don't think a fast track where we circumvent the the authorities and responsibilities of Congress then let your voice in Congress know that let everyone know what you're thinking because these are critical moments

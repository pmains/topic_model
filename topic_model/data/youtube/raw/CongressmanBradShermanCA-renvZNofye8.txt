the entire country's been captivated by Isis the beheadings on YouTube revolts us all but the Shiite extremists Alliance based in Teheran is more dangerous and more evil they have killed far more Americans hundreds in the 1980s in Lebanon hundreds in Iraq and hundreds in Afghanistan from Iranian provided IEDs this alliance of Iran Assad Hezbollah and the Houthi is racking up victories in the Middle East now they're not just more evil because they kill more they've killed more Americans they've responsible for the deaths of 200,000 Syrian civilians the difference here is that Assad supported by Iran and by the money that Iran now has available when we when Isis kills 50 people they put it on YouTube when Assad kills a hundred that it would kills thousands he has the good good taste to deny it now this the nuclear deal was not supposed to be a get-out-of-jail-free card for everything that Iran does we have sections 301 and Section 302 of the Iran Threat Reduction Act that I worked with our former and present chairman on you've only designated 70 entities under 301 but just as important under 302 you have not sanctioned a single business that I can identify for doing business with the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps an entity that puts new blood on its hands every day in Syria mr. Smith what's the most prominent or well-known company that has been sanctioned for doing business under Section 302 for doing business with the Iran Revolutionary Guard court sir I'm sorry I'd have to get you that information I've got the end for me 0.0 we've done a significant amount of IRGC designations IRGC is it designations are nice what about sanctions designations are sanctions sirs designations under this as we're talking about secondary sanction so when we designate an IRGC if you have the IRGC label on our website then okay the IRGC is in trying to do business in the united states the IRGC is getting its supplies from companies in Europe which European companies have you sanctioned for doing business with the Iran Revolutionary Guard Court when we designate an IRGC and we put an IRGC tag that carries secondary sanctions have use the secondary sanction mr. Smith or can you just the filibustering supposed to go over on the Senate side the the answer is if they carry secondary fish have you designated have you been posed a secondary sanction on any business on Europe you because the European actors have moved away from that business and none of them are doing business with the IRGC I have not seen evidence of European actors continuing to deal with the IRGC okay what about eight what about South Asian and East Asian actors I haven't nobody's doing okay because the Treasury Department has announced that the IRGC is this huge economic monolith you've only designated 70 there are a lot more fronts for you to designate but you say it's this huge economic and yet you can't find a single East Asian South Asian or European company that's doing business with them let me move on to air Mahon another designated entity the airline of choice for the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps and for thugs going to Syria to kill people they're flying Airbus aircraft into friendly countries in the Middle East in Europe that those Airbus aircraft have us technology on it what have we done to prevent those aircraft from being received in those friendly friendly cities a number of agencies of the US government including Treasury Commerce State and others have been actively engaged to try to prevent Mahon air from being able to fly have we adopt anything or are we just sending letters we have stopped where if we stopped Mahon I don't think I can say in this setting then you get that to me confidentially we haven't let's plate this they're flying into an awful lot of European and Asian and Middle East uh friendly cities why haven't we went nailed a single Bank for doing business with Mahon no secondary sanctions on any bank we continue to try we continue to do what we can to follow the Aliki we can't find a single bank that's doing business with Muhammad if we find the evidence then we will go after okay but you have found zero evidence of any but I mean we're relying on the executive branch to enforce this deal because you're able to monitor what Iran does and here's an example where you can't you've got a major airline doing business in dozens of cities and you can't find them doing business with a single bank Thank You Sherman Thank You mr. Rohrabacher thank you

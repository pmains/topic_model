thank you dr greene congressman greene chairman green judge green pastor green public servant al green thank you i rise today in support of my colleagues resolution recognizing islam as one of the great religions of the world i commend my friend representative greene for honoring islam you know this action helps to honor the millions of muslims of many different backgrounds who proudly call america home as one of three muslims currently serving in congress it is my great privilege to speak here today mr speaker in the people's house about our special faith though we are a minority in this country we have participated fully in the story of our nation since its earliest days even before america's founding and our declaration of independence this brilliant declaration enshrined freedom of faith and religion for all of us today there are muslims in all parts of the country who are business owners who are teachers construction workers engineers lawyers judges elected officials the first muslim in congress my friend comes to mind keith ellison we now have sisters ilhan omar and rashida taleb and the list goes on statewide and locally you know throughout this covert 19 pandemic mr speaker you'd be hard-pressed to find a hospital in this great nation without a muslim health care worker on the front lines serving fellow americans not just in urban centers but in suburbia in rural parts of our country you know as more and more muslims call america home mr speaker we will continue working tirelessly guided by our faith to ensure our great country lives up to the principles of equality compassion and opportunity for all our faith keeps us motivated every day to advance these great goals you know around the world billions of muslims are also engaged in this struggle also using their faith as a guide we've seen what's happened with uyghur muslims we're seeing the dispute in kashmir we're seeing conflict dealing with the israeli-palestinian question and sadly we still see muslims who endure hurtful stereotypes and discrimination on this journey but our faith teaches us to be bold to be brave and to always choose love over hate so we will not be deterred mr speaker i'm a proud muslim a proud american and i'm honored to be a member of a very diverse and growing global community and i'm thankful to live in a country that enshrines the right to practice this faith we wouldn't have the foundation for american muslims in this country mr speaker were it not for the contributions of african-american muslims scholars say 30 40 maybe even 50 percent of the slaves who were brought here from west africa were muslim we see muslims as first responders i was one of them we see muslims who were part of responding to the call to fight against terrorism in a 9 11 reality and often times threading potential attacks that you'll never hear about in the news because muslims are on the front lines in our law enforcement community and in our intelligence services muslims have been critical in this country with establishing islam and promoting self-respect self-determination creating your own enterprises and businesses we hear terms now like stay woke i submit to you mr speaker that that terminology came from the contributions and the foundation laid by african-american muslims began as a colonel in the inception of this country and it started to blossom in the early 1920s and 30s during the great depression and during those times you had variations of islam that was not arabized because if it was an error presented islam it wouldn't have been attractive it certainly wouldn't have been attractive to me but the islam that was presented was created in a way to fight against the poison and the toxicity of white supremacy and now you have a beautiful religion with an interfaith coalition with christian brothers and sisters jewish brothers and sisters sikhs hindus atheists buddhists all coming together to make america a better place now some people are comfortable with talking about islam and in their critiques of islam they overlook the hypocrisy of their own faith you cannot really call yourself a lover of god and show hate for others of a different faith you cannot call yourself an elected official and a representative of the people if you're only committed to serving and representing one segment of the population and you certainly can't call yourself a true public servant without recognizing the contributions that have been made by this wonderful community i salute representative greene for his bold leadership for his visionary leadership as a proud christian man in the tradition of jesus christ knowing that in my father's house there are many mansions to stand up and recognize the wonderful religion of islam i commend you i thank you because we are america i yield back mr speaker

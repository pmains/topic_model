  THSPEAR PRO ORE:HE   CHA NOW RECGNIZ THE   GELEMAN FROM NTH CAROLINA,  MR. MCHRY, FIVE MINES. MR. MCHENY: I THANK U, MR. SPEAKER. MR. SPEAKER, RI TODAY TO   NOR T LIFE A LEGACY OF  GREAT AMERICAN, A MESSENGER FOR  OUR LORD AND SAVIOR OF JESUS   CHRIST, AND A MAN NORTH  CAROLINA PRODUCED, BILLY   GRAVEMENT HE WAS BORN IN 1918  IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA,  WHERE HE GREW UP THE SON OF A  FARMER.  IN 1939 HE WAS ORDAINED AS A   MINISTER THUS BEGINNING WHAT   WOULD BE HIS LIFE'S CALLING. IT WAS IN 1949 THAT REVEREND   GRAHAM GAINED THE INTERNATIONAL  PROMINENCE HE IS KNOWN FOR   TODAY. IT WAS THAT YEAR THAT HE HOSTED  THE LOS ANGELES CRUSADE,   ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED TO BE JUST  THREE WEEKS, IT ENDED UP   CONTINUING FOR OVER TWO MONTHS.  THROUGHOUT THAT TIME HUGE  CROWDS CAME TO HEAR REVEREND   GRAHAM SPREAD THE GOSPEL OF  CHRIST.  IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE LOS   ANGELES CRUSADE, REVEREND  GRAHAM'S STATURE ONLY GREW.  REVEREND GRAHAM TRAVELED ACROSS  THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND   THE WORLD TO SPREAD THE GOOD   WORD.  AND ENCOURAGE HIS FELLOW MEN   AND WOMEN TO FIND SALVATION  WITH CHRIST. AND IN CHRIST. HE WOULD FILL EVERYTHING FROM  SMALL CHURCHES TO MASSIVE  FOOTBALL STADIUMS. ACCORDING TO THE BILLY GRAHAM  EVANGELISTIC ASSOCIATION --  EXCUSE ME -- REVEREND GRAHAM   PREACHED TO OVER 215 MILLION   PEOPLE OVER 185 COUNTRIES AND  TERRITORIES AROUND THE WORLD   DURING HIS LIFE. BUT HIS INFLUENCE DID NOT STOP   THERE. THROUGHOUT HIS MINISTRY,   REVEREND GRAHAM BECAME KNOWN AS  AMERICA'S PASTOR, SERVING AS A   MORAL COMPASS FOR OUR NATION.  HE SERVED AS A SPIRITUAL   ADVISOR TO COUNTLESS AMERICAN  AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL  LEADERS AND CIVIC LEADERS,   INCLUDING EVERY AMERICAN   PRESIDENT SINCE HARRY TRUMAN.  IN THE 1950'S AND 1960'S, HE   JOINED WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING   JR. FOR INTEGRATED CRUSADES, A   POWERFUL STATEMENT FROM A WHITE  SOUTHERNER AT THAT TIME. HE DELIVERED INVOCATIONS AT THE  INAUGURATIONS OF FOUR AMERICAN   PRESIDENTS, AND IN 1983 WAS  AWARDED OUR NATION'S HIGHEST   CIVILIAN HONOR, THE  PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM,   BY PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN.  FOLLOWING THE HORRIFIC ATTACKS   ON OUR NATION ON SEPTEMBER 11,   2001, IT WAS REVEREND GRAHAM   WHO COMFORTED OUR NATION FROM  THE PULPIT OF WASHINGTON'S   NATIONAL CATHEDRAL.  WHILE BEST KNOWN FOR HIS WORK  AS AMERICA'S PASTOR, THERE IS  MUCH MORE TO REVEREND GRAHAM.  FOREMOST AMONG THOSE IT WAS HIS  MARRIAGE TO HIS BELOVED WIFE   RUTH.  REVEREND GRAHAM AND RUTH MET IN  ILLINOIS AT WHEATON COLLEGE,   BUT IT WAS RUTH'S HOMETOWN IN  WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA THAT I'M  HONORED TO RESPECT AND -- THAT   THEY CHOSE TO CALL HOME. SMALL TOWN, A HUMBLE TOWN. IT WAS IN THE GAITHER CHAPEL   WHERE REVEREND GRAHAM AND RUTH   WERE MARRIED IN 1943.  FROM THERE THE GRAHAMS BUILT A   HOME ON MONEY TREAT'S LITTLE   PINEY RIDGE -- MONTRIET ACE  LITTLE PINEY RIDGE AND IT WAS  THERE THAT THEY RAISED THEIR   CHILDREN.  NOW, CERTAINLY REVEREND  GRAHAM'S PUBLIC WORKS WERE   EXTRAORDINARY BUT WHAT HE AND  RUTH BUILT AS A FAMILY IS  ENDURING, IS ENDURING INDEED.  WHILE AN INTERNATIONAL ICON FOR  HIS WORK SPREADING THE GOSPEL  AND CHRIST, REVEREND GRAHAM'S  FAMILY WERE THE GREAT NEIGHBORS  IN MONTREAT. REVEREND GRAHAM WAS KNOWN FOR  OCCASION A.O.L.LY ATTENDING  SERVICE AT FIRST BAPTIST   CHURCH, FOR PLAYING GOLF AND   GRAB LUNCH IN TOWN.  ONE OF THE FINEST MOMENTS OF MY  CAREER WAS HAVING AN   OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS  REVEREND GRAHAM'S  REPRESENTATIVE HERE IN   WASHINGTON.  AND REPRESENT HIS HOME IN  MONTREAT WHEN IT WAS PLACED IN   THE 10TH DISTRICT. IT WAS THEN I HAD THE HONOR OF   TRAVELING UP LITTLE PINEY RIDGE  TO VISIT REVEREND GRAHAM IN HIS  HOME.  THE PERSONAL KINDNESS AND  HOSPITALITY HE SHOWED ME TO  INVITE ME INTO HIS HOME IS   SOMETHING THAT I WILL NEVER  FORGET.  AND I EXTEND MY DEEPEST  CONDOLENCES TO EACH OF REVEREND  GRAHAM'S FIVE CHILDREN, TO ALL   OF THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AND   GREAT GRANDCHILDREN WHO HAVE   LOST A MENTOR AND A FRIEND.  AND AS A NATION, WE ARE FOREVER  INDEBTED TO REVEREND GRAHAM FOR  HIS YEARS OF SERVICE TO OUR  STATE, OUR NATION, AND THIS  WORLD. IT'S ONLY BEFITTING TORMED   TOMORROW REVEREND GRAHAM WILL  -- TOMORROW REVEREND GRAHAM  WILL RETURN TO WASHINGTON ONE  FINAL TIME, TO LIE IN HONOR IN   THE ROTUNDA OF THIS GREAT  BUILDING.  MR. SPEAKER, I CONCLUDE BY   NOTING THAT REVEREND GRAHAM IS   PASSED ON FROM THIS WORLD BUT  HE'S MOVED INTO THE KINGDOM HE   PREACHED ABOUT FOR SO MANY   YEARS.

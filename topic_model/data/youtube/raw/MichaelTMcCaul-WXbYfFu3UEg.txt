gonna call as a chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security congressman welcome back to the voice of Texas hey more Chris thanks for having me i was told to call on 820 so many wounds no that's that's cool man we'll look we'll Bend where we're having to have it okay look on some things you're working on I want to get into first off here and then I want to get into some things that have been on our radar screen Alyssa Texas first off National Defense Authorization Act this week you introduced is an amendment or a component to this that would allow some of the defense folks on base to carry concealed firearms for their personal protection what is the status of this are you getting bipartisan support on this where do we see yeah I anticipated to the past it's going to be on the House floor today and the reason Chris why i introduced the amendment he is in response to the well first of all major asan shooting and I went to the Purple Heart ceremony those of the funeral services and you know that possibly could have been avoided if we could simply let our soldiers on base carry weapons as they do in theater war what the amendment does the bill allows the commanding officer to basically deputize or a point who he believes would be appropriate to carry weapons on the base to protect the soldiers outside of the other reason why it's so important is that all these threats were getting recently from Isis and the threat stream is really ticking up right now most of these threats are directed at military installations and so I think we're on a high state of alert the military installations as security levels have gone up yeah it just makes common sense to allow our men and women who served in combat to secure weapons to protect themselves from the threat that could be both inside and outside the military installation yeah a lot of folks I think would agree with you on that Michael McCaul congressman Michael McCaul my guest right now for the tenth District of Texas you took a trip to Europe here recently what was that was that all about well was in the middle I went to Baghdad and met with the Prime Minister Baghdad's assess the situation didn't walk away very encouraged some he's in hiding the Shia militia in to fight Isis because the Iraqi National Army is so weak but that's going to just inflamed the Sunni tribes it's a real complicated situation over there and I don't think they're going in the right direction why is that a problem for us because the less ability we have to defeat Isis over there and more of a threat it's going to be to the homeland and then of course we have the honor to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu Israel who has a very strong opponent of these Iran negotiations on their nuclear warfare program he really laid out a very strong and compelling case as to why this administration is leading us down a path to nuclear disaster and so great takeaway from that we also looked at in Turkey is kind of like the these foreign fighters in and travel over to Syria in Iraq and then come back to Europe and then into the United States is a big problem in Turkey is happy that's a transit route that they take and we looked at the airport screening that's taking place right now they're starting to screen better inbound but they're outbound screening is not really where it needs to be and then we know some of our European counterparts at NATO talking about at a deal with this friend finally I think one of the most memorable experiences maybe in my lifetime was going to Normandy to commemorate victory over Europe day my dad was part of the air campaign in World War two for the d-day invasion and to see the great sites laying a wreath in honor of the servicemen and hearing that taps team play it was a very emotional experience than one that I'll never forget and then finally just go into Omaha Beach you know the bloodiest battle on these edges to see it and those cliffs you know that everybody seen the movie Saving Private Ryan but those cliffs with a client the german bunkers right on top of them just remarkable work well that was back in the day when we had an occupier of the Oval Office who actually took national security seriously I want to worry about that congressman rangel Macomb I guess from the 10th district here in the great state of Texas hehe of course is the chairman of the House Committee on on Homeland Security Michael Morell it was he's pimping a book and we all know that he is and and he has there's a lot of distrust of mr. Morelle from both sides of the political aisle and I understand that because of the way some of the things on Benghazi and such and his testimony before Congress but he grown up a point about the fact that the Central Intelligence Agency while Barack Obama and we just started off the show talking about mr. Obama's lies now it's coming out that he lied about the bin Laden raid and it's NBC coming out in the New York Times coming out and of course seymour hersh started this whole ball rolling saying the other relies told by the administration and it seems that we have been treated to lie after lie after lie and what mr. Morel had talked in an interview with fox about was another lie that while obama was going around the country saying that al-qaeda was on the road to defeat that al-qaeda was was decimated the CIA was briefing him no mr. mr. mr. Obama it is not defeated it is not decimated it is rampaging it's gathering strength so what he was being told by the CIA and other intelligence officials was not the message he was delivering to get reelected again my contention is he was he was reelected on a series of Lies would you comment on this and were you seeing the same intelligence that he was seeing and why didn't we see a more vociferous push back on this narrative from Republicans saying wait a minute that's not the truth at all well I've been talking about this false narrative for years now because when the 18 it's on the run right after the killing of bin Laden and by the way Morrell show me the photos of the line Murphy was killed but said I've been talking up this false narrative for years because it you know he talks about how we've defeated them they're on the run the Arab Spring was great great democracy Israeli Arab winter and at the same time I'm getting briefings that indicate very much to the contrary that that actually al Qaeda is spreading throughout northern Africa al Qaeda in Iraq is is in the Tasca sizing into what's now known as Isis and the Front's getting greater not lesser and that was just part of his narrative from the beginning that used in in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan close down Guantanamo but the problems it defied reality 100 he says that we needed Desmond going up if you watch and it wasn't as clear is his narrative really spun up in the last couple of years and it's um it's a lie it's like I much deeper than this it because now and I and I call this the the valerie jarrett faction that is in is in the obama administration and this is where it becomes dangerous that here too for Republicans and Democrats had sections of our government that were off-limits to politics and that they all mutually agreed on this but in the era of Obama we have seen an infection of the political apparatus that now has its tentacles in every aspect of our government even the national security component and it's putting Americans at risk and I guess what I want to know is number one what what is the GOP doing to curtail this practice which as you and I both understand the ramifications of this if it's allowed to continue that we're making national security decisions based on politics number one number two tell me that folks in the leadership recognize this is going on because outwardly it doesn't appear they do well I mean I recognize it and I talk about every chance I get on national television about the false narrative and how you know Morrell also talked about how big Godsey cross line between national security and politics with the false narrative about the video I mean this administration down plays right console he doesn't want to say the word radical Islamists because that's not politically correct and they're so concerned about offending the muzzle world rather than protecting the United States of America and so I you know I've been very uncle very loud from the the perks that i have is chairman of the Homeland Security we're passing on national defense authorization bill is very strong we are putting more money into our military in national security efforts you know I was on fox news yesterday morning talking about how you know this homegrown violent extremist threat Chris in the United States what we saw in garland texas there's two hundred million dollars at the present budget within homeland security requirement change and when you look at the line-item budget for how you can encounter this homegrown violent extremism islamic extremism there's zero that's that's that's a problem that's a real problem so we're changing the budget to reflect the realities in the needs of our national security that this president just always seems that is heaven this again that's true congressman Michael Macomb I guess right now the 10th district here in the great state of Texas I have one more national security question that I want to move on to resident Obama's executive in action memo I know you can't go into details about the enhanced interrogation technique program I'm not going to ask you for details on this but Morel in his interview with Fox did say that that's any talk to this is what Morrell said he said that waterboarding worked it was a decision only a sitting president can make and Morel was blown away by the efficacy of waterboarding and he also laid down this and this goes back to the the infiltration of politics international security concerns but even he was talking to members of Congress both political parties and laying out the EIT program he was not only not only did he get support from Democrats but he got Democrats along with Republicans admittedly that said why aren't you doing more and then he decried that sent that travesty of a Senate report that basically the Democrats had to say hey it wasn't us we weren't there we weren't in this decision making process when nothing could have been further from the truth would you address your Europe your comrades across the aisle there on the Democrat side who are now trying to say they had nothing to do with this enhanced interrogation technique program well it looks against I mean I'm frustrating the wise it's funny I guess who else is on the Intelligence Committee time Nancy Pelosi I mean lo see you know listen they anybody on the Intelligence Committee or my committee knew exactly what was going on but Republican Democrat and in the wake of 911 you have to understand the mood of the country was to to win at all costs and you know what it was done a very limited narrow circumstances and I'll tell you that's Chris it worked and it saved American wise there were multiple plots major plots that were stopped because of these enhanced interrogations and clits Sheikh Mohammed the mastermind of 911 911 was not the only plot that he had on the books and we were able to stop people asking Jack and we stopped all this from happy have we been able to keep America safe you know well it's because we've had good intelligence could law enforcement and we've also these techniques gave us great intelligence to protect Americans you know what I'll stand by that decision I think was the right thing to do alright last thing I want to talk to you about by the way congressman Michael macomb I guess right now for the 10th district here in Texas he of course is the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security US side onto an amicus brief challenging resident Obama's unconstitutional executive in action memo and just just so you know some background on this congressman I don't think I talked to you about this the last time we had you on that's that's how i classify what he did because you and I both know he didn't put pen to paper and make it an actual executive memo because or an executive order rather because that subject to judicial review and he couldn't have his his executive order subject to review so he just whispered in jay johnson's ear and jay johnson dutifully saluted and instituted this by the way and i'll throw the cinemas aside they washed in Times and other outlets doing reporting that DHS is continuing to even right the injunction here in Texas on this this memo of his they are continuing to process amnesty applications for these illegal immigrants number one what what is Congress going to do about the Department of Homeland Security violating a judge's order number one and number two tell us about the amicus brief well i joined 112 of my fellow Republicans i'm also a member of the Supreme Court Bar to sign on to this important lawsuit to stop his executive amnesty and Pinot he said himself 22 times even have the authority to act law and I think everybody it's taken a you know a government course in Constitution 101 knows that it's a Congress rights law is not executive branch execu Prince enforces laws he's creating law is Sir conveying the Congress and quite frankly violating the Constitution and it's as simple as that crescent and that's the issue that I'm confident what the district court judge ain'ta did a great job in his decision he also found that the the Justice Department was you know you nearing contempt and i believe the Fifth Circuit very conservative circuit appellate court will uphold this Roy and then of course judge Scalia is the go-between swingfest certain Supreme Court aside i believe the executive action has been halted if there is evidence that the administration is violating this order and i have any evidence of that then we will rule petition the court directly to enforce that yeah that's that would be a violation that would be a contempt of the court order hits in fact that is happening course we've been told that's been stopped yeah but afternoon chatter phone calls one of the first cause o makin is to find out what's going on down there yeah thank you sir I appreciate a yeah it was in the washington times i believe it was reporting that the DHS attorney admitted that i think it was some 2,000 amnesty applications were processed after the judge's order came down and I guess a lot of the listeners here to the voice of Texas should want to know who's going to bring jay johnson and his people to account for violating the judge's order congressman michael mccaul key from the 10th district of the great state of texas here congressman always appreciate you you're setting aside time to talk about the issues with us and come back again so soon hey Chris thanks for having me I sure do appreciate it you bet you sir

you my guess is that most of you are applauding because it's so hot in this room and they would only call the race we can get some fresh air outside i'm so delighted it's been this very important and special evening certainly the lives of the moran family with all of you you come from all over Kansas and it is a very humbling experience for me to have the opportunity tonight in front of all of you to begin a journey in fact the beginning of greater opportunity and freedom liberty in our country begins tonight I look at elections as the beginning of a new page in our country's history they happen every couple of years and what that means is the American people establish their new year's resolutions and my guess is that across the country tonight the voters are sending their new year's resolutions to watch in DC in a new year here you know many of you is back most of you know me know my background know where I came from no my experiences and there's nothing in my life that you would ever suggest to Jerry Moran would ever have the opportunity to grow up and be a member of the House of Representatives and now to be a member of the United States Senate that's an amazing development so much about me but it says something about our country and it says something about the people of Kansas who we are what we care about what we stand for what we believe in and what we want for the future I've been blessed in so many ways I have had great parents moms and debt my mom and dad my grandparents have a wonderful family a wife and daughters who support these efforts but we live in a wonderful place Hays Kansas we live in a wonderful part of the state western Kansas and we live in a wonderful state that has been so supportive of the efforts that we made to try to make a difference I'm no different than anybody in this room in the sense that all of us want to make a difference in this world and I appreciate the chance that you all have provided me for the last 14 years to try to make a difference in the House of Representatives and I now go to the United States Senate not for purposes of any personal glory nothing about a name on a door nothing about a title but about a belief that we live our lives in kansas and america in a very special way and we all have a responsibility to make certain that we pass on to the next generation of Kansans of americans the light that we love the life that we lead and so my mission is to make certain that i do the things today do the things tomorrow do the things next year that increase the chances that were going to turn this economy around that we're going to create jobs they're gonna have a regulatory and tax environment in which a business person an entrepreneur can succeed in the process of pursuing the creation of wealth and put people to work and in that process of creating well we create opportunities for Americans I talked to raava so we're years ago and I said I think it's time for us to go live a normal life and none of us lived on who lives but driving from Hays to Kansas City or Wichita every Monday and driving home every Friday for 14 years is not a normal thing I'd love to get rid of that effect of my life but you all have been very important in doing something for me personally and I hope it translates into being a great member of Congress and that is you economy accountant and it's in the grocery store it's in the post office it's in church on Sunday in which we have those conversations and no one in this room to my knowledge has said Moran you're an idiot but they have said and said it many times what in the world are you idiots in Washington a very nice way of delivering a message and that's my pledge to you tonight is that I will never forget where I came from I'll never forget who I am I'll never forget who got me there all for the purpose of trying to make certain that the next generation of Americans can enjoy the freedoms and liberties guaranteed by our Constitution and to have the opportunities to pursue their dreams all of our lives we've been told that in fact all throughout the history of our country we have believed that the better days are yet to come one of the things I've always appreciated about my mom and dad they were never interested in themselves and I think this is true of most Kansans what they cared about was their kids and grandkids all my life my parents worried about my sister and I want to make sure they did the things that gave us the opportunity to pursue our dreams and when we had kids all they care about is that their grandkids have the opportunity to pursue their dreams that is something that elected officials in Washington DC ought to note that long term is not about the next elections long term is about whether or not our children and grandchildren have the opportunities that we know they can have and introduce to you one more time like family dr. Baba about leading a normal life and what she said when I said that is oh no no you're good at what you do this is your calling in the country meet you I thought that doesn't sound like my wife hall and it occurred to me that she likes me being home two days a week second would be way too many part of that serious discussion with our family is the fact that we have two daughters like I say we care about our kids and we watch Kelsey walk across the graduation stage and if it really was one of the defining moments in which I said oh my gosh surely I have one more fight in me to see that we turn this country around for the benefit of my kids your kids and our grantees so we do this I'm here to tell you tonight that I believe that America is a great country it can be great and continue can continue to be great but each individual citizen and me as a member of the United States Senate has a responsibility to live up to that that freedom that has been passed upon to us those economic opportunities that we've been giving and so in front of all my friends have you got a few more than this in front of these friends in front of my neighbors and family I give to you tonight my pledge that I will do everything I can to be a great member of United States Senate on behalf of the people of Kansas on behalf of this country called United States of America god bless you all we said a burger night before we came here and prayer was that we make the right decisions in our lives we do the right things and electricians but as human beings as citizens of gods and I would ask you as you always have to hold me accountable that I do the right things for the right reason throughout my time in public service and we are honored by your presence here tonight thank you all for

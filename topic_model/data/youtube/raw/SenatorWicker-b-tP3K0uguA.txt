now joining me our great friend Senator Roger wicker from Mississippi Mr wicker thank you for coming back on the show I'm sure you heard it I appreciate it uh I'm sure you heard all that and I will say to you sir you know I think our numbers are basically correct they're certainly a ballpark numbers Putin's behavior is uh pretty much ballpark it burns me up to watch us help him him being Putin and basically all the people around the world that hate us it burns me up to watch this country help them when none of that is necessary and we could produce some 15 million barrels a day and oil price and gasoline price and home heating fuel and natural gas and heck do you know the story as well as I do all that stuff will be a lot lower and I'm just going to guess there would be fewer Wars how's that Senator wicker fewer Wars well there would there would be less in um in Vladimir Putin's pocket and and in the treasury of the Russian Federation for sure yes you know this is basically uh fifth grade arithmetic that you've uh reminded us of and uh and it's another one of the self-inflicted wounds uh done immediately upon taking office by President Biden it was the war on all it was the signaling of uh of the uh open border I mean who who around the world could not have understood that our border was an open invitation after what the president did the first day in office and during his campaign and and then uh fueling the the inflation bar with 1.9 trillion dollars of tax and spend when we were already coming out of a recession uh because of covet yes the uh the uh the war on all which the president now says we going to need for another 10 years at least has not only hurt us in the pocketbooks here in the United States but yes it has enriched Putin and helped his war effort absolutely yes indeed all right um I want to move on um a little bit different point um so we had this balloon you were on last week we were talking about ballooning and flying saucers and whatnot um now we have Vladimir Putin uh pulling out of the start nuclear treaty we have China as always insulting the United States and playing footsie with Russia more and more whether they're going to sell them lethal weapons or not we don't know here's what I don't get sir whether it's ballooning or flying saucers or Russia or China or their behaviors why hasn't the United States taken any counter measures why hasn't this country stiffened its back and let me just add I don't mean to presuppose An Answer here but I want to just speculate with you a moment my former boss Donald Trump I believe I should have just bumped into him at dinner the other night last weekend he would have slapped on at least a hundred billion dollars worth of tariffs on China he surely would have slashed or added export controls thrown Tick Tock out of the country and would have had quite a lot to say to Vladimir Putin as well and yet Joe Biden doesn't seem to say a single thing to these people who are kicking Us in The Shins or Worse left and right what do you make of that uh well I I once again I totally agree with you it it is a sign of weakness that China is looking for and and I think we're all uh correct to worry about China it to me if you're worried about what might happen in the Western Pacific where we have a ton of allies and we rely on a ton of trade then then you ought to be worried about the balloon because of the signal it sends and basically um we know the Chinese spy on us and and Heavens knows uh all of the major uh powers are involved in Espionage but for them to invade our airspace as they did and for that to go a really completely unanswered in terms of actual uh actions by the United States is a yet another sign of weakness and and frankly Larry it's another good reason why uh we need to stiffen our resolve in Ukraine because we know China is watching what we do and and they look for whether we have the resolve to see things through in terms of our International policy I mean you know Senator wicker I'm I'm a free Trader I mean I came into the administration as a free Trader over 40 years ago or 40 years ago I was a Ronald Reagan free Trader but not as it pertains to China all right I stopped at that water's edge not because it's not reciprocal with these guys and they and my view job just this is me not you certainly sir uh I believe they are our enemy they are our adversary plus uh I believe Trump would have already taken action I I think Trump and I'd like to see there may be other Republicans Mike Pompeo uh Governor DeSantis I don't know Nikki Haley maybe they'd all be the same page I'd like to hear from them what they should be what we should be saying to China right now I mean I slap the tariffs right back on I'd pushed Tick Tock right out of here right now I'd say don't you dare because if you do dare this this and this is going to happen you know that's what Biden didn't do a year ago Biden you know kind of whined about economic terrible economic sanctions and nothing happened because he didn't do anything and when he did stuff it was too late you follow my logic I want to see something I put them in the Shins back or worse I I do understand exactly what you're saying but I do also worry about this Larry the sanctions as you pointed out against Putin really have it worked there are ways around that and I'll tell you Phil Graham and I wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last year in which we we started out by saying sanctions against China uh an even bigger more powerful economy are going to be less effective than they were against Putin so absolutely we ought to be sending the signal that we're not going to tolerate what they've done sending for example a balloon into our own Sovereign airspace but beyond that sanctions are not going to prevent China from doing something totally disruptive and totally stupid with regard to Taiwan the the solution there is for us to make sure that our friends in Taiwan that and Taiwan have the ability to defend themselves and for uh our allies in the Pacific to be so strong that just like in the Reagan days uh nobody tried anything that's to me uh more important than any economic sanctions we could bring against China and you know they they can make a choice and I guess they made a choice five ten years ago um against really being part of the international trading uh system and and having both their citizens and the rest of the world benefit from you know what you called Ronald Reagan's uh attempt at free trade um they made a decision no they they want to grab territory from their neighbors and uh and and they want to exercise dominion over uh the entire Western Pacific and that ought to worry us and if that worries us winning in Ukraine ought to be the signal that we want to send winning in Ukraine quickly and with all the weapons we can provide them safely well I don't know if that's possible but you have more expertise about that and more intelligence than I do anyway it's another segment I would suggest in a pinch going back to Reagan's peace through strength you know Senator wicker we could always limit government lower tax rates go back to deregulation and sound money grow the economy at five or six percent which would throw off so many new resources that not only could we help Ukraine we could help Taiwan which may be more important Cuts just saying those tax cuts of 2017 brought millions of dollars billions of dollars back to the United States and uh created hundreds of thousands of new jobs yes sir all right producers are screaming out me but Senator Roger wicker thank you ever so much for coming back on the show be nice to Larry thank you sir I

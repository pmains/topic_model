having three children is a lot of fun and a lot of work the cost of college is a big concern it really bothers me that marilinda garcia wants to shut down the department of education eliminating federal student loans and scholarships i don't think marilinda garcia understands what that would mean to families like mine annie kuster has worked to reduce the cost of student loans and make college more affordable she cares about people she understands what families are going through annie custer gets it i'm annie kuster and i approve this message

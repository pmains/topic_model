S FTX AND SAMUEL BANKMAN-FRIED BEFORE THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE. THEY ARE LOOKING INTO EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN MORE BROADLY FOR CRYPTO IN THE CURRENT SOCIETY. WE TURN NOW TO ONE OF THOSE WILL BE ASKING THE QUESTIONS, BRAD SHERMAN OF CALIFORNIA, A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. AS I UNDERSTAND, WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE MAN WHO NOW RUNS FTX, WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GET OUT OF THIS? >> I HOPE THAT OUR FOCUS IS ON WHETHER CRYPTO IS GOOD FOR AMERICA, NOT ONLY OUR INVESTORS. BUT LET'S FACE IT. THE PURPOSE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY IS TO HARSHLY DISPLACE THE U.S. DOLLAR. WE WERE GOING AFTER INCUMBENT IN A MARKET, WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY OVER THE U.S. DOLLAR OTHER MAJOR CURRENCIES? IT IS RIGHT THERE IN THE NAME. CRYPTO. SO MY GOAL IS TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, IF WE CAN'T DO THAT, IF WE ARE ABLE TO IMPOSE KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING STATUTE ON THE ENTIRE AMERICAN-INVOLVED CRYPTO ECOSYSTEM, THE ONE REASON IT HAS FOR EXISTING. DAVID: YOU CAN SKEPTICAL WITHOUT A DOUBT BUT BY AND LARGE, WE'VE GONE FOR DISCLOSURE RATHER THAN BANNING THINGS. YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND LET THE BUYER DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. DO YOU SEE IT HAVE FORWARD THAT CRYPTO CAN DO WHAT IT WANTS TO DO, PROVIDED THERE IS ACCURATE AND FULL DISCLOSURE? >> IN THE INVESTMENT WORLD, WE TEND TO GO WITH FULL DISCLOSURE. BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT ARE ANTISOCIAL IN NATURE. WE DON'T WANT BURGLARS TO HAVE BETTER TOOLS. AND CRYPTO EXISTS AS A TOOL WITH A VERY LARGE MARKET, WHICH IS WHY IT HOPES TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE TAX EVASION, AND THE INVASION OF SANCTIONS, LAWS, ETC.. FROM AN INVESTOR PROTECTION STANDPOINT, MAYBE IT IS ENOUGH TO PROVIDE DISCLOSURE, BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN PRODUCT THAT SHOULDN'T BE OUT THERE. ONE HAS THE SOLE ADVANTAGE IN ITS NAMESAKE INCUBATING U.S. SANCTIONS LAWS, TAX LAWS, BANKRUPTCY LAWS. DAVID: LET ME PURSUE THAT. YOU REFERRED FURTHER BURGLARY EQUIPMENT. IS THERE NO REDEEMING SOCIAL VALUE POTENTIALLY TO CRYPTO AT ALL? WE HEAR PEOPLE SAY IT CAN FACILITATE TRANSACTIONS ANY EFFICIENT WAY, INCLUDING ACROSS BOUNDARIES. >> WELL FIRST, ONE GOOD THING ABOUT CRYPTO IS IT HELPS YOU EVADE LAWS OF MANY COUNTRIES. BUT JUST LIKE BURGLARY TOOLS MIGHT HELP YOU BURGLARIZE SOMEBODY WHO DESERVES TO BE BURGLARIZED, THE OTHER THINKS A PAYMENT SYSTEM IS INTERESTING TECHNOLOGY. I THINK OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS, THE PAYMENT SYSTEMS FOR THE U.S. DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES IS GOING TO BE MUCH BETTER. I DON'T LIKE TO SEE THIS 3, 3 .5% CHARGE. FOR THE MOST PART, WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY FROM PAPER CHECKS, THE PEDESTAL AND INCONVENIENCE. I THINK WE CAN IMPROVE THE PAYMENT SYSTEM. BUT TO SAY THAT YOU NEED HIDDEN CURRENCY BECAUSE YOU WANT FASTER, MORE EFFICIENT PAYMENT SYSTEM -- DAVID: IF THERE ARE ADVANTAGES BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH CRYPTO PART, YOU ENVISION A WORLD IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT TAKES OVER THE DIGITAL CURRENCY, EITHER THROUGH THE CENTRAL BANK OR SUPERVISING THE REGULAR BANKS TO DO IT SO WE GET THE ADVANTAGES OF THE DIGITAL PAYMENT SYSTEM WITHOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU SEE POTENTIALLY FOR ILLEGALITY? >> WE ARE MOVING THROUGH THE PAYMENT SYSTEM. WE NEED TO SEE THE TECHNOLOGY BETTER, AND I THINK WE WILL, JUST AS WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING ELSE THEY CAN BE DONE DIGITALLY, DONE AT LOWER COST AS DECADES GO BY. A DIGITAL CURRENCY FROM THE FED, OR YOU COULD HAVE WON THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL BANKS. BUT IN ANY CASE, WHAT YOU WANT IS A SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING OARSMAN, AND THAT IS THE ANTITHESIS TO THE CRYPTO ECOSYSTEM. DAVID: SO WHEN WE HAVE SEEN YOU TAKE A POSITION ON CRYPTO, A SKEPTICAL ONE, AS I SAY, TALK ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY YOU HOPE TO GET OUT OF TOMORROW. HAVE YOU ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND, OR ARE THERE THINGS THAT HAVE PERHAPS MISSED YOUR RANGE THAT COULD SEPARATE WHAT WENT WRONG FROM WHAT COULD HAVE GONE RIGHT? OR DO YOU THINK THE WHOLE THING WAS WRONG FROM THE GET GO? >> I THINK THE WHOLE THING WAS WRONG FROM THE GET-GO BUT THAT BEING SAID, I CHAIR THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTOR PROTECTION. AS LONG AS AMERICANS ARE BUYING CRYPTO, WE WANT A FULLY AUTOMATED MORTGAGE FIRM. SERIOUS ACCOUNTING FIRMS. ONE THING THAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS INVESTORS WHO SEND THEIR MONEY TO THE BAHAMAS SO THE MAIN U.S. INVESTOR PROTECTION LAW, WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON YOU COVERAGE, AND THE INVESTORS SAY I SENT MY MONEY TO THE BAHAMAS TO INVADE THE SEC PROTECTION. WHY DIDN'T THE SEC PROTECT ME? BUT AT LEAST WE SIGNAL. WHEN YOU SEND YOUR MONEY TO THE BAHAMAS, THERE IS A REASON WHY. YOU HAVE BEEN VERY DIRECT, AND I THANK YOU TO THAT. YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARD CRYPTO, IS THERE SENTIMENT IN SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES, REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY SUPPORT A MOVE TO ACTUALLY BAN CRYPTO? IS THAT FEASIBLE? >> ALL OF THE LOBBYING POWER IS ON THE SIDE OF CRYPTO. IT MADE BILLIONS, LITERALLY THEY MADE MONEY BY MAKING MONEY. THERE IS NO LOBBYING FIRM IN TOWN, THERE IS NO TAX IN TOWN DEDICATED TO ENFORCING OUR TAX LAWS, AND MAKING SURE BANKRUPTCY COURTS ARE DEBATED. SO I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO PASS THESE STATUTES. WE ARE STILL PLAYING DEFENSE. BUT THE INVOLVEMENT IN WASHINGTON HAVE ONE PURPOSE, AND THAT WAS TO PROVIDE REGULATION TO CRYPTO AND EXPLODING THE SEC. I THINK THE SAT WILL PROTECT -- SEC WILL RETAIN THE POWER THAT IT HAS. THOSE POWERS ARE PURE LIFE AND HAPPENSTANCE AND STEM FROM A CASE IN THE 19 POLICE DEFINING WHAT IS A SECURITY, BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CRYPTO ARE SECURITIES, AND IT IS NOW TIME TO SHUT DOWN THE UNREGULATED U.S.-BASED SECURITIES EXCHANGES THAT CLAIM THEY ARE NOT SECURITIES EXCHANGES. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL BE WATCHING. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE LIVE THOSE HEARINGS, SO WE WILL BE WATCHING YOU AS YOU

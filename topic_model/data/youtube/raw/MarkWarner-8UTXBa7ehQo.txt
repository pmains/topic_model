okay let's get started I'm Dan runde I hold a Schreyer chair here at CSIS it's great we're going to be having a conversation with economic impacts of globalization and technological disruption this event is being sponsored by the by government of Denmark and we really appreciate your support and friendship I want to thank the Simon chair and and Stephanie Siegel for inviting me to to speak thank you very much this is the Simon chairs event and I want to just say a few remarks the first is I wanted to to say how important our relationship is with Denmark and what a great friend Denmark is the United States thank you very much and they've been willing to shoulder all sorts of burdens and they punch above their weight and we're lucky as the United States have friends and we're also grateful here at CSIS to have Denmark as such a great partner so and we had the the tech tech minister sorry the tech ambassador there's Denmark has a tech ambassador and the and he was here yesterday and we had the minister of development here yesterday so this it feels like Danish week here at CSIS so thank you very much so Denmark understands the challenges of the changing challenges and opportunities of Technology and I think that's one of the reasons why we wanted to have this conversation and that there's we shouldn't just look at these changes as threats but as opportunities and their their change their challenges here but they're also in their challenges and opportunities here and their challenges and opportunities in the in the developing world and also not all the disruptions that we're gonna face in the world are technological there's all sorts of radical changes in demography there's a a youth bulge in parts of Africa and Middle East and then other parts of the world they're facing global aging so there's gonna be all sorts of other sorts of disruptions that aren't related to the fourth Industrial Revolution and then the other thing is I think some of the some of the changes that we're gonna see that are real and are coming may take a little longer or may be shaped in different ways by politics or the regulatory environment I mean we've seen this just in the last three or four months that with the gig economy or data or driverless cars that regulatory and political snags are going to perhaps change the trajectory of those phenomena so I think a lot of that will be impact in this conversation the other thing is that think it's interesting is that some of the the radical you know the the disruptive technologies may mean different things in the developed world and in the developing world in India where you have ninety percent of jobs are in the informal sector what does that mean for for the gig economy or become or what does it mean for a country like the United States or Denmark so we need to anticipate and think about these kinds of changes and I know this panel will help do that we've been doing a lot of work at CSIS about the the impacts of the fourth Industrial Revolution in developing countries and we'll be producing some some work over the next several months on that we're also going to have a task force on workforce development in developing countries and we're going to be starting that in May so and that's all also been done in partnership with the Dane so it's been it's very exciting and this is an exciting time to be here at CSIS I want to just recognize some of the speakers here we have some really really interesting folks we have Bruce Reed who's a co-chair of the future of work initiative at the Aspen Institute had a very illustrious career in public service Susan lund was a partner at McKinsey and runs the McClellan's McKinsey Global Institute and his friends the most important work on many of the disruptive technologies that are out there and my really good friend Wayne Holden who was the president and CEO of RTI and grateful to RTI and for you Wayne for being here and Archie has been such a great partner to us at CSIS we've made really some really incredible work together on innovation led economic growth and so so pleased you're here also it feels like it's Wayne Holden week because you were here with us yesterday as well so thanks and then finally we have the the Minister of Finance of Denmark thank you so much for being here and it's very exciting and so Stephanie I'm just gonna turn the floor over to you and just leave it to you thanks hey cool Jan thank you very much for the introduction as Dan mentioned I'm Stephanie Segal I'm a senior fellow here at CSIS I'm also a deputy director in the Simon chair of political economy like to welcome all of you here today that are joining us in DC I'd like to welcome as well those that are joining us online for this event this topic of economic impacts of globalization and technological disruption is certainly one that is getting a lot of traction right now it's important to remember it's not really a new issue this idea of change and of innovation leading to disruptions is not one that is new to the last couple of years it has a long history dating back to the Industrial Revolution john maynard keynes actually had referred to technological unemployment back in the 1930s so it's not new and yet right now it does feel like there's something new about the way that we're facing this particular issue and that's probably a function of the pace of change so the rate of innovation and the rate that globalization has occurred is actually something that is relatively unprecedented and the pace of that change is actually challenging not just policymakers but also private sector and individual workers how are they going to respond to that change and the fact that the technology itself is also enabling certain changes in the workforce so you have the rise of independent contract workers the so-called gig economy what does that mean for benefit provision what does that mean for social safety nets and then finally I would point to the fact that these two forces of globalization and technology are also blamed in part for rising income inequality here in the United States and other advanced economies also throughout the world in emerging markets as well and this issue of rising inequality is then feeding into political discussions increasing nationalism and protectionism and anti-globalization so this has implications stations for the liberal economic order and for all these reasons I think policymakers now are really focused on this particular issue so very happy that we're able to bring together this panel of experts following the panel discussion we'll take a brief break and then we'll hear from Senator Mark Warner to get a better understanding of how this looks from US policymakers perspective and from Capitol Hill in particular but I really like to just turn it over to our experts right now dan had given the introduction so I'm not going to spend too much time but I'd just like to thank everybody for your participation beforehand and I'd ask the finance minister to kick us off if you would well thank you Stephanie I'd like to do that and thank you for giving us this opportunity to exchange views on globalization and I like to start out by giving a Danish perspective sometimes of times it seems like Denmark it's the only country left in the world in favor of technology authorization free trade and globalization because if you go down to surveys of the Danes they're still in favor of all of these and it tends look very positive on globalization we look positive on free trade and we are embracing new technology but of course this doesn't come easy even in Denmark it still gives us a gray hair from time to time to think of how to continue to be on the front of this but just a few words about what did not come from Denmark has always been a trading nation and as I'm sure you all heard about the Daley's Vikings and how they chart around ransacking villages in Britain and in France the truth is that just that's just a part of the story the bigger part of the Vikings was that they were trading it's much easier to trade and come back safe if you only trade and not fight with all this so as as far as they could get by trading they start out trading and therefore we've been trading for a thousand years in Denmark and our wealth do not come from natural resources oil gas or anything it comes from the ideas in our heads and the fruit of our hard labor and it comes from trading than other nations we can see quite clearly that in Denmark two trades is a fantastic way of increasing our wealth and in my view trading is perhaps the most fantastic thing that humankind has ever invented because you can only trade if it's free I accept to give away what's mine to receive what is yours because I would rather have what you have and we exchange things we don't need to know each other we don't even need to like each other to trade if only we'll think that what we get is of greater value and what we can so in Denmark the openness to trade has been massive for decades and half of the people working in private section Denmark is directly or indirectly depending on export so we are very keen on export but what is actually quite unique for the law is that we're also very keen on import why because we're not only producers we also consumers and by opening up for products from the United States from the rest of the Europe or firm Asia we as consumers are getting more products to choose from better pricing larger variety and we can get exactly the thing we need because we're open for import and historically trade has been seen as positive if you export and negative if you import but you can't take many things today there are not a combination of export and imports if you take something as common as the the a tennis ball played with at mindle done that before it's been played with in in London it has traveled more than 80 thousand kilometers and comes from 17 country's the wall the robber the production the packing is global in this setting and it's as simple as a tennis ball fires a thing of something even more complicated and you can just add up to many many more things so has this just been easy and did not well not really not always because we're also facing technology we have had decades of Danish companies traveling abroad and manufacturing jobs in Denmark has gone away over the last thirty years what we're trying to do is to say if manufacturing is going away what should we do then we should raise our skills we should be better at doing service design production planning so that we can continue to be on the front we have refused to compete on low salary we've refused to compete in low salary we have decided to compete on skills and that's why in Denmark we've had what you could call a life learn lock lifelong learning so that on the workforce the companies and the government are working together to increase skills if you're out of job and Denmark one of the most important thing is to see are your skills updated or can we do something to help bring you on to the next job if I could just take my own history and I went out of business cards in the early 90s and I still remember the happy face of my mother when I come home and said I got a job in a bank and she said oh in a bank that's fantastic that's a sure thing you can stay there till you retire that was in 93 and later in 93 tercer in 91 and in in 92 there was a currency crisis in the Scandinavian country and the banks start to layoff people the security my mother dreamed of did not last a year so the security for me is not in a desk or in a title it is in my head and my hands it is in my skills and if we continue to get stuck on the job that we had in the world is changing we will lose our jobs if our skills are being upgraded and it's in our smart hands and our clever minds will have the chance to move on to the next job 25% of jobs and they're not are being shifted out every year 25% of the workforce is rotating to another job and it's bringing on new skills to the next level and still even though we have had this you could say good tradition we're right now being a bit worried about what's going to happen because we can see the trends that technology is changing even faster AI is going to be a huge disruptive factor the way that innovation is taking up speed right now so we have tried to say what can we do and actually formed a disruption Council where we bring academia trade union business people and government together to discuss for now more than a year what is our approach what should we do what is it's changing us and knowing that none of us can do this alone the academia can come up with ideas but they can't put them through the government can do some but not if we're working without business the business can do a bit but we need the trade unions to think positive in this direction so we're actually spending a full two days seminar every month discussing what you did not do about the disruption we're seeing right now what should be our approach and I think that this is why we continue to be a nation that is looking positive on globalization because we know that we need to fix things together and being a nation like Denmark having the history we have we are able to work together we were able to do this cross-border a lot of the people in that disruption council is politically totally disagreeing with me totally disagreeing with me but they see the same fear and they see the same challenges and I know that we can only overcome this being a small nation if we're working together so we try to do that okay thank you very much for the comments you touched on a couple of things that I think we'd like to come back to but one just the characterization of trade and a zero-sum view on trade versus a value-added view of trade and the nature of globalization that it's really difficult if not impossible to think of things just in a purely bilateral way and that actually shapes how you think about the issue of trade also the points that you made on on skills training and just the broader value of preparing from a policy perspective preparing for a future that you don't actually know so I'd love to come back to to to the approach with the disruption council but speaking of the future that we don't actually know dr. lunge is one of the lead authors of a report from McKinsey that many of you are probably familiar with already that actually tries to look at what the future global economy is going to look like 15 30 years from now so if you could illuminate us that would be great well thank you it's an honor to be here and among such distinguished panelists so yes technology is changing both how we work and how we trade with each other and we're talking today at a moment where there's a lot of public fear on both fronts that globalization particularly sitting here in the United States a globalization in fact is not good for us that these advances are not good for workers so we've done some work looking at both of these fronts and I think there are a couple key messages that I think are important for us to remember first is that okay that we see huge advances in smart automation robotics and artificial intelligence and this is real this is not just a hype there have been advances in data collection and data storage and in mathematical advances in algorithms that have suddenly given new life to artificial intelligence you all know this is an old concept people started talking about artificial intelligence back in the 60s and it's gone through phases of progress and then slow down and then program we're in this phase of huge progress and it's real and it has some very positive benefits right now we're sitting in the United States after a decade of very low productivity growth well productivity growth is the key to rising living standards and a growing economy we need more the new innovations in automation robotics can actually help lift productivity growth this is going to be good broadly for the economy and it's going to drive the next wave of prosperity at a more micro level we see advances in these machines that can do amazing things so for instance they're now AI algorithms that can diagnose various cancers much more accurately than a human being can so there are real positive things we should we you know we firmly believe that these technologies are good for a society they're good for the economy but that's not to say that there's not going to be disruption ahead so I'll talk first about the work force we did a very granular study of what are all the activities that people do within their occupation and what can machines do of all those activities and what we found is somewhat concerning at the top level it's yeah a large share of what am I reckons are paid to do and James could theoretically be done by a smart robot or an algorithm now when you look beneath that though what you find is that very few jobs are fully automated and in advanced countries like the US and Denmark most of those have already gone to low-wage nations own less than 10% of jobs can be fully automated but instead what it means is that we're gonna start working alongside the machines in all of our jobs smart machines are going to start to do some of what we do and it leaves humans for doing what humans do best so the things we will increasingly do or that are the activities that require things like problem solving critical thinking creativity social and emotional skills so managing others interacting with customers interacting with coworkers so as these technologies roll out across the workplace what we're going to see is that all of our occupations are going to shift and this then brings up the issue of workforce skills are we prepared for this level of change we're still in a model where most people think you go to school for the first twenty to twenty to twenty-five years of your life and then you're gonna go out into the workforce for the next 40 years and you're gonna work and you're never gonna go back to school you're never gonna learn again maybe on the job a little bit but that model is clearly dead at the at the type of disruption we're seeing so we're all going to need to learn to do new things real-time I think about my own long history at McKinsey as a consultant when I first joined we would draw charts with pencil and paper and then fax them to someone in India who would produce them in PowerPoint so then a few you know years later okay we all now know how to make our own PowerPoint charts well no that's not good enough no now the associates learn all tricks and tableau where you can do real-time analysis and visualize it so constantly we need to upgrade our skills now our educational system in this country is not particularly set up for that mid career training opportunities are not widely available we still focus a lot on associate's degrees Community College which is two years or a bachelor's which is four years well somebody in mid-career with a family with a mortgage probably can't afford to go back to school for two years much less four years so we need to rethink credentials nanodegrees how can you have short-term mid career training programs that people can go and learn a new skill shift into the jobs that are growing but do it in a short amount of time and it can be done there are lots of programs and I think Bruce will talk about some of them too that have shown that you can identify what are the critical skills in an occupation like nursing being a nursing assistant and within 12 weeks teach someone those absolute must-have skills and the rest they can learn on the job so there's a big need to overhaul how we think about about training now to globalization it's a very it's not a very popular concept in the United States right now but I think that technology is going to reach is reshaping globalization so the first thing that technology did the reduction in communication costs and transportation cost gave us this great wave of the creation of what we call global value chains so a product has components from countries all over the world and all of this is enabled because companies can get in touch with suppliers via email via you know the internet and make orders and track where things are going and so technology gave us this great burst of globalization of production over the last 25 years but that has largely played out when you look at the figures on the amount of goods that are traded each year it's increasing but it's not increasing as fast as the size of the global economy and that's in stark contrast to what we saw over the last 25 years where trade was growing very rapidly so does that mean globalization is dead it's like no I think the global value chains are shifting and technology may hold opportunity for more production to be done in Denmark in the United States because manufacturing in particular so robota size labor costs aren't as important for many many types of manufactured goods so then the decision on where to produce but comes down to things like infrastructure and workforce skills and energy costs and so this is ongoing new research we're looking at but I think that there's an opportunity that this new technological era will in fact reshape where manufacturing is done now does that mean it's gonna create the same number of jobs as before no but the jobs that are there will are higher skilled or higher paid so it's still an economic engine and country should embrace this but it does mean that people increasingly and we've seen this this shift for the last hundred years or moving more into service occupations so all of this is to say is yes there's a lot of change should we adapt to it and devise rethink our labor market policies or trade policies to reflect the new era yes absolutely and there's a lot to be done but should we fear it and think that this is the end of prosperity absolutely not if anything we should be really excited about the advances we're seeing that have a lot of potential thank you very much and I and I think even if you were to fear it it doesn't mean that it's not going to happen anyway so I think fear might be you know in the sense kind of a positive push to say all right it's coming you've got a you've got to deal with it but thank you for those comments there's a lot there both on the micro level and specific policies but linking back to the macro and kind of overall globalization trends that we can that we can come back to but we'd like to hear from Bruce as Dan mentioned in his introduction of Bruce Bruce Reed is currently co-chair of Aspen's future work initiative he's founder and CEO of civic which is a group that focuses on policy ideas related to all sorts of domestic issues and he has a long history in the Obama and Clinton White House working on domestic policy issues including workforce development welfare reform lots of things that are relevant to our discussions so welcome and thanks very much Stephanie it's an honor to be at CSIS as Stephanie said I've spent my entire career in domestic policy so my knowledge stops at the water's edge but I want a second and commend everything that the Minister said my wife is the granddaughter of Danish immigrants and for 30 years she's been telling me that Danes are way smarter than Americans and I love the idea of a disruption council we've kind of gone the other way are our government the White House and the Congress are sort of it eruption council but we should try your approach I'm gonna pick up where where Susan left off and talk a little bit about what to do about these challenges her report if you haven't read it is superb it gives a terrifying picture of what the world could will potentially look like in 2030 I think sadly in many ways this isn't a future work problem it isn't just a future problem it's a it's a current problem we are already seeing profound impacts from the from the fear of the future of work and you can see that in the 2016 electoral map you can see it in the decline of communities up and down the Rust Belt and Appalachia in the United States is the only advanced country with a declining mortality rate I mean with declining life expectancy that's due entirely to a big increase in white midlife mortality which is directly connected to economic scene and and what the economic future looks like for college graduates mortality rates haven't changed but they've gone way up for those with only a high school degree or less so we're going to be wrestling with this having the rest of this sooner than we would like the future work project at Aspen is a bipartisan effort to try to come up with ideas of how to wrestle with all this the future of bipartisanship might be honest shaky the grounds as to future works partisanship is a lot easier to automate but Senator Mark Warner and his colleague former Indiana governor mitch Daniels have have been focused beyond Washington trying to work with states and cities around the country to try to test out new ideas let me point to three areas many of which Susan alluded to where I think we have the most work to do the first by by far is skills the minister was kind enough not to mention it but Denmark puts us to shame in this area the United States state spends 3/100 of 1% of GDP on training which is less than half of what we spent 25 years ago Denmark spends 20 times as much as we do and the only advanced country where that we spend more on in training is Britain which may help to explain why they ended up with brexit and we ended up with Donald Trump one of the reasons in the American economy at least this is a particularly challenging problem is that as the economy becomes more flexible more mobile businesses have less and less incentive to train their current workers and in the u.s. at least businesses by far the best at training it has the best sense of where the jobs are going to be what elzar needed does a superb job of training the workers that it actually has but it has no incentive or less and less incentive to train workers for their next job or what they might want to do and that when people worked for a company for 25 years it was different now I think the playing field this goes in the wrong direction so one thing we've been doing is proposing ways to change those incentives get the incentives right our tax code very much favors in investment in physical capital not so much in human capital senator Warner has proposed a couple of ideas in this regards proposed to 20% worker training tax credit its mod left or the R&D tax credit to try to change that balance he's also proposed lifelong learning accounts because the minister's right lifelong learning is what we're going to need to be doing but we don't we're not set up to for individuals to think of it that way or to finance it that way and having training IRAs that employers could match would be a an excellent idea in the bargain we also need to to address some of the points that Susan made about how we do that training we are in the midst of great disruption in the higher ed world we you know governor daniels who's now president of Purdue University has pioneered the first three year state public college degree the rest of the world seems to be able to get through people through college in three years but here in the United States we've been violently opposed to that and I think that kind of innovation is going to keep going Susan's right that for people in mid-career and maybe people early in their career there's going to be a lot more focused on getting the skills you need in a timely fashion and and being in a position to renew those skills and update them as as time goes on so nanodegrees micro degrees degree apprenticeships there's a lot of other things going on around the world and there there is one excellent program here in the states where a business is doing something that is in the best interest of the country and of its workers and is working well for for the for the business Starbucks has a partnership with Arizona State University where they promise every barista who works at least part-time that if they want to get if they want to finish their college degree Starbucks will pay for it even if they're studying something that's completely unrelated to what the what the company does we need more we need more programs like that the second area that we're we're looking at is what forms of new social insurance we may need in the 21st century most of our social insurance programs date from the middle of the last century we're still playing catch-up with Europe on this we've finally got to a place where we have health care that you can take with you from job to job but much of the rest of our social insurance scheme is not well suited to the current environment what does unemployment mean to an uber driver who decides when and when and whether he or she is going to go to work on a given day and we'd like to see a lot more experimentation at the state and local level that's kind of how we got the social contract of the 20th century a number of states adopted things like the minimum wage which then were adopted here in in Washington and became part of that of the ethic senator Warner has proposed a 25 million dollar benefits Innovation Fund that is seed money for states and localities and nonprofits to to try new try out new forms of of social insurance there are a couple of examples of that going around of going on around the country New York City has something called a black car fund which covers the taxi and ride-sharing business and it helps make sure that that those workers have workers comp which they wouldn't otherwise but we need a lot more experimentation in this regard then I think the third and most challenging long term area is around work students write the book they'll there'll be a lot of they'll still be a lot of jobs but if you if you look at at the McKinsey report the potential disruption displacement of the American workforce by 2030 is something is it could be as much as 38 million and US manufacturing which has been an issue that has roiled American politics for the last 40 years including in the last election the entire decline in American manufacturing jobs from its peak to its current spot is 7 million it went from 19 to 12 so if you if you think we've gone through we've had that kind of backlash when we lost 7 million jobs imagine what's going to happen if 38 million households are are turned upside down and the I think one thing that is important for us to keep in mind is how much bigger this problem is then the than the income gap that you know what if you look at what's happening in the Rust Belt today entire communities are coming apart in the seams because people don't have something to do every day and we're able to close the income gap we provide disability insurance we have a lot of of schemes that make it so that people aren't starving but the one thing that humans need is a purpose something to do during the day and and there's a lot of dignity dignity that's caught up in work that doesn't take well to massive displacement so I think there are a couple of areas that are going to be the frontlines of that battle retail is one as Susan suggested I think another big one where we should be spending a lot of time trying to get it right is with the trucking industry trucking drive truck driving is the single largest profession in two-thirds of the states in the u.s. three million truckers and another million associated with the trucking business the writing is on the wall for that profession it's not going to it's not going to be around come 2030 there's an enormous financial incentive for the trucking industry which is a big two hundred billion dollar business to accelerate that transition and we need to figure out a way that that as it does so the country and the industry think about what's going to happen to those three million truckers who and trucking is is it's not a job that anybody's gonna cry any tears that we're losing it's a it's it's a you know very difficult an envy able job to do but it is perhaps the biggest single middle-class job for high school educated workers in America and it's going to have a profound impact from one side of the country to the other so that's a lot of work to do for a government that's not functioning at the moment we you know the it's all stuff that we could fix with sensible policies but that may be the root of our problem anyone can invent a driverless car it took America to invent a driverless nation tweetable tweetable no III think for sure kind of the focus on what can be done at state and local levels and also looking at what private sector participants can do was something that that we need to think about and discuss it a little bit more here but not just a whole-of-government but kind of whole of economy approach which is really what's what's needed dr. Holden Wayne Holden is is head of CEO of RTI International which is based in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina a hotbed of innovation but your work is interesting because you focus largely on advising emerging market economies on how to have an innovation led economy so interested to hear your perspective and how these set of issues look from the emerging market perspective so one of the problems with being last is you have constrained time but one of the advantages of being last you've listened to everybody else you can kind of go yeah I agree I agree I agree check off this this and this so I'm actually gonna throw in something first it's a little bit different but I think very relevant to this and I think it's lost in the detail some time and that's the importance of research and development okay this gadget that we all have that controls their lives didn't just appear because of one person in the world decade's worth of work like different research teams doing different things creating different aspects of this making all this happen making all of us work and driving it forward and we need to remember that we often get caught up in the applications of technology but we have to think about how technology gets created and research and development and technology and new technologies are what drive economic growth and if we don't have that underlying investment in research and development that's not going to happen across and part of the concern I have in the u.s. is that if you see what the investments meant as a percentage of GDP across time we've had a decades-long decline in that investment by the government across time and I think that's a global issue that needs to be addressed one of the concerns at this point in time and it depends on where you stand in a spectrum of whether this is good or bad but is the investments being made in quantum computing quantum computing is the next computing revolution that's going to increase the ability of computers to do things that hundreds of times their capacity currently right now China has very clear objectives in China is out investing everybody it's out invest in the United States ten to twenty fold with respect to these things so the issue becomes whoever has that breakthrough and whatever happens with respect to quantum computing as we move forward it's going to drive the continuing evolution of this and we need to be able to invest in the R&D capacity to participate in that an interesting question for everybody here is anybody here know how to create neural networks using Python end up with the simplistic supervised learning algorithm now but those are the things that are happening today that are going to evolve into the future and if we're all gonna have to get a little more cognizant with there there are only about 20,000 people in the world who really have the expertise to do that now they're being paid enormous sums but I would argue that they're very important and finding out where those people are and understanding how they interact with each other and understanding how all this plays out on a public basis as well as a private basis is really critical for the kid nearing evolution of technology now flip to the innovation led economic group and I want to thank CSIS we've had a partnership in this for a couple of years we've been working on the issues of what's happening in emerging market places so obviously emerging countries and emerging economies have gotten very interested in this because they clearly understand that technology and innovation is what drives economic growth there are now 50 or 60 different countries around the world that have a national policy innovation many of those have a cabinet-level position but it just addresses the issue of innovation and trying to drive innovation into the economy so those those emerging economies are at the point of recognition they're at the point of hiring consultants to come in delft in the craft a plan the problems are with implementation and really facilitating change and helping an emerging economy to understand the complexities associated with really driving innovation into the processes in that particular context and be able to link that economic growth which is a multi sector issue you have to deal with it across sectors and you have to deal with it in the scenario where governments can be much less stable you have to deal with it in the scenario where they're an entrenched interest that may be keeping government less stable and there are bad actors and good actors and how are you going to be able to go into a context grab the stakeholders together and figure out how to implement and drive that change for a period of time a significant period of time in order to be able to help that economy now there's great examples and probably the best example of leapfrogging is m pace in Kenya right you don't have the infrastructure for phones you create the infrastructure for Wireless you understand that you can do banking over wireless channels and that works in that context that work but it can't be copied everywhere those other contexts differ there are different insurance players there are different issues with respect to how those contexts operate whether they're actually ready and available to do something like that so what I would say more than anything is there was a context specific issue that one has to deal with it's you know it's almost like the issues of the Gartner hype cycle technology it's very easy to understand there's something there it's very easy to understand it's new it's bright it has implications for the future and people grab it a little too early before it's really matured and they really understand all the different components of it I would argue that you look at artificial intelligence and you look at what media with artificial intelligence over the last several years they've created initially a very simplistic and it's easy when you have the two letters AI for everybody to grab onto that a very simplistic label for people to react to only in the last six months to a year have you seen media gravitate more towards the complexity more towards of limitations more towards the potential issues that could arise and also the fact that where we're at right now is you know really a more accelerated stage and artificial intelligence has been around as a concept for a long time but very far away from some of the things that people have portrayed with respect to the capabilities of artificial intelligence what the potential implications are for Humanity itself so oftentimes we're working with emerging economies we have to go in commits with them work with the stakeholders across time and really try to drive all these links together in a very complex way depending on a particular context and to some extent kind of lower expectations a bit because of a lot of the hype that gets driven around this and the longer term processes of how all these things are going to play out eventually and now the complexity starts to emerge after a few years well thank you for that I feel like there's a whole lot here for us to to dig into it is seven minutes to ten o clock we've got about 25 minutes I'd like to take the prerogative of asking a few questions of the panel and then give you all an opportunity to to ask some questions there is a theme here as far as looking at different roles that different sectors of the economy have to play the role of individual workers and what responsibilities they have for training the role the public sector - to help with the transition and then the role of the private sector in in adjusting to the changes that are taking place if I could put you on the spot maybe a little bit and talking about how the disruption council approaches this issue and and how it interacts with these different players is there a certain expectation of these different players or is it a more organic thing where they're coming to you and proposing ideas well it's a it's a council set up by the government so the government is providing the the platforms and the discussions and also a few of the the policy issues but is actually quite organic where everyone has a say of saying we would like to discuss this proposal we would like to bring up this topic to go forward and every time we meet we we split the two days the first day we have external partners you had the visit from our ambassador of Technology yesterday he has been there as well telling what he experienced around the world as the change some technology and then we have a discussion on concrete policy the next day what should we do what should be the play part of every player to move Denmark forward and we don't get total consensus but we get a much better idea of where we stand and what are the solutions and bringing us forward and and of course we cannot hijack this discussion saying that now we decide because people are there in their own individual rights but we still shape in a future of for Denmark this way one of the things that has been discussed very much in the latest years is the income inequality I'm much more afraid about the skill inequality because when you have skills inequality it will lead to income inequality you can't you can't bridge that skill inequality with money yeah unless you will continue to pay and pay and pay and I don't think anyone would like to see that so what we are focusing on is much more the skill inequality than the income inequality Denmark is a very equal country we have no difference between the richest and the poorest but we have seen a bit of a rise over the last few years and and it hasn't really turned into a political discussion because what we're focusing on is the skills how can we lift the skills of those who are unemployed and that is really one of the things that this disruption council are focusing on so you have partners coming to the table bringing their ideas engaging in this this discussion I'm wondering for those that have experience and Bruce and Wayne I'm looking at you experience working with either emerging market policymakers or Bruce you're a veteran of engaging with different constituents to try you as a maker how realistic is that sort of model and do we have participants willing to come to the table that maybe view the situation of let's call it shared responsibility is that something an idea that has traction in the US and other emerging market countries well sir that's how we got the social contract in the middle of the last century was that in the 40s and 50s employers and labor and eventually government all decided that an employer based benefits scheme made the most sense for everybody we built a whole bunch of tax incentives around that and for for at least a quarter century it worked it worked pretty well I think we're now in a situation where that old scheme doesn't work anymore and where all the different components are under pressure to not hold up their end of the bargain as I said businesses are under all kinds of pressure to produce short-term profits - you know they're pulling back from benefits generally the sing nearly a hundred percent of the job growth over the last decade has come in jobs that were contracted out that carry no benefits whatsoever we surveyed employers about what they feel their responsibilities are and the ones that were contracting out felt they had no responsibility whatsoever to those workers meanwhile governments under all kinds of fiscal pressures and challenges so the it's not that one side needs to win this argument it's that we need to figure out how much of this is going to be on individuals how much if it's going to be on government how much is going to be on business and then work together to make that scheme possible which requires leadership to bring leadership consensus bargaining a lot of things that are you know difficult but I suppose the one thing we have going for us is that we have a country full of people who need and want that so you know necessity is the mother of invention I think shifting social contracts is a very complex process right and oftentimes it's you accelerate progress when this crisis right and unfortunately people tend to not respond until they get to that point it's they're less proactive mhm so I think a more proactive approach is something that you try to encourage individual to do I would agree completely with your last statement it depends on leadership and having the appropriate leadership at the table who are gonna drive the process forward on the process and make that part of what they are trying to accomplish as an individual or as a group of individuals and I think that enhances the probability that you're going to get this done in a more proactive way otherwise you're just waiting for the crisis to occur you know the extreme situation that has to be fixed there was one other question I did want to ask because we're talking about this this is coming it is happening there are going to be winners and losers in the process and it's it's actually going to be a longer process of transition the McKinsey report actually goes through what I've kind of termed as an active policy scenario looking at kind of non technology specific policies that actually would help smooth that adjustment could you just talk a little bit about what those policies are that actually help pave a smoother adjustment path path yeah I'd be happy to and I'd also be happy to address a corporate training point so I think that look maybe I'm optimistic by Nature but I and it's true that if you look at the data the amount of money that companies spend training workers has been declining but yet I think we are at a moment not of crisis but I'm hearing a very different dialogue among companies in the u.s. of course we don't have restrictions on laying off workers so if a company chooses to automate you know they don't need to decide to retrain their workforce and yet there are companies that we could rattle go on and on Starbucks Amazon providing tuition credit AT&T with a goal of retraining half of its workforce that's a hundred twenty thousand people to build their digital skills and they have set up online courses with Georgia Tech and with an online educational provider called audacity to develop these nano degrees so I think that there's actually a lot of move now is it gonna be enough I don't know but I'm hearing a very different conversation with large companies in America today that gives me hope that in fact you know a number of them are going to step up Walmart has it's Walmart Academy to help the associates move into management position so there's just a lot of examples is it all going to move the needle on the national data I don't know but I think that there's reason to be optimistic now I agree we need we need the national conversation and the leadership and how do you catalyze this movement I was just on the Council on Foreign Relations Task Force on the US workforce and one of the things we're trying to do after as a result of that a suggestion have been made you know can we have a corporate good housekeeping award so for those of you who wonder who know about office buildings there's something called the lead environmental designation and this is a completely voluntary thing and 15 years ago I don't think anyone had really heard of it but now every building you walk into and this one I'm sure in the lobby you're gonna see its lead silver or gold and so it's building standards that had met certain environmental criteria and there's talk about could we do the same in the private sector because because of the dysfunction in Washington because of the political gridlock there's a recognition that the private sector is probably gonna play a larger role than it does in Denmark and then I would also say at the local level when you look at different cities and states the u.s. is such a big complicated country but Chicago actually has a Chicago I think they call it the Chicago innovation Council that's a combination of civic leaders and business leaders who have looked at Chicago whose economies fine but it's not particularly high-tech and they said why don't we have an emerging startup ecosystem and they've created spaces and incentives anyway so there's I think that you can look around the US and see different local communities where that leadership is emerging and that's quite exciting now what can the federal government do well there's a lot because even in the age of technology you know and and I think it's right to say look AI is this catchphrase and part of the work that we've done is to say well how fast our companies adopting this and the answer is not very when I said you know a lot of work can be technically automated does not mean it will be because it is human beings and companies making these decisions and that's all happening rather slowly but a lot of jobs will be in other fields so we have an aging population and older people consume more healthcare and there's huge need for innovations in that space there's huge need for infrastructure we just went through a period of ten years of ultra low interest rates and unfortunately did not have a big infrastructure building program but now that rates are rising I think the government is finally talking about yet again are we gonna have an infrastructure so I won't comment on the timing but it would be good it would be an employer infrastructure is not a long term job creator you employ a lot of people when you're building it and then the main maintenance and operation employment goes way down but there's so much to do in terms of the basic infrastructure of this country including by the way broadband there's still a large number of Americans who don't have access to high-speed internet which is a travesty so I think that there is a lot that could be done and that would support workers in the in this transition and and we didn't really talk explicitly about fiscal policy and fiscal space to do those things that's probably a topic that merits an entirely new panel but it probably is worth saying that to do some of these things require some of the physical resources and in that respect I think Denmark and the u.s. look quite different we do something worth worth discussing all right well we're we're about five past the hour right now I'd like to leave some time if there are questions from the audience we have people with microphones if you can put your hand up and just state your name and your affiliation we'll take your questions right over here in the corner Matt Goodman I work with Stephanie and the Simon chair here at CSIS and just to say we do a lot of programs this is really one of the richest and most kind of thought-provoking panels we've done in a long time really appreciate everybody's clear and compelling messages I want to push Bruce a little bit on the third point about work and the nature of work and what you know can you give us any sense of what's going to replace those three million truck driver jobs not you can't you don't have a crystal ball and predict exactly what the jobs will be but you know what kinds of you know what are the what what what do you think are the nature of the jobs that are gonna be available for an 18 year old high school graduate who doesn't have you know the advanced education or skills and but needs something to do all day and needs dignity in their work and it's the dignity piece that I think is really important for you - I'm glad you stressed that so that's for you can you give any sense of what you're where you're going with that what you see is possible answers and and then you know I was gonna ask the fiscal question actually because Denmark has something like a 60 percent marginal tax rate and and I think a much better fiscal picture than we do this stuff some of this stuff feels expensive how are we gonna pay for how are we gonna pay for this stuff for anybody so well Susan can give a more detailed picture of what kind of jobs are going to grow and what kind of jobs are going to shrink I think in many ways it comes back to the minister's point that that the challenge is making sure that we we transfer enough skills to the people who are being displaced by the changes and but this isn't all doom and gloom we're gonna get richer as a country we're got what we have a fad you know in the aggregate we have a a very bright future but it it's going to require a fair amount of sharing which is not not something that comes naturally to us and I think I brought up truckers because it's a foreseeable problem that a responsible industry and a responsible government could see coming and do something about that there are you know over the course of the next decade aid a any given trucker could take could get a nano degree in something they could find another line of work that would carry them into the future but it's difficult for people to do that entirely on their own difficult to find the money to do it difficult to know I think one of the biggest problems we have is that individuals desperately want to increase their skills you know the first thing that happen after the global financial crisis was flood of people back to community colleges and into colleges but the average consumer they average worker has no idea what what kind of skills are really going to be valued in the marketplace they have you know they they go off to a non-profit I mean if for a for-profit school that will take their money but not give them skills so the it's not it's it's not that there won't be any jobs it's whether we're going to do a sufficient job of investing in the people and also the communities it's it is like we have a brilliant future on both coasts and a very turbulent future in the heartland because the educational and skill resources are flocking to both of those places we could fix that as a country we could we could create a bunch of well-funded research universities in places where you know our kids don't go right now when they get out of high school so it's it's it's not at all dark and hopeless I just think there's a tendency um those who are benefiting the most in the current economy to say um well we're gonna make we're we're gonna continue to be a very rich country and we can just write a check to the people who fall behind and no society can work that way you're quite right Denmark has a high marginal tax and fortunately has dropped over the last two decades from 73 to 56 and income tax and then we have a huge set of deductions so the tax burden of Denmark is is lowering in these years at the same time we're increasing our spending on education because we have chosen to see education as an investment not as an expenditure but as an investment research and development we're pretty high in European standards of state financed innovation and research and then we have asked companies and workers to give a bit of their wealth into this project so the salaries has gone up a bit less in order to create a fund where you can get extra training life learn training nanodegrees as you mentioned up to a few weeks every year you can decide to do something extra so it is not only state financed it's also financed by the workers themselves by the companies in a mixture where they set together to describe what kind of studies what kind of causes can you take others this fund so we're trying to make this a three wind pay it's just the three way payment the states the government the workers and the the businesses together to pay this because otherwise we can't we we can't not even in Denmark you have support for the the government to paid all we need the two other parts to play with there were two why don't we take these two gentlemen right here along the rope we could take your questions together I thanks for this panel I'm Michael life men not independent consultant in DC so I think it's important to remember that it's not just the blue-collar jobs that are at risk radiologists some accounting work some legal work and so the problem is broader than just truckers or drivers and so I'm wondering does that make it harder or easier to go through this transition right there's a large population that will be affected but potentially because it's people with more social power than in past technology disruptions maybe there's more of a chance that something gets done so your thoughts on that well thank you very much I'm Vikram Niro from Johns Hopkins sighs I'd like to echo Matt's point that this has been a very interesting discussion so thank you very much for that I have two conundrums that I want to place in front of you and ask for your thoughts on it the first is that you're quite right it does appear everywhere the technological change is accelerating but virtually every analytical study shows that productivity growth is declining so I'd like you to explain why there is this conundrum secondly I think there's the broad broad question about you know manufacturing of the share of GDP is declined not just since incidentally in the United States but virtually worldwide how much of this is real and how much of this is a statistical artifact because many services which you previously delivered inside manufacturing companies are now being out sourced so jobs that were earlier inside manufacturing or now in the services sector see you see the shift and that's really not that's actually an improvement in efficiency not necessarily a decline in competitiveness third I would like to say that fiscal policy is central because what appears to be happening in this country is that in the absence of a redistributed fiscal policy to try and bridge the skills gap or the income gap we're having efforts in policy diverted to trade barriers as a redistributed with the redistributed objective which is so unfortunate how do we shift this narrative this policy emphasis back to the questions that this panel is talking about thank you all right why don't we take those two questions anyone want to take a shot at the first one which was kind of the range of workers that will be affected you know I think one of the issues that we all need to think about a little bit more as really we're talking about human machine interface human machine interface has been going on since the first tool was okay and really we're talking about a different type of interface now than the interface of taking humans ability to apply brute force to do better etc and so I think we need to conceptualize it within the realm of human machine interface and understand how that is going to evolve across time rather than which again I think part of its the media and how the media has been driving some of this this issue of machines taking over the capacity of humans going forward okay good thing I think there still is now I'm a scientist and I will tell you that radiologists in the United States have been trained at a very deep level and I think independent of the you know AI algorithms that are scanning images to identify things there is significant capacity within that radiologist to interpret and make decisions about what should then happen as a result of that particular detection in that particular finding because that machine has so much more capacity to be able to do visual matching than an individual human does so I really think the dialogue needs to move in that direction it has if people have talked about you know machine human augmentation and things like that going forward but that needs to evolve more so that we understand this in a more complex what I would add to that I agree completely that we've been talking about AI replacing radiologist for 10 years but they're still radiologists and in fact one radiologist I've talked to said he loves it because he's less stressed out and worried that he's missed something so the AI is a backup to make sure he hasn't missed anything and in our very legalistic society that actually has other implications from medical malpractice so it could be a benefit but I think you're right that I'd be sugarcoating it if I didn't say the next big wave of automation we saw it in manufacturing it's gonna be a lot of back office job somebody called it the death of Dilbert for those of you who are familiar with the cartoon but all those accountants finance reporting people like that stuff can be automated in a big way now I think that when you asked what does this mean for them finding new work it might be easier because for one thing one of the problems with manufacturing that we realized far too late is that a lot of the job loss was concentrated in these towns and small cities that depended on this one industry so when the factory closed down the entire economy was devastated skills didn't matter because the economy was dead so then you're in a distressed community a lot of the back office type work that can be automated is more in urban areas that have more diversified economies so there's some hope that it's not going to be the same as the Rust Belt cities which are truly sad and you know it took way too long for all of us to recognize that there was going to be a big problem when the you know main employer in town pulled out and I think it also links to the point a lot of the people now doing those jobs do have some kind of secondary education I'd go back to the earlier question what is a high school graduate what gonna do I wanted to jump up and say no you cannot only have a high school degree in a country like the United States and think you're gonna do anything more than you know very menial work like gardening like a key for everyone is that there's got to be some sort of post-secondary training and skill building they just add to your question about productivity and the the dilemma that we're talking about investments but we're not really seeing investment if we're not seeing productivity I do believe that there could be a statistic glitch here that what we have normally seen as manufacturing could be different now because of automation and because what we're looking at is actually countries still being richer and richer and therefore there must be productivity in this but it's also a matter of at least in Europe people giving themselves more free time most bad time working a few and few years shorten shorter hours so the value that we're creating is not the same because we're spending it more on leisure time and not on work I just make one one quick point I think it will be helpful if the country as a whole sees that the working class is the canary in the coal mine for the rest of us I think we aren't panicked enough but it's also important that our leaders channel that anger us on trade and tariffs on robots and yeah if people understand what they really need to do to make it in the future then they'll do the right thing they will scale up and and and our country will come together and do the right thing I think that yeah but the challenge that Washington in its current form has with something like artificial intelligence is that we have no use for intelligence and we're really good at artificial I know there are another tweet I I have clearly done a horrible job as moderator because I know there are a lot of questions out there I'm also getting this sign which means we need to take a brief break now there's coffee set up and back senator Warner will be out in about ten minutes so we'll have everybody come back in if you could use that time maybe to ask the panelists questions directly this was a fantastic discussion I knew we had a lot of talent on the stage but I clearly underestimated the amount of time we would need so if you'll join me in thanking them [Applause] you good morning thank you all for coming thank you for being here we've got a few people still coming in - enough to get their coffee I think if I wanna say thank you to all of you I'm glad that you're here I think that the size of the audience reflects a bit the nature of the problem this is I can't think of a more serious issue right now that America should be talking about then this the shorthand is the future of work it doesn't have the traction as an issue it ought to have money or Denmark for the foresight to go out and do something structurally to deal with this problem it's really impressive that you're doing it weird I can only find one political leader in America that is taking it seriously that Senator Warner and we were just talking talking about it we know with certainty the I don't know if it's gonna be five years from now ten years from now but with one out of five Americans making a living off a drive in something they're gonna lose their jobs at some point now how fast I don't know but do we have an opportunity to get in front of a problem most the time we react after it's too late you know this is one of those rare cases where we have an opportunity to get in front of a problem before it becomes a crisis you know when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected it was it was about the redefining American capitalism in a way to save it as a model for governance because there were two competing ideologies in the world at that time national socialism with the rise of the fascists in Europe and international communism and they had the energy and they had the answers in American capitalism was on its but because of the recession now we're coming back now but I would not say that we are energetic about our future a matter of fact we're kind of ambivalent about our future we can't get traction about our future and so fortunately we do have one leader in America right now that is focusing on this putting his personal energies behind it devotes he's got a lot of other things he's having to do everyday too because as you know he's the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee and so the entire investigation that's underway is is on his lap but he continues to devote energy to this topic we are the ones that are failing because we're not generating the audience-participation to get this subtraction in America about this need so we're here to listen to you senator I'm delighted that you're willing to share your time with us today and then we're going to have Stephanie's going to lead a kind of a dialogue bringing all of you into the conversation through a question-and-answer so please welcome Senator Mark Warner and thank him for coming to you thank you John thank you for that introduction thank you for your support and for your years and years of public service in so many ways and leadership here at CSIS is a is really tremendous I just had a chance to meet the Danish Finance Minister mr. Hansen thank you for the support of this program and in many ways this is obviously not just an American problem this is a worldwide problem and candidly while this is not politically correct for an American politician to ever acknowledge any other country doing things slightly better in the space but I think Denmark is ahead of us and in both understanding this problem understanding where social contract I'll look like in the 21st century and I thank you for your willingness to to be here and support this initiative also in a acknowledge for those of you who've already sat through the first panel you may hear some repetition from Bruce Reid and I because we have also been working together on this issue for the last boy three and a half years and as John mentioned you I think you this is one of those problems this is one of those issues everyone from right to left along the political spectrum will acknowledge it's coming everyone from right to left will acknowledge no matter what we do specifically on trade globalization is going to continue everyone from right to left acknowledges we're going to have massive technological change everyone from right to left acknowledges oh my gosh are we prepared for this and I think the resounding answer is no and I would actually argue that are both of our political parties are firmly caught in the twentieth century both of our political parties are approaching this issue with a backwards look I would argue that my party the Democratic Party thinks about most of this from the problem of redistribution and income inequality both terribly important so government should redistribute wealth and then there's an enormous income inequality and government needs to bridge that and and some of that solution is right the Republican Party is saying this is just a problem of markets wha actually fix this and if we could just energize individuals to work a little bit harder and you know there may be certain things around markets it's still I think need to be reinserted eyes to get this right but both of the parties are many ways backwards looking one towards the 1930s for tea solution maybe one I'm not sure and I say this I know CSIS si is a bipartisan nonpartisan entity so I'm gonna make my editorial comment here I'm not sure really what the Republican Party is now said but I would say the Trump party you know has a backwards look that is looking at you know a mythological age of when it was a great life for white guys in the 50s and 60s and maybe into the 70s but I'm not sure again that's where our future was headed as John mentioned you know there is you you you can end up with a pretty dark spot here if if you go to where the logic illusion John made mention of the fact that if we move to automation and driverless vehicles we eliminate you know a large large percentage of jobs a stat I always like to use is that it it is driving in if all shapes and forms the single largest employment item in America for men and the nation notion of driving for a job is going to rapidly disappear at at some point so we can get to a point in a pretty dark area fairly quickly about whether the robots are going to take over everything I know in our last panel and I think she may have had to step out but Susan London from McKenzie I think there is she did I think some of them and McKenzie did some of the best work that said by 2030 we're not going to have this disappearance of all the jobs that maybe the good news there still will be work but the challenge for the all of us as policymakers and business leader is the notion and nature of that work for at least 30 percent of the workforce and I frankly think that's low in terms of oacd nation's first world nations the nature of work of 30 percent of the existing jobs are going to fundamentally have to transform themselves and I'm not sure any of our systems are really equipped for that so the question I would argue with is where do we where do we start and I I would start with the notion that the issues that we're going to face on a going-forward basis are less built upon the traditional ideological framework of liberal versus conservative or left versus right or for God's sake in our country red versus blue instead the question is going to be which political party or which group of policy makers are going to be forward leaning versus those are going to be backwards leaning this is a future versus past conundrum and there is an opportunity I think in a time when where I work on my day job we are caught up in enormous you know gridlock there's a opportunity if we get this right to forge a whole set of new alliances that might lead to breaking some of the political gridlock so I want to talk about two things for we go to the question answer period the first is if the notion and the nature of work is changing how was that changing and what is that do to our traditional social contract the social contract that grew up in Western Europe and in America in the 30s and 40s for the most part in the aftermath of massive industrialization and post-world War and what post depression at least in our country were different I think than in Denmark in many ways but in America it was a collaboration between business government and labor and the notion was you know once you went to work once you became a full-time employee that with that full-time employment you came certain expectations if you worked full-time long term chances were that your company was going to provide you health care and retirement and then there was going to be a series of a social safety net that would be provided by the government that would be unemployment Orman's comp disability often times regulated by the by the state government not the federal government and our country and no one in Denmark and elsewhere most of those obligations lie with the state it was almost only in America where it was those benefits only came about if you receive what full-time employment a w-2 employee and for 80 years that actually worked pretty well you know my dad was a marine in World War two got out of the war came back worked a couple of jobs and then went to work for a single company and work for that company for 40 years he never got that high in the hierarchy never made a lot of money but there was a level of Economic Security that came with that job and there was a recognition that with the job came healthcare retirement and if you were somehow to lose this job there would be something that would catch him in terms of benefits but that notion is changing it's been changing not just in the last few years with the the platform companies but it really has been changing over the last 30 years we've we've gone from you know as we move into the baby boomer generation people have started to move from more jobs we've moved from defined benefits to 401ks we've seen a slight shifting more back to the individual but a lot of this has really accelerated and boy oh boy has it accelerated as the Millennials 83 million strong including my three daughters come rushing into the workforce and where they will be in a short period of time the majority of the American workforce and if you ask most most Millennials the question is not where do you work the question is more often what are you working on and usually the response is not I want to go do X for my whole career but I'm driving uber I'm working on a startup company I'm doing a little IT consulting on the side and they're cobbling together a set of set of revenue streams you know to make a living and on the good news with that is that there is a certain amount of flexibility with it the bad news with that equation is you may be doing fine until you're not and when you're not doing fine all of the traditional programs that we set up for the 20th century social contract are not there for you so if you are a gig worker if you are an independent contractor if you are part-time if you are an entrepreneur you may be doing making plenty of money but there are no benefits that go along with that so how do we think about a social contract that would actually change that I believe that the truth is and we this should not end up devolve into some kind of 20th century labor classification battle I think we need to move past that debate and acknowledge the chances are in this changing world both by economic necessity and by choice of the workforce we're not going to go back to a world where virtually anyone works for the same job for 30 plus years so how do we create a new social contract that would meet where the economy is at today and the fact that already in America today in 2018 a third of the workforce is already in this form of some level of contingent work non full-time and that third of the workforce will go to over 50% of the workforce by 2025 again good news would be they may do being fine bad news is there's gonna be no no social safety net so I would argue and we have from the Aspen Institute effort have been arguing that we need to create a system of portal benefits you know in many ways for all the flaws of Obamacare that was the first move towards making health care more portable than our existing system and what that portable benefit system looks like I think time will tell chances are it will not all be run by the federal government chances are you know it will be administered in many ways on your device and it may have an enormous role for FinTech or or for non governmental entities but it should include some ability to set aside some resources as a buffer from that first job you get at 16 or 18 and that that benefit pool would accommodate and travel with you as you move from job to job throughout your whole career because I would argue particularly for folks on my political party that while income inequality is a huge problem and needs to be addressed that a problem of a most equal magnitude is income insecurity because in this changing world people that even with their even when their income tax return may show that they've made a decent salary chances are they built up no kind of no kind of reserves and as the Federal Reserve study recently showed 47% of Americans could not absorb an unexpected $400 expense without going into hock now that level of insecurity breeds not just personal insecurity but it also breeds political insecurity because you're pretty angry if you're working your tail off and then some something happens and you can't get your head health care you know you have no reserves there no benefit program to pick you up so we need a new portable benefit system and we've made some progress we've got a bipartisan legislation that would create at least a 20 million 25 million dollar grant program at the Department of Labor we've seen in Washington state efforts to create a portable benefit system we've seen the SEIU and uber work together on some ideas we've seen you know to a degree at least for driving we've seen the black car fund in New York exists as a as effect as a disability fund for some time for independent contractors but we need to do much more now if you accept the fact that people are not going to work for the same job for 30 years and that we need a portable benefit system the corollary to that is that it also changes the nature of what we should where the responsibility lies and what we should expect from the public sector and the private sector as we move into how to make sure that workers actually have the skills they need to compete in this changing economy if we go back to the McKinsey report that says 30 percent of all jobs and I think again that's low will fundamentally change the nature of their skill requirements between now and 2030 and that over 50% of the workforce will not be in permanent work then it is not illogical in our current economic system that businesses no longer invest in any meaningful way in workforce training and skilling one of the dirty little secrets though that and I say this is somebody who's been in business longer than been in politics but isn't fully recognized is that business wallet continually wants extraordinarily low tax rates and the tax cut bill that took place in December you get those rates but they've not been willing to accept any additional responsibility for the workforce and matter of fact on any kind of historical trends the amount of investment in workforce skilling and training is on a solid slope down in effect business has tried to push more and more of that responsibility back up on the state and you know it's a rational business decision particularly for low and middle income jobs those are the jobs that are most subject to technological change globalization or pure elimination so how do we rethink the notion of workforce training I would argue that we don't even have the right accounting systems you know the number of studies have shown that most nation states seventy percent of most first world nation states assets are their human capital yet at least in our American accounting system if you look at the balance sheet of any fortune 100 company there is no line item for human capital we've had a tax code that for years has promoted investment in intellectual capital and actual hard physical goods and we actually have Rd tax credits we have an accounting system that allows you when you buy that a computer to count it as an asset and depreciate it hold it on your balance sheet if you spend those same dollars training up or skilling up an individual throughout their career that's not an asset that's a cost it's a liability and we need to fundamentally change our whole thinking so we've put in place or at least from a legislative standpoint a taking the model of the very successful R&D tax credit and trying to create a human capital R&D tax credit so that a company would not get a deduction but they would actually get a credit for upskilling any individual and delivery system food could be through a community college or elsewhere but upskilling in a significant way in a world of certifications this should be able to be done give you that tax credit if the person below a cut line of say eighty thousand dollars of income receives an additional skill you know the many challenges I think that we faced and one of the biggest disappointments I had in the tax reform effort was boy oh boy did we ever blow an opportunity I'm a business guy I want to make sure that we're competitive with Denmark I want to make sure we're competitive around the world I'm all for bringing down Court rates from where we were to tie-in but that deal should have been made with American business was if we're gonna bring down rates to be more competitive you have to be willing to actually be willing to upskill and train up people in your workforce and will give you a tax incentive to do that but we miss that opportunity we miss the opportunity as well to say for those companies who got off short profits will be happy to allow you to repatriate those profits and bring them back at a low rate but the deal needs to be you need to make some of those profits back and reinvest in communities have been hard hit by trade huge huge missed opportunities in a bill that at the end of the day I think is going to simply you know provide a short-term spurt of growth but historically doing using borrowed money at the end of an economic cycle to Goose an economy that was already almost a full employment does not historically provide long term value creation final point I want to make is this is that if we're going to rethink how we invest in human capital if we're going to rethink how we deal with deal with the notion of a social contract and portable benefits I almost think we're going to have to step back and at its core question how can we make and let me say it the preface as somebody who's been blessed to do very well by the American economic system I failed a couple times then managed to do well in business you know I believe our free enterprise system but I would argue that modern American capitalism is not working for enough people and instead of making radical transformations on either the left or the right I think there are ways that we can slightly shift incentives to make it work for more folks investment in human capital a new social safety net and I believe also changing some of the incentives John and I were talking before we came in you know the capitalism post-world War two capitalism in America from the ur late 40s to the mid 80s built the country's strongest economy and built the world's largest middle class but many ways that capitalism was built on long-term value creation starting in the late 80s early 90s we've shifted too often in with the ability and I say again technology was both a adder and a detractor on this with the ability to move capital with the flick of a keystroke we've shifted so much of our attention towards short-term quarterly profits over long-term value creation and frankly everything in our tax code everything in our SEC system everything in the public markets reinforces short-termism over long term ism and again from tax code changes to different reporting cycles for for public companies there are ways within a free enterprise system that we can shift some of the emphasis just slightly back towards companies and and enterprises that will invest in infrastructure that will invest in R&D that will invest in human capital because if we don't this level of income in security and job insecurity combined will create more and more political distance we will have more and more Americans that will not only get frustrated with the Republicans and Democrats will frankly be frustrated with the overall effectiveness of our underlying economic system and history has shown that that countries to get to that point in their development not very good things happen so what I would urge and back to where John started these comments we do need to make this and and I'm white Carolina who works with me and some of the folks who asked me over here you know I'm wide open for correction on how we turn this into a political agenda but boy oh boy wouldn't the next political debate the presidential debate it was actually focusing on the future of work if it was actually focusing on what a 21st century social contract was working at it was actually focusing on capitalism 2.0 or investment in that 70% of our country's assets that's human capital wouldn't that be a lot more interesting than what passes for political debate right now so my challenge to all of you is help us figure out a way to do this in a more potentially understandable way and let's grow this audience from this room to a standing-room-only where both political parties and whichever political party gets there first and I think the same challenge will be in Denmark and elsewhere in America at least the political party who usually seizes that day and I grew argue Democrats have been slightly more successful at this than Republicans historically but the challenge will be going forward is that party that's forward leaning that party that's optimistic that party that would reinforce what is the unique American secret sauce which I think that everybody I'd have a fair shot to have an opportunity to earn a good life not be given but to earn a good life and getting this question about a future of work and future of capitalism getting the answer to that I think will be the key to who solves that problem for the 21st century so thank you very much CSIS I look forward to a conversation now thank you Thank You senator Warner as hopefully as apparent to everybody here in the audience you know why we were hanging your office so much to get you to come here and speak to us and and you have you've got a long track record of thinking about these issues before it was cool to think about these issues this might don't lecture it's cool yeah I think you know we had a conversation with the last panel that it does feel like something might be changing at least at a global level you know we're talking here on the margins of the spring meetings of the World Bank and IMF so five blocks from here we've got finance and development officials from some 200 countries talking about a range of issues but anti-globalization the risk of anti globalization and this fear stemming from technological disruption is real and it appears that policymakers more than just you are now taking notice so if there's an upside here to the anxiety it's that we're hopefully getting some focus on these issues so thank you again for being here today so I made the mistake with the last panel of asking too many questions myself and not leaving enough time for the audience to ask questions so I'm not going to do that again this time I'm gonna just ask one question linking it to our previous panel and to the experience that Denmark has had with their disruption council so this is a council that the Prime Minister created last year bringing together public sector private sector civil society to talk about these issues that are going to be shaping the economy of the future so my question to you is can we do that here is there an appetite and the leadership to actually do something at a national level that might replicate this sort of forward-thinking approach to policy well I actually think we already have a disruption council it's called the Congress right or non disruption is the case I I think it is better number of times in Denmark it's a wonderful country great ten-day biking trip three didn't work but there is a homogeneity around Denmark or there are different regions in the nation it's still of enough size that I think that disruption Council at a national level I want to follow what happens in Denmark I'm not sure that doing a disruption Council on a national level would work as well here as doing perhaps at a state level you know the benefits the optimism versus fear that exists in much of America really can be an awful lot trace to where you live and wide swaths of America that kind of particularly depended upon a 20th century industrial economy you that has been dislocated already or the areas where there is the most challenge fear uncertainty insecurity portal benefits I think are a great idea but it's it's probably not topped on the agenda in the valley and you if you take that part of Northern California because even though Millennials may be losing a job there's always another one there if they've got the skill set so that the the break point becomes regional the break point also becomes how high you already are on the skill high let's go ladder if you're very high on the high school at or the ability to move from job to job for gig to Gig becomes much easier it's much harder for folks with lower level skills and older and I think the the one thing I asked when we focused a lot on portable benefits well you also focus on this workforce training issue and you know there's not a politician around a policymaker around who doesn't have a an idea or a pro a program about changing education or rethinking workforce training but generally speaking most of that effort has been about how you take someone that doesn't have skills or that's young and equip them for their first job the thing that I think that is so that I've at least come to the conclusion that's so fundamentally different is the expectation used to be you know if you went to work at the factory and even if you weren't the world's brightest bulb you know if you're a good solid worker you'd be able to keep a job and keep on the line and you may not be bumped up all the way but you'd be skilled up along the way today even if you're a great worker and a low and moderate-income position they're just our know virtually no incentives for that company to upskill you both because of the fact that your job may be eliminated or a fact that you may not stay so you why train you up if you're gonna go to a competitor and so I came back to the tax code bill and I know I'm kind of wandering around here but I really do think that notion of the ongoing upskilling amongst people who are already in the workforce is an issue that very very few policymakers or business leaders are grappling with alright with that I am gonna turn it to the audience now with the the right to come back and ask a question again I I will say I'd ask people to focus their questions on the topic under discussion today we all know senator Warner has a number of interesting issues that he's following right now but let's afterwards on keeping the secrets on Russia over here let's stay focused there's a question there in the back if you want to wait for the microphone it was identified identify yourself senator Warner you have the unique experience of being in a state where you can meet with your constituents in Arlington which represent a very different socio-economic background and mix of constituent that you know compared as compared to down and Roanoke and down on the tide waters you all because of that you know the importance of communicating with each of those constituents and so one of the questions I have is as you start thinking about getting some of these messages out higher research and development at the federal level better workforce training you know and in a public-private partnership what is the most effective way to communicate with our constituents when today you have so little time and you it's very difficult to get people to sit down for 30 minutes to listen to what are really really engaging and important points how do you do that in Virginia and how do you think that we on a national basis when you and and mr. Daniels go out and try to communicate in a bipartisan way how can you do that effectively where people don't immediately then trench it you know we trench back into their camp good question Carl thank you for that question when I try to answer it a couple ways one in Virginia obviously Northern Virginia is doing fine but what is fascinating around Virginia is in almost every major community we've seen a renaissance of cities across across America and nobody would predict in that 30 years ago we've also seen in one of the challenges I've got is is that we haven't figured this out even among small-town Virginia in Southside Virginia and Southwest Virginia there's certain communities even once that don't have colleges that it really have have had a bit of a renaissance and others who are still struggling I'm not sure people have I wish some great think tanks would sort that out in a state by state or community by community what is the sauce that that makes the community continue to succeed versus those that don't if they're kind of equal in size I think we have some so the fear and insecurity about going forward isn't straight geographical that really is there's even kind of a more targeting but to your basic question I I haven't sorted that out I mean if I can talk to a group you know I've done plenty of town halls with not folks that would show up on a Friday morning at a think tank and they get the idea that they or their kids are gonna move from job to job they get the idea that there's they don't have any social insurance and they like the notion of a portable fence I know they're gonna need more Skills going upscale they want to make sure they're not all told that if you've been a coal miner and you're 55 that you're gonna suddenly be transformed to a tech worker they don't want to hear that but there will be plenty of other roles that we could think through I don't think I don't think I've figured out it or nothing a way to transform that into policies one of the things I'm hoping this year to do is is in Virginia with our new governor governor Northam and for that matter you got a lot of gubernatorial races you before we maybe make this a national issue if we could make it a state issue and states have always been the best laboratories for our country and roll out policy ill experiments and we could put up a little federal matching money you know in our this bill I've got with Todd young from Indiana Republican you know would be a great little starter but we gotta move we got to put some points on the board but I've still I'm still sorting out I'm still struggling to figure out a way to make this it's hard to break it into a three word sound bites but I do find I guess the optimistic part though is every chance I've had amongst you know lots of communities if I get folks to listen I think they they get it and the good news is portable benefits it's not a Republican or Democrat issue you know investment human capital everybody talks about so it's not these don't fall neatly into partisan blocks and that's a good idea that's a good a good notion question right here the woman in the gray in the middle senator thank you so much for being here today my name is Dennis Henry I work here at CSIS you were talking about portable benefits and I wonder if you can speak a little more to the idea of portable labor protections that go beyond just health care and the things we usually think about when we think about benefits you mentioned the work that the SEIU is doing with uber and I was curious if there are more efforts if you've given some thought about how we protect a very non sedentary labor in the world of digital everything you say can and will be used against you so I'm trying to agree I think there is a a growing debate inside labor with some of the traditional old labor saying we need to try to force everyone back into a w2 full-time traditional job role and make this a labor classification battle I think newer labor SEIU but more like Domestic Workers Alliance and a whole series of new organizations that didn't even exist 15 years ago are more forward-leaning and saying we're not going to be able to put the genie back in the bottle people are going to move from job to job so let's see if we can create portability you know and is it portability because in certain senses it's not even portability by the type of work you do which is you know labor unions by by their definition of being trades you know if somebody is an IT worker part-time an uber driver another time a handy fixer-upper you know for their third gig and then they work part-time in a more traditional venue the notion of a traditional trade union isn't the right one so I think we're gonna have to evolve into a new model I do think the more the more forward-leaning organizations realize if you create this portable benefit system the role of new labor may be to manage that Portland benefit which both provides them an income stream but also gives them a chance to then protect the worker and whether that goes into full though we variations along the scale of negotiation I do think you need to bring a number of the labor benefits to this new portable system whether if you've got what's four years ago uber was still in his early stages now it's in 40 nations I'm not sure even if every uber driver was organized it all belong to the same label organization so the question of who will speak in terms of actually working conditions I think we're gonna just have to sort through but I do think the role of the port of the benefit manager very well could and I actually think should be representative I think still think we're early but I would urge I worry for real a lot of groups that I've worked with for a long time and been very supportive of I don't think they should get rid of their traditional role protecting somebody who's an additional long term w-2 worker but both the ability to do flexibility the ability of both economic necessity and frankly worker choice to be able to work on their own schedule a little bit more it just we're gonna drive drive more and more into this flexible work force not a lot of people but a lot of interest so I like it's no we could we could keep this going on for a few hours but we've got we've got about time okay thank you great talk and my name is Maggie I mean I work at IFC part of the World Bank Group and I'm also a Virginian given given the large tech community in Virginia and given the nature of the issue that we're talking about do you see potential partnerships with the industry being part of the solution given that you talked about portable benefits and their ability to manage and understand risk also obviously part of the potential future workforce I like the idea of Virginia as a laboratory but also maybe a partnership including the industry and how you how you're thinking about that a great question a lot of the benefits piece outside of health and retirement which has been more federal but a lot of benefits based unemployment workman's comp disability you know those are all state administered programs so the ability to try something may is actually easier at the state now you sometimes I have a federal labor laws that overlay that so you know and you know I do think you'd have more you'll have flexibility with the Trump administration creating some waivers this is where you're gonna have to build some trust so the waiver doesn't mean just we're gonna cut out a workers benefits but I do think we're going to partner partnering with the tech community is where I'd hope to to move into and I've been talking to the governor about this because there are a lot of a lot of contract and part-time and consulting tech workers in Northern Virginia that don't have any of this social insurance and that since its non or non labor organized group already would be a great place I think I think to start one of the other areas that were you know the I think probably was touched on in the earlier panel was one of the area's that's particularly ripe for reform and experimentation is unemployment and how you can move more unemployment into a more flexible benefit that could also be used for training that might be able to be used for relocation rather than simply a a stipend until you find new work because the idea that you gonna simply find new work in your old career probably isn't always going to be the case going forward I got more to come hopefully within a couple months on with NV TC and hi good morning my name is Nicole golden I'm a senior associate here at CSIS and consulting with the bank and others Thank You senator for your wonderful remarks I particularly appreciated the comment about the conundrum between past and future and as you alluded to in your earlier comments I think it's also an issue between present and future in terms of how do we prioritize and think about the immediate situation of displaced workers but also think forward to current training and education but my question is actually about this issue how do we elevate this conversation and this issue and I'm curious since we are here at CSIS your thoughts on how do we frame and how do you think about this issue a future of work and workforce as a national security issue if we national security issue is we've got to have the intellectual talent and the workforce to compete well the reasons why I so strongly support immigration reform and it's also why I think if we do not have if we do not have this ability to have our workforce skilled up in a mobile world others will take those jobs you know the predestination that America is always going to be the preeminent power is it's not the case and the one thing in the national security context that and I've changed dramatically on this in the last two years because I've spent so much time and classified briefings and I think sometimes the West writ large needs to need to think about this is it we're kind of stumbling through this China has a plan China has a plan our work force on investment on theft of intellectual property rule if you think about where the next technologies will be in terms of AI machine learning quantum computing 5g China is equal or exceeding us already and they're putting the workforce in place so we this we have to transfer this into a we have to make the national security argument as well as a as a Treasury veteran I remember secretary Geithner saying plan beats no plan all the time so yes I think that's true right here in the second row thank you John Mullen McLarty associates I also teach a course at Georgetown on trade and a neighbor of Senator Warner in Alexandria tour the four questions have been friends so I feel and oh but I'm no quantity you just mentioned China and and we've heard from Denmark earlier on there's obviously a huge government component in addressing this issue we have relied heavily in our social contract as you've pointed out and the panel talked about on on companies you've talked about using tax incentives to for to help with training and maybe infrastructure I wonder if the private sector is is is up to that whether since the the states will be more nimble than the federal government in in in addressing the public part of it the states are also where companies are incorporated do we need a new kind of a corporation companies are created to create value for their shareholders are tax incentives enough to make them do do good for the people great one tax incentives aren't enough but boy oh boy did we blow it in December you know I spent years trying to get on the Finance Committee yeah put me in coach put me in got on the committee and it was the most disappointing thing to have this massive tax giveaway without any real discussion of anything other than how can we cut the most taxes for the most businesses in the sloppiest way possible and the chance to do in the pro business but the frustration I had with business leadership in America that had all been talking the game but when they got offered that twenty twenty-one percent rate rushed to that rate and said mr. Trump we love it let's jump in jump in the boat you know and they would have they all have said to me oh we weren't happy to a trade for repatriation we've been happy to do training well we missed a frustration number one there are efforts around different corporate forms there's the effort that probably owes the people in this room are familiar with called the B Corp that you know has done some good work but it's been it's been really hard with our existing levels to go as a B Corp which has a different set of definitions to a public entity there was an effort that Mike Bloomberg put together called SAS B which would be a different accounting standards sustainability standards that include workforce and training in environmental and it has been years in the making and I think still making some progress but not as much as I'd like there are other countries and no American politician should especially one that was a business background would ever cite France or Italy as an example but they actually have public company rules that grant additional voting power for longer term holds on stocks and there are now is going being created of going through the final hurdle at the SEC an American long term stock exchange that would you voluntarily list but it would be over a longer term pool Larry Fink they had a Blackrock the largest money manager if not the world with trillions and trillions under a set thinks that we should change part of the ERISA definitions around fiduciary duties so that you can include a corporation could include benefits beyond just a short-term return to shareholders it can be over long term value it can be to include your employees in your communities so that fiduciary duty difference definitional difference could could make a change so we could do these at both state and federal level again B Corp is probably the one that spread the most it's I think in 36 states at this point there is that legal frame I think and the guys that are running our great great guys I still think we've not none of these experts are still fairly nascent I guess in the greater scheme of things the fact that almost all of these things grew up post 2008 2010 financial crisis means they're still really young and this debate is just happening but my fear is that our policy debate is not keeping up with technological change when you went through industrialization we went through Agricultural Revolution when we went through the first Internet wave revolution you know you had years with the rate of change that's about to come around from automation that's about to come around from automobile driverless cars driverless drones you know from AI we don't have the luxury of trying to cogitate about it for a decade and then start small experimentation we need the urgency of now on these issues or we will have I think the breakdown of our political system because if both political parties are looking at 20th century solutions and they're not meeting the economy where the workers are and where the economy is headed yeah that's not a good that's not a good recipe you brought it right back to where we started this discussion and and precisely why it is such a critical issue for us to to tackle so we've already kept you longer than I promised so I want to thank you steps last one last quick one thank you all for being here and being interested Karolina wet raise your hand so you know where our or Bruce and Connor others they're folks here that that are working with me on this project we don't have this all figured out by any means if you got ideas suggestions better ideas we're wide open for business I also want to thank the finance minister Missy Hanson and because I think Denmark is ahead of the curve on this you start with a more flexible social contract stuff to begin with but the fact that you've got a disruption council and that you're you thinking through this at a governmental level I don't think there are many other industrial nations in the West that are doing this at a national level so kudos to you all and we'd like to very much continue the conversation with you and help learn from what you're doing but my sense would be you know thank you all for being here but let's make sure the next time we find a way to phrase this in shorter political terms and we make this a standing-room-only crowd thank you very much dear partners in that [Applause] [Music]

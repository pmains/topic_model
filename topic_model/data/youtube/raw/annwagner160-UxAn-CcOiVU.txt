I thank the chairwoman for yielding good morning mr. Sloane good morning I want to start by expressing my continued anger and frustration that your company was taking advantage of your customers and our constituents for years you had a responsibility to your customers and placing ones money and wealth in the custody of an organization like Wells Fargo is one of the biggest displays of the public's trust and your company betrayed that trust and took advantage of customers in order to meet sales performance goals and fraudulently improve earnings and share prices while you have apologized paid millions in millions and fines and after reviewing your recently released business standards report made numerous changes to your corporate structure I think we can agree there is still more to be done mr. Sloan there were over 15,000 accounts in Missouri affected by misconduct and scandal since 2012 these include many of my constituents whom I represent I care deeply about these customers have all of these customers been made whole sir and not just for any fees charged but also for related effects such as impact on credit scores and such the answer is yes by us and the way that we have done that is by the extensive outreach that I mentioned in my opening statement outreach outreach meaning what meaning that we we looked at 165 million accounts they have been made whole and there and their credit scores have not been impacted you made sure of that we have we have corrected any improper information that we provided to the bureaus and in addition to reimbursing customers for fees and expenses we've asked them to come in and see us to the extent that they felt like there was additional the percentage came in to see is there a very small percentage came in to see us notwithstanding our best efforts to contact everyone and to the extent that they weren't satisfied with what our offer was we hired a mediator at our expense on their behalf and we've resolved all of those customers that have come in in addition those customers have the ability to take part in the class action settlement that we've entered into where we've time after the scandals that have been brought to light since 2016 Wells Fargo decided to hire a new chief compliance officer to ensure that the bank is mitigating risk I'd like to know when that new chief compliance officer was in fact hired and has the new chief compliance officer been empowered to make changes throughout the company he has Mike Romer was hired and joined us in January of 2018 in January of 2018 that's correct what was going on between 2016 and then a lot of time before you hired a chief compliance officer sir yeah that's correct we had a compliance program that was in place it wasn't working as well as I would have liked we dismissed our formal we asked our prior the chief compliance officer to step aside and we went out and I think we've hired the best chief compliance officer in the industry who has a demonstrated capability of the regulator's tell you to get rid of your chief compliance officer no I made that decision um in your testimony you mentioned that Wells Fargo has worked to address the root causes that allow these issues to occur in the first place mr. Sloan in your opinion what are these root causes was there something your business model something in your organizational structure that led to this malfeasance well I think there were a number of root causes Congresswoman first it was reflective in our decentralized structure where our control functions were part of our businesses as opposed separate I've changed that since I become CEO I think it was also reflective in our retail banking business in an incentive plan that was much too focused on selling products as opposed to providing good service and advice we've got we've ended that incentive plan and we have a new plan in place it's being received quite well by not only our team members but also by our customers that's reflective in improvement and customer service customer loyalty customer experience course the feedback that we get from our team is that those fundamental changes like that are being very well received my time is about to expire I have more questions about risk management and the board I hope some of the other colleagues will get to that I thank you for testimony and I yield back madam chairwoman

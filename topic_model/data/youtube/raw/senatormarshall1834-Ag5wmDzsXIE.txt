thanks to both you I want to get an inside perspective on this congressman Roger Marshall is a Republican from Kansas he joins me now from Capitol Hill congressman thank you for being with us I appreciate this you've got unique insight into this because your district in Kansas I understand is one of the biggest agricultural producer rigs in the entire country and it does rely to a great degree on some of the people who might have been these daca recipients that's right Ally we have open jobs right now in Kansas and a lot of these are immigrant related situation we have maybe 12,000 some daca kids as well and these are just our numbers on a newspaper article these are real kids these are friends of my my children these are brothers and sisters of the kids I've delivered over the past 25 years in Great Bend America one of the things that that gets to people is some of the characterization not just of these people but what their effect on the economy will be and I just want to show you this from Breitbart a little earlier today it's a daca recipients currently hold upwards of 700,000 US jobs an ultimate end to the program with daca recipients not getting amnesty would result in a 700 thousand job stimulus for American workers this would amount to nearly 30,000 new US job openings for American workers every month once the program is officially phased out that is tantalizing sir how do you respond to that to people who will say get these guys out so that Americans can have these jobs Ellie that doesn't make much sense to me I was speaking with dr. ben Carson about a month ago when dr. Carson said we have five million open jobs across this country right now and what the problem we have in the country is actually have a lack of skilled labor force that's the problem so there's five million open jobs yet these 700,000 people are not in the job pool then we'll have 55 million 700 and open jobs in the country right now so we have a shortage of work supply right now of laborers can you tell me just for those of us were not as familiar with it across the country how immigrant labor works into the Kansas economy what are the jobs that they do and why is it that it requires this sort of labor to get those jobs done sure you know at the fastest growing dairy in the country dairy milking cows is very very labor intensive and people don't realize this but we have to milk our cows two or three times a day seven days a week 365 days a year so it is a very labor intensive a situation I visited dairy in Kansas where they deliver about 30 baby Holstein calves every day so that was a maybe five or seven workers for that particular part when it comes to feeding cattle we have big feed Lots in Kansas as well also very labor intensive out in the in the general form work whether it's planning wheat or harvesting hey we need lots of laborers as well obviously we cover politics a lot on MSNBC so the stuff that I was just talking to Kelly and Garrett about about how this is all playing out on Capitol Hill is intriguing do you as a Republican particularly care that this is something that's being worked out with both both Republicans and Democrats so that the president is talking to Democrats about it you know I'm very much a laser-focused person I want Congress to do their job I want them to look in the mirror and figure out a solution the president has given us six more months to figure out daca I think it can be done I'm very happy that the president is bringing it to everyone's attention and making us talk about it I'm happy that there's bipartisan discussions going on great discussions in the freshman class over on the house side on immigration issues we're talking about an h2c visa program so there'd be a simpler way labor force visa program for agriculture as well so it's a very prudent topic right now and I'm glad we're all talking about it representative roger marshall i appreciate the time you've taken to be with us roger marshall is a republican congressman from kansas thank you sir thank you

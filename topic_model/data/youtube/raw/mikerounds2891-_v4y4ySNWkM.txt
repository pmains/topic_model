joining me now is republican senator mike rounds of south dakota he serves on the armed services and foreign relations committees senator rounds welcome back to meet the press thanks i appreciate the opportunity to visit this morning well we're really happy to have you here so earlier this week you said that the fbi search must be justified and that you had serious questions about the integrity of the justice department having seen what they retrieved including all these classified documents had that answered your questions about the need for them to go in i think it brings more questions and i think it's important that we recognize that there are more that there's more information to be released yet i think uh releasing the affidavit would help at least that would confirm uh that there was justification for this raid uh but remember this is also a case of where we're gonna have more questions as they continue to develop as as they look through the information the material that they've garnered at mar-a-lago perhaps they will share some of what their concern was they'll share a little bit about the reason for actually going in and doing it this way there's going to be a question about whether or not they did exhaust as attorney general garland said all other means to to do this rather than making this unprecedented move on the home of a former president this is a you know this is a a very historic attempt and a challenge really in with regard to looking at a former president and whether or not they want to bring any kind of charges against him this is a change and this is something that will go down in history and it'll be studied for years to come but in the meantime i think most republicans would prefer to look right now with the 2022 midterms coming up we'd much prefer uh to focus on what the policies are right now that are hurting our economy uh and as my friend amy klobuchar said they want to talk about what they think is the right direction to go and clearly here in south dakota where i'm from i went to a street dance last night and i'll tell you what the folks in fort pierce south dakota are talking about why gas prices are still high they're talking about what the cost of hamburger is they're talking about why in the world we want to have 87 000 new bureaucrats and the irs out chasing down and trying to audit them and those are the types of things that they're learning about those are the things that they're scratching their head on and and that's the focus that i think democrats would prefer not to have right now and if they can get the former president with all of the popularity that he's gaining and all of the support he's getting from his supporters right now if they could get him to announce right now in the race they'd love to have that because that would take all the air out of the out of the atmosphere right now and the challenges that they face with regard to the economy at this time well let me play some of the rhetoric some of the comments by some of your colleagues about the search uh and ask you about on the other side i know doing this 90 days before an election reeks of politics i think it's an attack on the rule of law this is the fbi being used as a political weapon against your opponents we should be alarmed at the way that the department of justice and the fbi have gone after someone doesn't the fact that so much was found including classified documents when the president and his lawyer had affirmed according to the new york times that they had turned everything over doesn't that justify a search an unannounced search uh for months and months they tried to get cooperation didn't they take every step that they could have taken i i think this the last part of your question is probably very important i think it would be good for the justice department to release some of the information about the extraordinary steps or the steps they did take to try to cooperate with the former president i also think this will bring into question one constitutional issue that has not been talked about and that is whether or not a president can declassify or classify certain items and i think constitutionally back i believe it was in 1988 there was a supreme court decision u.s navy versus egan in which they actually talked about whether or not a form or a president could classify and declassify and it's never really been litigated but it appears that a president can classify or perhaps declassify information and if that's the case then the question would be and i think it will be litigated as this moves forward whether or not that was completed while the president was in the white house at that time and and i think that'll be part of the discussion moving forward in the meantime yeah there's concern out there and believe me republicans out there are questioning why in the world are you going after a former president right now but you didn't go after other individuals who clearly had classified documents or information that was sensitive and you did not do that in the previous administrations well in this case some of the information was compartmentalized and you know that's the most secret that includes sources and methods and you have to be in a vault to see it so in any case those documents should not have been at mar-a-lago in in the basement but the classification issue is going to be litigated most likely as you point out but in this case the potential crimes listed on the warrants those three crimes don't require there to have been classified documents it just requires these papers that could damage national security to be inappropriately held and and as i said earlier we do have more questions uh and look i'm i'm not one of the individuals out there that says that you immediately attack the fbi or the justice department i think this is very important that you provide them with the opportunity to lay out their case but i think it's very important long term for the justice department now that they've done this that they show that this was not just a fishing expedition that they had that they had do cause to go in and to do this that they did exhaust all other means and if they can't do that then we've got a serious problem on our hands if they are able to do that and to come forward they should do that as quickly as they can and they should share that with the american people because this is a time in which with regard to the institutions in this country we want the american people to have faith in their institutions we want them to see that they're not that they're not political and that they're not being politicized particularly during an election year but uh you know at this point i think it's very important that and i'm hoping that if they actually did this and that they recognized how serious this was that they did have their act together before they went in and and did this and that it was not a fishing expedition it is up to them to be able to share with the american public the logic behind what they did the facts they had what caused it and i think releasing that affidavit would be important but i think i think attorney general garland really does have a responsibility not just to take accountability for it but to share with the american people why they did this we still have more questions than we have answers let me just ask you quickly uh given that they did take all this material boxes of material and and classified documents as well and given how casual he was about securing documents that's been well established when he was president do you think that should disqualify him from being president again and would you vote for him if he runs i'll keep my powder dry with regards to your last question i think right now we're going to focus on the 2022 election we want to retake the house we definitely want to retake the united states senate and i think in doing that and our goal is to focus on what's going on right now with the american people we're going to focus on the fact that inflation is still over eight and a half percent uh we're still talking about gdp which has been going down and as you know uh sharing breakfast with the chair of the former chairman of the of the federal reserve anytime you've got two quarters in a row you are in a recession we want to see us get out of that recession and most certainly we want to see gas prices come down they're still a buck and a half higher than when joe biden took office those are not good policies to run on for democrats we need to focus on that and as we get past that and get into the 2024 i think the republican will be well positioned but uh let's get past the 2022 election first and we're not in a recession yet but uh we'll wait and see what does happen and we really want to thank you it's very good that you came on today two quarters tell you differently than that that's out of date out of date even according to republican economists in any case when we come

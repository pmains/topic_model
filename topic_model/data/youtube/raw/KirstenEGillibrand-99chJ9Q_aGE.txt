[Music] we all know that our military has a sexual assault problem every Secretary of Defense for more than two decades has acknowledged this the problem hasn't gone away and military sexual assault is as pervasive as ever and so our bill essentially allows the decision of whether a crime has been committed and whether it should go to trial not be made by trained military prosecutors not commanders because right now troops don't have faith in the system last year alone about 15,000 cases of rape sexual assault unwanted sexual contact and only about 6,000 of them are reported only about 4,000 openly and of those strong souls who reported about 59% are retaliated against for reporting so we need a military justice system that is more transparent more effective one that is worthy of the sacrifice that our troops make every day my husband and I are children or stationed at Camp Lejeune North Carolina Colonel Wilson was reported to have had prior sexual misconduct and his previous command was aware of it in Okinawa Japan they did nothing about it and sent him to Camp Lejeune where he ended up sexually abusing my daughter so their failure to punish him cost my daughter her innocence can't wrap my head around why a commander in the military with no legal background has such legal power just basic transparency and accountability holding commanders responsible for not doing these jobs well and having trained prosecutors make these decisions who know what they're doing listen to just the headlines of the last few months from March quote reports of sexual assault increase at two military academies from September quote Bad Santa Navy's top Admiral kept spokesman after boozy party sexual predator warning from October in the military trusted officers have become alleged assailants and sex crimes from just a few weeks ago quote senior military officials sanctioned for more than 500 cases serious misconduct enough is enough this shows that there is still not good order and discipline in our military and it shows that our system is broken because it protects predators it fails to protect victims please speak out about this raise your voice tell your story let's do everything we can to pass this bill [Music]

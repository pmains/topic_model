thank you very much chairman Smith for recognizing the problem that we have today and for holding this important hearing and for allowing me to join you in your discussion and your questions I'm proud to represent Michele Littlejohn and one of the three witnesses here today miss Liv John's three children beautiful children two daughters and a son of sila Lila and Joseph were tragically adopted by her former husband to Lebanon nearly two years ago she's worked tirelessly to litigate their return in Lebanese courts and as one remarkable landmark decisions that have essentially established her case to return the children yet she waits I must defer to her with great respect to tell you the entire story and commend her for her brave struggle mrs. Littleton's testimony and that of the other witnesses here today suggest that we need to look as you said more closely at ways to improve our government's support of parents who face abductions and retentions as you mentioned so eloquently in your opening statement mr. chairman Congress passed the Goldman act to empower the State Department with tools or sanctions to discipline countries who enable abductions and retentions I understand that you invited the State Department to participate with us today and I must say that I'm very disappointed that we don't have any State Department officials here today to testify on how we can work together to strengthen our support for their brave parents like mrs. Littleton I follow the travels and and the work of our secretary of state who clearly obviously gives that job absolutely 100% and I just can't tell you how I'm disappointed that none of the other 60,000 plus employees that doggone Department could not find time to show up today and participate in this important hearing that you've called very very disappointed and maybe I may bring that to the attention of the secretary the doubtless difficult circumstances when a child abduction in effects intersects with our foreign relations but we must try to do better and again chairman Smith I want to thank you for holding this important hearing and allowing me to participate I thank you again very much mr. chairman and again be remiss if I didn't state how disappointed I am the State Department is not here and can't help answer or validate some questions that have arisen because of the testimony that we've heard here today for example the last time our staff and I met with Miss Littleton the Department of State was there and we talked about a number of different approaches that they might try to execute to make these things happen a little bit more efficiently they promised to update us and it did in fact recontact us and and tell us that the local law enforcement had gone to the children's school to execute an order and they planned actually to take the kids in a possession and return them to you but can you just imagine on that particular day the kidnapper didn't let the children go to school and hereif filed to appeal every other finding so you know I think the pressure the political pressure definitely needs to be applied at a higher level as mentioned here we're when we interface with the local authorities there's obviously more than a little bit of corruption and there they're not on our side like so much of the international community do you know each of you if any criminal charges have been filed against the kidnapper yes I'm aware of criminal charges being filed have they been filed it's been eight years yes have they been filed yes it is your ex wanted by the FBI for interstate transportation of children illegally or what's the charge it's under the international parental kidnapping crime and passport fraud okay now how how severe is the penalty for that I'd have to look at the statute but they are extraditable because it does meet the comity it meets Japanese law under the interpretation of the Department of Justice because that's pretty significant I think that got left out of the testimonies here sir your case to my knowledge in Ecuador or people who have found a safe haven in Ecuador have not been criminally charged by the Department of Justice here in the US where were your children kidnapped my children working up to a power they were taken from Miami to Ecuador by their mother and I met with the FBI in Miami and they told me they're not going to do anything unless I win the head case in Ecuador okay so you have to win a case against Ecuador a foreign court before and I wonder why your FBI office is different from your FBI office if I could address that briefly my colleagues and I have met in the past with the office of the Attorney General at DOJ not directly with the office but underneath in the building and we've cited the fact that there's been gross inconsistency in the FBI throughout the country with regard to responding to parents of kidnapping cases I've seen instances as heeps described as well as parents being turned away claiming that the parent needed to file local charges first no wonder no we're under the federal statute does it require any sort of prerequisite so I do not know if it is a fundamental lack in training policy or just a desire to push parents away because in the end these cases are hard to prosecute and they'd rather put resources elsewhere but it is important to actually get this on the record and get it cited and the last thing I'll just add in response to that is our coalition of organizations has asked for the past several years for DOJ to provide statistics on how many cases they have pursued and indicted under the international parental kidnapping crime Act of 1993 to date they have declined stating that they do not Cole ate those numbers and advised us to reach out to each district office throughout the country frankly I think that's kind of a nonsense response but that's what they tell us thank you yeah I'm not a lawyer but I think your court proceedings make it very clear that the children have basically been kidnapped and out of Miami and I'm shocked that you couldn't get any charges filed and he could miss listen how about you there's a federal warrant from the FBI for international parents will childhood abduction there is a warrant there is a warrant okay so two out of three if I could just add to that in my experience in knowing hundreds of cases we are the outliers that actually have received response and indictments by the Department of Justice it's highly unusual okay thank you and again you wonder what the parents are telling their home countries to you know that they're obviously taking the kids did the kidnapper side and and it would be like if if you enter there and kidnap your kids back and brought them over here they would be found motion saying that you molested two children and all kinds of terrible things and why we should send them back to the country with them I mean so you know it's it's not clear-cut probably to the other side of the authorities either they don't hear your side they're obviously just getting the other side do we know if if there are children in the United States who have been abducted in other countries by Americans and are held here and the people from the other countries are trying to do just the opposite are we aware that yes there are cases where children have been kidnapped from foreign countries to the United States how many I don't have the exact figures on that I do know the Department of State publishes those numbers or did in the past on their website prior to the Goldmann act and they would list year by year the number of incoming cases as they call it you know how the status works on any of those do we respect the foreign court's jurisdiction my understanding from meetings with the Department of State on that topic are that's handled by the courts that adjudicated and the general answer could be yes but I think as you pointed out they get into the details and that he said she said component so one could make an argument that we may not be perfect on this as well however I do think our American rule of law does apply and hearsay is probably not allowed in those jurisdictions the way it is in Japan and I presume in Lebanon and Ecuador and many other countries that stack the deck against American citizens when our children are kidnapped abroad yeah you think there should be maybe an International Court but then you see what happens in to un same thing you know it's all against us just out of curiosity is judge Wald still in a bench yes yes you would not have had a problem were not for his poor judgement if I if I understand your testimony correctly that is correct as is he aware of what this turned into he's fully aware and he actually finished doing the final court orders the final return orders that we submitted to the Lebanese civil court that Lebanon is acknowledged so he has tried to make it right or rectify it but I've been left to the fate of my lawyer and Lebanon using the court documents that judge waltz is now sending so to have my children returned and and he seems like your attorney there I was on the phone with you one time when we did a conference call and he and he seems pretty confident and priest seems confident competent and I guess he did yeah get everybody to the point they wanted to go until the local police muffed the execution of the order for whatever reason or however reason the kidney who knew about it and you know that that's kind of sad this Chairman I think it's it's really clear that we need to get some level of the State Department involved it may be a higher level that would actually want to show up at a hearing and see what was said and and be up to date on this stuff and and and I think to the point of of the witness today clearly the local level of governments are not going to be responsive I don't think we're going to expect to see any change of behavior on their part unless we get higher level interaction on our part and they've all mentioned the possibility of sanctions being the key and I mean this is not on the radar screen in most Americans but if you know about one of these cases and you know about the injustice of one of these cases and you think about the children of these cases it should it should shoot far up the the interest screen of any agency particularly our Department of State that I I you know I don't have an answer right now except some of the things that I've expressed that we should pursue further with our Department of State but I just want to thank you for for your interest in this as you have so many other humanitarian issues and and stood on so much principle for the betterment of mankind I am deeply grateful to you sir

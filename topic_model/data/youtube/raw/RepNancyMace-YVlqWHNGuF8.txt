i yield the remainder of my time to congresswoman mace a pioneer for women in the workforce and the first woman to graduate from the citadel the military college in charleston south carolina i yield the mismatch um thank you ranking member comer i appreciate you yielding your time and i want to thank the chairwoman maloney for convening this meeting today as someone who has broken glass ceilings and barriers all her life like many of the women on here today and watching i want to say thank you but i also don't want to have a message of doom and gloom i want to have a message of hope for every woman who's out there working or in the home today should also be a celebration for women and when we talk about equality and equal rights our constitutional rights to equality are covered and protected under the 14th amendment because if it's not then that means i have no protections today and i believe as a hard-working single mom and american that my rights are protected under their constitution today and i'm not denied those rights um i want to start off by echoing the ranking members statement two people who have the same education and perform the same job should receive the same pay regardless of their gender their race their sexual orientation or any relevant characteristics but i think it's also important to when we're talking about this issue to acknowledge the raw numbers um you know it's not just the the number that's been cited but there are other factors we're going to hear those numbers my members of the other side of the aisle probably all day to day and they will no doubt be used during the duration of the hearing but they don't give an accurate entire picture and i think it's important when we're talking about data that we look at the entire picture so the raw wage gap number is not a measure of equal pay for equal work it's a comparison of averages the often cited statistic we heard just now about 80 cents per dollar men earn does not actually compare women and men in the same profession who work the same hours with the same qualifications or experience so while we have this i believe very important conversation and supportive of that today i want to start with the data in context so once adjusted for factors such as hours worked and compensation packages family and marital status the gender wage gap i believe is significantly smaller than what we're talking about today and in most cases when you look at the data you look at contacts we're talking at context we're talking about between two and ten percent so i'm not saying there's no gender wage gap i'm not saying uh it's statistically unlikely women earn less than men i'm just saying that it's not because of widespread discrimination there there's always been discrimination and we may never be able to resolve it a hundred percent um at all and i've been in a male-dominated industry my entire life and and i've seen that discrimination in every every industry that i've been in um but thanks to existing legislation that we have uh in 1990 1963 the equal pay act and in 1964 the civil rights act wage discrimination is illegal and should be adjudicated and can be adjudicated and held accountable bad actors can be in the civil uh justice system in order to get a clearer picture i want to brief look at the data and starting with hours worked in 2019 the department of labor's time use survey found the average full-time working man spends 8.32 hours a day on the job compared to 7.73 hours for the full-time working woman so let's be clear this is not a reflection of effort it's women on average spend more time doing other unpaid work there's been a survey that was done in 2019 that 22 percent of men say they do household work compared to almost half of women so don't get me started on that conversation either but um but it's there are big differences significant statistically significant differences but hours work isn't the only factor to consider here the data show that women in general they're willing to trade higher pay for more flexibility whereas the data shows that men are willing to trade flexibility for higher pay and you know children also play a role in all of this um and so these are important factors when we're having this conversation and not too long ago we as women we didn't have the ability to make decisions about our professional careers our personal lives where we went to school all of these have been achievements and successes that we've had and i want us to celebrate those um as the ranking member comer said earlier prior to the pandemic women were joining the workforce at a faster pace than men women outnumbered men in earning college degrees but in the last year we've seen because of schools closures that we've had over three million women leave the workplace and this has been devastating to the progress we've made to women going into work um and having careers um i cannot cannot express how devastating we've set ourselves ourselves back decades because of covenanting in school closures but we must continue to work for equal opportunity and individual flexibility rather than simply equal pay there are other factors these two are not mutually exclusive and i want to thank the ranking member for yielding his time i yield back

why is china targeting for a takeover one of the most iconic names in american financial media and why is biden's treasury department just letting it happen now last august forbes came to a business cooperation agreement to be acquired by a chinese company called magnum opus in february 2021 magnum opus was formed and on march 25th it received its initial seed money from the china investment corporation that's an official financial arm of the chinese government well two days after receiving its money from cic magnum opus met with forbes representatives now if that wasn't bad enough the sec proxy statement on magnum opus states prc governmental authorities may seek to intervene or influence such companies operations at any time that the government deems appropriate to further its regulatory political and societal goals here now is congress congressman who blew the whistle on all this florida rep michael waltz congressman this is i'd like to say this is shocking to me but given how much land china is allowed to buy in the united states food companies they've bought in the united states why isn't anyone in the biden administration even slightly expressing concern over any of this well laura as you know the chinese communist party seeks to replace the united states as a global leader but they're doing it by compromising every aspect of american society they've done it with wall street with hollywood with the sports industry with our politics with academia and now they're going after uh now they're going after media and they're doing it through acquisition and the thing is the treasury department has the power to stop it and so the the explanation i'm demanding is either is one are you investigating it under cifius the committee for foreign investment in the u.s to protect our critical infrastructure like telecommunications and media or secretary yellen of the treasury department are you not investigating it and why well at this point it's going to be either capitalism congressman or the chinese way of doing business which is filled with controls demands for certain speech to block certain speech and it's it's not like their goal is to let the united states continue to go along its merry way and have a strong economy again and do all the things we did under trump that's not what they want they want to sow doubt in the capitalist system that's what the goal is forbes would be a great way to do that no that's absolutely right and they have what laura what's called elite capture we've seen that in spades with hunter biden the son of the vice president where they seek to compromise and then influence and use influencers or people in powerful positions but the other piece of it is they seek to control platforms that reach the american people and forbes reaches millions uh and is seen as an icon of capitalism and so then they will have a platform and they actually actually say it and their sec documents that will soft pedal their human rights abuses soft pedal their military build up soft pedal the fact that they're buying up things like both sides of the panama canal and entire electric grids and countries through their debt diplomacy and then trash the united states as in president xi's own words he seeks again to replace the american dream with the china dream and supplant the united states and they're going to do it through propaganda and they're going to do it through using our greed against us and laura i am sick and tired of these corporations selling out lecturing us about social justice and then selling out and that next hypersonic missile that's going after an american aircraft carrier it should say provided and bought by larry fink of blackrock and wall street and all of them and we have got to stand up and call it out and enough is enough you bet and speaking of blackrock um apparently although some financial institutions are are being spooked congressmen by these lockdowns they're shocked that you have a month-long lockdown in shanghai of 26 million people shocking to them but reuters is reporting that nevertheless goldman sachs is looking to add close to 10 jobs in shanghai they're building out their operation blackrock's adding around 20 to its headcount already there and the industry's growth moves resulted uh many bankers traders fund managers at the same time are moving from hong kong to other sen centers to shanghai but those dreams now appear to be in peril as some of these other companies are picking up and moving over to hong kong where there's no freedom as well um yeah but you would think that goldman and blackrock at some point would put their money where their mouth is this is what happens when you make a deal with dictatorships and a deal with the devil how about we defund dictatorships uh and how about a little bit of corporate patriotism uh at the at the end of the day but they so what they reap on this one laura congressman thank you we'll be continuing to follow it

  THESE THREE GUYS SAYING THEY  WANT TO KNOW IF THEY SPOKE TO  SPEAKERS AND ORGANIZERS AT THE  PRO-TRUMP RALLY BEFORE THE RIOT. LET'S BRING IN REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER FROM  THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND A  MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JANUARY 6th  COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. BASED ON THOSE THREE SUBPOENAS,  THOSE ARE DON JR.'S BOYS. DOES THAT MEAN THE NEXT PEOPLE  YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING TO  SUBPOENA ARE DON JR. AND KIM  GUILFOYLE? >> WELL, OBVIOUSLY I DON'T WANT  TO REVEAL THE NEXT STEPS. IT FLEXES EVERY DAY IN TERMS OF  IF WE LEARN NEW INFORMATION,  WHERE DOES OUR FOCUS GO, HOW DO  WE BUILD THAT CASE? BUT I MEAN CERTAINLY I THINK  THERE'S NO DOUBT LOOKING AT THE  ROLE THAT KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE  PLAYED, THAT DON JR. PLAYED, IT  WOULD BE OBVIOUS WE WOULD NEED  SOME INFORMATION FROM THEM OR  PEOPLE THAT WOULD KNOW THINGS  ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE DOING. WE ALL SAW THE SELFIE VIDEO OF  THEM DANCING AND LAUGHING AFTER  THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. WE JUST -- ALL WE WANT IS  ANSWERS. IT'S NOT LIKE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ANYTHING NEFARIOUS HERE BESIDES  LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE TRUTH  IS, AND WE WILL. I'M CONVINCED THAT THE JANUARY  6th COMMITTEE WILL GET THE  TRUTH. NOW, THE QUESTION IS WILL PEOPLE WANT TO ACCEPT THE TRUTH OR  CONSPIRACY, AND THAT'S A WHOLE  OTHER ISSUE.  >> BUT THAT IS THE ISSUE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANY  ANSWERS UNLESS THESE PEOPLE FACE CONSEQUENCES. JUST HAVING TO TESTIFY, IT'S  JUST A SHOW, AND THEY DON'T  CARE.  >> WELL, I MEAN, LOOK, AS FAR AS ANY CONSEQUENCES, THAT REALLY IS UP TO DOJ. WE CAN BRING PEOPLE IN TO  TESTIFY AND PRODUCE EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION AND REFER THAT TO  THE DOJ. I CERTAINLY THINK WE INTEND TO  DO THAT. WHAT IS THE ROCK THAT LED UP TO  JANUARY 6th, AND WHAT'S BEEN  HAPPENING SINCE. SHOW THAT TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE. EVEN IF THE WHATEVER, 30% OR  WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS OF PEOPLE THAT THINK JANUARY 6th WAS  LEGIT, THEIR KIDS WON'T, AND  WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THEY  GET THE RIGHT ANSWER. THEY GET THE RIGHT NARRATIVE TO  ALL OF THIS. AND WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN  TO GET THERE. IT WILL BE UP TO THE DOJ ON WHAT THEY WANT TO PROSECUTE OR WHAT  THEY DON'T.  >> MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY HEAR  THEY COULD GET SUBPOENAED,  THAT'S REALLY SCARY, YET JIM  JORDAN AND SCOTT PERRY SAY  THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COOPERATE  WITH YOUR COMMITTEE. IF YOU WERE TO SUBPOENA THEM,  THEN WHAT? WHAT WOULD BE THE ACTUAL COURSE  OF ACTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T  SEEM SCARED. >> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S  INFORMATION I DON'T FULLY KNOW. THERE'S UNIQUENESS WHEN MEMBERS  OF CONGRESS ARE SUBPOENAED BY A  CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE. I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEFORE IN MY  CAREER. I THINK IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF  CONGRESS AND HAVE INFORMATION,  FIRST OFF, YOU SHOULD BE IN  FRONT OF US VOLUNTARILY. THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S INQUIRY, IF YOU DON'T DO THAT, IF WE HAVE TO SUBPOENA YOU, WE'LL DO THAT. ULTIMATELY THE INTERESTING THING WITH PEOPLE LIKE JIM JORDAN IS  THE HOUSE HAS WAYS TO COMPEL  TESTIMONY OR TO BE ABLE TO  PUNISH IN A WAY THAT WE CAN'T  WITH ANYBODY ELSE. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY WE CAN REFER SOMEBODY TO DOJ FOR CONTEMPT  WHEN IT COMES TO SOMEBODY LIKE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS. THERE'S THINGS ON COMMITTEE. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY VARIOUS I  GUESS PERKS, THAT CAN BE USED. I'M NOT SAYING WE'RE GOING TO  USE THAT. I'M SAYING THOSE ARE QUILLS WE  CAN USE IF WE NEED TO.  >> CAN I ASK WHAT THIS IS LIKE  FOR YOU. YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN. YOU'RE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS. I'M GUESSING JIM JORDAN NOT LONG AGO, I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS YOUR FRIEND, BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY  YOUR COLLEAGUE. WHAT IS IT LIKE FOR YOU TO BE A  REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS  RIGHT NOW? WHO DO YOU EAT LUNCH WITH? >> IT'S DISAPPOINTING. I THINK WHAT'S THE MOST  DISAPPOINTING FOR ME IS I  THOUGHT THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT  HAD RED LINES THAT, YOU KNOW,  TRUTH TO SOME LEVEL ACTUALLY  MATTERED. WHEN I SEE SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW,  REFUSING TO COOPERATE IN FRONT  OF THE COMMITTEE. IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE. WHEN I SEE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,  WHEN I SEE TED CRUZ, YOU KNOW,  PUSHING THIS IDEA OF THE RAY  EPPS CONSPIRACY, WHICH BY THE  WAY HAS BEEN A CONSPIRACY ALMOST TAKEN AS GOSPEL FOR ABOUT TWO OR THREE MONTHS THAT SOMEHOW RAY  EPPS WAS AN FBI AGENT AND  SOMEHOW EVERYBODY IS SO DUMB  WHICH EVEN IF HE WAS AN FBI  AGENT, WHICH HE WASN'T, THAT  THAT ONE FBI AGENT INCITED  EVERYBODY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE  TEAR UP THE CAPITOL. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR OWN  BASE AND VOTERS IF YOU THINK  THEY'RE THAT GULLIBLE. WHAT HAPPENS IS THE REACTION IS  ALWAYS SOME CIRCULAR ARGUMENT TO COME BACK AND POINT OUT  SOMETHING DIFFERENT. PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT WHATEVER  REALITY FEELS GOOD TO THEM. ALL I CAN DO IS TELL TRUTH. ULTIMATELY, THESE PEOPLE PUSHING THESE LIES AND CONSPIRACIES,  J.D. VANCE THIS MORNING IS  PUSHING THIS RAY EPPS IDEA. THEY WILL PAY FOR THAT SOMEDAY. THEY WILL PAY FOR THAT BECAUSE  THE TRUTH ALWAYS PREVAILS.  >> I KNOW YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM  FORMER VICE PRESIDENT MIKE  PENCE. HAVE YOU REACHED OUT TO HIM  PERSONALLY? YOU AND LIZ CHENEY HAVE THE BEST CHANCE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.  >> I HAVEN'T. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR LIZ, I HAVE NO REQUESTED IF SHE HAS OR HASN'T. FOR ME I'M ALWAYS CAREFUL. I WANT TO GO THROUGH THE  COMMITTEE PROCESS ON THIS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT  MAINTAINS THAT WAY. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE VICE  PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY TESTIFY EVEN IF IT'S JUST WRITTEN ANSWERS TO  QUESTIONS. I RECOGNIZE HE PLAYED AN  IMPORTANT ROLE THAT DAY. REGARDLESS OF YOUR FEELINGS OF  THE VICE PRESIDENT, HE CERTAINLY COULD HAVE MADE THIS SITUATION  WAY WORSE. HE CAN COME IN AND ACTUALLY  ADJUDICATE HIS ROLE IN HISTORY  VERY WELL. WE'LL GET THE INFORMATION I  NEED. I'M VERY CONFIDENT OF THAT.  >> REPUBLICAN SENATOR MIKE  ROUNDS, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN  THINKING ABOUT IT, TALKING ABOUT IT THIS WEEK, HE TOLD THE TRUTH. HE SAID THAT THE 2020 ELECTION  WAS FAIR AND THAT PRESIDENT  BIDEN WON. HE TOLD A FACT. YET TRUMP ATTACKED HIM AND  ATTACKED HIM. WATCH THIS. >> I THINK AS REPUBLICANS WE OWE IT TO TELL THE TRUTH, AND I  THINK INTEGRITY MATTERS. AND SO, IN MY OPINION, IF WE  WANT TO KEEP THE CONFIDENCE OF  OUR SUPPORTERS AND OUR VOTERS,  THEN WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH  THEM. >> CONGRESSMAN, YOU AND SENATOR  ROUNDS ARE PART OF ONLY A  HANDFUL OF REPUBLICANS WELCOME   -- WILLING TO TELL THE TRUTH. TRUMP IS STILL PUSHING THE BIG  LIE. YOU SEE MORE AND MORE  REPUBLICANS EITHER PUSHING IT OR STAYING SILENT ABOUT IT. HOW FRUSTRATING IS THIS TO YOU  TO REALIZE THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THE TRUTH IN THE GOP ANYMORE? >> IT'S FRUSTRATING. IT'S ANGERING. YOU KNOW, SENATOR ROUND SAID THE RIGHT THING, AND I GET IT. I MEAN, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS  LOOK AT TWITTER AND SEE PEOPLE,  OH, NOBODY SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR DOING THE BASIC MINIMUM, THE  RIGHT THING. I TYPICALLY AGREE WITH THAT, BUT IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT WHAT SENATOR ROUNDS WAS ACTUALLY,  UNFORTUNATELY BRAVE, AND HE  SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THAT. THAT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT CAN  SPREAD. BUT YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S THE  MOMENT WE'RE IN. PEOPLE -- EVERY, YOU KNOW,  MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND SENATOR,  I THINK IF YOU PUT THEM ON THAT  CIA JUICE, RIGHT? LIKE THE TRUTH SERUM. THEY'RE GOING TO TELL YOU THEY  KNOW JOE BIDEN WON, BUT THEY'RE  SCARED TO DEATH. THEY'RE SCARED OF THINKER OWN  VOTERS TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH. WHAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP IS THAT? WHAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP IS THAT? THAT'S NOT LEADERSHIP AT ALL. THAT'S FEAR. THAT'S THE SPIRIT OF FEAR  PERMEATING YOUR SOUL. THAT IS NOT LEADING.  >> YES, WE SAW TED CRUZ TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT JANUARY 6th AND THEN GET SPANKED BY TUCKER CARLSON,  AND HE CRAWLED BACK. AND LASTLY, I JUST WANT TO ASK  YOU THEN, IS THERE A PLACE FOR  YOU IN THE GOP RIGHT NOW? >> YOU KNOW, DO I FEEL LIKE IT,  NOT REALLY. I MEAN, I'M GOING TO MAINTAIN MY REPUBLICAN IDENTITY. I'M A REPUBLICAN. I'VE BEEN ONE SINCE I WAS 6, AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR THE SOUL  OF THE PARTY, BUT YEAH, I'M NOT  GOING TO SIT HERE AND PRETEND  LIKE THAT IT CERTAINLY FEELS  LIKE I'M A MEMBER OF THE  REPUBLICAN FAMILY. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SILENT THAT I THINK AGREE WITH  ME. WE JUST NEED PEOPLE TO SPEAK  OUT. SILENCE IS COMPLICIT, AND  SILENCE WILL ALLOW THE  CONSPIRACY TO INFECT THIS PARTY  IN A WAY WAY WORSE THAN WE'VE  SEEN NOW.  >> THE FACT THAT YOU WERE A  REPUBLICAN SINCE YOU WERE 6  YEARS OLD, MEANS THERE'S A

well thank you all so much for joining us today i'm mike johnson i'm the vice chairman of the house republican conference and i'll kick things off uh it's crystal clear at this point um the biden white house is uh maybe distracted maybe they're misguided but they remain focused on the wrong things they're they're trying to control the narrative instead of solving problems and the american people have had just about enough of it of course this week they're at it again this time the spin is already starting about ahead of tomorrow's gdp numbers for the second quarter we all expect we know what's going to happen it's going to be another disastrous disastrous economic report and the ongoing series of disastrous economic reports that have happened under this administration of course many expect that the update tomorrow will confirm what we seem to feel and know intuitively that we've officially entered a recession and instead of working to keep our economy out of recession the white house is busying itself trying to redefine what that term means of course we know what recession means it's no less ambiguous than what a man and a woman is but again they're spinning it regardless of all that we know the economy is clearly contracting we feel that acutely american families everywhere are seeing it and and feeling it for themselves we've done town halls in our district over the last several weeks as we've been back and forth from washington and uh that's the the feeling that's a complaint of people all across this country in the face of the looming economic recession and the crushing inflation what are the democrats on this this side of pennsylvania avenue focused on well they're taking guns from law abiding citizens they're dishing out more corporate welfare and yet another tax and spend reconciliation bill the democrat agenda alternates between attempts to distract the american people at best and out outright misguided policy at worst so we're here today to say that this election will be about three things and this is what i derive from my town halls what we call the three eyes it's inflation immigration and incompetence soaring inflation uninhibited illegal immigration that is a serious threat to the country and staggering incompetence on every level there was a cnn story last week that caught my eye it was entitled vulnerable democrats sound the alarm over inflation crisis well it's a little late for that we really wish that um they had thought about that before they voted to pass 5.4 trillion dollars in new partisan spending last year and now that the bill is coming due for all of that those vulnerable democrats are hoping the american people will just forget their vote but we don't intend to let that happen house republicans are so looking forward to the upcoming august recess our district work period we're going to go out there and take our vision for a new direction for the country directly to the american people and we met and talked about that as a big group this morning i thank everybody for being here today and i want to yield first and my dear friend representative carol miller from the great state of west virginia

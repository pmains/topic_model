we're really very energized today we're very strong this is about the happiest i've seen members in a long time because we see that we're starting to win this dialogue on a national level it's wonderful said republican congressman john culberson clapping his hands to emphasize the point we're a hundred percent united i think that you may see uh a partial shutdown for several days but steve people are probably going to realize they can live with a lot less government than what they thought they needed on day four of the government shutdown the impact is growing even more apparent states could run out of money for a special food program for women infants and children by the end of the month and for others waiting for drug trials the shutdown is literally a matter of life and death the national institutes of health announced that they can't take 200 clinical patients include including 30 kids with cancer because because of the shutdown i mean those stories aren't insignificant those stories are significant if you weren't angry before about the government shutdown you're about to be very angry because a group of vets that came to the world war ii memorial yesterday had to break down a barricade in order to actually visit the memorial to them now that we have made the jump set ourselves on fire and made the jump uh we have to we are now in the valley of death we decided to go into the valley we have to run together we have to stay together we're not going to be disrespected and so that's where we're at today where we have to get something out of this and i don't know what that even is what do republicans want to get out of this shutdown i honestly don't know what they want they started off by saying they wanted to defund obamacare now they realize that can't be done i'm not trying to be rude but they're acting like five-year-olds because i'm thinking that adults would be able to come to an agreement like that but i don't think it should be this hard they either pass it or not

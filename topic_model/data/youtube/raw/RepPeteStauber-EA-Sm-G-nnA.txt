Thank You mr. chair and the ranking member graves I graduated in 1984 and one of my bucket list was to become a private pilot I can share with you that I'm in 43 hours of the cirrus sr20 and sr22 this congressional run and my current occupation here serving the public has stalled my training but I can say the last the last flight my instructor says you're ready for solo I'm not there yet so I've got been interrupted I will also share with you you talk about the pilot shortage and what have you my senior one of my boys is a senior in high school and on March 22nd we will be going to the aviation Career Expo at Lake spear College in Duluth Minnesota a very well-respected college that teaches pilots to fly in and gets them interested in the aviation culture you know something that I that I really want to detail as an Odom system and this is for Captain to Pete primarily we know that in 2017 in San Francisco the Air Canada bus nearly landed on a crowded taxiway and they they mistook it for a cleared runway information about that runway closure could that could have been could have been prevented and the information was located on page eight of the 27 page list of the San Francisco Airport in Odom's this also freaked the no times also are frequently a state there's birds in the area what happened we don't know what type of birds if they're on the runway in the air or nearby so captain to Pete can you please discuss some of the issues with the current state of the NOTAM systems and the concerns you have yes sir and thank you for that question I share those same concerns for many many years during my 40 years of flying I haven't seen very many improvements in fact I was really delighted when I heard the chairman of the NTSB mentioned mentioned the problem I've seen and heard of various efforts underway to streamline it we've not in my airline the technology is such that I can use an iPad that'll actually decipher that but it's still buried there's still too many you think about the expectation you're showing up for flight maybe an hour before and especially if you're flying international and you're literally presented with a paper stack about that talk about that thick and you have to weed through that to see if what is relevant and what isn't and it's almost I mean you really have to you'd have to show up we and we do we we do whatever it takes to to make it safe but I share your concern with that and we're actively working to try to fix that we've got folks that are working in you are Eric we have the largest non-governmental safety organization in the world and we're working with the FAA to just somehow fix that but again you know this really comes down to the funding issue again you know the FAA taxing it is so much coming at them from so many different angles you know between us and and commercial space and we're all a part of that effort but a steady reliable source of funding would be a step in the right direction so thank you for the question I thank you captain for that that answer and as ranking member graves talks about aviation is an extremely safe way to travel and we can we're going to make it safer and I appreciate you talking about the funding because that's why we're that's what we're meeting for today so captain to Pete I will say this that I am introducing a bill to form a task force to address these concerns with the no domes and I hope you'll take part in it and I think that's a that that's one of a number of additional safety items we can bring to the pilots and and the culture in aviation and and I hope you'll support that absolutely thank you very much mr. chairman I yield back

i'm david gray and I'm Bonnie Quinn after answering questions on the economy and monetary policy for two days fed chair Janet Yellen has wrapped up her semiannual testimony before Congress joining us now is a member of the house financial services committee congressman brad Sherman Democrat of California Carson Sherman thank you very much for being with us today I wanted to ask you about the feds dual mandate and what side of it you're most concerned with right now right now I'm most concerned about jobs and a healthy economy inflation is not the problem but every time I go home to my district you meet people who are unable to get a job that pays much more than minimum wage we need to create so many jobs that there is a labor shortage and it drives wages up the idea that people who have we have a low unemployment rate that just is masked by low labor participation rates was though how to characterize the performance of the economy the health of the economy congressman is satisfied with us we're crawling out finally of a deep canyon on our bellies at the speed at which somebody crawls we need to be we need to be robust and we need to see the Fed I was disappointed to see them increase their interest rates and hopefully they'll announce that they're not going to have or they're unlikely to have additional increases this year businesses that need to know that the economy is going to go forward and that the Fed has its foot on the accelerator well in fact they didn't increase with the most recent meeting and have been shuffling around a little bit and now they're not looking to be increased much rest of the year in fact we'll pull up work on the terminal actually tell you exactly the the next increase not even in December not even in February but Janet Yellen yesterday to the Senate said that she was disappointed that central bankers were having to shoulder most of the ways of simulating growth and that fiscal policy makers like yourself should do more what could you do what would you want to do well I'd like to see us build infrastructure in this country it's an investment in the future you hate to see us increase the debt but if you bequeath your children good harbors rail transportation good highways the fact that you're also bequeathing them a bit more debt seems to make sense he putting a lot of Americans to work if we would just build what we need to build console ensuring both of the presumptive nominees here for president have been talking about the economy yesterday and today Donald Trump speaking in New York this morning talked about trade let's hear a bit of what he had to say if she is elected president she will adopt the trans-pacific partnership and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good she'll do this and just as she has betrayed the American worker and traded every single stage of a career and it will be even worse than the Clintons NAFTA deal and I never thought it could get worse than that on the issue of trade is this something with which you agree with Donald Trump well this is a case where I agree with the Hillary Clinton who also agrees with Donald Trump and that is we should not ratify and adopt the trans-pacific partnership we need instead deals that will reduce our trade deficit and that are not especially not ones where we have a quote free trade agreement with a communist country like Vietnam where the interest rates of correction the wage and rates can be as low as 50 cents an hour there's just no way for American workers to compete and then you say we're going to sell have access to Viet Nam's free markets will lay down their freedom and they don't have markets so you don't get at access to anything at all except cheap labor which may help some profits but certainly doesn't help American I think that Hillary understands and has come out not only is she come out against TPP she's come out against considering TPP during the lame duck session which is the only device or ruse that could be used to to get Congress to pass it if we vote on it in an ordinary time we will vote it down just a quick question here about guns your colleague John Lewis on the floor of the house this morning leading a protest calling for a vote in the house is that a protest movement you intend to join I did join it just before I was on the air with no no bill no break Congress shouldn't be going home without acting on the need for common-sense gun control all right congressman Sherman thank you very much for your time today that's congressman brad Sherman Democrat of California member of the House

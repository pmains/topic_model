hello everyone I'm Lisa murkowski I'd like to welcome you to our first episode of my new series we're calling it The Icebreaker so for today's inaugural conversation I'm really pleased to be able to host Pat Pitney Pat is the president of the University of Alaska we're going to be discussing University of Alaska fiscal Foundation act this is legislation that I was really proud to lead we were able to add it to the year-end Omnibus Appropriations package but what we're going to talk about today is not only what it means for the University but really the state as a whole and we'll also be able to touch on some of the other wins that we were able to deliver for our great University of Alaska system today's podcast is as much informational really as it is a celebration so Pat Pitney who I will ask to speak in just a moment has been the president since February of 2022 she earned her MBA from University of Alaska Fairbanks there all three of her children are graduates of UA she's been with the university for 23 years so she's got a real a real tight connect and great history with our University of Alaska so Pat it is so great to to have you participate in our in our first inaugural Icebreaker conversation and be discussing the University of Alaska fiscal Foundation act so so welcome thank you and thanks so much for having me um and for your support of Alaska and the university you know we're so lucky to have you as our senior senator you you care deeply about Alaska but you absolutely understand how important higher education is to Alaska's future and its economy and uh we we couldn't be better represented than with you so and I'm honored to be here well your your words are kind um I think you and I share a common belief that if we don't vet invest in our young people um we're not investing in in our own future so we've got good things that we want to be working on together so to kind of break the ice here if you will um I'd like to ask you to share with our our viewers here something that allows them to get to know you a little bit better I know some things about you that I think are pretty cool but why don't you share perhaps some little-known uh trivia or it's not trivia I mean it's serious stuff you win in a gold medal but um you've got some other accolades to you aside from being president of the University of Alaska so I I do think I'm not the only gold medalist University president I I was so fortunate when I was younger much younger uh to uh participate in the 1984 Olympics for Team USA and and bring home a goal um it was it was a fabulous opportunity uh and that's a fun fact but I think that the most fun fact for me is uh you know now I'm a grandmother and I've got three precious grandkids two of them who live in in Alaska and uh what we're doing here today is going to be so instrumental to their their future and um that's that's my fun fact well it's a great segue into the conversation that we want to have today and this is the legislation that we were able to to pass and um uh and to advance something that we've been working on for a period of time but for our viewers and our listen listeners I really just want to ensure that all of you understand how significant this measure is what it took to bring it into law we have known about the University's land grant challenge for some time I was actually serving in the Alaska State Legislature when when it first came before us an attempt to to make good on on Alaska as a land-grant university we weren't successful at that point in time and and a couple other occasions but but really what has come about through the fiscal Foundation act what the governor and the university working together identifying this this as a plan uh we've all been working to ensure that it's a priority it's certainly been a priority of the university and and one of mine since since mid-2020 and what it does is it effectively addresses this fundamental inequity you have the fact that the University of Alaska is a land-grant school in the largest state in the country but it has one of the smallest land entitlements in the entire country at just a hundred and ten thousand acres but now thanks to the fiscal Foundation act we're going to right this wrong and and provide significant support to Alaska's Soul land Grant University so Pat this is your opportunity to really share with folks a little bit more about how this whole idea this concept came about what it's going to mean for the University and really really if you can articulate in in layman's terms what this is all going to mean for the University going forward yeah I think you covered the history pretty well I mean starting in in the 1800s the way the United States promised a better future for people it was through these land grants and and there was an intent as Alaska became a state for the University to have this land grant and it just for a variety of reasons it never came true when the state tried to pass it as you mentioned that you you were one of the votes for it and I think I think ultimately uh Frank murkowski signed the signed the state Bill there were some legal challenges against that and we knew we needed a federal solution so this this is our this is the federal path to that and um and so what it allows is is uh to rectify that that land grant I mean with more than two times our current level of land and um it ensures that the universe that they can build a revenue Source it's not it's not a full Revenue Source but what I would call a Tipping Point Revenue source for us to invest in excellence um going forward and I think this uh this solution is the first step in in gaining that land you know we um we've said that this was a a big priority it was not just my priority it was it was we were joined by uh Senator Sullivan and of course our late Congressman Don young um but we really heard the the direct call from the University of Alaska about how important it was to to expand uh the University of Alaska's land grant and to create new paths for for Revenue generation and so to kind of lay out a little bit more about what will happen the university and and the state have the opportunity to now jointly identify up to 50 000 Federal acres in the state for potential conveyance and then what will happen is the Department of interior specifically BLM is going to survey these selections they'll work with the university and the state to transfer up to 360 000 Acres so that's the entitlement but the whole process of selection it's it's easy to to put it down in words it's much harder to actually make this all happen I think it is important to note that this is all voluntary but it will help make up for the University's lacking Grant which again is about just a little over 150 000 Acres so to put this into perspective we have a university that is land-grant University in the largest state in the country but currently has a smaller federal land grant than the state of Rhode Island which is of course the smallest state so kind of put it in context there it will take some time I think we recognize to to realize the benefits of this new legislation but passage was was obviously key so if you can describe what what Alaskan students particularly but what Alaska can anticipate or expect what this fiscal Foundation act will mean for campus infrastructure how you mentioned it will bring a source of of Revenue that can be helpful if you can just describe how you anticipate what this will mean for the University system right so you're absolutely right it's going to take years and it's going to bring a level of stable Revenue over time um and um right now we use that the revenue for the UA Scholars Program it's one of the biggest things we do and that's that provides a 12 000 scholarship for students in their top in the top 10 percent across the state this is this is supported over 9 200 students awesome investing in our own yeah investing in our building our Future Leaders three thousand of those reported that their first time college students and their family and that brings social Mobility you know we know uh somebody with a bachelor's degree earns more than twice uh what somebody with uh just a higher education earns or just just a high school education earns but it's also Tipping Point for research Investments uh recent investment we did was we have now a joint Masterson Fisheries public policy between University Alaska Fairbanks and University of Alaska Southeast and we know as the Arctic opens our Fisheries policy is even more critical and uh that uh that joint degree program was started by the the earnings we currently have from our natural resource sources fund so literally we're going to go from 150 000 acres of land grant two close to 500 when we add the 360 000 on or a little over 500 000 Acres it takes time for us to monetize uh that property but it is uh absolutely critical uh to have this as the first step so that we can get to the land being transferred into the University's hands then we can monetize it and so um I'm just I think it's such an investment in Alaska and Alaska's future uh both from an economic standpoint a Workforce standpoint and um and research that'll bring add to Economic Development yeah so the potential for so much good for the University and and again a reminder of of all the good that comes from the Alaska Scholars Program and and being able to to benefit more more Alaskan students you know this was this was an effort that I think we all came together to try to advance but your support and and advocacy for the university for it for so for so many decades just know how much it is appreciated deeply appreciated um with all that you're doing um I I think about the different ways where expanding the the land grant will allow additional support for things like campus facilities for infrastructure for research you mentioned the Fisheries so all good things so now that we've passed the bill and um and again are acknowledging this is going to take a little bit of time to put into place over these next years will alaskans be seeing anything different immediately or uh um what do you what do you anticipate because we see the news everyone gets excited and thinks all right now I'm going to get a new um uh a new facility on on campus here um that's probably not the case but we will be able to talk about that with our next conversation when we're talking about the cds's but for purposes of of the land uh Grant Foundation I think for right now it's fair to say the pieces are being put in place right the ball is rolling or we we have the opportunity for the ball to roll we we've done a lot of preparation in anticipation of uh getting this legislation and uh so we've been working with Department of Natural Resources now for over a year on setting up the process because the process is that the uh the state and the university agree on which which land they're willing um to allow us to to have transferred directly to the University versus going to the state and so it's it's a a portion of the overall state land grant that has not yet been conveyed by the federal government we are very fortunate we have supporter of the governor and the legislature Alaskan native corporations and uh and of course our our board and so we have uh already put uh several uh tranches of land selections uh sent that over to Department of Natural Resources and when I came back after the new year one of my first meetings was with our new commissioner John Boyle uh to you know make sure we're we're on the on the same side and and understand you know letting him know uh the the opportunity that we uh we just we have together to do this uh that meeting went very well the uh the way we will generate Revenue so that the process we have to get agreement from Department of Natural Resources then it goes to BLM to actually do the surveying and conveyance to the university uh when the land comes back I mean we anticipate uh earning revenue from subdivision development uh other real estate development mining uh gravel sales I think in in the carbon space we're investigating the carbon space with some of the current land we have now and uh and then Partnerships you know where we have adjacent land with a particular entity we might look at what our partnership opportunities are what our direct development opportunities are on particular property that that's beneficial and so but we have the we have the DNR step we have the BLM step then we have the monetizing step you know again we're going from 150 000 to over 500 000 Acres so trip triple the the amount of funding right now we're getting about seven million dollars annually and so how the land grant works as it all goes into an endowment and then we receive you know a roughly a five percent draw annually to spend and so you know again because it's quote in the endowment and we're drawing essentially from a Permanent Fund uh so this so it's available to Future Generations and that also further uh kind of constraints so if you sell a piece of property for let's say two hundred thousand dollars you're over time you're getting five percent of that 200 000 because the the law is to preserve it for a few you know future Generations as well so but all of this is going to be that Tipping Point Revenue whether it's for a Scholars Program whether it's for research whether it's for facility advancement as you'd mentioned technology advancements all of it can be then invested into those tipping points alongside you know continued State investment in the University well we we think about those Investments those long-term investments in our state um in our infrastructure in in alaskans themselves and so finally being able to make good on this promise as a land-grant university to actually get the land to a land-grant university it certainly feels pretty good from where I'm sitting and and and knowing your your deep deep connection and Leadership at the University I I know that it feels pretty good from where you are and what that future then looks like it was a great win thank you so much we we we're in this together Pat but um in the in the minutes that we have remaining um I'd like you to just touch on on some of the other good news that the university received in the Omnibus Bill and this is what we were able to advance through what we call congressionally directed spending as excuse me as as a member of the Appropriations Committee we did pretty well 14 million dollars talk about those uh absolutely spectacular again couldn't do it without your leadership and your seniority on on the Appropriations uh you know we seek funding for Workforce Development and economic development for the state of Alaska sorry sorry about your coughing like I'm feeling like I can feel your pain all the way over here but uh the university uh really is uh pleased that you know we had funding to renovate a facility in kotsaview uh the Chuck T campus again focusing on uh Workforce and and supporting the Workforce Development in that region uh a very very important was um for Workforce Development is simulation capacity to train more nurses you know one of the biggest constraints on on our nursing enrollment is having a clinical space uh these simulation Labs speed that that clinical um time because we can do it in the lab versus having to do it in the hospital and uh that helps hospitals as well uh having that simulation space so that funding there you know another area was um the uh CDL licensing and that's the University of Alaska Southeast and you know I think it's really important to know we have you know three just amazing universities with the University of Alaska Fairbanks University Alaska Anchorage University of Alaska Southeast they do different things and although we're the university system it's kind of the umbrella of the whole and all of all of what we're doing is supporting all three that uh that's that Federal support often gets something up and off the ground uh they then become sustainable in the long term and I wanted to point out another project which was uh in our International Arctic Research Center they do um very um precise and publicly available seasonal forecasting that's used by communities it's used by the military um but and it's so important after you know the recent hurricane Marbach I guess it was tight film got the wrong one but your support of those is super this is so appreciated the um but the the other appropriation increases for things like drone research drone um systems development and suicide prevention cannot be understated or what a difference that that's going to make for Alaska well thank you for for detailing some of those well I took a little break to clear my throat sorry we we're both uh we're 4 000 miles apart but we're simpatico here um it really was important to be to be sitting with folks from the University and understanding how as Federal Partners we can be really working to not only help facilitate the research whether it's in the Fisheries or what we can do for Workforce Development everything from a CDL program to nursing so we're really hopeful that these that these investments in our federal dollars in response to declaring significant needs that are going to benefit alaskans all over the state from the Chuck Chi campus all the way down to Southeast these These are significant so so thank you for that but thank you thank you for for your leadership at the University thank you for for all you do to make our estate a better place and and young alaskans better people and those who come to our state so I appreciate the fact that you've you've led the inaugural uh Icebreaker session and now I'm gonna now I'm gonna offer you another challenge um we're we're kind of doing a murkowski minute which is a wrap-up of what we've just done so my challenge to you is articulate in a minute the benefits of of what what we've been able to do with the fiscal Foundation act and what it means for the University of Alaska well well first I'm going to take a little bit of Liberty and and say thank you on the uh the Icebreaker You Know Arctic Arctic is a common passion of of ours and uh and I love the I love the Icebreaker approach uh to your to your session um and uh the uh the most important message about what we discussed today is an investment in Alaska and Alaska's future the physical Foundation act helps us make higher education more accessible to alaskans everywhere that means alaskans create get more opportunity by giving the university the land that was promised when we we have a stable environment from which we can build from the federal Appropriations you've secured allows us to meet the workforce and economic needs of communities across Alaska and that's one thing about the University of Alaska's system we're not in one place we're in communities across the state because higher education is so critical to every economy in the state and it also means the university is empowering alaskans to build a strong sustainable future educating the next generation of Alaska leaders so they can do what we're doing today so it means a lot it's a big deal and thank you it is a big deal we're investing in alaskans we're investing in our strong sustainable future well said and again thank you for for your leadership your advocacy making a difference across our state and thanks for being part of our inaugural program so thanks so much and to those of those who've joined us thank you

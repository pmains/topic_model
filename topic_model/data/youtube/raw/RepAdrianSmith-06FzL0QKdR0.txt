Mr Speaker I rise today to defend the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Nebraskans in Nebraska the need for firearms is the same today as it was even when the Second Amendment was enacted before we were even a territory of the United States rural Nebraskans depend on their firearms for self-defense and for protecting their livestock they also know how to handle firearms to store them securely to handle them appropriately and perhaps to even let neighbors who are able to use them safely borrow them to meet their needs I have serious concerns the bills we are considering today and tomorrow are going to criminalize this behavior for Nebraskans who have done this for generations and won't even know that are breaking the law should a rancher who lends a rifle to a neighbor to address threats from predatory animals face a year in prison and a $100,000 fine no-showed a legally caring farmer who is injured at work be subject to arrest for handling for handing his firearm off before being taken to the hospital no these are exactly the situations this bill would create while doing little to address the real problems underlying crime in our society this is a bad bill and I urge its swift rejection I yield back

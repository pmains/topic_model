also on capitol hill some progress today on an infrastructure bill republican and democratic negotiators in the senate say they have an agreement joining us now is california congresswoman karen bass of los angeles i watched you just a couple of minutes ago during that story about uh pelosi versus mccarthy and at the mention of the word i couldn't help but notice you chuckled a little bit reflective perhaps of the rancor that exists between the two parties in the house there's been talk now that we've we're very close to this infrastructure package but pelosi at this point not committing that it's gonna definitely pass the house the one that that they've come up with and dealt with in the senate do you are you hopeful that that you're gonna have a bill well i'm very hopeful that we will have a bill but let me just say that one of the reasons why she's saying that is because we don't know what exactly is in the senate bill and we know one of the earlier discussions was really eliminating or reducing money for public transportation so in part we need to know what it is that is in their bill but uh also you know pelosi and the house democrats very much want to see a human infrastructure bill that would be passed through reconciliation and that would provide for child care and education a lot of things that people need in communities and to not just view infrastructure as roads and bridges another very important piece of legislation is the justice and policing act of the bill that you introduce the sujord floyd george floyd justice and policing act and it's passed the house still not voted on in the senate where is it does it stand right now and what are your your thoughts on whether that's going anywhere well i certainly hope it is going somewhere i was over in the senate today meeting with senator booker i'll be back tomorrow meeting with senator scott and so we are continuing our conversations and we certainly hope that the senate will be able to get something across the finish line as you mentioned we did our work in the house we passed the bill in march the senate will be in session next week so we can keep hope alive for a couple more weeks but you know oftentimes mark and you know this when it seems as though things are done nothing is going to happen at the last minute suddenly a compromise appears so i am have my fingers crossed that were at that moment now all right and speaking of moments a very powerful moment yesterday in the uh on capitol hill the january 6 commission hearing yesterday those police officers testifying about what they endured what are your thoughts after your what you saw yesterday we presume you you you witnessed at least part of it and uh do you expect that commission to use its subpoena power for reluctant witnesses who might include your own colleagues in the house absolutely absolutely while the investigation goes on and you know the fbi continues to investigate and i will not be shocked if members of the house uh are investigated by the fbi maybe even indicted i'm sure this the committee will uh subpoena various people especially those individuals in the republican caucus who were speaking to the former president on january 6 trying to get him to intervene now mind you some of their offices were broken into uh as well and they tried to get him to call off his supporters but let me just also mention this is the party that talks about blue lives matter this is the party that talks about democrats want to defund the police and here they are defending people who physically attacked police and threatened to kill the former vice president all right representative karen bass we look forward to speaking with you again on this and many other subjects thank you again for joining us thank you and stay

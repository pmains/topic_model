all right congressman mike walsh republican from the state of florida joins me now congressman let's get uh a little testy here former president trump did well in the primaries people like his policies but in my opinion they don't like his behavior after the election what's your response to that congressman that's a tricky subject i know it yeah sure no look i think the american people are ready to look forward uh they want to get out of this absolute uh in terms of inflation crime border and a mess overseas and and i think that's what the president should be talking about his vision to dig this country out of the hole and get us back to where we were pre-pandemic which was a roaring economy in middle east peace and strength abroad and i think that's what the president should be focused on i think that's what the american people are looking for and when we have candidates that talk about an america first agenda that gets us out of this progressive left mess they win don't look back look forward is your message i think okay i want to get back to this dreadful tragedy in texas uh the 51 migrants found dead in these in the truck in san antonio three people are in custody there now the president of mexico ripped to the quote lack of control at his country's borders with the u.s and karen jean-pierre says the border is closed congressman this is a real mess is there any change that's going to come out of this dreadful tragedy well that's a bit rich from the mexican government and from biden's uh press spokeswoman the fact is the cartels control the u.s border and the mexican side of the border and they're increasingly operating on our side so as you know i've called for military action against these cartels that are armed to the teeth that are taking on the mexican army they're making tens of millions of dollars a week on human smuggling uh including this absolute tragedy and they're pumping fentanyl chinese made fentanyl [Music] killing our people and destabilizing uh a number of states and inner cities so this is uh this is an absolute dereliction of duty on biden's part on majorcase's part uh and they should be they should be ashamed of themselves and they should be ashamed of themselves for lying to the american people uh not only the deaths from fentanyl the deaths from human migration and smuggling the sexual assaults that are happening uh to young girls uh the people that are coming from over a hundred countries including now some from afghanistan taliban controlled afghanistan this is an absolute crisis uh and enough is enough and we're seeing in polling stew the american people have had it as well it's right up there with the economy in terms of what they care about what they're upset about if the republicans take control of the house and or the senate in november somebody's going to be held accountable for this congressman thanks very much for joining us this morning we'll see you again later now if you've been watching the show you may have seen

mr. has Anka five minutes thank you madam chair and frankly I hope there's another 14 hearings because this is one of the most expansive steps that government has taken and I'm sorry my mic my colleague is is leaving it just seems to me i'm not quite sure how i understand whether the CFPB is a five-member board versus a single individual how exactly that is going to ensure the president's reelection or non reelection so i think that we're seeing obviously some heated rhetoric and and and i've seen seen some positive elements on my bill bill specifically HR 3871 we've had everybody credit union Association National Association the consumer Bankers Association just recently both put letters in appreciate your support the resounding endorsement a professor or will Marth I think that one sentence I don't oppose I'll take that as well and and I know that there has been some concern i think somebody earlier had expressed that all three bills really chip away at the CFPB and i just want to make sure that my colleagues aren't more concerned about keeping out any amendment to dodd-frank versus trying to make sure that we make it workable and do the right thing which is exactly what house bill 3871 is trying to do you know and frankly i'm i'm happy to entertain the notion of belt and suspenders approach to to mending both the CFPB act and the FDI act but it seems to me that as I think can't remember i'm sorry mr. steinbart I think had noted on page four of your testimony I had it up here at one point but maybe you can comment a little bit on that sort of the background and why we do need to not just do this with FDI and that deposit insurance side of things but why we need to amend the CFPB and why maybe we shouldn't be so deathly afraid of changing a a sentence or a jot or tittle in this is not Holy Writ that has come down from heavens this is the work of very fallible men and women who come in here trying to do the right thing but let's let's try to make sure that it's workable so if you care to comment I think that the oversight that that Congress has shown under about CFPB I think also highlights the the problems that some of the industry has with it and certainly we do we have never had a bill that is quite as large that the scope is basically unlimited as we do with this piece of legislation it is a they can act right now within the confines as the ranking member is pointed out initially in a very finite way which might be a good direction but that doesn't necessarily mean that the act itself as drafted as written is basically carp launched to do anything in this area that might impact consumers in any way for their financial services so when we look at the act we look at trying to put a little bit of belts and suspenders around it a little bit somewhat insurance when we asked our members at a recent meeting if they could rank the biggest concerns they had it's always the uncertainty and the uncertainty is because not of what CFPB has done but what it could do and all of these acts and the provisions we're talking about today really is a way to bring some oversight to bring some accountability so not because of what they've done but what is so wide open in the future sorry thank you and just so we're clear my bill 3871 you view as one of those elements to provide absolutely yes a satchel element all right mr. well Martha professor wilmarth well I just wanted to point out that I think that mr. Steinberg was probably referring to this so-called you def authority but I've described at some length and I can describe it if the committee wishes there are very tight limitations and very specific findings that have to be made before the bureau can issue a you tap rule and also a very detailed cost benefit analysis they've got to consult with federal Prudential regulators sock has a potential veto so I I don't think this look this authority is nearly as wide open as as that statement might suggest thank you but but you certainly don't see a problem with us providing that clutter I think the idea about provided providing that privileged materials the privileges maintained when institutions share them with their regulator that rainy seems perfectly sensible I I appreciate that and I think that to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle you know I know we are having much broader conversations about whether the CFPB should or shouldn't exist whether dodd-frank was good or bad all those other things with simple fact is there is a hole in my opinion and the opinion a virtually everybody who deals with this that has to be fixed so let's go do it let's go prove to the American people that we can set aside bickering and go get something done that is going to protect the consumer and protect those that are serving the consumers so I appreciate that and last last little quick reminder I've I mean we're seeing a lot of heated rhetoric and I just want to remind everybody we're in the same boat banking lenders non-banking lenders you name it I mean there's there's a lot of stuff that's getting thrown out there and I just caution everybody to make sure that you realize we're trying to be all be on the same team here to make sure that we are protecting consumers and also protecting business people men and women who are in this industry who are providing that service so thank you very much madam chair Thank You mr. Hinojosa for

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise in opposition to HR 1430 which makes it harder for the Environmental Protection Agency to do its job this bill would bring the EPA's work to a halt undermining protection of America's health and safety this legislation interferes with the use of sound science and creates obstacles that stops the EPA from enforcing the law this bill is just one part a president Trump's and congressional Republicans attack on science and our environment shortly after the inauguration the Trump administration removed remove taxpayers funded scientific data from public websites now that's not open that's not honest and that's not fair to the taxpayers this month president Trump proposed dramatic budget cuts that will make it impossible for the EPA to enforce clean air and clean water laws and yesterday President Trump rescinded the clean power plan paving the way for more air pollution we cannot go backwards I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and other Republican efforts to weaker weaken the environmental protections we must put public health and scientific integrity before polluters profits Mr Speaker I yield back

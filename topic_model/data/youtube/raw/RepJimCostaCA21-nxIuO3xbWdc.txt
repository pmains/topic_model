hello i'm congressman jim costa and i want to wish everyone a very very happy mother's day to all the moms throughout our land we say thank you and god bless you mom's day is a special day for me and for our family as i suspect it is for everyone mom and i were more than she was more than just my mother she was she and dad were my best friends and uh you know i miss her she's been gone now for a number of years but she was the source of strength in our family as i suspect moms are for all families that you could always count on and so on this mother's day let us give thanks for our moms for not only what they do what they've done but for their constant effort to make our families better so it's it's fitting and proper that we celebrate them but we should celebrate them every day and many years ago when i was in grade school uh my mother intercepted a kind of one of those puppy love letters uh that young kids do and she didn't think it was a good idea of course and she said let me tell you something young man no one but no one will ever love you more than your mother and she's right no one loves us more than our moms happy mother's day everyone and let us celebrate and think of ways to say thank you but say thank you every day

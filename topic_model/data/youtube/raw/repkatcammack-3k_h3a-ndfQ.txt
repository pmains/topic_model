now I would yield two minutes to my uh colleague from the great state of Florida representative Cameron thank you to the gentleman from Georgia my friend Mr Clyde for hosting the special order on an important topic my speech is well beyond the two minutes that I'm allotted so I'm just going to dispense with the notes really and talk about how absolutely insane ridiculous and unconstitutional this new rule is not only has it been completely blown out of proportion what the braces a brace that was originally designed for disabled veterans increases stability and since 2015 had been ruled as an accessory by the ATF which under their own regulations under their own guidance they said that they didn't have jurisdiction over accessories so I thought that was very interesting that now we have an unelected swamp creature a bureaucrat who thinks that they can now make felons law-abiding citizens felons by now instituting this 120-day rule a lot of people have talked about this but few have talked about the economic impact this will have based on the next data that we have this is going to be a 1.9 billion dollar hit to the Firearms industry 1.9 billion dollars to law-abiding citizens and believe me this rule has nothing to do with gun safety this has nothing to do with making communities safer this is just a back room attempt a back door attempt to get at the firearm industry that is all this is and nothing more this is why Mr Speaker we have to pass the short act this is why we have to pass the reins act because the rains act would prohibit any regulation that has a hundred million dollars more impact to an industry to come back to Congress for an up or down vote and you can fire your Congress Critter but you cannot fire these unelected bureaucrats so we need to pass the reins act we need to absolutely stop this regulation in its tracks and it's time to once and for all let those swamp creatures know that the Second Amendment shall not be infringed with that Mr Speaker I yield back

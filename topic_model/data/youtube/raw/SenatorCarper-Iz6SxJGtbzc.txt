senator baucus is lay down a proposal for us to consider this week the measure does more than just extend coverage in years they had to pour a lot of people who don't now have health care coverage but it also does in a lot in a way that so it's cost-effective instead of increasing the deficit we reduce the deficit over the next 15 years by 50 billion dollars would reduce it by close with trillion dollars in the second ten years of fee beyond that so we extend coverage to people who don't have it we also rain in the growth of health care costs and the real challenge choice is not to rein in the growth of health care costs per to make sure at the same time we provide better better outcomes and I think the legislation is designed to to do that as well I do support the legislation and I hope to make it better as we go through the markup debating legislation this week

thank you it's critical for communities that are experiencing the deepest effects of climate change to leave conversations on how to mitigate its impacts not just for one day on a panel which we had in November but every day we are having this conversation this is important since the first page of our briefing memo says that there's a large agreement among climate policy experts that a price on carbon is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions however I have received repeated correspondence from environmental justice groups that have real concerns with the carbon tax absent concrete steps to invest in front-line communities and stop the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure and extraction that harms communities for my constituents the climate crisis is also a public health crisis as we move forward we must ensure all voices are at the table as we weigh climate solutions

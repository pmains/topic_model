good morning good afternoon everybody um thank you congressman waltz um i especially want to thank congressman stivers um he's been so committed to passing this bill and um i wish him all the best and i want to say as i said yesterday this is really for senator tillis's benefit um my biggest issue with working on this bill was not that it was bipartisan was not that congressman stivers was a republican but if i as a michigander can work with someone from ohio is possible if i can tag team with someone who went to ohio state university then anything is possible senator please get this done i will say we have two of these veteran service dog organizations in my district blue star service dogs and veteran service dogs and i have gotten a chance to visit and see with my own eyes what the impact of a dog plus a veteran who is suffering can have i met people like shane he's a navy vet who adopted and trained his service dog and just to be very specific about it the dog wakes him up from nightmares he picks up things that he's dropped he helps him manage large crowds and get through it with dignity and the issue is particularly personal to me just because i'm an army wife my stepdaughter is currently active duty my my other stepdaughter is a physician for the va so this issue that i've seen up close and personal and as everyone has said here it's far past time that the va understand this the trainers that are here the veterans that are here they understand the combination of what a service dog and a suffering veteran mean and it's just far past time where the va can mention and notice the same thing i'm very much hoping that we can do this first for uh representative stivers as he heads off into his next job um i feel particularly it's important now more than ever to show a bipartisan effort to get something done it is still possible and i think we stand in support of that so with that i will hand it off to representative rutherford

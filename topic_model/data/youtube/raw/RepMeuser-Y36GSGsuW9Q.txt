the gentleman from pennsylvania mr muser for five minutes sorry thank you madam speaker yes the great commonwealth of pennsylvania i appreciate that madam speaker there is a fentanyl crisis in our country it is plaguing our communities plaguing my district poisoning our children devastating american families madam speaker this seems to be ignored by by many however both in the white house and and on this house floor our southern border is an unmitigated disaster due to this administration's open border policies drugs crime and the secret transportation of illegal immigrants flooding into our communities without warning in the middle of the night is causing serious long-term damage yet it seems to be ignored by too many fentanyl is an extremely deadly substance it has flowed into our country and droves by way of the southern border a recent study found that fentanyl deaths have doubled in 30 states amid the border crisis americans are suffering at the hands of the drug cartels the customs and border patrol reported a 134 percent increase in fentanyl seizures in fiscal year 2021 with a disturbing 11 000 pounds confiscated of fentanyl um estimated to be able to kill every american seven times over uh uh devastating unbelievable with this high amount confiscated the drug enforcement agency was forced to put out a public safety alert uh warning the american people about fake pills laced with fentanyl and and other fentanyl-related poisons putting so many at risk drug overdoses have hit a record high in 2021 and over one hundred thousand deaths in the united states including more than five thousand deaths in pennsylvania nearly two-thirds of these deaths were connected to fentanyl in 2021 the leading cause of deaths for americans between the ages of 18 and 45 were drug overdoses is there any question that congress should act madam speaker i am a co-sponsor of the halt fentanyl act this legislation will permanently schedule fentanyl substances as a schedule one drug giving law enforcement the ability to prosecute the trafficking of deadly fentanyl into american communities my democrat colleagues recently blocked this life-saving legislation when my republican colleagues offered it for consideration last week it truly is hard to understand why president biden and far too many of our democrat colleagues in fact not all last week have have ignored this crisis ignored madam speaker blocked legislation that would help fight it and have sat idly by as they contemplate what the root causes of our southern border crisis may be and madam speaker if someone could show me where we where where around speaker we have seen the white house actually mentioned fentanyl as the terrible scourge on our country i'd like to see it madam speaker if if however they were to take a mirror to their own policies they might realize that the root cause is the policies themselves it's certainly time for congress to act to step up and do its job together to stop the flow of fentanyl into our communities thank you madam speaker and i yield back the balance of my time

I'll introduce you to my truck this is the place I work when I'm in Kansas every weekend I come home from Washington DC and spend time with people across our state and I had a midlife crisis most people want to buy a sports car I just wanted to have a pickup truck so my ford f-150 and I travel Kansas really day in and day out 191,000 some miles on this truck since 2011 but this is a place that in some ways I call home that gets me around the state gives me a chance to get acquainted with people that I care about

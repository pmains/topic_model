Thank You ranking member madam Speaker mr. Chairman I appeal to you to make this an urgent issue urgency I think is very critical here so I rise in opposition to the previous question so that we can consider the homeowner flood insurance affordability act Anna wake of Hurricane sandy over 74,000 National Flood Insurance Program claims of submitters II from policyholders to date the nfip has paid over three-and-a-half billion in sandy claims it has served as a lifeline to thousands of new jersey residents whose lives are turned upside down by the storm the funds paid out through those claims have helped our neighbors rebuild our homes businesses regardless of what a political affiliation persuasion we're all affected by this estimates indicate that the total cost of Sandy will be between 12 and 15 billion dollars making sandy the second Clause costly as flood event after Hurricane Katrina so it is true that we need to make changes to ensure the NFIP remain solvent however the rollout of the 12 2012 reforms to NFIP have been fraught with issues i'm hearing constituents from constituents a little flurry little furry and moonachie particularly which were devastated by sandy this is destroying property values disrupting the real estate markets and the communities of New Jersey and across this country that's why it's so quit a lot we visit flood insurance reform I passing HR 3370 this legislation will prevent premium rate hikes until FEMA completes the affordability study that impossible in 30 seconds in that time the German additional 30 seconds thank you the affordability study called for by the original biggert-waters flood insurance reform legislation giving FEMA a chance to implement an affordability framework the bill establishes an appeal process for remapping increase an advocate position within FEMA just last week a bipartisan majority in the Senate did approve this pileggi already heard it is time to bring this vital legislation to flow again I appeal to the Chairman this is urgent because we had two major storms in the last few years but because Americans all over this country are affected one way or the other if not by a storm off the ocean a snowstorm or even worse so I asked you I asked you specifically do what you can to make this put this in front of us as soon as possible thank you thank you much

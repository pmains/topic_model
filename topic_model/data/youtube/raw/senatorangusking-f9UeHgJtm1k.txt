uh thank you madam chair i want to thank you especially for having this important hearing i think this is a great topic for us to be discussing i don't have uh much in the way of specific questions but first i want to say i don't think we celebrate enough uh when we have a success we always focus on the next problem coming down the street and uh yesterday's passage of the great american outdoors act i think is a is a really significant achievement for this congress it's one that uh to say it's been a long time coming is an understatement uh and it's going to really make a difference for generations of americans generations of americans who who won't know any of us who passed it but they'll see the handiwork that we brought through uh some hard work and and cooperation and uh bipartisanship all the things that our citizens hope we we do um and again i i don't really have a question i do want to associate myself with the comments from senator manchin about broadband we've learned a lot of lessons from the pandemic we knew before the pandemic that broadband was an issue in rural areas but since the onset of the pandemic we realize it's not just an issue it's a necessity it's something that really has to be addressed uh in a comprehensive way just as franklin d roosevelt addressed the rural electrification question uh in the 30s it's exactly similar it's absolutely critical uh to modern life so i just want to thank all of our witnesses for the work that they are doing and have done uh i think it's prudent to try to get some provisions into the new coveted bill that's being discussed to deal with some of the specialized particularly of seasonal businesses that have been particularly hard hit this summer i know that's true in maine as well as across the country so thank you for the hearing and i'll look i've enjoyed the listening to the testimony and we'll look forward to working with you and ranking member manchin and the rest of the members of the committee to try to effectuate some of the ideas we've heard today thank you again madam chair

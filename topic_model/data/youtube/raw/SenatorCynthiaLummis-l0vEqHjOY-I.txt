thank you mr chairman and um under secretary liang thank you for appearing here today um i want to follow on the line of questioning that senator haggerty had begun a few minutes ago and asked about the recommendation in the president's working group report on stablecoin issuers that it should only be limited to insured depository institutions with respect to the insurance requirement is it the case that the fdic and ncua have found that stable coins and their assets are insurable and have these agencies committed to provide deposit insurance to newly chartered de novo institutions that issue a stable coin so thank you for that question senator lamas um the proposal for stable coin issuers to be insured depository institutions given the flexibility of that supervisory and regulatory regime is not does not necessarily mean that stable coins need deposit insurance i think that would depend on the circumstances of the the backing and the um the functionality of the stable coin that is being provided so the proposal is not and the pwg did not um recommend necessarily that stable coins be backed by deposit insurance and what other types of backings would you uh believe adequately protects the consumer so i think the consumers can be protected with reserve assets that are truly high quality that will provide some um reduce the risk of runs by investors there's also the um protections provided by oversight of the all the entities that go into providing supporting stablecoin as a payment so the custodial wallets the custody the other ways of uh trans um of liquidation of the redemption of the stable coin that can be provided so i think all those go into protecting consumers when they want to use stablecoin for payments so um since there are alternative ways of bringing stable coins inside the banking perimeter like a 100 reserve bank with tailored holding company supervision um is that something you discussed and uh are willing to consider yes i think um bringing stable coins into an idi framework that is adjusted for the risks of the stable coin issuer which would include solid backing of the of the stable coin one for one would certainly be an option well i i'm so pleased to hear that that's your approach because without it i think the type of competition that senator haggerty wants to protect would be at risk if someone already has deposit insurance and can issue a stable coin like you know jp morgan's jpm coin that would seem to limit competition in that marketplace to only the very very largest banks in our country and there may be other options that other institutions could explore and it sounds like you are willing to discuss that with them so i'm going to conclude with a different question does treasury have a timeline for issuance of the guidance on the definition of broker for digital assets under the infrastructure bill i know we were promised some public guidance on this a few months ago and we have yet to see it um i know treasury is working very actively on that the the principle of of the tax provisions is is you know for those who owe taxes should pay their taxes it is not designed to um to crimp the activities of of crypto assets well i'm i'm also very pleased to hear that because some of the um provisions in the definition as you know included people who wouldn't know the ultimate customer of a digital asset the ultimate customer being the one who owes the taxes as opposed to the inventor of the software or the hardware so thanks very much we look forward to that guidance coming out as soon as possible and appreciate again your testimony today mr chairman i yield back

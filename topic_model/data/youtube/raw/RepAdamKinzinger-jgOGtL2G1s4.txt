joining us now is also a republican congressman from illinois adam kinzinger congressman kensinger thank you so much for joining us madison cawthorne lost how do you feel about that well it's good i mean it's good for the country it's good for the party it's good for the 11th district of north carolina i mean you know look dc has become uh kind of a a growing ground for people that are just more interested in fame than governing that are more interested in in becoming famous and actually doing really serious work at a time when you know we've got a lot of challenges here at home and a lot of challenges overseas and so it was a good thing he lost at my organization countryfirst countryonest.com we've been on the ground there we've been spending money not on endorsing any opponent but just getting people to turn out turn out to the primary this is the key john is is people don't even vote in primaries primaries are unfortunately where like a vast majority of members of congress are actually determined so we think we made an impact it's good to see him lose um i want to ask you about pennsylvania because there's something of a different story there doug mostriano has won the republican nomination for governor there and master honor to call him an election denier is an understatement i mean this is a guy who worked as hard as he could to overturn the will of pennsylvania voters in the 2020 election so what does it tell you that he is the republican nominee for governor now well it tells me that if you know on my last kind of glad we beat you know madison cawthorne if you think that means uh we're winning this battle for the soul of the republican party it's not true um you know i think there can be moments of victory and i think this is going to be a long-term fight really for the soul of the whole country um in this case uh you know look you can look at this race you can look at other races and say it seems like there's almost a competition to see who can become even more crazy and somehow now that is a litmus test of who is conservative and that's why i think it's important for conservatives for even moderates and liberals to take back what being a conservative really means it doesn't mean being an election denier it doesn't mean blowing a shofar you know the first time you start your campaign and then being pretty much there on january 6th being a conservative we all know what it used to mean it means you want to spend a little less money and empower people uh it doesn't mean you deny elections so look this would be a long-term fight for the for the for the soul of this country in particular party congressman this is the first time we've had a chance to talk to you since the massacre in buffalo there are 10 people killed because they were shopping in black uh in the shooter it seems was motivated by white replacement theory this this crazy offensive notion that white people in this country are under threat uh from minorities of replacing them you've called on your own house leadership to say more about this what are you asking for specifically how responsible do you feel that some leaders are for creating sort of this environment well what i'm asking for is just spit out the cancer you know there was a day um steve king used to be a member of congress from iowa and he made some racist comments and we basically kicked him off his committees today you know people like marjorie taylor greene uh you know people like matt gates mo brooks the folks you think about um they are almost leading well i would argue that they are leading the republican caucus and so kevin mccarthy elise stefanik instead of leading as you know their title leadership should suggest they do they basically are tolerating this all in the name of hopefully i become speaker someday and what happens john is did they pull the trigger no you know did they call this guy up and tell him to do it of course not but when we as a party or a movement or people like frankly tucker carlson you know throw out these theories or just fish in the waters of white replacement theory or echo some of those kind of fear-based things you can't be surprised when some people take that to the level of going and massacring people you just can't you can't fundraise you can't feed you can't live on fear because eventually you're going to create fearful people and fearful people can do really bad things and i think that's what we saw in buffalo liz cheney your colleague who sits on the january 6 committee your fellow republicans you put out a pretty strong statement um condemning sort of house leadership in this you know look what's amazing john is she got kicked out because she wanted the truth about january 6. she got kicked out by kevin mccarthy and replaced by elise stefanik um and you know elise kind of was playing with this great replacement theory in some facebook ads i haven't heard a word from kevin about this i mean this is where we're at and i think look as a party as a country you gotta look back and say i mean really is this what we want to be do you know we can't talk about ronald reagan and then pedal in dark fear um we've got to lead people we have to be light and i'll tell you i'm very worried about where we are and i think as a country we have to take real inventory of of our tongue of our rhetoric and politics let me ask you a little bit about the business of the january six committee we learned that the justice department has asked your committee for transcripts of some of the interviews that you have all done how do you feel about that and will those be handed over well i think the the chairman recently addressed this and and uh i'll defer specifically to his words but i think they were along the lines of you know look we we're not going to specifically turn it over to the department of justice there's some issues there but we're certainly going to find ways to make sure they know what what is in the material that they get the answers they need uh i'm in line with with uh cooperating with doj 100 i just you know i'll defer to the chairman to figure out the technicalities i think look if there is criminal activity done we don't want to get in a tail chase where we're constantly kind of prosecuting the last administration because that's what banana republics do but i gotta tell you the last administration it's been we've never seen an insurrection we've never seen somebody try to overthrow democracy so we absolutely have to have justice on that we're going to do that on the committee justice needs to do that on the criminal realm well based on what you've seen because you've seen the depositions i haven't do you think there are grounds for criminal charges i think for certain people you know we'll talk more about this in june when we do our hearings and uh but that'll be again a decision where we can say look here's the information does that reach any kind of level of a crime for whoever that's what doj gets to figure out um we're going to present the american people i think a compelling story in june congressman adam kinzinger i do appreciate you joining us this morning thank you very much you bet

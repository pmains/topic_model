amuser of pennsylvania for five minutes thank you chairman meeks uh thank you ranking member mccall thank you deputy secretary and uh all of you for appearing here today so in april russian military equipment uh was left on ukraine's border following military exercises april of 21 in may president biden waived sanctions on the north stream too arguably there are now more sanctions on domestic energy production than there is on russian energy production in september after our disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan russia conducted military exercises and left troops and additional equipment behind on the ukraine border russia continued to amass troops on ukraine's border through the fall and seven days ago a full invasion of ukraine began with only uh the courage of the ukrainian people keeping russia from reaching all of its military objectives in short order on friday state department spokesman ned price stated admitted that it was clear putin had used diplomacy to buy time for an invasion putin had intended to carry out all along my administration said it would unleash crippling sanctions if just one russian unit or one russian tank crossed the border of ukraine even after russian troops began to execute putin's february 21st order to send russian troops into the separatist republics in the dambas it took nearly a week before the administration imposed strong enough sanctions to begin to have a real impact on the russian economy and and the ruble uh deputy secretary sherman can you explain this delay uh that you had months to prepare sanctions uh with our allies and partners actually i think you've answered your own question congressman it takes time to get allies and partners to work with us on very highly technical issues to make sure that sanctions can go forward there was a great deal of preparation to be ready to both try to deter putin and then to impose severe consequences on him and many you and other colleagues have raised the issues of oil and of ns2 on ns2 as i said before the pipeline was 95 completed under the last administration under president biden it is now dead and bankrupt on oil uh the president's working uh to release 60 million barrels of reserves oil and gas production are an all-time high by later this year lng exports are at historic highs under this administration storage facilities are at capacity the narrative that this administration is doing nothing to free up resources is just not i didn't i didn't say that i said during the build up i'm reclaiming my time please so i did read the classified offer that was sent to russia on january 26th i believe um it was startingly weak uh i don't think it had any chance of making any difference whatsoever to to russia why was this even sent was it actually intended to get a reaction where putin would say okay i give let's have it let's have a talk about this are you describing the non-paper that we sent in response to russia's non-paper to us i'm just describing the classified document that that i read and was sent and was not made public probably because it was just so awfully weak and had no intention if it's a classified document then i'm not going to discuss it i'm not discussing it either madam secretary well i don't think it was weak if we're talking about the same document i think it provided russia uh with an off-ramp uh to its ridiculous demands that in fact nato returned to 1997 so that current members of nato had to leave which we certainly weren't going to agree to that ukraine would not be able to join nato if nato decided it could we could not agree to those things but we did offer them things that were in their security interests should they have wanted to take it deputy secretary we're all in this together i don't want to have to make you sit there and rationalize uh uh what where where we how we got to this point uh and the the uh you know irrational uh delays that took place i do have one question the um one last question the the russian excuse me the ukrainian parliament sent us a letter to congress i'm not sure if you have it but i'll gladly give you a copy uh that they were very specific and what they needed those on the front lines and keeve people we should listen to from anti-tank guided weapons to stingers to small arms grenade launchers not big stuff not asking for air cover all kinds of communication mainly military portable radio sets and body armor and helmets does the administration have this and is this planning to be expedited to uh ukrainians in the field fighting the russians as i said this year alone we have provided a billion dollars in security assistance i won't go through the item by item because some of them should be discussed in a classified setting but we have provided a whole range of those items to the ukrainians already and are continuing to do so including through third party transfer thank you i yield back mr

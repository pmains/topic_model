Thank You mr. chairman thank you miss Lynch for appearing here today and for your services Attorney General I'm sure that many of my Republican colleagues will spend their time discussing the overhyped matter concerning secretary Clinton's emails but I'm going to focus instead on more important issues facing this country we're all sickened by the killings of Alton sterling in baton rouge and falando Castile outside of st. Paul according to the ACLU mr. Castillo was the one hundred twenty third african-american to be killed by law enforcement this year that is of course no excuse for last week's vicious murders of five police officers in Dallas but the knowledge that mr. Sterling's and mr. Castiel's deaths come on the heels of a long list of senseless killings of black men women and children whose encounters with the police might have gone differently had they not been black must spur us to take action black lives matter is not a hashtag it is an imperative and I appreciate the work that you are doing and your department is doing in this regard and I hope you'll keep us informed on that but I want to go to a different matter related unfortunately exactly one month ago today a lone gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 others in LGBT nightclub in Orlando mass shootings are now an all-too-common occurrence in this country in 2016 there were 229 mass shootings defined as one as shootings in which at least four people are shot as you know every day on average nearly 300 Americans are shot and murders assault suicide suicide attempts accidents and police stations police actions 48 of them are children and teenagers this is a distinctly American problem more than 33,000 Americans lose their lives to gun violence each year in the United Kingdom in 2011 146 that's the gun violence denmark 71 portugal 142 japan just 30 the United States 33,000 you cannot tell me no one can tell me that the American people are a thousand times more mentally ill than people in these other countries a recent study in the american journal of medicine found that compared to 22 other high-income countries the gun related murder rate the United States is 25 times higher we have held exact book this is a nekkid em there is an epidemic of gun violence and how is the majority in Congress responded with emergency hearings about Hillary Clinton's and Lois Lerner's emails we have held of course 0 hearings on gun violence we have passed no bills to address the issue we have done nothing to require universal background checks we continue to allow military-style assault weapons on our streets we have not even prevented those on the no-fly was from purchasing guns that's why it was proud to join John Lewis and nearly the entire Democratic caucus and protesting the Republican Congress's abdication on this issue now ms Lynch what does the assassination of five Dallas police officers last week tell us about the NRA s favorite adage the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun the police officers after over armed and what about an armed society is a polite society well congressman thank you for raising this important issue of gun violence in our society I don't have a comment on the NRA s positions or statements but of course about that state and everyone their position but what do you think of the statement that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun is that true does it work congressman I think that the issue is as usual doesn't really lend itself well to aphorisms and and in short statements and is my hope that the work of many on this committee and indeed throughout Congress in having the discussion that has been good that has begun on this issue will continue so that we can in fact continue to work on the serious issues of access to firearms in our society earlier this year I did make several recommendations to the White House which were accepted for important ways for dealing with this issue ranging from clarifying guidance on those who are engaged in the business and therefore must provide background checks for purchasers ranging from clarifying rules on acquisitions of certain types of firearms and by those in certain business capacities such as trusts but also as part of that a very important part of that was a request for additional funding for ATF for more resources to deal with the the information and the issues arising out of gun violence as well as funding for HHS to deal with the issues of mental health that place so many Americans in jeopardy a loophole in federal law allows the transfer of a firearm to anybody after three business days even if a background check is not complete last year the FBI concluded the suspect in the shooting in Charleston was able to purchase a gun through this loophole should that policy change should we hold the transfer fire should we hold the transfer firearms until the background check has been completed well congressman in order to change that rule it would require congressional action the three-day waiting period is part of congressional action that has already been voted on by Congress and certainly it is it is a fact that with the rise in purchases and the increased use on the Knicks background system there is ever more use of that system we are working to improve the next system to make it as efficient as possible we've expanded the number of personnel working on those background checks we are working also to improve the automated portion of the Knicks system so that the dealers who go through the system will be able to get information more quickly and to be able to respond either by either by proceeding or denying a sale or in other ways as appropriate so we are working within the system as it is currently structured in order to change that it would require congressional action thank you my time is expiring but I wanted to briefly mention one more issue we've been following the department's review of the consent decrees that govern ASCAP and BMI there are reports that the department is not recommending any changes to the consent decrees but is moving forward with an interpretation of the decrees requiring these organizations to license works on a 100-percent basis instead of the current practice of fractional licensing in conflict with the formal opinion of the u.s. register of copyrights I have heard from numerous songwriters and constituents greatly concerned about the disruption this will cause in the industry and to the creative process several of the parties involved have raised a host of other issues related to the consent decrees as well can you clarify for the committee the status of the department's review of the consent decrees in the process moving forward time's the gentleman has expired the witness will be permitted to briefly answer the question Thank You mr. chairman Thank You congressman the Antitrust Division is engaged in a review of the consent decree which I believe dates to 1941 it has been utilizing a public comment system after going through an initial round and receiving public comments another round of public comments was also opened those comments are still being reviewed stakeholders are being consulted with and as my understanding that the Antitrust Division will be wrapping up this matter shortly and will be making public its findings and we will of course make sure that they're made available to Congress I believe they would be in any event provide it to you but we will certainly make sure that they are provided to you thank you very much

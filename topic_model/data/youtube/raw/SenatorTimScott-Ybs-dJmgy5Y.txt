[Music] all right folks we welcome back to the show south carolina senator uh tim scott republican of south carolina and senator scott it's great to see you again sir well larry thank you for having me on the best show on tv so i appreciate being back with you i love that music to my ears we appreciate it so right now the headline story is the consumer price inflation report which was worse than people thought and they weren't too excited about it in the first place as you probably know so for the 12 months ending in february it's a 7.9 up 7.9 um the biden people are blaming it all on vladimir putin do you agree with that well larry that's a ridiculous statement here's what we know from the kitchen table economists also known as moms around the country they know without any question that before there was a conversation about russia their gas prices were up 60 percent they know before there was ever a conversation about the genocide happening in russia in ukraine because of russia there was already seeing a double-digit increase in fish and meat and all types of food nearly a 20 in dresses and other types of clothes we've seen a crisis caused by president biden's decisions to literally cut off the keystone xl pipeline to stop permitting for oil research and at the same time spend two trillion dollars it's like pouring gas on a fire that's already out of control it's his fault not somebody else's so i yeah i was just looking at some of the statistics um you know if you took energy out just first of all the invasion wasn't until late february so this report doesn't really take that into fact but you can just take energy out excluding energy the inflation rate is 7.3 percent for the past three months annualized and 6.6 for the past 12 months so really energy here is a red herring and i think you're right about overspending the fed is printing too much money so that kind of leads me to another point there's an omnibus appropriations bill that passed the house last night i guess it was one and a half trillion dollars um i don't know that anybody knows that we we had uh bill hagerty senator haggerty on he's on the appropriations committee he hasn't seen anything he doesn't even have a document this thing's coming over to the senate i guess today some people say it's a 16 increase over the prior baseline which seems to me more inflationary deficit spending but what do you think about this bill well larry here's what we know it's hard to read 2700 pages overnight you get something at 1am or 2am in the morning you wake up and you have 2700 pages to read before you vote seriously that's a bad decision by itself adding a half a trillion dollars to our national debt that's adding even more fuel to the fire that we just talked about and finally let's say this the democrats leadership in the house has led to a 40-year high in inflation and they're still pouring more money on this crisis that's not good for moms making decisions at homes like the one i grew up in i can't imagine the type of crisis people are facing paycheck to paycheck working paycheck to paycheck and this administration thinks more spending more debt and more challenges is good news for the economy terrible news for moms like the one that raised me so in his state of the union speech i mean you gave one of the greatest rebuttals to a state of the union speech um not quite a year ago but in this year's state of the union speech he actually gave the same laundry list of social spending he just didn't call it bill back better and the cbo had priced that out as you probably know over ten years at five trillion dollars to increase debt by at least three trillion yes sir so in other words putin's not to blame for inflation overspending is to blame for inflation the federal reserve is accommodating it buying all the bonds pumping up the money supply but president biden is there hypocrisy here i mean he wants more spending he rather blame putin than his own domestic economic policies that's the point i'm driving at well larry you make a very important point listen we've had to drag this president into a position of leadership it's like we're dragging a kid kicking and screaming into a positive position of leadership and during the state of the union what does he say from that position of leadership he literally says he wants to lower costs while increasing wages that is a unusual perspective from a guy who ran a business you don't lower costs by raising what raises wages you lower costs by increasing your production so that you have more on the bottom line and with that extra resources you can increase wages you can look at benefits but he doesn't understand how the free market system actually works i can't imagine what he was thinking when he read from the teleprompter what someone else wrote he should have stopped and said wait a second let me just tell the american people the truth i have no clue what i'm talking about when i look at this teleprompter but here's what i would say if i was just thinking on my own i would say that in order for the american economy to continue to grow we need people coming back to the workforce not leaving the workforce we have more jobs open than we have people looking for work that's called a problem and how we're going to fix that problem we're going to fix that problem by making more incentives for people to come back to the workplace he should talk about things that we understand like i need to see more energy production in the greatest nation on earth so that we're creating more jobs in the energy sector that has some of the highest paying jobs in america that kind of incentive is common sense incentives that puts everybody back at the line to start working again we should talk about the importance of america's future not 2022 and 2024 but 2030 and 2040. we're gonna build the most vibrant economy the world has ever seen by investing in research and development he didn't have that kind of conversation larry because he doesn't listen to your show he would know that already [Music]

the chair now recognizes mr mckinley for five minutes uh thank you madam chairman uh uh and i appreciate the fact i'm encouraged that this uh the committee today is going to be addressing the epa's mission because over the years i think we we've we've experienced mission creep uh that became a consuming force within the epa uh and quite frankly the trump administrator in fact it was demonstrated during the obama administration that it was it was all stick and no carrot uh the trump administration was it was it concurs with your statement and trying to get it back to the basic mission they spent the last four years trying to get back to the basics what was the law i had conversations with scott pruitt same thing with andrew wheeler get back to the basics what do we have to do and he was successful with that we've already heard over the litany of successes whether the superfund site updated the lead copper rule finalized air quality standards created a funding mechanism so that we provided a hundred million dollars in grants so without objection madam chairman i'd like to enter the record the epa's 2020 year in review and a document from administrator wheeler highlighting their net accomplishments mr mckinley we as stated we will uh enter all of the exhibits at the end of the hearing thank you thank you your staff is invited to committee staff thank you so the question to uh do governor wheeler the trump administration finalized a a new copper lead and copper rule for the first time in over 30 years when you were at the epa did you try to update that regulation miss whitman my time's running it's just continued apparently uh question adjusted me i i was cutting out badly i couldn't hear i apologize i couldn't hear you i lost your time on that uh what we were saying was there was a new lead and copper rule was put in place for the first time in over 30 years so my question when you were the epa did you try to update that regulation uh congressman i don't even actually remember that but yes okay i don't know i i honestly can't say whether we did or not thank you uh do you know that uh that during the obama administration worked on a lead rule for eight years but but never proposed one under trump they did they took care of it uh so well that's good and then we need that in the flint michigan uh water crisis that happened under the trump administration did it happen under the trump administration or was it gina mccarthy and and the obama biden administration that took place that the water was so contaminated there do you know oh that was going on for a long time i think there were several uh administrations what happened a lot of epa's that ignored it and but it finally came to pass and it was corrected with it do you know back in 2015 the gold king a mine uh outburst out in colorado did that did that occur under a trump administration to fix it or was it that uh the obama administration i presume by the way you're asking the questions that was under the trump administration that that was addressed i mean every administration has had their crises and addresses oh yes they have right so it's good i mean we need that both nobody is all bad and that's the good thing now let me turn to carol browner on page two of your testimony you discussed the need to strengthen the environmental enforcement um and but starting in 2011 there was a downward trend in all criminal enforcement statistics it wasn't reverse until under the trump administration uh so were you aware of that that it was declining not not not increasing or not flat with all due respect it is important to distinguish between civil enforcement and criminals and i think that you need to get both of the numbers do you realize that the administration of the trump administration actually collected twice as much in civil and criminal penalties than the obama and biden administration did were you aware of that i think the question is what were the levels of compliance what we all care about is the clean air and clean water sir not certain not the penalties correct my time to go to john destin because at times running out uh john professor the democrats seem to be returning to the obama's mission again uh overwhelmingly focused on this war on coal as it relates to it and they want to decarbonize this power sector by 2035 and without carbon capture this would ultimately eliminate coal and natural gas for domestic energy production and some you've already talked about what was what's going to happen with it can you discuss the potential impacts that eliminating that if foster fuel production would have on budgets like in west virginia or in alaska wyoming north dakota or alabama all the states that are involved with fossil fuels do you mean if we just completely eliminated fossil fuels what they're doing that's the plan to do away with because they're not you're not funding carbon capture so there's no way for us to get the net zero by 2035 unless we eliminate it well i certainly haven't analyzed the complete uh elimination but that would be devastating for uh much of west virginia i mean that would devastate our employment base it would devastate our tax revenue base if that happened just hypothetically if we had completely elimination over the next year west virginia would be devastated just in closing i know running but by 2030 they want to have zero or 80 emission reduction of carbon are we going to be able to achieve that in west virginia 80 in the next uh by 2030 no i don't think we can achieve it in that story and we can go from there

joining me tonight is Congress in Jerrold Nadler of New York congressman good to have you with us good to be here we're going to find out how fast the wheels of government can turn here under the umbrella that you haven't had any Republican step forward and say anything like what the president said today what are your expectations something's really going to get done well I don't know that remains to be seen I mean right now the Republicans are saying nothing they're ducking some of them are opposing any reasonable gun control restrictions the president's going to push it very hard there's the the Democratic leader set up a task force today under congressman Thompson of California there's going to be a lot of constituent pressure on everybody including Republicans and they're going to have to either step up to the plate or say no and that's going to be very difficult for a lot of them your colleague congresswoman carolyn mccarthy urged support from Republicans today here it is and i'm asking my Republican friends to work with us it shouldn't be a Democrat or a Republican issue it's all of us as Americans who are mourning the death in Newtown and we don't want to see any more of these shootings again so they always hide behind the Second Amendment they're they're fabulous at doing that but the Second Amendment does not give you the right to bear any kind of arm and technology has changed and of course the design has changed the proficiency of the manufacturing has changed why will no Republican step forward and admit that well because of the fear of the NRA leadership which is fanatic which lies the gun owners and says that any attempt to regulate guns in any way is a prelude to taking all your guns away luckily the the power of the NRA was shown to be a paper tiger in the last election i think that knowledge is going to have to be broadcast and assimilated that you can take on the nra and live to tell about it you know no right is absolute we have the First Amendment right to freedom of speech but you can't get away with yelling fire in a crowded theater so the Second Amendment the Supreme Court has ruled the Second Amendment confers a personal rights to carry arms but it doesn't confer a personal right to carry machine guns or grenade launchers or semi-automatic weapons or or large magazine clips there is no hunter that needs more than two three three bullets in a rifle to hunt anything beyond that is not only fair subject for regulation but absolutely ought to be banned but there's very few hunters out there that want to be told what kind of firearm they can use and this is the urban and rural divide that the president talked about a little bit today in Congress and I come from the middle of the country over the last 30 years before I came to work here in New York and it's two different worlds you go to the middle of the country and they say don't you come close to me with any firearm regulation and don't tell me how to use my firearm I don't want any regulation so ever we're here in New York here in New York City the the laws are about as strict as they are anywhere in the country so how do we strike this balance you strike a balance by saying look anyone has a right to have to have firearms that are reasonably related to self-defense it is a license for that and for hunting in for sports but no one has the right to have military-style firearms that are designed to kill people in large numbers as rapidly as possible common sense says that I think even people know even people in rural areas will recognize that that too everybody wants their kids to be safe and the fact is they were having more and more of these of these outrages you know as I've said before we had a maniac attack a an elementary school in China last Friday the same day yeah used and I know nobody died that is that's a talking point that's out there quite a bit the bottom line is the American people are ready for change will the Congress walk in lockstep with the American people on this that's that's the big question Congress Jerrold Nadler great to have you with us tonight thanks so much

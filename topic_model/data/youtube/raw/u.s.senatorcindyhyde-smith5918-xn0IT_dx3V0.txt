thank you madam chairman and thank you for being here today you've really presented yourself extremely well very impressive I want to talk about rural veterinarian nearing medicine in Mississippi we have a tremendous shortage and across the country that threaten the long-term viability of our livestock Industries we have counties in Mississippi that don't even have a large animal veterinarian and that's really what we're hearing across the entire country and as you well know our food security and economic security are put at risk without sufficient Veterinary oversight to ensure the health of animals and the food supply chain and the proper Federal inspection of meat poultry and catfish processing the USDA National Institute of food and agriculture nifa currently administers the veterinary medicine loan repayment program to alleviate rural Veterinary shortages by providing money toward educational loans of veterinarians who agreed to serve in rural shortage areas there's just so much money to be made in small animals that it's difficult to lure them into large animals but while many of these rural veterinarians serve in private practice some undertake Federal roles such as USDA safe food safety and inspection service inspectors but despite the successes of this program there are still critical shortages across Rural America one of the reasons for this that I think has been identified is that these awards from nifa are subject to a federal withholding tax meaning that 37 percent of the dollars appropriated to this program go right back to the treasury so instead instead of the educational debt for the Royal veterinarians without this tax we could better address these shortage issues by helping more veterinarian practices where it is desperately needed what are your views on the veterinary shortages and how open are you to additional conversations on how we can get more veterinarians into Rural America and how will you ensure Nipa continues to successfully administer this program and what do you think about alleviating those taxes Senator High Smith it's interesting because every young person I talked to who's interested in animal science I beg them I begged literally beg and plead with them to to to look at large animals you know um and what what I noticed when I toured the veterinary school at Mississippi State University primarily female yes primarily female vet students um I've got one of my staff right here who just graduated large animal a large animal vet so so how do we so the symptoms are great programs like the nifa lab program are great we've also recognized an imperative to diversify our Veterinary programs I toured a talk with some of the students at at president nave's um University at Alcorn you know the students are interested in animal science and veterinary science how do we encourage them and Bridge the way for them to go into vet programs so something that we talk about a lot in terms of planning on how we can use some of these unprecedented investments in the next generation of AG professionals to train targeted areas like veterinarians for Rural communities for large animal science so I think that this is you're right there's a this is an important issue I would love to have an opportunity to talk more maybe hear some of your thoughts on what you've learned in your in your state um I've always been excited about the repayment program the the loan incentive program that nifa led tried to get my daughter to go on veterinary services but she she fought against me because I thought hey we can send you to a rural area and get some of that paid back um but yeah this is very important ARS hires a lot of veterinarians a lot of veterinarians and well I'll tell you what we've seen the most glaring shortage is as we move into our BSL 3 and BSL four facilities where we're dealing with diseases like African swine fever Canadian you know classical swine fever avium influenza we need we need trained veterinarians PhD DVM phds who can help us in those spaces and we have a shortage of those people and then we have to compete with everybody else but the same students and so I would love to have an opportunity to talk with you about that now in terms of the the withholding I would need a whole lot more information on that piece but I'm happy to talk with your office to see see what's possible well thank you for your interest because it is a good critical shortage and we are losing animals because we just have no one to come to the farm in time to save them thank you madam chairman

as an original co-sponsor of the homeland procurement reform act i'm grateful that this legislation has been included in the america competes act i will offer an amendment later today that strengthens provisions that support domestic manufacturing and american small businesses it's of the utmost importance for our economic and national security interests that we make more things in america that should be a priority when it comes to purchases made by the department of homeland security for protective equipment for frontline personnel purchasing more of these items from qualified american small businesses would be a win for workers and companies that manufacture their products here in the united states small businesses receive less than 26 percent of federal government contracts my amendment will help close that procurement gap and at the same time create good paying jobs support domestic manufacturing and strengthen our supply chains i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the america competes act and i yield back

America Tim all right Greg we are pleased to bring in the congressman from Florida's 17th District representative Greg stubey Congressman welcome back to Victor news I want you to know our viewers have been praying for you and besides the loss of your beard which you did on an online poll you look really good sir how are you feeling thank you I feel better every day healing every day getting stronger every day and I want to thank your your viewers for their prayers because prayer is powerful and I think I am where I am today in the healing process because of it that's great to hear all right let's get to some of the news Joe Biden allowed a Chinese spy balloon to travel across our country he then started shooting multiple Airborne objects out of the sky that he announced were probably just privately owned recreational and purpose can you make any sense of that congressman no and what's frustrating we had a briefing this week members of Congress had a briefing with some of norad's head and the Pentagon officials and we knew about this on January 27th on 28th they confirmed that it was a Chinese Communist Party surveillance uh balloon and did nothing until February 4th allegedly the president was notified on January 31st so the first question is is why did it take three or four days for the joint Chief staff to notify the president then why did it take eight days from the time that we had confirmed this was a Chinese surveillance balloon to shoot it down it's beyond the pale for somebody that served on active duty uh in support of operation Iraqi Freedom National Security is very important to me and I don't think we should let the Chinese Communist party which is the number one national security threat to our our country allowed to surveil nuclear sites B2 bomber bases all of this in our country before this Administration took action yeah it seems like they're slow to act and acting in the wrong way and many times okay the Judiciary Committee wants answers from Christopher Wray about targeting Catholics when did people of faith become Public Enemies with this Administration sir well it's because we ideologically don't agree with Democratic platform issues namely life uh game marriage transgenders all these different things that are like the far left Progressive agenda of this white house and this Administration so suddenly anybody that believes that life is precious and uh supports doing away with Roe v Wade and supports restrictions on abortion and supports life and this country is now a target for this Administration we've seen this with parents at school board meetings we have seen this now with Catholics and other Christians who believe strongly on the word of God and that is in direct opposition to the things that this Administration support Congressman this is Greg Stevens you introduce legislation to repeal the Motor Voter portion of the national voter registration Act of 1993. it's not like Americans want to spend more time at the DMV so tell us why Motor Voter is bad for election integrity yeah there's a lot of individuals that get their voter registration by their driver's license and there's no identity check on their citizenship and so then they go and get their voter registration based on their driver's license they're not citizens of our country I don't think non-citizens of our country should be able to vote in our elections amen we agree with you on that one Congressman tell us about the safeguarding of the United States armed forces and service academies act and what you're seeking to protect our servicemen and women from yeah we had a number including a constituent in my district that refused to take the vaccine on religious grounds uh was denied that and was being told that she wasn't going to be able to graduate was being told that she wouldn't be able to get commissioned uh and so what my bill would do would ensure that these individuals that were kicked out have the right to go back in to these academies if they want to go back in and anybody that denies taking the vaccine based on religious exemptions should be honored that religious exemption like we have done historically good now let me ask you about this mayor Pete finally broke out of the tragic the derailment he spoke out about it and the chemical spill in Ohio listen to this I'll get your response while this uh horrible situation has gotten a particularly high amount of attention there are roughly 1 000 cases a year of a train derailing so is that the direction encouragement people in East Palestine were hoping to hear no absolutely absolutely not and you have FEMA denying disaster relief to to a Republican state to a republican Governor there's always politics when it comes to this Administration and what's sad is it is affecting people's lives it is affecting People's Health and mayor Buddha judge isn't doing anything to go in there and help the people uh in Ohio and uh our thoughts and prayers are with them and I hope that the Republican Governor can get this thing squared away so that we can protect the health and safety of those Ohioans will Congress be able to do anything about it and to that will speaker McCarthy get us any closer to a secure border we can the the challenge is the Appropriations process they passed that big huge budget bill that went all the way to October the real power that the house has is the power over the purse so we can put writers on the Appropriations Bill to deny the Secretary of Homeland Security any funding to allow legal immigrants to come into our country but unfortunately because uh they passed that big Omnibus right before a republican house took over uh we're going to be constrained on that until October of this year but there's absolutely things that we can do not only impeachment proceedings that we can bring on my orcas for for completely and intentionally violating federal law on our border as we stand here today but also we can use that Appropriations process to change and accomplish policy objectives On the Border real quickly on this can Congress do anything about the train derailment there's things that we can look at from a Safety and Security standpoint and I think that from a disaster relief supplemental we absolutely can do something on that to ensure that those individuals have the help that they need financially to get back on their fee Congressman Greg stupid Florida thank you sir for being with us on Victory thank you today Mike good to see you

Madam President Western North Dakota is getting a lot of attention these days because of its vibrant energy economy but people also need to know about the spectacular landscape and natural beauty that thrives side by side with energy development in my home state so I want to speak today for a few minutes about a remarkable asset in my home state of North Dakota that was highlighted this past week in the New York Times The Times ranked Theodore Roosevelt National Park in Western North Dakota as fifth on its list of 52 worldwide destinations to visit in 2016 only Mexico City Bordeaux France the Mediterranean island of Malta and the care of the Caribbean city of Coral Bay st. John in the US Virgin Islands ranked ahead of Theodore Roosevelt National Park Tim Neville for the New York Times wrote of the park quote few presidents have done as much for conservation as Teddy Roosevelt flying to dickinson in Western North Dakota to visit the park named after him we're rolling grasslands dotted with bison collapse into the spectacular red white and gold Badlands of tumbling mud coolies and quote the more than 70,000 square acre part consists of three parts the South unit which is the largest of the two units the north unit and the site of Roosevelt's Elk Horn ranch which lies between the North and South units the little missouri river meanders through all three sections of the park Roosevelt captured a colorful picture of life on the Elk Horn ranch in his 1885 book called hunting trips of a ranch man quote my home ranch house stands on the river brain from the low long Brenda shaded by leafy cottonwoods one looks across sandbars and shallows to a strip of metal land behind which rises a line of sheer cliffs and grassy plateaus this veranda a pleasant place in the summer evenings when a cool breeze stirs along the river and blows and the faces of the tired men who lowell back in there rocking chairs what true american does not enjoy a rocking chair book in hand though they do not often read the books but rock gently to and fro gazing sleepily out at the weird-looking buttes opposite until their sharp outlines go indistinct and purple in the afterglow of the sunset end quote Theodore Roosevelt National Park is preserved what Roosevelt saw more than a century ago that reason it gets half a million visitors a year but more should come to see it and I believe more will as a result of the New York Times list and speaking of New York the times was the right venue to highlight Teddy Roosevelt National Park because Teddy Roosevelt was a native son of New York born in the part of Manhattan at the dawn of the age of concrete canyons and bustling growth more than a hundred and thirty-five years ago he fled the hectic pace of New York for the solitude of North Dakota's Western Badlands on a hunting trip during that trip is first to what was then called the Dakota Territory he was so taken with the land that he bought a ranch before he left for home with a year back at home in New York however tragedy struck in a cruel way for both Roosevelt's wife and his mother died in the same house on the same day he was crushed but being a man of action he sought to redirect his grief by throwing himself into a new adventure cattle ranching in North Dakota he went west and built the Elk Horn ranch on a plot of land that is now part of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park Roosevelt long acknowledged his debt to North Dakota he said quote I've always said I would have not have been president had it not been for my experience in North Dakota it was here that the romance of my life begin end quote Madam President that romance is still alive well in Western North Dakota my invite travelers from around the world to visit us and see what the New York Times described as quote a century of protecting America's magnificence end quote

chairman powell i want to thank you for bringing to the attention of this committee over the last several years the systemic risk posed by a tough legacy libor some 16 trillion dollars of instruments where we would not know the interest rate that the debtor is supposed to pay the creditor and 16 trillion dollars is a big problem we passed the relevant bill back in march and for those who think congress can't possibly deal with a problem until after the last minute we passed it a year and a half before the libor hit the fan uh that uh bill uh requires rulemaking by the fed and the rule making is supposed to be done by mid-september and uh that would put us in a that's the final step in making sure that these libor instruments uh are not a subject of uncertainty because even one basis point a thousandth of a percentage point of of risk or uncertainty turns out to be significant when you're dealing with 16 trillion dollars so chairman powell can we count on the fed in getting these uh regulations out by mid-september yeah so by the way thank you for all of your efforts on this technical problem um which have really really helped move it along um and in terms of the rule yes we know the deadline we know it's a tight deadline and i i'm assured that that uh people are working very hard to meet that deadline thank you um you're shrinking your balance sheet a lot of focus on how much you're shrinking your balance sheet but it also what matters is the content of the balance sheet you can invest in treasuries or you can invest in mortgage-backed securities if you go to an all-treasury portfolio and sell off your mortgage-backed securities that'll probably raise mortgage rates and we're trying to deal with the with housing inflation and housing affordability so whether it's the mortgage on an apartment building that might be built or whether it's a home mortgage keeping mortgage rates low i would think would help inflation is there any possibility that you would take a look at that and perhaps keep in your portfolio some of your mortgage-backed securities and perhaps have a mix of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries in your balance sheet so we're committed to having a mostly treasury not all but mostly treasury balance sheet and uh we don't have that now and and you know treasuries are going to start to roll off mortgages much less so we have not decided to start selling mortgage backed securities but we've said that we'll look at that again when uh when this process is further along and if we do i i don't actually think that that the things we would do would have much of an effect on on mortgage rates compared to well but the effects that we've already had yeah um we have obviously faced a recession risk biden says that a recession is not inevitable do you agree i don't think that a recession is inevitable thank you um there seems to be a great debate in this committee as to whether inflation is the result of covid and the effects of the ukraine war which are affect the entire globe or whether there are the result of biden and his policies which believe it or not are not applicable to germany britain or canada as much as we in the america like to think that we are the entire world and then we look at inflation rates and we see higher month-to-month inflation rates in canada and germany than here in the united states higher year on year uh in germany and the uk so we're in a situation where only if you believe that biden is responsible for german inflation can you reach the conclusion that uh it's biden's policies that have caused inflation in the united states which is pretty much on a par with what we see in other uh developed countries particularly europe a part of this is the idea that if biden just gives a speech saying we'd like to see a fossil free future that that somehow impairs the amount of oil that is produced in the united states and somehow then affects worldwide oil prices i would put into the record this article from forbes titled uh u.s oil companies have increased drilling by 60 in one year and uh without objection i hope that without objection and uh i would point out that we had higher oil production in this country in the first year of biden than the last year of trump then we had higher oil production in 2022 than 2021 and in 2023 we will have the highest oil production in the united states in our history unfortunately that will probably not be the lowest gas prices in our history so whether it's good or bad we've discovered that making speeches does not does not suppress production

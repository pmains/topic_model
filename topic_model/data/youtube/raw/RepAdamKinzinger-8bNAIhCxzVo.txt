AGAIN? >> WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE OTHER REPUBLICAN ON THE COMMITTEE,  CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER. CONGRESSMAN KINZINGER, LET'S  START WITH WHAT LIZ CHENEY SAID  THERE. ARE YOU SEEING ANY EVIDENCE THAT WHAT YOU'VE UNCOVERED IN THESE  HEARINGS IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON  YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN  THE HOUSE OR ON REPUBLICAN  VOTERS GENERALLY? >> WELL, ON THE HOUSE I DON'T  KNOW. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN, YOU KNOW,  EVERY DAY I CEASED TO BE AMAZE  OF HOW MUCH THEY'RE WILLING TO  ACCEPT AND NOT SAY ANYTHING. IN TERMS OF REPUBLICANS IN  GENERAL, YOU HAVE A BULK OF  REPUBLICAN VOTERS -- THIS DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE HAVING A TON OF IMPACT, MAYBE PEOPLE  ARE SHIFTING MORE TO  POTENTIAL -- WHAT I'M HEARING A  LOT OF ANECDOTAL STUFF AROUND  THE EDGES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE  BEEN HARD CORE WITH TRUMP WHO  CAN'T STAND HIM. IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE A BIT OF A  DIFFERENCE WITHIN MAYBE A GOP  PRIMARY, BUT I THINK ON THE  BIGGER TERM IT'S DENYING  ANYWHERE NEAR 50% OF THE  AMERICAN VOTERS WILLING TO  BASICALLY GO ALONG WITH  SOMETHING LIKE THE COUP ON  JANUARY 6th. I THINK THOUGH LONG ERM,  JONATHAN, IN FIVE YEARS I STILL  BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO FIND SOMEONE WHO ADMITS THEY'RE  A TRUMP SUPPORTER. >> IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO HEAR MERRICK GARLAND AS THIS HAS  UNFOLDED. THIS WEEK HE WAS QUITE EMPHATIC  IN SAYING AND REPEATING THAT NO  ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, DO YOU  THINK IT IS MORE LIKELY NOW THAT WE'LL ACTUALLY SEE SOMETHING --  AGAIN WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IN  AMERICAN HISTORY -- A FORMER PRESIDENT, A POTENTIAL  PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AGAIN, BE PROSECUTED BY THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT. >> WE HAVE NO SPECIAL INDICATION OBVIOUSLY INTO WHAT DOJ IS  DOING, THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE  INVESTIGATIONS. BUT IT DOES FEEL LIKE IN THE  LAST FEW MONTHS SINCE WE STARTED PRESENTING OUR EVERYDAY THERE'S MORE MOVEMENT IN DOJ. I HAVE TO WONDER WHAT THEY WERE  DOING THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. I'M NOT GOING TO COMPLAIN. LOOK, WE NEVER WANT TO -- THIS  IS IMPORTANT -- WE NEVER WANT TO GET IN A POSITION AS A COUNTRY  WHAT YOU SEE IN FAILED  DEMOCRACIES WHERE EVERY LAST  ADMINISTRATION IS PROSECUTED. THERE'S MASSIVE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN I'M GOING TO PROSECUTE  THE LAST ADMINISTRATION FOR  POLITICAL VENGEANCE AND NOT  PROSECUTING AN ADMINISTRATION  THAT LITERALLY ATTEMPTED A  FAILED COUP. THAT'S A PRECEDENT THAT I'M  WAY MORE CONCERNED ABOUT, IF  THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THIS  HAPPENED FROM A JUDICIAL  PERSPECTIVE AND THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD ON  PROSECUTING AND YOU DON'T YOU  HAVE SET THE FLOOR FOR FUTURE  BEHAVIOR OF ANY PRESIDENT AND I  DON'T THINK A DEMOCRACY CAN  SURVIVE THAT. I CERTAINLY HOPE THEY'RE MOVING  FORWARD AND I CERTAINLY THINK  THERE'S EVIDENCE OF CRIMES. >> YOU HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE A PROSECUTION OF TRUMP HIMSELF, I  MEAN, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STEP  BACK HERE, THIS IS A GUY WHO'S  SOUNDING LIKE HE'S GOING TO RUN  AGAIN, SO HE WOULD BE BEING  PROSECUTED BY THE PRESIDENT THAT HE'S POTENTIALLY RUNNING  AGAINST. >> SURE, LOOK, I WORRY ABOUT  EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED FOR  THE LAST FEW YEARS, AND REALLY I WORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT  COULD HAPPEN IN FUTURE AND THAT  INCLUDES THINGS LIKE WHAT  HAPPENS IF A PRESIDENT RUNNING  FOR OFFICE AND HE'S INDICTED HOW DOES THAT FEEL? BUT, THE CONVERSE OF THAT IS,  WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T DO  ANYTHING? WHAT HAPPENS IF WE LOOK AND SAY, HE'S RUNNING AGAIN, WE'RE  CONCERNED HOW IT LOOKS, THAT  COUP ATTEMPT THING LET'S PUT IT  BHIND US. >> AN INTERESTING PIECE ABOUT  YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH KEVIN  McCARNY IN "THE WASHINGTON  POST." HE WROTE ABOUT THE CONFERENCE  CALL THAT REPUBLICANS HAD ON NEW YEAR'S DAY, JUST FIVE DAYS  BEFORE THE ATTACK ON THE  CAPITOL, AND THIS IS THE PART  THAT JUMPED OUT TO ME. YOU DESCRIBING WHAT YOU SAID TO  KEVIN McCARTHY. KEVIN, YOU HAVE CONVINCED HALF  OF THE COUNTRY THAT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN. THERE'S GOING TO BE VIOLENCE,  AND McCARTHY'S ANSWER, THANKS,  ADAM. NEXT CALLER. JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT, OF COURSE YOU WERE TURNED OUT  UNFORTUNATELY TO BE RIGHT. McCARTHY CLEARLY DIDN'T BELIEVE  THIS STUFF, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN  DIFFERENT IF HE HAD STOOD UP AND HE SAID NO, THE ELECTION IS NOT  STOLEN, AND PUSHED BACK ON THIS  EFFORT OR WOULD HE JUST HAVE  BEEN PUSHED ASIDE, WAS IT TOO  LATE? >> LOOK, IT WOULD BE SO  DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW. WOULD HE HAVE BEEN PUSHED ASIDE  IN PROCESS? MAYBE. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE YOU  GOING TO STAND FOR IN YOUR LIFE? GO OUT BEING KNOWN AS THE GUY WHO ENABLED A FAILED COUP OR THE GUY WHO GOES OUT STANDING UP? VERY LIKELY COULD HAVE SURVIVED  THIS. WHEN HE WENT TO MAR-A-LAGO,  YOU ROBE THIS, A COUPLE WEEK PERIOD AFTER  JANUARY 6th ALMOST A STANDOFF  AMONG REPUBLICANS, WHAT DO WE  DO? THE SECOND KEVIN McCARTHY SHOWED UP AT MAR-A-LAGO TAKING THAT  PICTURE WITH DONALD TRUMP HE  LITERALLY RESURRECTED HIMSELF  POLITICALLY. HE WAS LIKE AN AMBULANCE DRIVER  WHO TOOK THOSE PADDLES AND BROUGHT DONALD TRUMP BACK TO  LIFE. THE FEAR THAT WENT THROUGH THE  REPUBLICAN RANKS OH, NO, HE'S  BACK ALIVE AGAIN WAS PLATABLE. WHEN PEOPLE DON'T TRUST  SOMEBODY, REPUBLICAN LEADERS DON'T TELL THEM THE TRUTH  THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THE TRUTH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  PARTICULARLY MANY REPUBLICAN  FRIENDS, YOUR LEADERS BY AND  LARGE HAVE BEEN LYING TO YOU,  THEY KNOW STUFF THAT'S VERY  DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY'RE  TELLING YOU, THEY KNOW THE  ELECTION WASN'T STOLEN. THEY'RE GOING TO SEND OUT  FUND-RAISING REQUESTS, THEY'RE  GOING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY FROM  YOU AND THEY'RE GOING TO USE TO  STAY IN POWER. YOU CAN BE MAD AT LIZ CHENEY AND I. WE'RE NOT THE ONES LYING TO YOU. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE  SECRET SERVICE. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE HEARD THROUGH  MOSTLY ANONYMOUS SOURCES, THEY  HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH CASSIDY  HUTCHINSON'S TESTIMONY. YOU HAVE PRESENTED CORROBORATED  EVIDENCE. IT WASN'T DIRECT EYEWITNESS  ACCOUNTS. WHY HAVE YOU NOT SPOKEN YET TO  THE LEAD DETAIL WHO WAS IN THAT  VEHICLE ON JANUARY 6th WITH  DONALD TRUMP OR THE DRIVER OF  THAT VEHICLE AND IS THAT GOING  TO COME? >> YEAH, THAT'S A QUESTION YOU  HAVE TO ASK THE SECRET SERVICE  AND YOU HAVE TO ASK THOSE  PARTICULAR PEOPLE. >> SO THEY'RE REFUSING TO  COOPERATE. THEY PUT OUT STATEMENTS SAYING  THEY'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO  TESTIFY UNDER OATH, ARE THEY  NOT? >> I WILL TELL YOU THIS MUCH,  THE COMMITTEE, THERE ARE ALWAYS  BACK AND FORTH NEGOTIATIONS, THE COMMITTEE MORE THAN WELCOME TO  TESTIFY UNDER OATH AND WALK THEM IN AT ANY MOMENT. IT'S NOT OUR DECISION. WHAT WE HAVE IS A VERY CREDIBLE  WITNESS IN CASSIDY HUTCHINSON. TALKING ABOUT WHAT SHE HEARD. SHE DID IT UNDER OATH. IN FRONT OF MILLIONS AND MFLS OF PEOPLE. YOU HEAR ANONYMOUS SOURCES,  PEOPLE OF INTEREST THEMSELVES,  COMING FORWARD AND SAYING THAT'S NOT TRUE, BUT UNWILLING TO DO IT UNDER OATH. NOW THIS IS ALL A SIDE-SHOW,  WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LIMO, BUT  IT DOES GO TO THE FACT THAT  DONALD TRUMP AND HIS PEOPLE  TRIED TO SAY SOMEBODY BEGGED HIM FOR A JOB OR AN ENDORSEMENT OR  THIS PART OF THE STORY ISN'T  TRUE TO TRY AND DISCREDIT A  WITNESS AND THEY'RE FAILING AT  THIS, TOO. THEY'RE FLAILING AROUND. CASSIDY HUTCHINSON IS A TRUTH W  MORE COURAGE THAN A VAST  MAJORITY OF MEN IN POLITICS  TODAY. >> WE HEARD AUDIO CLIPS OF THE  SECRET SERVICE RADIO TRAFFIC, I  MEAN THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY. IS THERE MORE OF THAT TO COME? DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO MORE OF  THAT? >> YEAH, WE DO. LOOK, WE HAVE ACCESS TO AT LEAST FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ALL OF  IT. WE UNDERSTAND WITH THE TEXT  MESSAGE SITUATION YOU KNOW  WHAT'S GOING ON THERE, THERE'S  SOME STUFF THAT WE STILL NEED TO GET. AS FAR AS WE KNOW WE HAVE  EVERYTHING. WE PRESENTED JUST BITS OF THAT. I THINK BOTH THE REPORT AND ANY  FUTURE HEARINGS WE CAN EXPLORE  IN MORE DEPTH. BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR THEY WERE VERY  WORRIED FOR THE LIFE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT OF  THE UNITED STATES SAT IN THE  DINING ROOM AND SAID LET'S SEE  WHERE IT GOES. WHEN HE FINALLY REALIZED IT  WOULDN'T WORK, HE SAID, YOU GUYS SHOULD GO HOME. >> BEFORE YOU GO, YOUR REACTION  TO STEVE BANNON FOUND GUILTY. >> IT'S GOOD. JUSTICE, RIGHT. COME IN. YOU CAN PLEAD THE FIFTH IF YOU  WANT IN FRONT OF OUR COMMITTEE,

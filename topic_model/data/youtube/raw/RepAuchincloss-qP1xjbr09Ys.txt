S MONTGOMERY WITH FALSIFYING PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND WITNESS TAMPERING. ED: THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE WAY WE IMAGINE ROBOTS TAKING OVER OUR GOVERNMENT. A ROBOT WRITTEN SPEECH WAS DELIVERED BY A HUMAN IN CONGRESS. LET'S GET TO DAVID BIENICK. WHY? >> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. NOT A SEARCH ENGINE LIKE GOOGLE WHERE YOU ENTER IN A REQUEST AND IT SPITS OUT A RESULT SOMEONE ALREADY PRODUCED. THESE NEW CHAT BOTS LETS YOU WRITE IN YOUR REQUEST AND SPIT OUT A BRAND-NEW DIGITAL WRITING, INCLUDING ONE THAT HAS NOW BEEN READ IN CONGRESS. >> NOTHING SEEMED OUT OF THE ORDINARY WHEN CONGRESSMAN JAKE AUCHINCLOSS WENT TO THE HOUSE FLOOR AND READ A ONE-MINUTE SPEECH URGING THE US AND ISRAEL TO FORM A JOINT CENTER STUDYING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. >> THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD IN AN ERA WHERE AI AND ITS APPLICATIONS ARE TAKING CENTER STAGE. EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS A ROUTINE SPEECH. >> WHAT NOBODY BUT AUCHINCLOSS AND HIS STAFF KNEW UNTIL HE ANNOUNCED IT LATER IS THAT HIS SPEECH WAS WRITTEN BY A COMPUTER USING THE SAME TECHNOLOGY HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. >> I WANTED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THIS TECHNOLOGY ON THE FLOOR OF CONGRESS SO POLICYMAKERS CAN ENGAGE IN THE DEBATE. >> LAUNCHED LESS THAN TWO MONTH AGO, CHAT GPT CAN CREATE ORIGINAL CUSTOM WRITINGS IN WHATEVER STYLE REQUESTED. RECENTLY IT GOT B'S AND C'S ON COLLEGE-LEVEL EXAMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA AND UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA'S HORTON SCHOOL OF BUSINESS. >> I TAUGHT A CLASS WHERE REQUIRED PEOPLE TO GENERATE PAPERS. >> NICK MONTFORT SAID HE HAD THE STUDENTS JUDGE THE QUALITY OF THE WRITING. IT IS SO GOOD, OFTEN HARD TO SPOT, EVEN BY OTHER COMPUTERS. SO ASSIGNMENTS MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE. >> TO BE MORE UP-TO-DATE, TO HAVE STUDENTS WRITING ABOUT THINGS HAPPENING IN THE PAST WEEK OR TWO. ED: IT IS ONLY UPDATED EVERY FEW MONTHS. GOOD NEWS FOR US. LET'S HAVE IT DO SOME WRITING. LET'S ASK IT TO WRITE A SCARY STORY FOR CHILDREN THAT TAKES PLACE ON BOSTON COMMON. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE HEART OF BOSTON, A BEAUTIFUL PARK CALLED THE COMMON. IT WAS A FAVORITE SPOT FOR CHILDREN TO PLAY AND EXPLORE. AT NIGHT, SAID TO BE HAUNTED BY A MYSTERIOUS CREATURE. AND IT WILL GO ON AND ON. I HAVE ASKED IT TO WRITE THIS KIND OF STORY SEVERAL TIMES, AND EACH TIME, THE STORY IS A BIT DIFFERENT. ED: I DO HAVE TO ASK ONE QUESTION. DID YOU WRITE THE STORY THAT AIRED ON THE NEWS, OR THE COMPUTER? ERIKA: GOOD QUESTION. -- MARIA: GOOD QUESTION. >> ONLY MY COMPUTER KNOWS. ED:

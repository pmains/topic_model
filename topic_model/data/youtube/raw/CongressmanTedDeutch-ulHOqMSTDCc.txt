as the gentleman mr. Deutsch from Florida Thank You mr. chairman first of all I introduced this bill because I met with the Assistant Secretary of Education for civil rights and asked how many investigations ongoing investigations into cases of anti-semitism were they pursue it and the answer was zero number one number two I appreciate all of the academic discussion and the references to the definition let me just read it for the record anti-semitism is a certain perception of Jews which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-jewish individuals and/or their property toward Jewish communities institutions and religious facilities that's the working definition then goes on to include contemporary examples and a fact sheet let me let me address some of what we've heard today one criticism of Israel is any criticism of Israel would be anti-semitic under this it's not true everyone understands that that's not the case that's number one number two that Jews because once they were victims are immune from criticism one while I'm offended by that and this is that has nothing to do with this piece of legislation three that somehow we should this is really some effort to go after Jewish anti-zionists is the reddest of red herrings and and for the suggestion was made that we have to look at all different sides there aren't all different sides to anti-semitism there aren't and the comment that was made that I find the most compelling is that a college campus is where a student search of student students are trying to find their voice I could not agree more but here's the question in all of this talk about about free speech which we hold dear and which we have to be careful this legislation any legislation would not violate or curtail in all of that discussion what's been missing is a discussion of the free speech of Jewish students who do not feel free to speak out they don't feel free to support Israel openly they don't feel free to join student government and talk about their Judaism and their involvement in their in their Jewish community and there are examples time and time again one last thing about this I understand that if you if you look only in terms of numbers across all campuses that while some of our academics here say it's not a problem I don't see it in my classroom I don't see it on my campus I don't hear about it and then 118 anti-semetic acts relative to the number of students on college campuses may not seem that great why shouldn't we be concerned about that in every one of those individuals and their ability to to sustain and fight back and have a Department of Education that's willing to investigate those kinds of attacks I this one this one is is really hard sometimes for me to understand we know what's happening on college campuses and yes I'm concerned about professors being able to teach I am but I also know that that college students like my own and their friends who are on campuses who actually see what's happening who will avoid parts of campus I have heard from their friends will avoid parts of campus because they're afraid if they're wearing a Jewish star that they're going to be shouted down that's not students finding their voice that's one student using his or her voice to to stifle the free speech of that other student yes rabbi Cooper congressman I just want to come back again to this visual because it's in real time this was posted by a professor at Rutgers University on his Facebook page we have a young girl 19 years old who went to Rutgers because she wants to get a degree in food science this is the guy she's going to have to go and sign up for because right now there is absolutely no price to pay there's no red line nothing about someone in the position of responsibility who openly expresses such vile hate and this there's nothing to protect that fresh freshmen from pursuing her course right and and mr. Greenblatt am I am I so off-base here have we been going down the wrong path worrying about the hundred and eighteen cases so far of anti-semitism your Congressman you're dead on I mean again I know some people teach courses over the course of 15 weeks the a deal has been tracking this for over a hundred years and data doesn't lie and what you pointed out about the definition is exactly correct this doesn't inhibit the ability of an individual student faculty or otherwise to criticize an Israeli policy but it does acknowledge as that definition does that definition by the way that was done in consultation with leading experts from academia and communal organizations and it's used by our embassies around the world to track anti-semitic incidences so some might not like it in its abstraction but in its practicality I would submit to this committee it has been vital to our State Department doing its work to protect Jewish communities around the world mr. chairman before I yield back I would just finally make one last point again criticism criticism of Israel Israel's government Israel's policies are more than fair they're welcome here just as they are in Israel but when you take the position it's one thing to criticize those policies but when you take as your position the very suggestion that Israel as a nation does not have a right to exist and you then try to impose that to to shut down others that is not a student finding his or her voice that is students or or others on a college campus using their voices to silence others in a way that is wholly unacceptable which this definition is simply trying to address and I yield back think

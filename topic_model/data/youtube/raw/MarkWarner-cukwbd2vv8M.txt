Simon bill I'm gonna start with Clarence reform I think you'll call them when we had the hearings you know bipartisan complete agreement that system is broken seven and forty thousand plus on the backlog this is a security risk this is an economic risk in terms of our ability to then to brief companies I was very concerned that we invited all the relevant parties testify OMB chose not to I would like you to give us an update on whether OMB is on the team now and trying to make this a priority and we'd had some discussion that that large number backlog you were gonna be able to cut a dramatic amount of that backlog back in a relatively short timeline can you give us an update on that thank you vice chairman Warner yes as a matter of fact I think subsequent to our beginning of this process back in March and our trusted workforce 2.0 initiative with our partners Office of Management budget OPM and DoD as well as a host of other organizations in departments we have been working diligently to provide this committee and the government with two specific things number one a dramatic reduction of the backlog and number two the development of a new business process how we will vet qualified citizens in the u.s. in an agile expeditious manner it's the same time making sure they're trusted with respect to their question in the backlog we currently are in the final stages of the paper for the DNI to issue that's being coordinated through the inter government process right now which I believe with some dramatic changes to how we currently do the business process of investigations once implemented will probably get us to position we could estimate probably 20% reduction in backlog within six months only 20% in six months that's a little less ambitious than I think we discussed earlier and is Owen be part of the process at this point OMB is a major part of the process again the four main individuals are OMB OPM DoD and odni and will these new business processes include reciprocity and youcome standards between government and our contractors yes sir again my hope would be since I understand a lot of these were on the secret level on the DoD side there was an ability to take I thought a much greater percentage of that backlog down with administrative action and then on going forward basis I would hope that we would see a reduction greater than 20% that would only take us down you know we move from 7 and 40,000 half-a-million that still doesn't do very well if were at the end of this into this calendar year senator I agree with you and concur I think some of the contingencies will be predicated upon the transfer of the MBI be inventory to DoD and how that impacts the planned mitigation efforts we do not have active algorithm for that at this moment but we are excited that 20% is probably conservative number and the question of counter intelligence with China I was again number of members on this committee has raised concerns about certain of the Chinese telecom companies and their penetration into the American market I was actually pleased the president acted on one of those companies DT now it appears that that is simply a bargaining chip and negotiations with China I don't think that is the appropriate way if this is a security threat it is a security threat and needs to be dealt with as such not as a bargaining chip in terms of greater trade negotiations my concern as well is that we are asking purchases of equipment at local government private sector we're asking others who are in the venture community and others to understand the threat of China but I don't believe we can fully briefed that threat if they don't have appropriate security clearances within their own institutions again another challenge that comes out of the backlog issue how do we how will we'll be able to move aggressively on having a standardized brief to universities tech companies VCS on the real threat of China and will that brief I think it would have to be some parts classified as well as unclassified you want to dress that first Germany I would concur and I think over the last two years we've made a lot of progress with our interagency partners the FBI and DHS in promulgating such advice in awareness and threat to not only academia industry with respect to the threat from China and other nation states who are pernicious in our they're stealing our proprietary data and trade secrets we will continue to do that and work with associations and I concur with your point that I think the private sector leadership that the CEO level needs to be a little bit more active in terms of obtaining security clearances so that that information that is classified and get them more effective and efficient manner

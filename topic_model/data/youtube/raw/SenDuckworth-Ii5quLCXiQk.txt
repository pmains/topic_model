Thank You mr. chairman let me just remark on how in I am of the bravery of a lieutenant captain or a lieutenant commander Elliot and enemies before testimony today and also of my colleague senator mcsalley let me just start off by saying that I do agree that the military has shown that it has utterly failed at handling sexual assault through the UCMJ process and I certainly do support removing sexual crimes out of the UNCA UCMJ process but here here's where I struggle as a former commander of an assault helicopter company myself there are crimes that I want to remain in control of for good order and discipline and the functioning of my unit for example violent assaults that are not sexual in nature that have to do with racism hate crimes that sort of thing and that's where my struggle is and certainly our ranking member has been so kind in working with me and and and we've been working with it on this for years and Martha you have as well you know from our time in the house and this is something we struggle and when we and I have to say I still don't see the improvement in the UCMJ UCMJ process in the military and so I remain supportive of taking sexual crimes up but I'm not sure that I'm there on all all a felony or even violent crimes what I'd like to touch on here though is is beyond the criminal convictions which we're going to work on you have our pledge that we will keep working on this the criminal the criminal convictions do provide some sense of justice but I still don't think it makes you whole not that you could ever be made whole again in the way you were before but but what is there that we can do to make the lives of survivors better what more can we do for survivors to make sure that they have what they need to process and heal and that includes stopping the retaliation that includes letting you resume your careers and be successful in the careers that you dreamt about from the time that you entered the military it could could Colonel Harry I'm current person could you talk about that and I mean maybe the four of you could talk a little bit and touch on what would what would make it I hazard to say to say better but but what else can be done well it's very controversial for some reason but I say start by believing there's a forum of the survivors we talk to a protected offender and survivors I talked to when I was active duty it is very hurtful when they feel like they're chained commands not believing them and not supporting them and so start by believing doesn't mean you're going to prosecute just start by believing means I accept that you have been through this traumatic event and I want to be in ER and help you I think Congress has done a great deal to help survivors on the back end with the VA still ways to go on that but we the survivor community appreciates that the other thing is just being able to flourish after this happens and understand that any survivor who's gone through trauma is going to have stumbles and don't don't hold those stumbles against them to the degree that they're driven out as the dod IG is shown give them that chance to thrive in the environment even after they'd been assaulted thank you thank you we've made there have been a bunch of changes to try to assist victims and I think they've the victims can speak more directly we do see a lot of victims at Swan or we hear from a lot of victims and one of the things they've asked for it is an actual legitimate anonymous reporting mechanism not the restricted versus the unrestricted reporting but something similar to what has been developed and has been fielding on a number of university campuses and now is getting actually some widespread coverage it's called its Callisto it's an anonymous reporting system or database where a victim can report their assault and their assailant just put it into a database and then that what happens is they connect victims that have the same assailant and they allow those victims to connect with each other and then they then you're more likely if you're not alone if it's if you have run into you've been assaulted by somebody that assaulted another person and now you've connected you're more likely to come forward you're more likely to be mutually supporting to each other that's one idea that we have recommended to DoD and I understand that this some they may be feeling something similar for the very first time it's a way for victims to tell their story to unburden themselves in a certain way and then potentially be connected to somebody else who was similarly assaulted by the exact same person excuse me I think there's a couple ways to go about it first of all commanders need to be trained better to understand that every victim is different what that's not you oh sorry okay every victim is different you know I I wanted to go to work like and that's I focused on work we had a new victim ownership and she was like got transferred off and she needed a lot of time to process the other thing is um discussing our training I don't we've improved our training a lot but I still don't think we address it appropriately like me when I was going through this I'm like I'm an officer I'm the third highest ranking person on the ship this doesn't happen to me this happens to these junior people you know the women are raped in our training the men are grabbed our you know body parts put on them they're not raped why don't we address the problems we're still not doing effective training yes so I believe just have more of a preventative before you even get to be a victim and I think that that comes from a true understanding and going back to Senator Mix Ali's comment about how do we change that culture so I think that right now sexual assault is seen as a fear-based knowledge and it's not taken seriously I personally after graduating from the Academy did not believe in the sexual assault response program just for many reasons and it took a truly inspiring leader who I reported to a candid discussion one day prior to my sexual assault even occurring and the way that he was able to passionately stand up for women who he has experienced while he was in command if we could put those leaders identify them truly I sent him incentivize them to become these advocates and not just randomly Archer but like assigned the role but people who actually want to be there and want to be able to protect past future and every type of victim I believe that that would help change the culture and I mean people stand up we have signs that say stand up speak up see something say something and honestly as a victim being in the Army after a year while I was waiting for this a trial it was insulting to see these signs in the hallways to see my victim advocate still posted even though it was not a good experience for me and to see people draw mustaches on them sharp is a joke we need true leaders to stand up and truly train what we need our soldiers to be expected of hold them to the higher standard knowledge teach them how psychologically to recognize these signs of predicating that was a really big for healing and for me understanding what had happened to me understanding the cycle of abuse and if commanders could be able to to recognize this abuse cycle instead of blaming the victim and instead of maybe even blaming the alleged there more knowledge and they they have the power still so thank you you've been very generous mr. chairman Thank You senator Scott

mr. president the senator from Texas mr. president I rise today to give voice to a town in Texas it's a small town of about fourteen thousand people in that town there's a high school a school of about 1500 students one year ago on May 18th a deeply disturbed and deranged student committed an unspeakable act of evil which shook Santa Fe shook Texas and shook the entire country it left our nation weeping just before 8 o'clock in the morning the shooter began firing weapons in the classrooms through doors whereas fellow students were taking shelter within minutes the attacker senselessly murdered eight students and two teachers their names of the following jerod conrad black christian riley garcia shana fischer aaron Kyle McCloud Glenda and Perkins Angelique Ramirez Sabiha Sheikh Christopher stoned Cynthia Tisdale and Kimberly Vaughn I would like us to pause for a moment of silence as we remember these brave souls their names will live on their killer's name will not his name is never worth mentioning again 13 others well we're also brutally wounded including three substitute teachers Flo Rice one of the substitute teachers at the high school that day was shot five times I've gotten to know Flo and her husband Scott well and the weeks and months since the shooting but that day was not merely a day of great tragedy it was also a day of incredible bravery Santa Fe police officers did their duty and swiftly engaged the shooter one of those police officers John Barnes was critically wounded in the process they shot back and ultimately they took the coward in the custody Santa Fe students also proved themselves to be heroes one of them Riley Garcia made the ultimate sacrifice he held a door shut to give other students time to escape and he was killed in the process other students tended to the wounded and to each other in the wake of the shooting Texans grieved with the families and the friends of those we lost we heard stories of terror and stories of hope I was at my home in Houston that morning Santa Fe High School is about 45 minutes away from my house and when I got the call as to what was happening I jumped in a truck and headed down there spent the entire day with families who had lost their children with first responders with teachers with school leaders with a community that was grieving mightily but in Santa Fe I also saw a boundless spirit and hope and unity I remember that afternoon traveling to the hospital and visiting with a number of the students who had been shot and wounded that day and remaining Clayton a young man who had been shot just that morning he had pins in his arm from being shot twice Clayton described how he jumped over the fence even have even after having been shot and his friends helped carry him to safety this young man described how he's a bull rider and a pole vaulter I asked him if he's a lefty or righty he said he's a lefty and that was the arm that was wounded but he said with a smile you know now I got to learn to ride a bowl with my right arm that's the toughness and the spirit of these students and their entire community all across Texas all across the country millions of Americans lifted those children lifted those families up in prayer you know it has become politically fashionable for some now to divide thoughts and prayers to suggest that thoughts and prayers are not appropriate I will say this we should always lift up in prayer those who are victimized by violence by brutality by terrorism by murder I believe in the power prayer and I'll tell you the community of Santa Fe leaned on the power of prayer in the wake of that tragedy now thoughts and prayers are not themselves a substitute for action and in the days that weeks that followed I met with mothers and fathers and teachers and students I hosted Santa Fe students here in the Senate dining room we talked with law enforcement with first responders I sat down with the president who traveled down to meet with the Santa Fe families I participated in a roundtable with Governor Abbott and families from Santa Fe and other communities victimized by violence and officials at federal state and local levels we discussed how we can do a better job protecting our schools protecting our children we've lost too many kids to homicidal maniacs and it has to stop we have to do much more to keep guns out of the hands of violent criminals to better treat the mentally ill all while preserving and protecting our constitutional rights there was a universal agreement in the wake of Santa flay as a state and as a nation that we had to see justice done to take every step to try to ensure that such an attack never occurs again soon after I was gratified to hear that the Department of Education announced 1 million dollars in federal funds for the Santa Fe Independent School District through a project school emergency response to violent grant project serve it's a crucial first step in federal funding to help the Santa Fe school community recover and protect all its students but the story doesn't end there in addition to a state prosecution most of us assume there would be a federal case against the Santa Fe shooter as well because his massive assault was on students and teachers at a public school and crucially because authorities found explosive devices on the school grounds and off camp campus including pipe bombs and a Molotov cocktail then a reasonable observer this would open the case to federal explosives or terrorism charges and all of us were committed to seeing the attacker prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law early press reports however indicated that federal authorities were not going to proceed with a federal case those press reports dismayed me dismayed many in particular because the shooter was under 18 at the time of the massacre which means that is likely the maximum state sentence he would receive is 40 years which means if only state charges were brought the shooter would be potentially eligible for release at 57 years old releasing this mass murderer into society wouldn't be just and it wouldn't be right and thankfully Attorney General Barr agreed and it's been public or publicly reported now that federal charges have come forward to ensure that this attacker is brought to justice and faces the full consequences for the horrific acts of that morning as we pause this week to remember the 10 people who lost their lives and the 13 people who were wounded one year ago we should reflect on what's changed but also on what still needs to be done to stop this epidemic of mass shootings and school shootings in particular last year was very proud that Congress authorized nearly a billion dollars in school safety funding legislation that I was a co-sponsor of nearly a billion dollars that schools can use to improve school safety including hardening doors so that shooters can't shoot through the school doors anymore shrinking the number of entrances and exits installing metal detectors and hiring armed police officers to keep our kids safe that was an important first step but we need to do more that's why this week I'm reintroducing two important bills first I'm reintroducing legislation to authorize more funding for school safety and to enable greater targeting of the felons and fugitives who try to buy firearms illegally if a felon or fugitive tries to purchase a firearm illegally that felon or fugitive should be prosecuted and they should be put in federal jail in 2013 my first year in the Senate I introduced legislation with my friend senator Grassley from Iowa to create a gun crime task force at the federal Department of Justice to ensure that federal convictions are in the national database and to direct the Department of Justice to prosecute the felons and fugitives who try to illegally buy guns to put them in jail before they can take the lives of more innocence sadly cynically Senate Democrats filibustered that legislation they prevented it from passing into law by demanding a 60-vote threshold in light of the tragedies of Santa Fe and parkland and Highlands Ranch High School just last week I urge my colleagues to join me in making this common-sense bill law this Congress let's direct law enforcement resources to stopping violent criminals before they commit more heinous murders I'm also reintroducing the bipartisan school safety enhancement act with Democratic Senator Doug Jones which would allow local communities to utilize school student support and academic enrichment grants to reinforce school safety infrastructure and technology installing metal detectors bulletproof doors and windows and establishing an efficient system for communicating important information to law enforcement and to parents are all important steps in improving school safety I hope that we can join together and pass these bills so that our students are safer and we can do more to prevent future mass shootings what happened in Santa Fe a year ago was a tragedy the night of the shooting there was a candlelight prayer vigil in the community the public park in downtown Santa Fe and even as you saw families grieving and an unspeakable agony their hearts breaking you also saw people coming together when I was at the vigil that night as you wept and mourned with students and parents experiencing the ultimate agony you saw at the same time students and parents in the community leaning on each other holding each other holding each other up praying alongside each other praying with each other giving thanks for the heroism and strength that I think is the only way a community makes it out of a tragedy like that the last year has been an extremely difficult year for the Santa Fe families and for the community that mourning is indelibly marked on to that community at the same time they've been able to lean on each other and rely upon each other to support each other and to lift each other up in prayer I want to conclude by saying to the families in Santa Fe we are with you we support you we love you and we're there for you and to my colleagues in Congress we need to unite together to make our schools safer to prosecute felons and fugitive before they commit acts of murder and to do everything to stop this horrific mass shooting epidemic and we need to do it now in the partisan battles focus on the bad guys and stop them before more lives of innocence are taken and I'm Speaker I yield the floor

on the eve of the next hearing we're also learning that panel members are beefing up security because of very ugly and violent threats against them we're joined now by a key select committee member congressman adam kinziker congressman thanks so much for joining us i know that over the weekend you revealed that you received a very disturbing death threat directed at your family and you are these threats ongoing are you among the members who are now getting a security detail so look i'll tell you the threats are constant they've increased um you know i even heard a voicemail just this morning that we got last night threatening execution that's kind of seems to be the uh the normal thing nowadays was just threatened execution but this the reason i released this letter this was sent directly to my home directed to my wife and it went on to threaten execution not just to me but of her and my five-month-old child and i think it was important to put out to show the depravity of what's existing out there the fact that there are people that literally would come up with this idea of killing a five-month-old because you disagree with me being on the january 6 committee so we have we have security we've we've had to up our security posture and uh we're aware but we're gonna move on it's not gonna it's not gonna hinder us and it's not gonna intimidate us i've been in touch with some of your colleagues on the select committee and they've been getting really ugly threatening uh and and voicemails and all sorts of things like that as well have they been receiving beefed up security as far as you know uh look i i think uh if they need it they're getting it you know the capitol police and all those agencies are are very focused on what they need to do but uh yeah i mean look they're all getting these threats i mean particularly liz and i because we you know are considered rhinos in the gop because we want the truth but what that shows is when you stir up evil when you bring in light to a dark place you see cockroaches get angry and scatter and we're bringing light we're bringing truth to the lies that have permeated many people's minds that doesn't it's not gonna make them happy you're referring to the vice chair liz cheney of wyoming uh you say she's been getting these kinds of ugly death threats as well well i i haven't talked to her about him but i i can make an assumption that if i am she probably is too all right let's talk about tomorrow's hearing it's going to be very significant i know the focus will be on the pressure that former president trump put on the u.s justice department you're going to be leading the questioning what can we expect to learn so i think what we've done so far you know when january 6 happened i think a lot of people's focus became that day in the violence and that was important it was a terrible day but what a lot of people forget is all the pressure points leading up to january 6. by the way nothing's changed to prevent anything from like that from happening again so we saw the pressure on the vice president we saw the pressure tuesday very emotionally on these state leaders and now we're going to talk about the department of justice a lot of this information is known a lot isn't and we're going to show what happened as the president was doing his best to basically put the department of justice stamp on his lies and conspiracies to embolden people so i would encourage folks to tune in and uh and see yet another prong of what the president the former president tried to do to take away no matter who you voted for to take away your vote yeah we'll be watching of course uh the former trump white house counsel pat cipolloni isn't appearing publicly when we understand but did your committee actually tape his closed-door interview with the panel will we see or hear any of that tomorrow well i don't want to talk again get into the details what you'll see her here tomorrow i will say this we do want pat sipoloni to come in and cooperate more you're going to see tomorrow men that did not necessarily want to be out there talking about this stuff but they understand their oath to the constitution and their responsibility to the country we want pastor bologna to come in and and be um and cooperate in a robust way there's no reason he shouldn't and we hope to see more of that was his closed door interview with the panel on tape did you record it again i don't want to go into the details because we may or may not talk about some of that tomorrow um but we certainly want to talk to him again and we hope he he obliges let's see if he does will you provide any more information congressman on the republican members of congress your committee says actually requested pardons pardons from then president trump again i wish i could give you all that preview but uh i'd say tune in tomorrow we're going to do a very fulsome look at this aspect about doj and we'll see if that question you ask is addressed or not but just know we continue to get new information literally daily new tips that come in new information this investigation isn't over this is us presenting what we've seen so far well speaking of new information i know you've said you've seen at least some of the footage from this british filmmaker alex holder who was filming with the trump campaign before and after january 6th how revealing is this footage so look it's anytime you get any more information particularly when it's close to family or close to the former president uh we're very interested in that there are areas where where we think we're we're very interested and we can piece together uh but i'll leave that to the investigators that are going through that they know the depth of what uh where they would like to see that plugged in what it confirms what it denies uh but i i appreciate the filmmaker doing he was he was asked to subpoena and it worked out well because it's what he should do your committee chairman benny thompson says jenny thomas the wife of supreme court justice clarence thomas has responded to your committee's request to speak with her do you expect her to testify publicly or privately my expectation would be probably privately a deposition uh we'll see what those details are you know look we're not out to get anybody but it's obvious that she has said and we have seen things that she may know stuff uh we hope she comes in and and doesn't plead the fifth like some have some are concerned about what it means for their own uh self just come in and tell us the truth again we're not out to get anybody and i hope it's obvious that you know despite what some of my colleagues in my party try to say this is partisan this isn't partisan this is this is a american investigation to put out the facts and by the way if there's anything partisan about it it's that all the witnesses have been republicans mostly appointed by donald trump we're grateful to you congressman for all you're doing stay safe over there please uh give our best wishes to your family as well congressman adam kinzinger thanks so much for joining us thank you coming

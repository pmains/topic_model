speaker this misguided provision in dodd-frank requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to mandate that public companies disclose whether so-called quote Conflict Minerals they use in their products benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its nine adjoining countries despite its best intentions sections 1502 has been ineffective and in some cases has been shown to have increased violence in central Africa that is why this suspension that I am proposing passed the House last year as an amendment to the F s GG appropriations bill in a full repeal of section 1502 passed the House with this this Congress as part of the financial choice act Conflict Minerals referred to tin tank tungsten tantalum and gold which have been used in a variety of products from cell phones cosmetics jewelry Footwear apparel and even auto suppliers located in West Michigan mr. chairman the breadth of voices opposing 15:02 is remarkable and I'd like to start with those that matter most for too long the people of central Africa have been overlooked in this debate even though there are the ones who suffer from dodd-frank unintended consequences without objection I'd like to ask to insert into an open letter from seventy Congolese leaders and other regional experts who wrote in that section 1502 provisions quote inadvertently incentivize buyers on the international market to pull out of the region altogether and source their minerals elsewhere as a result these conflict minerals and movement has yet to lead to meaningful improvement on the ground and has had a number of unintended and damaging consequences dodd-frank symp Act on African minors may seem unimportant too many rich country activists but in the Congo it has been the question of life or death according to a Washington Post article entitled how a well-intentioned US law left Congolese miners jobless section 1502 quote set off a chain of events that has propelled millions of Congolese miners and their families deeper into poverty the article goes on to share the story of how a Congolese teenager could no longer feed himself after dodd-frank ravaged the country's mining sector forcing the young man to actually join an armed group the outcome diametrically opposed in the goal of section 1502 mr. chairman no one can claim that these effects were unforeseeable in fact in a letter to sec commenting on section 1502 leaders from three Congolese mining cooperatives predicted that the conflict minerals rule would lead to a devastating boycott these miners wrote quote we cannot continue to suffer any longer do we now have to choose between dying by a bullet or starving to death question mark and end quote I ask my colleagues to remember the Congolese aren't alone in their suffering the SE C's rules apply to nine other nations as if they were all one single country section 1502 treats over 230 million Africans living in ten distinct nations as one undifferentiated group dodd/frank supporters will say that at this point some countries neighboring Congo may help smuggle minerals on behalf of armed groups which is why we need to paint with such a broad brush but I would ask my colleagues to name another example where a country's economy and each of its neighbors is targeted due to a pris k-- do we design russia sanctions to apply to each of its fourteen adjoining countries to do Iranian sanctions implicate all seven of its neighbors perhaps advocates for section 1502 believe that there's no smuggling from Russia and Iran but the real issue seems to be this dodd-frank supporters have no problem treating African Africans differently from other regions of the world I find that troubling so now let's consider implementation of 15 - its 1502 itself in April of this year the GAO reported that section 1502 has produced little meaningful information on conflict mineral sourcing it found that more than half of the companies in 2016 couldn't even determine what country their minerals came from most importantly virtually none of the companies could tell whether their minerals benefited armed groups a conclusion that echoed Gao s findings from 2015 and 2014 as well no wonder companies can't figure this out mr. chairman even the Department of Commerce has reported that it's unable to determine whether smelters around the world use minerals minerals traceable to armed groups in other words dodd-frank is asking US companies some of which are very small and medium sized entrepreneurs in large corporations supply chains to produce information that even the federal government can't provide as if it weren't enough the courts are also struck down parts of section is section 1502 for violating companies First Amendment rights the Trump administration's SEC has had enough of section section 1502 failures and is now reexamining the conflict mineral rule the State Department is now conducting a review to see how responsible sourcing can be undertaken more effectively the amendment I am offering today would suspend 1502 while the administration completes its assessment mr. chairman the facts I've laid out on 1502 aren't partisan and a suspension shouldn't be either so let me close with the words of Barack Obama's Security and Exchange Commission chair Mary Jo white in 2013 who said quote seeking to improve safety and minds for workers or to end horrible Human Rights atrocities in the the DRC are compelling objective objectives which lettuce and I wholeheartedly share but as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission I must question as a policy matter using federal securities laws and the SCC's power of mandatory disclosure to accomplish these goals end quote I should tell us something when even Democrats owned Securities and Exchange Commission chair warns that dodd-frank overreached on conflict minerals a suspension would be something that Republicans and Democrats can agree on and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment I yield back the balance of my time

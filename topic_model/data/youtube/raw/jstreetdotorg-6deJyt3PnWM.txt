good afternoon my name is John Rose off and I am the senior rabbi of Temple Israel of hollywood in los angeles i am the future of pro-israel activism because I believe that progressive Zionism is the best assurance that Israel will remain secure Jewish and democratic Gloria Steinem was right when she said that all politics is personal and so before I share a bit about how my pro-israel activism has shaped my life and Rabbinate I want to say a few words about my roots in Zionists and Jewish leadership in late 19th century my half my family left Ukraine for Canada and the United States and the other half went to Palestine those who may Dahlia were religious Jews and arrived in Jerusalem in 1880 along with Jeremy been amis great-grandparents they my family were among the original settlers of petach tikva when they moved there in eighteen eighty two my great-great uncle was famous as petach tikva zoo shomare policeman and as both Theodor Herzl zand Haim Weitzman's bodyguard whenever they visited the land and I had the good fortune of meeting him when I was six years old in 1956 big man another cousin became the founding professor of the department of Near Eastern languages at the Hebrew University translated the Quran and a thousand and one nights to Hebrew yet another help facilitate the Camp David Accords as a Knesset attorney and the third is the sitting Speaker of the Knesset though his politics and mine are obviously not alike in Los Angeles my uncles and aunts were top leaders of the United Jewish appeal the Jewish Federation the American Jewish Committee Brandeis camp institute and the Jewish centers associations in the 1950s 60s and 70s I was tutored in classic mid century Jewish liberalism and claim as my childhood rabbis to giants Leonard Biermann and Richard levy whom entered me in civil disobedience during the civil rights in Vietnam eras taken together all roads led me to serious engagement and Jewish religious communal and Zionist life my passion for Israel was especially inspired in those heady years immediately after the 1967 six days war and reflecting the sentiment of yehuda halevi though my body is here but could say Marv at the far ends of the West liebe Ibanez rock my heart lives in the east I feel as at home there as I do here and when I'm not there I yearned to be there and to be with her my adult life has been in part to struggle to join my two central worlds as an American liberal Jew in a no have on the oh hey of medina Essaouira hell it is therefore as a progressive reform Zionist that I have found my true and natural home as such I take the view that Jewish nationalism must envision our peoples independence as a means of serving humanity as a whole that we might fulfill Isaiah's vision to be an ore legume a light to the nation's I believe that social justice must be applied to all the major issues confronting Israeli society including Israeli Arab and Palestinian rights minority rights immigrant worker rights women's rights gay and lesbian rights poverty education and justice Israel becoming a just society in every way needs to be the end game if Israel is to live its own declaration of independence it isn't enough for us here in the West to mouth the right words we have to be prepared to put our money where our mouths are to visit Israel often to support those progressive forces they're working towards these good just indecent ends and for some of us to make aliyah among my chief missions as an American rabbi has been to inspire and lead my congregation to embrace progressive Zionist values by introducing them to the land people's religions cultures history and politics of Israel in the Middle East to that end I have led many congregational missions to the Jewish state established through the Los Angeles Tel Aviv partnership a relationship between my day schools sixth grade students and parents and the sixth grade students and parents of the tahala Elementary School in North Tel Aviv raised funds in support of the reform movement sister a religious Action Center the Israel movement for progressive Judaism in the building of to reform synagogues one in the VATS etzion and the other ramat hasharon i serve on the advisory board of the Daniel centers of Tel Aviv and as a national vice president of the Association of reform Zionists of America and I've sold millions of dollars of State of Israel bonds over many years I've also supported the good work of rabbis for human rights B'Tselem new Israel fund Shalom achshav and a new organization which many don't know about yet but I hope you'll look it up online called kaduche working for the separation of church and state in israel I tell you of my personal involvement because just as we expect much of the Jewish state we diaspora Jews have an obligation to give back to Israel not just our love and ideas but of our time expertise and treasure especially when it's hard to do so when we feel frustrated angry an alienated by Israel's government's policies and direction the particular organizations I support represent a vision of Israel that is Jewish democratic pluralistic compassionate and just they and others like them need strong American Jewish support just as we American Jews need Israel to embody the values we cherish in a word we need israel in israel needs us it's a relationship that must be intimate and mutual the Talmud makes this point when it says yo Tara ha ago rosealee nook para wrote c'est la Haneke even more than the calf needs to suck the mother needs to suckle though my synagogue is located at the far ends of the West I feel grateful that by and large my community has embraced my progressive Zionist vision even so I have my share of members who don't share that vision and who I know I have irritated a little bit over the years the challenge for me as their rabbi is to want at once draw them close provoke them not alienate them and comfort them the key to doing so is to show them sincere respect for their vision as different as it is from what I believe even as I hope they respect mine as different as it is from there's over many years I and many in my community have created and nurtured a safe and open space to talk about Israel and engage multiple perspectives and viewpoints it's through this kind of robust dialogue that religious and community leaders can best support Israel even so I've been attacked for my progressive Zionist activism I was especially criticized when my synagogue hosted Jeremy ben-ami this past spring in dialogue with david suissa the president of the Los Angeles Jewish Journal an equally passionate articulate an intelligent Israel advocate who incidentally is speaking at this conference after Jeremy invited him to do so when they appeared together a temple israel of hollywood i had already been tagged communally as a J Street rabbi for articles that I penned in support of j street's vision and activism and in this role I know that I've been dismissed by many in the LA Jewish community as being beyond the pale of acceptable pro-israel activism I know and you know that we are not beyond the pale our pro-israel pro-peace positions represent according to recent surveys not only the majority in the American Jewish community but also that of hundreds of thousands of Israelis more importantly progressive pro-israel activism is the future because the alternative which represents the status quo and the brutal occupation and submission of another people is what most in dangers Israel's integrity and existence and its future as a Jewish and democratic states and so all I can say to all of us is huzzah huzzah vineet Kazakh maybe we be strong and together in all of our efforts strengthen one another you

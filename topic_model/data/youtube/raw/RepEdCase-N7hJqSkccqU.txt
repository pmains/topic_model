aloha i'm congressman case another edition of my cruising with congressman case i'm here with an incredibly special guest my colleague and partner in the u.s house congressman kaialii aloha hello how's it going today great good excited good to see you um you know this has been as we take this it's december 20th 2021 so the first thing we want to say is a very merry christmas and a happy new year this will probably air after christmas but we're in the christmas spirit and of course we're both looking forward to 2022. um you know 2021 has been a difficult year in many many ways but for me uh the high point of my year was having congressman cahelli join me as my full partner in congress it's been a wonderful partnership he has grown incredibly during the year and it's really cool to spend a little bit of joint time at the end of the year just talking story we're gonna cruise today uh in my car it's a kind of an old car you know i think you'll be okay i'll be okay it's the kind of car speaking of where we are we're at the makapuu lighthouse and the reason we're here is because this is where the first and second congressional districts uh split so on this island at least at buckapuku lighthouse if you go on the leeward side that's first congressional my district if you go on the windward side second congressional kai's district and so we're gonna we're gonna go cruising on down his district waimanalo kailua kaneohe and then cross over and spend some time in my district and talk story along the way looking forward to it hello thanks for having me and we're excited to uh share with you the second and first congressional district on the island of oahu and uh very very excited to go stop by local businesses and uh take you to some special places and some special people that we want to feature today so i'm all for putting this together okay cool let's go right hello yeah so the second congressional back to your district which i represented also for five years and um i really enjoyed it too it's uh it's it's um i think it is a fantastic district i think it's one of the most diverse in the whole country it's one of the most beautiful as you say it's every single island has its own personality and even on each island you have your own personality you know west side east side big island and you know central maui versus lahaina and west maui a lot of people forget that uh oahu has a second congressional too they kind of think well first congressional that's uh you know b and all of oahu and right i don't represent all of oahu i represent the city of honduran but you you've got you've got uh a huge part of a walk i've never been down this side where um so this is really interesting here uh and this is worth your your uh a trip pacific university pacific university on the left and then the uh the makai pier over here this was a legacy of uh sea life park when it first started up it had a scientific side to it and um there there are some companies that uh these these uh at least the end of that pier and they're doing doing world-class research um in in uh deep ocean mapping and so it's a perfect test of facility these are local boys that started up this company uh they actually live in hawaii kai but they're they're in your district and um they get federal funding uh and so ocean mapping ocean mapping and related stuff having to do with uh ocean exploration ocean use um they um they work a little bit with some some of the military services but these are good paying jobs that are are out off of that i think they've got a employment base of about 20 or so so that would be worth the tour yeah i did it a couple of years ago so now we're coming up on waimanalo yeah and i know that um you know waimanalo of course uh um one of the highest percentages of native hawaiians in our state it's the hawaiian homelands and i know that you've been uh really deeply involved in your first year in congress in the hawaiian homeland so maybe talk a little bit about uh you know your your your native hawaiian agenda and how it works into the hawaiian homeland right here so we introduced um together uh hj55 and it's called the prince kuhio protecting families legacies act and that bill will consent to the state of hawaii's request through their you know legislative body and bill which became an act signed into law a few years ago by governor ige to lower the successorship blood quantum from uh 25 to 132nd blood quantum so this will allow families to continue to keep their homesteads um within their families and pass them to you know members of their families whether it's children or grandchildren or direct descendant of the lessee uh to allow that that that may not continue to have that 25 blood quantum because of intermarriage and and other reasons allow it to keep it in the family so that's something that you know i continue to hear stories you know from people emailing me about hey how's the bill doing um you know where is it at right now so right now the bill is uh been heard in the natural resources committee which you are a member of right and the uh subcommittee on indigenous peoples and we're waiting for a markup of the bill in the full natural resources committee and uh chair grijalva has coming into doing that at some point when we can get it on the calendar so looking forward to that yeah we're we're trying to get it um scheduled that yeah as you pointed out i'm on that committee and i'm on the subcommittee on indigenous peoples which has jurisdiction over native hawaii that's a really critical bill and you know as we drive by the homelands we're talking about um more generations or so now sometimes more a family is living on on this land right here and it's it's a distinct community that that that people love and um need to be able to um you know continue as as they have been for for more generations there's a lot of native hawaiians that are on the list um that's a whole other separate issue we need to address but what we don't want to be doing is kicking people off the homestead because of a blood quantum issue right i mean that's the last thing we want to do um and so keeping people in their homes allowing them to uh raise their families and future generations there is is really really important and ultimately it's what principle he wanted right originally his blood quantum uh was was 132nd and we're only uh following the original attempt when he introduced when he introduced the bill 100 years 100 years ago yeah his intent was 132nd so and it was incredible we you you uh put together a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the of the hawaiian homelands act uh a full hundred years you know it's kind of funny i don't know whether all that many members of congress gave it all that much of a thought then it was kind of a hawaii thing and of course hawaii was far away and not top of mind to many members of congress as is sometimes the case but probably more so 100 years ago and yet he got that bill through over some some pretty solid operation um but it was a huge deal for hawaii as it turned out uh thousands and thousands and thousands of native hawaii that's able to continue to live on the land and as you pointed out a successful bill but needs to be updated to the to the date now uh uh never intended that it was it was going to be so strictly applied as to blood quantum that essentially after a few generations you would get kicked off the land family member well we just passed uh the polo fields and bellows and uh you know bellows is a is a great place for me i i learned um part of learning how to play volleyball uh was training with the lokahi volleyball club fellows [Music] we're uh in waimanalo town now we're right across the street from waimanalo elementary and uh we're at a really really critical facility in waimanalo uh the waimanalo health center and i'm gonna turn this over to congressman cajelli to tell us a little bit about what's happening here yeah mahalos we're here for those of you of course you live in waimanalo you're very familiar with the waimanalo health care center the waimanalo health center is one of a few very very important fqhcs throughout the state of hawaii these are federally qualified health centers they receive federal funds to provide health care in rural communities everything from dental care to kubuna care they're very very important of course during a global health pandemic with kovid they've been very instrumental in this community the waimanalo health center also specializes because of the native hawaiian population here high concentration native hawaiians on this side of the island they do a lot for native hawaiians and whether it's through the native wine health care act and the federal funds that is appropriated to help native hawaiian's health care through papa lokahi there's a good synergy between our fqhc's waimanalo health center being one of them waianae coast comprehensive being another you know bay clinic over in hilo so these are very very important for our rural communities for health care yeah you know it's hard to underestimate the importance of the community health centers throughout our country community health centers serve as rural underserved communities not just in the rural areas uh in in this middle of honolulu for example we have the kalihikalama health center which services very underserved communities and has been for decades so these health centers are set up by federal law they're funded uh by by by congress and we and the delegation pay a lot of attention to the community health centers because they're really really critical not just for uh communities that that really just don't have access to good health care but especially as congressman kelly was saying under federal laws that are now a couple of decades old they focus on data plan of health care and in fact throughout cobit um there has been a critical focus by the health centers on native wines this is where most native blinds got there got their care uh during the middle of topic and other undertale communities so you can't go in like i said because the other thing the health centers like waimanalo have is a very very strong robust community partnerships case in point there's a newly opened um part of waimanalo health center that was raised a lot via private funds foundation funds the state legislature granting aids and so you know this this healthcare complex is really a coming together of federal state county private nonprofit money to provide rural health care in a in a community like this so it's very very important so uh tell me about your first year in congress i mean just what uh you've had one full year in congress yeah it's almost hard to believe that a year has has gone by but um you know it's been a it's been a amazing first year definitely a lot of highs a lot of lows you know highs for sure uh bringing my family to washington dc marie and the kids uh the first time any of them had ever been there so you know getting to see you know the smiles on their faces their eyes you know you know big wide open you know walking to the capitol and and uh and and just the whole you know even undercover and a lot of the restrictions we had you know being able to participate in and have my family there to be sworn in as a member of congress on january third of this year was very special you know three days later the insurrection happened uh clearly a low and and one of uh you know our our country's darkest days um and and then we start to you know rebuild from there and we you know inaugurate president biden on january 20th and and then it's been non-stop since then you know the american rescue plan that we were able to pass in march some some you know important pieces of legislation that you know i was able to to work on and introduce going back and forth between hawaii and dc uh clearly one of the hardest things about this job is to travel and and going back and forth there's no there's no easy way to get to dc um it's a long flight and it takes a toll on your body and it's usually a red eye and um so what was your secret in uh there i think i think all of us that have done it over the years have their own kind of rhythms to how they handle that yeah that commute and the and the red eye and everything else what what what you know what's your rate it is nice to stop on the west coast and spend the night even if it's for a few hours before making it to dc but it's also you know time is of the essence so you gotta you gotta get there and um so i've usually been just sucking it up and taking the red eyes i try and fly hawaiian as much as i can and uh so they hawaiian serves the boston and jfk direct and then i fly down to reagan so i've done that um so that's your route usually that's my route ynn to jfk or boston and then on the red eye yeah hawaiian has a code share with jetblue yeah so boston is my preferred route because they have a lot more frequent flights from boston logan down to dca or reagan which is right next to the you know the capital complex and the dc area so yeah i mean that's that's what i've done it's it's long you know and uh but a lot of times and study how do you how do you uh shake it off what do you do when you what do you do because you you know i always say i would get in and go take a nap and try and rest but you know as soon as i hit the ground my staff is waiting for me there's a whole agenda of things to schedule you know they try and not put too much on my plate on day one but it make no mistake it's as soon as you hit the ground in dc it's it's it's you're going and it doesn't end until i mean i'm lucky if i go to bed at 12 1 o'clock in the morning on the first day on every one every day every day what's the best way down do i go down here oh yeah no no go straight you know yeah you know the way if i go to bed by 1am on any day in dc it's uh that's a good day part of it is the time zone change you know hawaii is either five or six hours behind so i'm making calls back to hawaii to check on people see how they're doing of course checking out my family you know it's kind of hard to call them at four in the afternoon and tell them good night you know my kids don't understand that so i try and do that around five six their time but uh then i get up early i go to the gym i work out in the house gym and yeah i i hear you're a member of the you're uh you're you're a sworn member of the early morning uh muscle club yeah yeah i i'm there and there's uh some good good uh members there uh jimmy panetta josh godheimer uh lou correa lou correa is another one yeah and uh tim burchette from uh tennessee yeah it's a good it's a good place uh to get together bipartisan with other members uh you know both democrat and republican work out talk story and you know who taught me that was and i'm not a regular at the gym i should be but i'm not like you and uh i'm kind of episodic i go for months at a time on and off but abercrombie when i first went to lc um and i think that's what uh you know just to divert a little bit that's what's been really good about the hawaii congressional delegation through the decades is you know when a new member comes in and you try to get them going as fast as you can kind of uh you know pass along whatever knowledge you had and i remember i told you in the fall of 2018 i mean sorry 2020 um i said well one thing you want to do is get into the gym right away and that wasn't me talking that was abercrombie talking to me yeah because he said one thing you want to do is get into the gym right away because you know the politics kind of falls away and you just you know you're talking story maybe you're jogging maybe you know you're you're working out you're doing weights what basketball whatever and you can form friendships there that that will stand you in good stead over the time so you've done that i mean you know for me athletics always a part of my life even growing up you know as a kid and he don't play basketball baseball uh you know played in uh volleyball so he could come to congress and and i played on the congressional basketball baseball and football team and uh you know that was a lot from basically july through about november but it gave me an opportunity to meet a lot of new members uh that i would have never met before because it's so hard to meet people on the floor you really have to be deliberate strategic who you want to meet with everyone's meeting they all got something they want to talk about but when you get on a baseball field in the morning or get on a football field you really get a chance to uh to get to know people so that's been one of the most meaningful things i've done this year um is to get to know other members of congress senior members of congress um and and to give them a chance to learn about me that's been great two reps out of 435 you can get lost really easy and um we have like 220 members in our house democratic caucus yeah even that is i don't know everybody yeah i mean there's there's many people i haven't met yet i i'd say i probably have yeah i have a hundred i have a hundred that i i know i recognize another name a little bit about their background where they represent but uh well there's a lot of work here it's not bad it takes a lot of work you got another hundred nickel hey i got another next year yeah but those relationships just come in you just never know when it's gonna happen and you never know what they're on the other side too yeah because you talked about some of the people you hang with in the gym that are that are republicans and and obviously the the uh congressional uh uh sports teams are are bipartisan yep they're bipartisan so that's uh yeah i think you've done that well i think you've developed a really i mean there's people you hang with on a regular basis whether because you kind of have the same agenda or you you just have the same interest notice that on the floor there's like certain groups certain clicks that sit in the same place all the time and uh so this is this is kind of an interesting uh thing that you bring up because um so when i when i first went to congress i noticed that too and straight there's a real temptation when we when we're talking about the floor just for the folks that are listening we're talking about the full house when the house comes together um in in in the big chamber that you all see uh to to vote or to do other business or to debate and you you have that's the really the only time during a day that you're going to have or a week that you're going to have all of the members of congress coming into that chamber so you so that's not only an opportunity to vote and to debate it's an opportunity to develop relationships and get your business done yeah uh because you know if you have to go through the other office you've got to go through all these staff which way right you have to go yeah it's crazy you gotta make an appointment you gotta go to staff it's super hard and as opposed to just hey okay like a lot of times i'll tell myself okay well i'll just catch her on the floor i can just have a quick conversation with her on the floor and look all the people in standing in line it's about eight in the morning at urgent care in kailua you think that's for uh test we're getting tested yeah well as we speak we had nine hundred vaccinated yeah did you booster really um yeah we're looking for the coffee shop it's lanikai juice i think we're in this shopping center right here okay well we're in kailua town hallow we'll get some coffee at morning brew get a little bit of coffee on the coffee support local business so uh let's talk a little bit about uh kailua kaneohe your your community is on the on 2nd congressional this is the biggest one on this side yeah biggest one on this side um beautiful place you know obviously it's changed a lot in the last few years um it's it's become a prime tourist destination and and we've we've heard a lot from community members here uh but it's still a special place uh you know kailua canoe club uh lanikai um you know maria grew up here you're right in kailua my wife maria and the day family uh still still live here in kailua and uh you know we love coming down here bringing our our kids arguably one of the most beautiful beaches long stretch white sand beach here in uh on this side of the island and of course looking at the mooks and watching the sunrise come up is always beautiful here in kailua you know what kailua has too they have a very strong neighborhood board yeah you know something unique about the island of oahu that you won't find on any of the other islands is neighborhood boards that are established by the county charter and they're they're one of the great places for civic engagement in a community and you know i know you participate in your neighborhood boards we do the same and uh i actually started on the neighborhood boards so that was my uh that was my introduction to my first political race uh was it was for a neighborhood neighborhood wow manoa neighborhood born i served on manoa neighborhood board four years uh two years as chair and uh i mean the the blunt reality is if i hadn't done that i never would have been in charge today the lessons that i learned there on the neighborhood boards and they're they're a fantastic way to figure out what's actually happening in the community i think we have i don't know uh they're correct me if i'm a 36 on this island because we have about yeah well how much we have 11 11. we have 11 neighborhood boards and cd2 25 or 26. i'm not mistaken yeah and um my staff goes to them uh because that's where we pick up the vibe and what's happening in the actual community and i've gotten so many good ideas for congress and how to do it yeah okay like i i i went around hawaii a lot when i was you know during my life uh you know all of the islands i mean my family was from all the islands at one point or another and you know i had campaigned statewide and uh spent time in the communities throughout uh throughout hawaii and i thought i knew i knew it but to actually know a district of 750 000 people you got to really work at that um it doesn't just happen automatically i guess you can coast on it if that's you know who you are no it doesn't but it doesn't work out you don't understand unless until you get in the communities get in the neighborhoods and talk to like we're talking about the neighborhood boards the businesses so how did how did you handle that in your first year i mean you've got i've got a a logistical dif uh district that's really really compact and so it makes it a lot easier like if i if i land from washington dc it's like 15 miles one way 15 miles the other way a couple of miles wide i've got my 750 000 people i can get anywhere in my district from my office or from my home or from the airport inside of you know an hour at the worst traffic but you got the entire rest of the state how did you do that so you know we we started uh the congress with really important uh goals for our district office and our district operations that largely focuses on constituent services he always you know elect the hilo boy to uh congress he gonna move the office to hilo so uh you know i was you know fortunate enough to be able to relocate by his second congressional office over to hilo and you know mahalo for coming when we opened and blessed our office really appreciated you and audrey's presence there but part of moving our office to hilo and deciding how we would uh engage the district statewide you know we had a couple of things that we said at the beginning the first thing we did was we made sure we had solid field representatives on every island and so we did that we took the four part-time positions that we have in our office and you know just if you're wondering you know the house allows us congressman case and i to have 18 full-time positions and four part-time positions to staff our washington dc and our hawaii offices which sounds like a lot of people but but it's really not it's really not a lot but with that being said i took the four part-time positions and i placed them on maui molokai illinois and hawaii of course our district office is on the big island so we have that we have a staff there of about a dozen and then here on oahu my deputy chief of staff and my communications director reside and so they anchor our oahu operations so we first thing was we made sure we had enough representation on uh throughout the state and then the next thing we did was say well you know we need to go visit these islands like you just said and and how can we uh split our time to do that so we said we want to go to um the major islands twice in this first year and we're gonna go to lanai and molokai at least once and so we did that we went to kauai twice we went to maui twice went to lanai and molokai once each of course we spent a lot of time here on oahu and we spent a lot of time on the big island and so you know that those those trips that we've we took and they weren't just flying fly-out trips they were solid you know three four days um site visits on every island um you know from sun up to sundown packed agendas and allowed our field representatives to be able to um you know with local community leaders develop uh those site trips and what we would see and where we would want to go based on you know some of our objectives and parties for yeah i noticed i noticed you were doing that i thought that was really really good was to um not just get it in out you know for a day like you fly in in the morning and you and you leave in the evening but to to actually spend because i saw you over on you know kawaii for whatever it was we went for three days three days uh and i'd be at the blue ginger cafe every morning yeah just having breakfast and uh drinking coffee and guys would come in and i'd just be sitting there talking sir with them but i mean that you can start to absorb a little bit more about a community when you when you stay and spend the night and you have more you know conversations that are not so not so you know business meeting scripted you can cruise around a little bit right like you said go to the whatever the local restaurant is we also had some natural disasters you know in march we had catastrophic floods and heavy rains that did a lot of damage on maui so you know i actually stayed back to go to maui so i could get as much information as i could and bring back to the delegation to yourself and senator schatz and your own and say hey this is what mayor victoria needs right now on maui this is the bridges that are down this is the status of the reservoir on mahipano's property chance to show you there to make sure that the reservoir wasn't breached um but you know that's the kind of information i can bring back to the delegation and say here here's how we need fema's help you know here's how we need other federal agencies help um kawaii was another example we had the um slide it's much larger yeah so those uh site visits are really important especially during times of crisis in our community they're not connected or at least they're very i think you're going to make this left right the left coming up by the fire right now on this side of the bridge yeah okay yes you're gonna go right to that big building oh we passed it um we gotta turn around what's up big bump over here yeah and follow the truck yeah you're gonna love this i've been wanting to come here for a long time oh you should see this building they built with the american rescue plan funds are somehow kind of fun that they did it's and i was here about two months ago it's it's incredible i'm excited to see what it looks like now i'm just gonna park right by that all right so i'm gonna let you narrow where we are when we get there hey good to see you again aloha aloha nice to see you aloha aloha how are you good morning oh thanks for everyone coming out all right all right aloha how are you how are you good to see you wow hey how's it brother wow how are you aloha see you wait a minute we got to talk about this guy right here whatever whatever we i think we have my farmer remember in washington we should leave hour so right here like uh for me just before 9 40 2006. 2005. from the north shore and went to dc and uh decided to come home and so what do you do now i am the director of external affairs for tnt hawaii the nature conservancy yeah well mahalo for having us it's uh great to be here you know for me having a chance to come to kakao evie about two months ago really excited to see some of the changes that have been done in the last two months and uh you know for congressman case uh he hasn't had a chance to be here and to see this facility so you know we're really excited to be here in mahalo for our kupuna for coming out and for uh giving a chance to um to be here so yeah oh this is what it used to be long ago exactly right uh carol it might have already been converted back to louis kalo but it what we understand was rice yeah but uh yeah and so you can see no mangroves in the tax system and attack fish spawn and so as we go out today the whole idea is to restore it back to this area so that as climate impacts occur and more flooding occurs this is one of the best green infrastructural pieces that not only generate food economics culture but also provides the ecosystem service by banking water here on the land so that before it reaches the fish pond and the reef it's actually held the sediment is held and that's kind of some of the elevate like our agricultural systems in hawaii actually benefit the i know it's not a detriment so i don't think they think congressmen can know how to so that kids can come to this location with their kids in vance their showers sinks they basically interact with aina right here stay in their bubble leave without interacting with kakuivi staff outside of our educators and then that way there is no transmission and so the kilo stations are created to one they can witness and look out to see how the land changes but also experience it here and so that was 100 federal awesome yep [Music] oh oh [Music] but in reapportionment um because uh the first congressional threw a little faster than the second congressional i got to give you some of my district so you get you get kolina yeah i not like not like our colleagues on the mainland that are having to you know get basically get written out of districts or whatever and you know reapportionment a lot of people are wondering this census in this real portion that's actually embedded in the constitution every 10 years the census will be done to determine population and those population numbers determine the house of representatives where those lines are drawn and how many each person gets and the average member of the u.s house represents like you said about 750 800 you know average is maybe 70 to 730 or something like that but some districts uh have less and some more you just can't have that many less or more but some the number of representatives is is like i said said by the census and it moves so there are states that are that are losing uh seats in the u.s house and they're states that are gaining seats okay so we're going to go speaking of him to the daniel k noye international airport right now all right we are we're going to go get a little bit in your district now we're going to go and talk about something that uh it's in my district technically but it's obviously critical across the board for hawaii not just the airport itself but uh the airport system talk a little bit while while we're getting there uh this is a critical area for you in particular because you fought very well and successfully to get on the house transportation infrastructure committee and so talk a little bit about that committee and and uh what you've uh what you've done on that committee and um how how that helped someone yeah so i you know got uh fortunate to work hard and get on the house transportation infrastructure committee the committee is made up of several subcommittees and i get a chance to serve on the highways and transit subcommittee as we drive by the the uh the rail the rail project that's an important subcommittee that uh has jurisdiction over the fta the federal transit according to this heart project for real the other subcommittee i'm on is the aviation subcommittee really important for our nation's airports as we see a couple f-22 yeah warrior national guard raptors uh in the overhead pattern 20 years ago i used to do it i've done it only once and you know that that uh that maneuver he's doing right now to do the hard bang i kept it all in kept it all in i kept it all in so these guys have come up uh in fingertip formation and the lead is on the left position and he breaks over midfield and then five seconds later the second one breaks and that's how i develop they develop that species they come off the perch and one thing i learned was they do that because they got to come down fast they have to come down and uh spiral on down so they'll get they get down before the yeah they're tipping around they ground the air stuff typically coming up uh overhead at about you know 250 300 knots so that that brake turn allows them to bleed off that energy to get to a normal traffic pattern so they can put the gear down and final configuration yeah so i always transit and the airport subcommittee so you know um fighting for uh airport dollars is really important you know airports are typically generated by their landing fees and uh so as you can imagine you know honolulu international airport which is a unique airport one unlike any other in the nation because it serves major international and domestic commercial airlines it serves the united states military through income air force base and it also is a general aviation field that serves smaller aircraft uh tour aircraft whether it's fixed wing or helicopters cargo um down on lagoon drive so it's a really unique airport and its air traffic control tower has to handle everything from student pilot in a cessna going out to do some touch and goes to you know uh the airbus 380 flown by japan airlines you know the biggest uh aircraft uh commercial aircraft in the world so it's great to to be here at the airport one of the things i look at is you know honolulu gets a lot of money for its airports but uh airports that do struggle are there much smaller ones west maui so uh making sure we're getting airport dollars federal airport dollars and then making sure we're working with our state partners uh rasugashi is the uh deputy director for airports who is the department of transportation director it's really important in partnership that we all work together and leverage as much federal funding as we can and of course through the infrastructure and investment jobs act um like you said about three billion dollars are coming to hawaii for infrastructure there's a lot of money coming for our airports especially the common use areas what's a common use area taxiways runways lighting you know infrastructure that is used by all uh airlines and users of the airport wow we came wow go for it [Music] wow we're in the brand new concourse here and uh we're with uh rasugashi the director of state airports you have all of the airports right how many airports 15 airports across the state ranging from uh this one our largest to what's the smallest the smallest one i would say is probably uh no point no point point is still operating oh really i never knew that ah so tell us about this new i mean this is just well first of all we have the director of transportation with us for the entire state here at jade dupai and uh just introduce your team here and uh who else engineer worker delivering all these legacy projects and three big projects in one year yeah spectacular so guy why don't you tell us what it what did it take to actually put this together because you were you were here for the entire thing i think right yes how long did it take so we started on this in 2006 the first thing about the first the planning yeah planning you know in 2006 yeah we didn't get our environmental assessment approved until 2013 right and which time we started construction yeah on the first project um the marker concourse was the last of i would say near about a dozen of those projects right to get done the whole airport modernization plan that we've been working on for quite a while lots of federal funding in that too right and so how much did the concourse cost was about 280 million 280 million and you were telling us earlier you're you're you're up for a national award for the concourse right i mean you're trying to get recognized for the visa award but it's just the leadership and energy and environmental design um silver you know what to me that's a national award just take it yes global global award right is more a sustainable energy efficiency well it's spectacular i mean uh and you say yeah i mean you've flown in and out of here out of here it's great uh to see this uh what what you would normally see if you went to international destinations some of our nation's most modernized airports this is reflective of it when you look at this and you look at the rail line you look at the newly completed car rental facility i mean i think um you guys doing a fantastic job and the uh you know eg administration credit to their uh leadership and working together with the federal and local partners to bring this to fruition this is fantastic what a great way to welcome people to hawaii when they arrive here aloha it's great to meet you guys hi very good thank you john david hi excellent thank you john aloha representative aloha can you get can you walk us through from here all the way down what's what we're going to see here this is our this is our distribution system plus so what i'd like to warn you it all begins at the fire hydrant the yellow fire hydrant that's out in the field it comes in through these through this hose right here this light colored hose it goes into these tanks from those tanks it splits out and it goes into its contact time with that granulated activated carbon that carbon media yeah that's capable of removing a wide range of contaminants so the i'm sorry these are the kind of the smaller tanks that came in yesterday okay the big ones and then you have these what's the difference between the really large one and and these that's it's a great question sir so there's two it takes two to make one of the big ones okay so that's why you see four of them here whereas some of the systems that came in you might have seen some of the images as they came off the aircraft those were a similar system or makes up two tanks whereas this one is four because these are five thousand gallon tanks now the quality of the treatment is the same it's really driven by how much contact time and how much volume of media these actually have to go through so from there it goes through there's a sample port over there where you see our contractor partners are over there collecting samples they go to an independent laboratory for verification and that's to basically demonstrate that this this media system this filter system is effectively removing and returning water to the environment it's as safe as rain and so from there that water comes all the way through and you'll see our effluent point is down there and in this case it's a land application so we're effectively watering the grass because we have this opportunity here with a wide grassy field this is the safest way to return that water that comes through has been filtered it's rendered safe and again it's really a great use of that the other opportunities we have is to actually put it into a storm drain uh if it's a tight situation where we don't have a wide grassy field like that and then the other thing and again this is part of the partnership that we've had with both the epa and the department of health is they said there's some cases where if you get special permits you can put these into sanitary sewer waste right then if the sand island plant or honolulu for example should they come into partnership with them they might be able to receive this pdf oh my god how's that yeah how are you aloha middletown oh nice to see you so doh i'm sorry doh is just doing this right at the source right yeah so we're doing some oversight of the sampling of the operation and everything and then what we're doing is we're doing side-by-side field measurements just to verify some of the rings that we're getting today so what the what they're getting in terms of bringing it out you're doing an independent review of that yes oh actually that's about field measurements temperature ph um conductivity oh i just love oxygen but not the actual actual sampling you're gonna send out to the lab and then uh later in the week we're gonna do some replicate sampling okay great okay well thanks a lot yeah i appreciate that have a great day we're working hard and these boys are here from have you michigan i gather you've done a lot of this before or what's uh what's what's the expertise like what's the worst spill you've had to clean up oh i just got back from pumping off a flooded head with this place landfill where's that louisiana louisiana so so the landfill seeped down into the nose and containment we've got to get all the water out of there yeah yeah what about situations where you actually had contamination from whatever into a water system have you have you had to work with those like this yeah not really not really in the city water system i haven't had experience yeah but this is extremely clean water compared to what we're we're used to dealing with the old way have you guys uh worked in the middle east at all uh somebody told me that in the middle east they're used to a much higher level of standard contamination in their water i just didn't know if that was true or not or i don't know i just uh just a point of information have you all been to hawaii before no oh wow oh we're at the double tree over at also we will be informed by sampling at every route so in other words once we flush this if our testing demonstrates that this plan worked then we'll move on to the next step but not before okay and it's also with our parallel testing from our you know from the department of health and the epa performing independent tests as well now are you i'm sorry i'm asking enough questions are you when you say you're doing independent uh sampling are you are you sampling the water here are you sampling it in the houses coming out of the spigots because you've got the whole other uh the whole other part of this right to get into the houses and flush those houses yes sir so we're doing this in phases okay so the first phase is the distribution lines of the street and that way we have a known clean again tested and once that results come back to say we have water that's fit for human consumption in the pipes at the street at that point we go into homes and we flush individual homes from there we'll begin testing and if the home flushing you know and the sampling confirms then we'll be able to release the whole neighborhood and say your water is now safe for human consumption so we're kind of eliminating variables by going to the distribution lines first there's a backflow preventer to each service and that's kind of what allows any anything that might be remaining in a house it can't go back into our distribution system so it allows us to work from the street into the homes and that also allows us to manage you know our effort in terms of we're ready to flush the streets now and then we'll go into the homes and return those neighborhoods as they come as they come this whole ready of what they're doing here to try and restore clean water what are your thoughts on this process well the basic plan is to flush the entire navy water system and that's important to say it's the entire navy water system not just the parts of the water system that we know are impacted by the fuel spill but the navy in conjunction with the state and the federal partners have a plan that's approved by everybody it's thought through by everybody and their approach is to flush all of the systems so just the both the pipes themselves coming into the homes and then the homes themselves and so they're they're i think doing the right thing and and uh being safe and saying we know that the water that is supplying the navy right now which is from the guyava shaft which has not been affected it's a few miles from here we know that's clean um and that's what's feeding the navy water system but we're going to take it all out all out and then that's a critical part of course of stabilizing and getting our military and other families back into their homes in a safe way and once those uh various different communities i guess you could say those systems get flushed then we'll move into the next phase which will be the individual households and how those homes are flushed clean tested and and rendered safe for families to start cooking drinking using for oral hygiene and consuming the water in those homes and you're talking you know thousands of military homes affecting thousands of military families so that's what's happening right now the other important thing to note is that just behind us behind these tents both the navy and the department of state department of health are both testing so the state department of health is verifying uh what the navy contractors are doing so i think we'll have a a good full proof and you know safe safeguard on that and two people have to line up and say the water is either safe or not safe and not just safe for consumption eventually but safe to discharge into the environment which is what is happening right now um it's estimated that just today about a million gallons will be flushed from this location those uh that discharge started this morning and so the department health has also deemed that that water that is being discharged back into our environment is also safe as well i know that's been a major concern for a lot of people that water that is going back to the environment isn't safe i've been hearing that from a lot of our viewers like are we sure about this you guys feel confident that that is you know after everything's been signed off on that water is safe to be released back into the environment yes in in in whatever way there's a number of ways to discharge it back into the environment if there's any question about whether it's not safe then there's a whole other process that is being followed uh then water that that is safe yeah i mean this is a process that has been uh thought through very uh deliberately and and and has been able to come to an agreement by the department of health the military the epa uh and and they've they've deemed that this is a process we need to do to flush this system safely and to you know be able to eventually get to the point where we can render the navy's water system safe yeah this is just a part of the problem so the source of it is a whole other issue it's red hills reserve fuel tanks there any comments on those as we're taking care of this part of the problem well this is the first thing that we have to take care of first we have to take care of our families that are displaced and we have to assure everybody not just those that live in these homes and the businesses that rely on navy water that the water is in fact again safe and everybody's got to sign off on that so the navy doesn't get to certify that the department of health the epa that's the first thing that we have to do and that is is underway we have to monitor it all the way through we have to verify it and we all have to work together but the second part is is upon us today as a matter of fact in the proceeding as to what we do with uh with red hill in the interim while we do sort through uh the next steps of red hill of course the governor has said that operations uh must be suspended the entire congressional delegation urged that and it should be suspended indefinitely and so that process is clearly for the department of health right now and the governor we're trying to provide whatever support we can as we look at the taking care of our people and the environment part of this process will be also flushing the red hill well and making sure that the petroleum contaminants that are in that wall presently now whether it's being skimmed by navy divers or eventually pulled out of the well to be run through large capacity uh you know charcoal gap filters will get us to the point where we can we can also render the red hill well safe clearly that's going to take um some time because of the amount of petroleum that's in that well right now and and and also being able to definitively identify the source of that that petroleum does an ongoing investigation so i think we need to take this in steps today is step one in getting back to uh a clean navy water system but you are in our thoughts our prayers and um we wish you the best thank you for your service and we are doing everything we can we are moving heaven and earth to get you back in your homes and to get this navy water system back on again perfect thank you well that was a very full six hours of cruising just a small part of hawaii's first and second congressional districts with my colleague congressman kai kaheli getting kai's thoughts on his first year in congress and sharing some of our work together on behalf of our hawaii we hope you enjoyed it and from both of us and our staffs on capitol hill and back home we wish you and yours only the best in 2022 aloha

you chairman I want to thank our panelists for being here today we've spent tens of billions of dollars on important infrastructure Investments particularly Broadband funding in recent years spanning various federal agencies and this committee has a really important oversight role and uh I commend the chairman for his leadership in this effort um the infrastructure Bill alone made a 65 billion dollar investment in Broadband deployment and adoption and established as has been noted a roughly 42 and a half billion dollar Broadband grant program at the ntia I want to ask a couple of questions of Mr Powell and Mr spalter please you represent many member companies who would likely consider participate in the participating in the bead program this this grant program to States do your members uh want to participate in the bead program and how is your industry prepared for this new funding uh and perhaps you could touch on any regulations associated with the requirements of of the bead program or other government programs that are uh of particular Focus to uh your members let me begin uh Senator and thank you for the question our members are if I could use this phrase loaded for bear to be able to actually deploy these B dollars responsibly accountably quickly and effectively uh it is our members who have the financial technical operational and experiential wherewithal to be able to best apply These funds and and put them to their best and highest uses uh we are uh anticipating uh broad participation in the bead program we are concerned however that there are unintended consequences of the iija that need to be dealt with squarely including uh Provisions that I don't believe Congress had intended to be included in the bead program or it's in nord's implementation such things as Davis bacon the middle class subsidy that has been suggested um we need to uh together collectively deal with these issues if we're going to Foster the kinds of deep participation that we want and that our members would very much like to be able to achieve thank you Mr Powell I would just add the tenor of your question gets it something I think is not fully appreciated this is a massive complex undertaking for an ISP you have teams dedicated first of all just digesting the rules the conditions the parameters the markets that are going to be available which ones are not going to be available you know how is it going to be funded where are the matching funds coming from how do we do this in an inflationary environment that might lead to recession how do we do this in a supply chain constrained environment how do you do this in a skilled labor shortage environment what are what are the ways to migrate around those things right um so you know this is why the delicacy of unnecessary regulatory mandates could really derail the incentive to participate yeah yeah absolutely so we will uh we'll note whatever regulations or Provisions uh you think are already uh perhaps unintentional or or not reflective of the intent of Congress as a whole uh on an ongoing basis we'll want to be attentive to uh some friction that will be associated with implementation I'm sure at various points um one one question to again each of you uh Mr Powell and Mr spalter pertaining to the digital divide something we in Congress have indicated that we want to close for some period of time but what is closing the digital divide mean to you and uh do you believe that we will officially through this spending and implementation initiative be able to close the digital divide after you know tens of billions of dollars because frankly this is this was the promise of the Broadband Investments which was we would make sure there are no one served and uh we would significantly narrow the number of underserved uh households across the country I expect inflation which Mr Powell mentioned could have an adverse role on on meeting that objective but what say you Mr Salter to the question of how do we close the digital divide and what is closure of the digital divide I think it's been well expressed by the intent of the Iha itself which is that when all in America who seek it who want access to broadband can have that access at speeds of 120 throughput at least um to get to that Promised Land I think you know it's tantalizingly close uh but it's going to take an all hands on deck effort to make sure that we can in partnership with our government Partners really machete through a lot of these encumbrances that make our willingness to participate uh in question because of the various regulatory permitting and other challenges that we know are part and parcel unfortunately right now of broadband deployment okay sir your answer is basically we we hope we hope we can uh close the digital divide we all need to be working together and and uh towards that end but uh you certainly haven't give me a confident assertion that's going to happen which is fair Mr Powell yeah I think closing digital diet is every American regardless of where they live whatever their Community has the ability uh to access broad high quality Broadband infrastructure at a reasonable rate that's the historic commitment of the nation to Universal service and when we fully realize that dream that will be the result um I I am more excited and bullish than I've ever been that we have the opportunity to generally close the Divide I've also learned that declaring mission accomplished prematurely is a huge mistake a lot of this money could be misdirected inefficiently managed we've seen that before I think that the history of that anxiety should produce a much sharper more Vigilant or better overseen program if we do that I think we will be able to celebrate uh the closing of the digital divide if not we'll be wondering five years from now what happened you have your game face on all right yeah thank you

mr speaker i yield a minute and a half to the gentleman from illinois mr davis gentleman from illinois is recognized for one and one half minutes thank you to my good friend mr jordan and mr speaker i rise today in opposition to this anti-second amendment legislation i know first hand how important firearm ownership and the second amendment are for self-defense five years ago i was in the batter's box at a baseball field in virginia practicing for our congressional baseball game when a deranged gunman tried to kill us because we were republicans the attack would have been a massacre if not for the armed u.s capitol police officers my heroes david bailey and crystal griner who were there the actions on that field that day solidified my support for the second amendment remember mr speaker this gunman wanted to settle his political differences with us who were trying to fix a broken health care system with bullets on a baseball field that's not what we do in the united states of america but that day my thought was i wish i had my firearm to protect myself we don't need more laws and restrictions that make it more difficult for law-abiding gun owning citizens to exercise their constitutional rights and protect their families we need to support law enforcement and get tough on criminals who steal guns and commit violent crimes and further improve mental health programs i'm a proud gun owner i'm a concealed carry licensee and a strong supporter of our second amendment i always have and always will work to preserve the second amendment for law-abiding american citizens i urge my colleagues to vote no on this attempt to undermine the second amendment gentleman from ohio

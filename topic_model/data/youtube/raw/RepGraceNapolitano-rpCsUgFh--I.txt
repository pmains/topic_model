one minute thank you mr chairman and i too rise in strong support of hr 2080 and i think as before my speakers before i have thanked both the chairman and the ranking members on both sides uh especially the chairman ranking member supporting provisions requested that will help the state of california section 131 requiring army corps of engineers to review and report on improving water supply options at core dams in arid ridge regions such as california section 135 allows the court to use federal funds to prevent and manage aquatic invasive species on the core projects include quagga mussels short crab and foreign algae not only a major california problem but a problem for many rivers and and other dams they are very costly they will allow the court to assist our local agencies in combating the invasive species section 125 requiring the court to reissue regulations regarding levy vegetation and incorporate regional characteristics and levy performance some of the water agencies are complaining that the corps may be a little heavy-handed not looking at good science when requiring removal of trees and bushes from our levees and it would require the core to work with local agencies to solve the problem in a regionally appropriate and scientifically proven way section 106 and 109 provide more flexibility for local agencies to sponsor core projects that means accept funding section 201 allows for expanded use of harvard maintenance trust fund and we are asking for an eye vote on this thank you

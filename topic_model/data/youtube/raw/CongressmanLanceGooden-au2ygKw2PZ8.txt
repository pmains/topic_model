it's difficult for me to get on board with something that's so big being in another country and I would employ you implore you to consider bringing this home perhaps as things move forward you've said that you'll pull out of the Association if it goes a direction you don't want to go I would argue that you you have enough influence to bring this home and keep this American congressman lands good and holding Mark Zuckerberg feet to the fire making it known that he's not okay with Facebook's a good Lieber a cryptocurrency being based out of Switzerland the congressman joins me now to share his thoughts on yesterday's marathon testimony concert I got to tell you I actually shared those same thoughts when I initially read about the plan and I thought about the internet and how we ceded control of that to Switzerland as well yes and by the way my comments yesterday were some of the nicer comments of the day they were but they were but one of the arguments that mr. Zuckerberg used in his opening statements was that we need to be on the frontlines of innovation we as America I agree totally and if we're gonna do something like this why are we taking it to Switzerland let's keep it here at home I never heard a great argument for why they were so hell-bent on taking it overseas I think the argument is that that makes it neutral along with a board that includes nonprofits so that mitigates the profit-driven green aspect of it it felt like Mark Zuckerberg even in a sessom only yesterday and as they unveiled this wanted to want it to sort of please everyone and obviously it seems like no one was pleased that's right and you know about half the time was spent talking about the cryptocurrency the other half was an airing of grievances from both sides of the aisle mostly Democrats but there was some pushback on the Republican side it was fascinating to me that this progressive liberal company a group of people that had come in from Silicon Valley were not shown much love from Democrats across the aisle it was it was a an all on assault and an attack on Facebook it was fascinating to watch yeah and last year I think was the beginning of the rejection of Silicon Valley as progressive favorites they just looked at the overwhelming wealth that they have and they've considered that wealth that success that made them public number one were you surprised though at some of the grievances that seem like you know personal accountability might play a role there or some other things it felt like a lot of folks in that room wanted Facebook to be the savior of everyone's personal problems yes I mean I don't expect Facebook to police speech between candidates no matter how bad that speech may be there were some interesting questions posed that mr. Zuckerberg didn't have great responses to but I think it's because there were the scenarios that he had not thought of that as Facebook has grown they now are deal they are now dealing with problems that they had not imagined so and they're gonna continue to deal with that as they continue to grow and we we grow as a society political speech it's difficult to imagine me ever being happy with a group at Facebook determining what I can or cannot say and I think that's something that Democrats are upset with today because they don't like what Donald Trump's doing with his ads on Facebook but perhaps in years to come it could be a Republican upset with Democrats ads and I what I saw yesterday though was really a culmination of frustrations that were more from the Democrat side but they certainly existed on the Republican side as well I do believe mr. Zuckerberg intentions are good I don't believe that he's sitting in a room somewhere saying how can we make money off of the lies of politicians I do believe it bothers him that they've received such negative press and that he wants to make things right but I think as things continue to grow time passes and this just gets more and more advanced they're going to constantly have new problems arise that and they're just not going to make people happy the crypto currency it's totally separate that's a whole other problem but they've they've got issues I think he's a great face of the company but I think you'll never make everyone happy all right well thank you very much for your time congressman we'll hope to see you again thank you

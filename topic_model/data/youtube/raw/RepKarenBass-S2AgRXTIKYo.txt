thank you for joining us i think you know the question is coming i will get to it later i will start with some business before you in congress that we've been talking about on this show and the most immediate piece of business there in congress is the looming expiration of this 600 a week unemployment insurance boost the federal government has been providing that for several months it is due to expire at the end of next week it looks like the white house and republicans are pretty much a world away from you and your fellow democrats are right now we had jake sherman reporter on capitol hill on earlier uh in the show he was saying one possible outcome here is that there is a short-term extension agreed to this week for that 600 unemployment insurance boost while everything else is figured out is that something you'd be open to extend it short term the unemployment insurance and try to work out the other issues over a longer period of time well the main thing that i'm open to is that people should not have to suffer so whatever it is going to take for us to get a final bill out of the senate you know we really have to ask the question why has it taken the senate two months that bill has been sitting over there passed out of the house for a very long time and the idea that they would let people get to the brink of suffering where they run out of money and might face eviction is just shameful so if we need to do something temporarily so that people don't have to go a week without any any money then fine but it really is unconscionable because there's no reason for this they had all this time they weren't even in session they could have been working over there what we're hearing from many republicans from the administration steve mnuchin the treasury secretary saying this today saying that 600 is too much saying that for a lot of folks who are receiving that 600 on top of the state unemployment aid they get that actually accounts for more money than they were getting before the coronavirus pandemic in their jobs basically saying the principle needs to be no one should be paid more than they were getting in their jobs is that a principle you'd agree with i just love the way millionaires and billionaires think that six hundred dollars a week is too much money i mean i'm sure there are examples of that and there are cases of that but it doesn't take into consideration the different cost of living around the country and so i just think that that is is ridiculous but it's not just the six hundred dollars it's also the unemployment insurance so the theory is is that we're giving people too much money and that's why they're not going back to work how about they're not going back to work because their jobs are not open because their jobs are not safe um the idea that they would say we have to cut people's money in order to get them to work is just i i don't understand how some of these people sleep at night well they are millionaires and billionaires there are people out there watching this wondering what the future of their economic security is what are the odds of congress agreeing to a solution this week i i think the odds of us agreeing to a solution this week might be small but i do know that the senate is in session next week so it's almost as though they have timed it to take it into the first week of august again people suffering unnecessarily this pandemic has been so stressful for everyone and for some reason because the administration has not figured out a national strategy they keep trying to say well we just need to get everybody back to work as though the pandemic is going to go away without realizing that if we don't deal with the health issue we can't deal with the economic issue they are completely tied together okay let me ask you about the veep sticks now i told you it was coming here it is the reports are out there i know it's something you've talked about a little bit i'm curious have you had any recent communications from the biden campaign about your status about where this process is and if offered would you accept it now you know that i am not going to talk about that that you have to deal with the campaign let me just tell you that i am willing to do anything and everything over these next hundred days to get president uh biden elected in january he has got to be the one that we are swearing in i really believe that this election is a matter of life and death and that is demonstrated by the fact that we have over a hundred and 000 americans that are dead and we have a president whose job as commander-in-chief is to keep us safe and he doesn't even seem to be cared doesn't seem to care about how many people have died so i'm willing to serve in any capacity i'm willing to walk precincts safely i'm willing to do phone calls i'm willing to serve in any capacity i i want to ask you about one issue that has come up in regard to your potential candidacy for this role this was an article in politico this week this has to do with comments you made in 2016 when fidel castro died the cuban dictator when he died you called him back then commandante al heffey commander in chief sort of a a very respectful um a way to refer to somebody who had been guilty of imprisoning political opponents assassinating them medical experimentation on prisoners i think you know the whole litany here the article quotes some florida democratic leaders including javier fernandez is his name who says he finds your comments troubling and the democrats in florida are saying they are worried given the sensitivity of the name fidel castro and the cuban-american voting bloc there in florida the potential impact that having somebody who said that about fidel castro would have on the ticket i want to ask you about that comment he says he'd like to know more about it i would too what was behind that comment what did you mean by it uh well first of all uh i have talked to my uh colleagues in the house about that and it's certainly something that i would not say again i have always supported the cuban people and the relationship that barack obama and biden had in their administration in terms of opening up relations i happen to believe that sometimes the best way to change a regime is through having relations versus not for the last six years i've been a member of the national endowment for democracy which is the organization that actually funds the democratic efforts in cuba and so again for a country that is 90 miles away for a policy that we've had decades that hasn't worked i think opening up relationships is the best way to go but i certainly understand the sensitivity and uh to me saying that the understanding that the translation in spanish uh communicated something completely different so lesson and i'm just curious because i'm remembering back in the democratic primaries toward the end bernie sanders had made comments saying you know there were positive aspects to the to the castro regime how would you characterize the castro regime and its legacy well i think the castro regime and its legacy is very troubling let me tell you that over the last few years one of the things that i have done with cuba is they have a medical school there where they have been training african american and latino american students and i have been recruiting those students when they graduate to come back and work in the inner city and the reason is because they are down in medical school for free they don't come back with student loans and so they're prepared to work in the inner city so the latin american medical school that has been training physicians i have been working with for the last several years but you know what i mean we could talk all evening i could tell you about a number of regimes that i think are very troubling in a variety of different ways you know i serve on foreign affairs i chair the africa subcommittee and there are lots of african nations that i focus on that have very troubling governments but again we have relations with them and i believe that the best way to improve the situation is through communication and relationships all right congresswoman karen bass the chair of the congressional black caucus thank you for taking a few minutes appreciate the time

gentlemen first of all thank you for your willingness to appear before this committee to answer questions on the withdrawal from afghanistan you've received and will continue to receive tough questions on what led to this decision this is an important constitutional requirement of the jobs that you have agreed to serve in and i thank you all for your many years of service to our nation i want to underline the fact that every single member of this committee regardless of party is grateful for the dedication and bravery exhibited by our service members especially those who gave their last full measure of devotion at abby gate general mckenzie general miller told this committee that he recommended keeping 2500 troops in afghanistan and this is back in january of 2021 because he felt that afghan forces would not hold long without our support seems to me that there would have been a process to convey general miller's recommendation to the president can you share the process uh and who conveyed general miller's recommendation and was that recommendation delivered to both president trump at the time and also to president biden so there is a process for delivering recommendations from commanders in the field i was part of that process while i've been very clear that i won't give you my recommendation i've given you my view which will i think you can draw your own conclusions from and my view is that 2500 was an appropriate number to remain and that if we went below that number in fact we would probably witness a collapse of the afghan government and in the afghan military so gentlemen kenzie matt i just the i guess my question is would it be fair for the committee to assume that both president trump and president biden received that specific information that had been uh assumed to be delivered by general miller i believe it would be reasonable for the committee to assume that and would general miller have been able to deliver that directly to the president or would someone else have had to have delivered that for him i would leave it to general miller to express an opinion on that but he and i both had the opportunity to be in executive session with the president and i can't share anything beyond making that statement thank you secretary austin um this committee was briefed on the series of rock drills rehearsal concept drills that examined the many potential scenarios that could arise through the execution of different types of actions and counteractions remember by multiple leaders that the worst case scenario an unforecasted collapse of the afghan government was not something that these drills factored in as a possibility is it true that we actually did tabletop exercises and we actually went through these drills and we never assumed that there could be an immediate collapse of the afghan government we plan for a range of uh of possibilities uh the entire collapse of the afghan government was uh was clearly one of the things that if you look at the intel estimates and some of the estimates that others have made that could happen but in terms of specific planning especially with respect to neo we plan for you know a contested environment or an unconsent contested environment uh the requirement to evacuate a moderate amount of people versus a large amount of people so there was a range of possibilities that we addressed but never with an immediate collapse of the government we certainly did not plan against a collapse of a government in 11 days thank you general milley i think senator cotton made a very good point with regard to the timing the collapse of kabul and the time in which you were asked for your professional military opinion about the path forward which seems to be the real challenge for many of us is is that it appears that in your professional military opinion it would have been prudent to have used a different approach than a date certain with regard to a withdrawal from afghanistan and if that is correct and if there were other alternatives presented to the president i'm certain that the frustration that you felt in not having your professional military advice followed closely by an incoming president that you were then tasked in a very short period of time with handling what was a a position in time for the people that were on the ground there to respond in an emergency basis would it be fair to say that you changed from a a long-term plan of gradual withdrawal based on conditions to one in which you had to make immediate changes based upon a date certain senator um as a matter of professional advice i would advise any leader uh don't put date certains on end dates make things conditions based in two presidents in a row put dates on it um i don't think that's a my advice is don't put specific dates um make things conditions based that is that's how i've been trained over many many years i think with respect though to the 31st uh and the decision on the 25th the risk to mission and the risk to force and most importantly the risk to the american citizens that are remaining that was going to go up not down on the first of september and the american citizens i know there's american citizens there but they would have been at greater risk had we stayed past the 31st in our professional opinion thank

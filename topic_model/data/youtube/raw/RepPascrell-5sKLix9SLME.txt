for two minutes Mr Speaker I rise to speak for the unemployed I've had more calls of my office in the last two weeks from those who run out of benefits that's a fact of life the last speaker who talked about the unemployed and are better off without us helping them figure that out the unemployed are better off when they could put food on the table for their families the unemployed are better off when he can pay the rent that's when the unemployed er are better off and that doesn't happen by osmosis this legislation is incredibly important because millions of Americans woke up this morning and will not be able to pay the rent will not be able to pay their electric bill will not be able to do with the grocery store what needs to be done for years there were policies that place the extraordinarily wealthy people of this country the big banks the well-connected above seniors above the middle class above the American people just today the financial crisis inquiry commission had one of its hearings you should have watched it when these guys wiggled in their chairs at answering the questions of the commission of how we got to this mess look there's enough blame to go on both sides but you guys were in charge not us remember eight million jobs millions of people's retirement lost because of the recklessness of Wall Street and we can't dig down and help those people who are unemployed the extent of the time of unemployment we haven't seen in so many years but if you go back to 2005 2005 when we were warned of the clouds that were heading towards us you remember in those two years before that 2003-2005 the average salary and wage went down 1.5% so human the cherry my desire that was the cherry mines all members to confine their remarks of the chair during that period of time which was a bellwether for what was going to happen which was a distant early warning signal why we couldn't understand where is this money going if everybody's making profits and then we examine the record where was it going it was going to corporate profits because nobody was watching there was no oversight these unemployed are suffering because of those profits in times where we were starting to tighten our belt and understand what was coming our way the emergency unemployment compensation program began to phase out at the end of May so this bill will retro actively restore those necessary benefits this is dignity we're talking about this is a man or woman looking at their families insane we are going to eat tomorrow we are going to pay the electric bill and we are going to pay the rent I think that that's important in critical after two wars after two massive tax cuts would help the rich that you never paid for you have a nerve to tell the unemployed if people in this country that you must be wanting to be unemployed I'm sorry we cannot help you but if you're part of Corporate America and you stuck it to the Americans in the upper in the middle class of this country and the poor that's where I will find a way to bail you well let's make sense let's be fair

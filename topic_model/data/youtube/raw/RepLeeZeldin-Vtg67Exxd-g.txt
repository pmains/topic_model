good afternoon everybody before I begin I would like to say this the ranks of our Justice Department and FBI are filled with amazing patriotic men and women who passionately love their jobs and our country they take their oath seriously and perform their jobs exceptionally they enforce our rule of law and make us proud each and every day in the performance of their duties it is deeply unfortunate that individuals at the highest levels of these legendary historic agencies weaponized their powers and acted highly improperly their misconduct is a reflection on them not on everyone else performing their responsibilities to the very best of their abilities and making everyone in our nation so proud of them each and every day in May of this year 19 members of Congress introduced a 12-page House Resolution detailing misconduct at the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI with regards to FISA abuse how and why the Hillary Clinton email probe ended and how and why the Donald Trump Russia probe began this resolution also called for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate this gross misconduct with the understanding that to justice start Department cannot be expected to investigate itself 33 members of the house now sponsor this resolution calling for the appointment of a second special counsel because we and our constituents want transparency and accountability and yet since the introduction of this resolution further evidence has come to light of misconduct at the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI the same principles that motivated us to introduce our resolution then are driving us with even more determination and resolve today I'm joined here today by several of my colleagues including congressman meadows jordan gates and others to call on the President of the United States Donald Trump to declassify and release important information for the American public as I stated it in my tweet yesterday quote powers were abused the FISA Court was misled and we have zero tolerance for any of it there are three parts to our request one we are calling for the declassification and release of the Carter page FISA applications while we are strongly in favor of releasing the entirety of the FISA applications except for the necessary redaction of any sources and methods that must truly remain classified we most specifically want to ensure that the President D classifies and releases 20 pages in particular of the last FISA renewal this includes pages 10 to 12 and 17 to 34 along with The Associated footnotes we are confident that the FISA applications will prove that the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI failed to provide the FISA Court with critically important information when they requested a warrant to spy on Carter page and others part 2 of our request is that we are calling on the President to declassify and release all 12 of the Bruce or 302s we are confident that these 302s contain critically important information that should have been provided to the FISA Court but wasn't part 3 we're also calling for the declassification release of the documents provided to the gang of eight that contain exculpatory evidence regarding Carter page and others we are confident that these documents also contain critically important information that should have been provided to the FISA Court but wasn't in October 2016 the FBI and DOJ used politically biased unverified sources to obtain a warrant from the FISA Court to surveil a US citizen quarter page the warrant along with three renewals also would have enabled investigators to access pages communications with other Americans including other Trump campaign associates the warrants grant u.s. intelligence and law enforcement agencies sweeping power to collect bulk information and conduct about collection which results in surveillance of a broad array of private communications from the past present and future including those of US citizens not specifically targeted in the FISA authorized warrant to obtain these warrants FISA and DOJ officials submitted an unverified dossier prepared by Christopher Steele to the FISA Court the officials failed to disclose that Christopher Steele was hired by the affirmed Fuzion GPS which was hired by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign to prepare this dossier and that the source was unreliable and was soon thereafter going to be terminated as a source the FISA Court was not informed that Christopher Steele was actively opposed to the election of Donald Trump that he was the unnamed source cited in the media reports that the FBI used to corroborate his dossier and that fusion GPS had been hired to perform previous anti-trump research efforts in 2015 the woods procedures which are the FBI's mandatory vetting process required for all FISA warrant applications instituted to ensure that all the facts contained in it in the application are accurate and verified to clearly support probable cause for a warrant were not followed former director Comey admitted in swarm testimony to the century shiera Committee on June 8th 2017 that material contained in the steel dossier was known to be both salacious and unverified since FISA warrant applications are rarely turned down are almost never subject to appeal and are presented in closed court with no public record where the government is not challenged by any defense is imperative that the government take extra care to validate the information being utilized to build their case before they take the extraordinary step of waiving rights of a US citizen without his or her knowledge or the opportunity to present a defense at the FISA Court the government has a responsibility not only to provide its best evidence in support of its application but also the best evidence it has against its case in this case the DOJ failed to do so there apparently was very important exculpatory evidence that was provided to the gang of eight that was not even presented to the FISA Court these deeply flawed in questionable FISA warrant applications utilizing illicit sources and politically biased intelligence were approved by DOJ and officials and an FBI officials at the highest levels before being presented to the FISA Court it was further hidden from the FISA Court that Nellie or the wife of the fourth highest ranking DOJ official Bruce or worked for fusion GPS the court also wasn't notified that even after Steele was terminated as a source by the FBI for leaking information to the press the FBI continued to effectively use him as a source via Steele's contacts with Bruce or despite the troubling fact that he was terminated as a source by the FBI for leaking information to the press and for other reasons the FBI continued to use him through Bruce or Christopher Steele directly transmitted the dossier and other information through Bruce or to the FBI which then submitted allegations from the dossier to the FISA Court the details of the interviews between the FBI and or laid out in a series of 302 s written by the FBI but the DOJ continues to improperly keep those 302 s is classified in February 2018 the president United States to classified information within a memorandum by the House Intelligence Committee which revealed that before quote before and after Steele was terminated as a source he maintained contact with DOJ via then associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce or senior DOJ official who worked closely with Deputy Attorney General's eats and Rosenstein shortly after the election the FBI began interviewing or documenting his communications with steel for example in September 2016 Steele admitted or his feeling against Van candidate Donald Trump when Steele said he was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president end quote later that month in response to a request by senators Grassley Graham the DOJ Declassified a letter that referred to the Bruce or 302 interview summary stating that quote numerous ft 302 is demonstrating that DOJ official Bruce or continued to to pass along allegations from mr. steel to the FBI after the FBI suspended his formal relationship with mr. steel for unauthorized contact with the media and demonstrating that mr. or otherwise funneled allegations from fusion gps and mr. steel to the FBI and quote in May of 2018 upon request the DOJ produced 63 pages of unclassified emails and notes documenting mr. oars interactions with mr. steel on these issues the 302s contain mr. oars recounting of his interactions with mr. steel which are unclassified the dates of mr. oars interviews with the FBI to relay information which have already been Declassified and mr. oars emails and notes documenting their interactions which also are not classified yet the 302s themselves remain classified as Senator Grassley has stated quote nothing about these documents ought to be marked classified and quote we agree as I stated earlier we are confident that important information in these 302s that should have been provided to the FISA Court we're not actually provided to the judges as it should have been the same applies to important information containing the documents provided to the gang of eight we believe in equal scales of justice and no one is above the law that includes anyone regardless of last name and that even includes people at the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI especially when misconduct is committed in the performance of their duties while trying to take down elected officials and candidates as representatives is our constitutional duty to ensure that our constituents the American people know the truth that they possess the information they have every right to possess and that those officials who abuse their powers and mislead to FISA Court to obtain a warrant to spy on Americans are held accountable the numerous severe irregularities involved in this investigation the very notion of an administration employing our nation's counterintelligence capabilities to investigate its political opponents during a political campaign have deeply shaken Americans confidence in the leadership of US intelligence and law enforcement agencies these agencies exist to protect Americans from foreign threats not to try to sway the outcome of our elections or to destabilize a duly elected administration in conclusion the continued attempts to hide from the public a full accounting of these abuses is intolerable the American people have a right to know exactly what happened this investigation so we can implement reforms to ensure that such abuses are never repeated we will not allow those responsible for these misdeeds to improperly cite national concern national security concerns to keep the truth from coming to light the only satisfactory outcome now is full transparency for the American public and full accountability for those who maliciously subjected American citizens to surveillance abuses mr. president there are members of Congress and millions of Americans asking for you to declassify and release this information we want the truth we here standing here today are all members of Congress that have a zero tolerance those who abuse their powers and for all of the misdeeds and misleading of the FISA Court in trying to secure a FISA warrant to spy on American citizens and the Trump campaign at this time I would like to introduce congressman mark meadows Lee thank you for your leadership obviously this comes down to time and transparency it is time that we have transparency we're two years into an investigation that quite frankly has produced no results as it relates to collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian interference I can tell you that what the American people my district wants is they want transparency and they want it now I think all of the members is Lee has articulated when we returned home during August they said why not just declassify the documents while protecting the sources and methods and make sure that what we do is we allow the American people to judge for themselves there have been allegations of improper collection of information on the part of the FBI I'm here to tell you today that there is more than a reasonable doubt that those allegations are true so let's declassify the documents let's make sure the American people can judge for themselves and I think at the end of the day an administration that once transparency a president who has time and time again said let's be transparent we have nothing to hide mr. president we're calling on you today to encourage those around you to go ahead and release those documents and release those documents within the next week we thank you I think leave for your leadership and I'm going to introduce Jim Jordan thank you for your leadership outlook the reason we're calling for this now is in light of the things key things we learned last week from mr. Orr's deposition we think that's the catalyst and the reason that it's time to come clean we know the FBI the DOJ I'm gonna do it so we're asking the president States to make this information available to the American people so we can once and for all figure out exactly the wrongdoing that that took place but last week we learned a couple key things and Lee went through this but just to reiterate the dossier was the key to all this and the FBI knew everything everything before they went to the court to get a warrant to spy on a fellow American citizen and then to spy on the Trump campaign they knew who paid for the document they didn't tell the court that they knew the Orr's involvement both Bruce and Nellie's involvement in producing that document they didn't tell the court that and they didn't tell the court the statement that mr. Zeldin read that Christopher Steele had told Bruce or and Bruce Laura had told the key people at the FBI that Chris steel the author of the document was desperate to stop Trump from being elected those are pretty darn important facts that they did not convey to the court the other thing we learned last week as well is that the key people all knew Andy McCabe knew Lisa Paige knew Peter struck knew and Andrew Weisman a DOJ knew as well so that's important information that again I think the American people need to see these documents see this information so they can look at it and evaluate for themselves the other key fact is this or and still continued to meet as mr. Zeldin talked about even after the FBI fires the guy who wrote the document who wrote the key document that was the basis for all that the dossier they continue to meet they continue to have conversations and there are all these 302s that we want to see more importantly the American people deserve to see not only did those continue after Steele was fired these meetings and these interactions and the 302s from then it also continued after Bob Miller special counsel was named no one has seen those three oh twos no one has seen those we wanted we want those made available as well and then finally the other key takeaway I think from last week was why did fusion and Chris steel need Bruce or at all Chris steel had a direct line to the FBI why do you have to run information through Bruce or he could just give this to information straight to the FBI I mean I asked for a sore about this why did why did they need why'd they need you and it seems to me the reason was all this this circular pattern that existed that gives way to a document that we all know now not true this dossier if you got a top Justice Department official also passing information to the FBI also talking about it maybe even communicating this to the press or via him or they can talk to the press about Bruce ORS involvement that gives way to this to this document that we know wasn't accurate wasn't true at all so I think that's a key point for all those reasons these three things need to be made public that's why we're calling for it to happen and we hope that it happens as mr. meadows said sooner rather than later mr. president we need your help each and every member of Congress here has made some contribution to uncovering the bias and corruption that we've seen at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the FBI but we will be limited in our tools to conduct effective oversight in the absence of the documents that we are requesting today they have to be declassified mr. president so that we can lay out for the Congress and for the American people the Rotten basis for the investigations that continue solely to delegitimize the duly elected president the United States I appreciate mr. Zeldin mr. jordan mr. meadows for assisting in this effort and it's it's my suspicion that the most important information in the documents were seeking to be declassified won't be what's in those documents but what is left out of them you will not see in the FISA application any indication that Bruce or was functionally the handler for Christopher's steel while his very own spouse was getting paid with money that could be traced back to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign I don't suspect it will see in the FISA application the very the very origins of the collusion that existed between Christopher steel and elements of the Russian Federation that we're trying to pollute a trump presidency and I certainly don't think you will see the bias that was laid out from people moving from the Clinton campaign to the FBI investigation of the president and his campaign and then on to the special counsels investigation so we may see more in the omissions than what is laid out but we certainly need to see it all and we won't without the action of our bold president and that's why we're here and I'd like to introduce my from the Judiciary Committee Andy Biggs thanks man thanks thanks lis and thank you to all for supporting this effort because this is really a very top-line important issue we have to get to these documents we need to be able to see the FISA application that we've been shut out on that we need the 302s we've been shut out on that we need the assistance for the president because we're not getting assistance from the DOJ and the FBI now I just want to divert for one quick second as we've gone through this and been interviewing people both closed-door and say and you've seen some of them openly I've been struck and no pun intended but I've been struck and related to some of my colleagues that it is beyond me that we can find this this thread you have as Matt just said you had the functional handle the the de-facto handler of Christopher Steele the go-between with the FBI his wife is actually working in the same organization to basically D spirit and defame a presidential candidate from the opposition party we have everything that we learned about Peter struck and Lisa page in those highest levels and Eva cabe those who have left and those who are forced out as we've interviewed them I've been consciously struck that they haven't felt remorse for any of this conduct they they haven't seen any deviation from what they might think is normal practice that is why we have to get to the bottom of this because as we go through this if these folks continued to display a lack of conscience or remorse it indicates that we might have a bigger problem than we even perceived today and so I call upon the president with my colleagues to declassify this information so we might continue to find out how deep and how broad this goes thank you and now I'll introduce my colleague Keith Roxas thank you any Keith Ross mr. Pennsylvania 12 you know the American people believe in fairness and we have institutions in our government including the FISA Court where you need to have fairness and there needs to be disclosure and so in the interests of fairness for the American people they deserve to know what was going on the American people also deserve to be to not have to put up with the 'unless spin from one side or the other and there's a disclosure of this information without disclosing sources and methods give them a chance so in the name of fairness we're asking the president to have these days click Declassified thank you we we do they did call votes about 15 minutes ago so before but we're doing okay right now on time but I just wanted to make sure any members of the press have any questions okay so we're gonna get to a couple questions and then we do have a couple more members that want to speak Kathryn here it's Fox News does the president support the declassification of the documents and if so then who or what is the block we would have to defer to the White House to answer that question with regards to the president we would like the president to declassify and release all this information we called on but we don't we can't speak for him as far as what he wants I just clarify just one thing that someone said is it accurate that McCabe's struck page and the Justice Department's Andrew Weissman knew about ORS wife's work as well as Steele's animus towards the president before the FISA application I believe all that's accurate I can go back and look at the transcript nothing well I would love to see is the transcript made public from the I think approximately seven hours that mr. aura was in the in the transcribed interview but I believe everything decided there is that we can't speak for the the contents of the 302s there are 12 of them but that is one of the reasons why we're here is to be able to speak to you about the contents of the 302s so one of the points that was made earlier by congressman gates as it relates to the 5s applications is that something that he would expect and I agree with him of what the contents of the fisa applications would show would be based on the emissions of what you don't see in it however the two other reasons why we're here the 302s of Bruce or as well as some of the documents that have been provided to the gang of eight that has exculpatory evidence with regard to quarter-page and others that that would include information that should have been presented to the FISA Court and wasn't but to answer your question that's really one of the reasons why we're here is because we want all 12 of those 302s to be released to help answer that for you understand the pattern every single time Bruce or had a meeting contact phone call skype whatever with mr. steel or mr. Simpson he then followed up with a briefing with the just FBI and Justice Department every single time and we know he had a whole slew of these because some of the stuff has been released specifically the emails and text messages between mr. Oren mr. Simpson and mr. steel so to be clear that was before the FISA application yes okay obviously I've met with the president on other items I don't normally comment all my conversations with the president I can say that in my conversations with the president and the administration he has been very consistent on wanting transparency and I have not seen a major pushback on this request as long as it protects sources and methods and so I think we're the vast majority of Americans they would see it as a welcomed response from this president and I've not gotten any indication of a pushback but as you know I don't come in on my conversations with the president I will say that this particular issue and Leah and Jim and Matt had pointed this out the information was collected in an abnormal way it was verified in an abnormal way and it was prosecuted in an abnormal way you can't have all of that and end up with a process that actually is is representative of doing business with Lady Justice having a blindfold on and so it was the improper collection authentication and prosecution that we have run across and unclassified documents that we believe that the classified documents will further illuminate it's not just all those impropriety it's the fact that the FISA courts have not protected the integrity of the courts and we know that because there has been no one held to account for the impropriety by the Justice Department in coming in and getting not one not two not three but four FISA warrants without providing the court proper information and if the judges were doing their proper job and we're not so chummy with the people that came before them then they would have already had hearings in contempt of court for what they had done using the physis system and when we had the testimony by mr. Rosen Stein and I repeatedly asked him did you read the application you signed and he continued to refuse to indicate even read that the judge said I had him in court the next day demanding to know what the heck was going on and why he should not be in contempt of court for certifying something he didn't even bother to read all of those things contribute to why we now have to ask the president please declassify the courts are not doing their job the justices had injustice throughout the top of it and this is the way we get to justice thank you we were able to get a number of documents I've had conversations with Deputy Attorney General last week we were able to get a number of documents that we're actually currently reviewing to our check list to see if we've got those I can't tell you that the response as has been very voluminous in the last week or so and so we're we're right now our staff is going through to see if there's anything remaining so we should know in the next 24 hours or so whether there's still outstanding document requests as it relates to that particular effort whether it be impeachment or contempt as you know the speaker and and the Chairman agreed that if if they weren't responsive they would look at a contempt resolution and judiciary and it's too early to tell them that's where we well I don't believe that that person is doing a good service to faithfully execute their job and performance of their duties whether it's to the President to the White House or to the American people and that that person should not be inside of the administration and they should submit their letter of resignation and move on to something else if they want to go join the resistance if they want to fight President Trump they should do not should not do it from a position where it is very important for us to have the best people possible to protect American national security to make sure that our military set up for success to ensure that our veterans are taken care of when they come home to grow our economy when you appoint people to important positions within the government you rely on them to do their jobs exceptionally and that person was even though they said anonymous they are outing themselves as someone who is not serving the American people in the performance of the duties that they were appointed for III believe that I don't know who the person is I don't know what job title that they're currently filling and I and I think that more and I think that more that we the more that we learn about it the more would be able to answer that question as informed as possible and right behind you unleash the power of the media you guys are able to find out things that quite frankly most people can't find I can tell you that we're taking this very serious from me as Lee would say from a national security standpoint and that's really my focus and everybody's entitled to free speech that free speech is something that should be protected and guarded and you'll find that I'll be a Sentinel for doing exactly that and yet at the same time if you're having highly sensitive and classified meetings within the Oval Office and you have someone trying to resist those efforts you know I think all of us would agree that it is highly unusual and perhaps the only time it has ever happened that a an anonymous source has posted an op-ed being part of an administration I don't recall it perhaps some historians can correct it so so we're looking at what is proper from a legislative branch standpoint we have oversight over the executive office of the president and federal employees committee and so as we look at that we're working very diligent the New York Times in a very difficult spot because you have one part of the New York Times who's keeping that source close you got another part of the New York Times that would have to do their investigative techniques for a Pulitzer prize-winning story and do that so hopefully there's nothing in this town stays secret forever and so I do believe ultimately we will find out who was the author and we're looking at what is a proper role for our branch and yet to not overstep that when it comes to the national security concern there's no concrete will you recall to testify the former FBI director or his deputy to determine who signed off in the back communications between or steel and fusion GPS we have some members of our Judiciary Committee and oversight in government forms we get Nellie Oren for a transcribed interview ASAP and Glenn Simpson as well I do think based on what we learned from mr. or The Andy McCabe was in and on this from the get-go because we know that shortly after the first meeting that mr. Orr and his wife had with chrissteele he went straight to Andy McCabe so certainly McCabe seems like someone who should be brought back in but I'm more focused right now on Ellie or and Glenn Simpson what about director Comey we'll leave that up to mr. chairman Gowdy well I guess this is a news breaking day I have a different opinion than the speaker never happened listen again we're in the early stages of this I spoke to you earlier I think what I normally use the vernacular we meaning the legislative body a little bit more uniquely tuned into this just because of my subcommittee work with the federal workforce and the oversight of the executive branch and and yet you know it may be something that fundamentally is only the role of the Department of Justice and the executive branch and so you know we're less than 24 hours into this I don't want to jump to any conclusions do I take it seriously certainly should we all take it seriously without a doubt and and and hopefully we'll be able to come up with some kind of concrete steps you know in the days to come I just ask one more question quickly okay just one more question I just to prepare for today I went back to the June testimony of the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and in that testimony he seems to indicate that he has been relieved of his responsibility to sign the fisa applications is that anyone's understanding sorry can you come just come to the podium because I think you're right I have to go back and look at it as well but I remember in that Testament I think he made that decision himself to kind of recuse himself from signing with that is that in light of the IG investigation I got to go back and look at the transcript okay thank you thank you all for attending I want to thank my colleagues for their great work and mr. president please declassify and release these documents

I want to thank everybody for for joining us on this special birthday celebration and that's really what it is it's a celebration the celebration of the law that has greatly improved the health and lives of everyone in this country 21 years ago we weren't debating on how to weaken or delay the the implementation of our clean air laws instead we were debating bipartisan legislation that would improve and strengthen our clean air laws 89 senators let's write eighty nine senators approved the clean air act amendments of 1990 which a republican president george herbert walker bush signed into law 21 years ago today and we are all better for it we just asked tom tom tom when where were you like 21 years ago you were you in the house represented we were in I'm just kidding we are in the house we were voting for this stuff and working with John Dingell to see it become become law and it wasn't just Democrats was it a lot of Republicans is very much a bipartisan initiative well I've always believed that we can protect the environment and grow our economy at the same time it doesn't have known have to make a choice we can have both and we should the case of the Clean Air Act we have since we passed the clean air act amendments of 19 well since we passed the Clean Air Act of 1974 every dollar that we spend installing no pollution controls and cleaning up our air we've seen some thirty dollars return in term in the form of reduced health care costs better work place productivity and save lives in other words fewer people are getting sick today and missing work because of the Clean Air Act either work because of their own sickness or the sickness of a child or the seconds maybe of a parent and here's some more good news our economy didn't take a slide because of these protections either in fact the opposite is true since President George Herbert Walker Bush signed the bipartisan clean air act amendments of 1990 electricity rates of state constant while their economy has grown by sixty percent in this country of ours despite the successes more needs to be done sixty percent of our citizens are still breathing unhealthy air we also know no more today than we knew 20 years ago about how pollution in pairs health we know more about how pollution travels from one state to the other we know that don't we Ben and we know more about how to curb that to pollution in ways that make sense in a cost effective last week's victory in the Senate against the resolution to dismiss the cross-state air pollution rule gives me hope the clean air can again be a bipartisan effort as it once was and I'm hope that we can all work together for a cleaner tomorrow a stronger economy and the healthier people

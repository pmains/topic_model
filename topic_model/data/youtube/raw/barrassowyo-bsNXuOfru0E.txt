than senator john barrasso the republican senate republican conference chair as i say wyoming republican i'm very good to have you senator there is talk right now that washington could intervene here that there could be a move to stop this uh and that congress could do that it's a little murky but how do you feel about that well i think it's important that we try to avoid this strike neil the impact on the economy is about 2 billion a day so about 15 billion dollars a week it will hit supply chains and you know the president ought to be very involved here the president tells his ability as a deal maker and he tells his influence his push that he has with the unions and how they listen to him as you just reported it's one of the main unions that's trying to prevent a deal that so many have already agreed to the president ought to get involved all right now i'm just wondering if we get to that point though senator where workers leave and you have 115 000 across the country uh this was thought to be at first something only you had to worry about if you were afraid we're waiting for freight now we know it's going to affect passengers as well on so many of these amtrak lines that serve as both i'm wondering what you think the impact is going to be well the impact's going to be dramatic we're talking about moving products from from farm to the store to the markets we're talking about moving energy all of those things if we don't get them moving it's going to increase prices add to the inflation we already got terrible inflation numbers yesterday i think this is going to add to the problems that we're facing now as a nation under this administration this needs to be resolved i'd like to see it resolved quickly but what people are concerned about most at home with me this past weekend in wyoming are the cost of everything and specifically food you know senators think of you your state is a big energy state that the president is is still back up that plan to freeze oil and gas leases just as his counterpart in great britain the new prime minister liz trust is talking about expanding energy production off the north sea um so that's something he's not open to doing what do you think well i think that this president in this administration and the democrat party their religion is climate joe biden came into office and said he's going to shut down all fossil fuels he's done it with keystone he's now frozen oil and gas leasing he's even on going after leases that have been sold to explorers for energy in the previous administration and it seems that he is trying to take us from energy dominance to energy dependence americans know what they want we want energy that is affordable number one is affordable and available and reliable but the climate extremists the the radicals that are running the democrat party they don't care about any of those things certainly not affordability what they want is energy that is renewable that takes precedent over everything no matter the cost of the consequences and as a result people are going to be paying more for energy to heat their homes cool their homes to move their vehicles and certainly to keep the lights on senator finally um we talk about this inflation and this backdrop that that isn't great we have a wholesale inflation report which the prices before they get to us still stubbornly high and the only game in town appears to be sir the federal reserve the expectation is that next week it could raise interest rates another three quarters of a point maybe a full point um what do you think of that are you worried they could be overdoing it well that's always a possibility the you always worry how do you calm down the the inflation how do you get those prices down i know what i would do and that's i'd cut this reckless washington spending unleash american energy and cut washington regulations but the headline in wyoming to me tells the story of inflation and it's that food prices continue to soar and it's the list of things that people use on a daily basis it's bread it's milk it's eggs it's meat it's chicken fruit vegetables and we're seeing prices in the last one year neil that have gone up faster than in the last 40 years these are the things that people worry about and in eight weeks they're going to be voting on that and that's why i'm very optimistic about our opportunities to take back the united states senate and take the house of representatives senator barrasso thank you very much watch this closely we are

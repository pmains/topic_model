the gentlewoman from iowa ms acne who is the vice chair of the subcommittee on housing community and development and insurance is now recognized for five minutes thank you chairwoman and thank you for all the work that you understand is important to this country which is housing for americans and affordable housing in all parts of our country and i'm here to actually ask questions about the real issues that we're facing uh and thank you to all of our uh folks here for attending a study recently found in iowa 75 percent of our children under six years old had lead in their blood this is the fourth highest in the country uh dr del rio i know this isn't quite your specialty area but can you tell me a little bit about how lead can affect children thank you very much for your question uh representative axel uh yes uh you know lead accumulates in in the brains of children and therefore it impacts their development many years ago the uh the government banned lead in in paint and in toys and in other things that could lead to children licking that lead and leading then to lead intoxication which you know causes anemia causes many things but eventually will cause developmental deficit and those children with lead intoxication in in their house uh are probably never going to develop normally and will have developmental disabilities which will lead them then to to to actually not be able to be productive americans so we are really hurting our future by exposing children to that well i appreciate you bringing that up and so if i'm hearing you correctly there's literally no safe level of lead for children is that correct uh again i'm not an expert in that area but my answer will probably be no lead is not something that normally goes into our bodies so any lead could probably be dangerous led i appreciate that and having unfortunately having this kind of level of lead poisoning in iowa's children is very concerning to me and so i want to focus on some of the causes and solutions that we might have here uh mr shaheed my understanding is that lead is far more likely in areas where more older or there's more older housing especially housing from 40 years ago or more does that fit with your research yes uh thank you thank you representative for that question yes it does um our housing stock really across the nation um um you know has not gotten the attention particularly of that housing that's relied on you know households with with fixed income so our elders as well as uh low-income families just haven't had uh the type of upgrading and regular up creek upkeep and and maintenance um and the lead issue is both an issue of paint inside the house but also issues as we know obviously with flint um and with many other municipal water systems as well so lead also in the water lines thank you for that i appreciate it it appears we don't see the same level of issues with new housing so ms rice is building new housing or replacing older housing with new as we've structured in the build back better act likely to improve our children's health by better protecting them from lead yes it definitely will and in addition to that as i alluded to earlier the neighborhood homes investment act provides substantial subsidies to enable the refurbishment the renovation and the rehabilitation of naturally occurring affordable housing that is already existing in our communities throughout the nation so it provides the funding needed to to you know remove the lead paint and to update the water lines thank you for that one last thing i was surprised to learn when i got to congress that we've had no usda multi-family housing built in more than a decade um so this is of course uh of housing for our rural communities and we all know you can't expect to have safe affordable housing for everyone if we don't build anything new and that's why i've been working to fix this for a couple of years uh funding for new usda housing is included in the bill we passed here last month miss rice i'm wondering if you can describe the impact that you think bringing also affordable housing out to our rural areas could do for this country oh that's tremendously important one of the challenges that we face in rural communities is problems around infrastructure and the ability of that infrastructure to support safe and healthy housing so the funding to support rural housing development is really critical well thank you so much i know that we need to get this work done to build more affordable housing of course for our working families and a key part of that for me is to make sure that we protect our iowa kids from the dangers of lead exposure in these older homes i hope that we can all come together as americans to make sure that we protect our children and have safe affordable housing for people across this country thank you so much for your time and being here i appreciate all of your testimonies and i yield back thank you

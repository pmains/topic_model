[Music] all right welcome everyone thanks for being here my name is Chris Murphy and I have the privilege of representing Connecticut in the United States Senate I'm joined here today by Salvage Schiano a good friend and president of Connecticut afl-cio and James pander Alexander who is from New Haven legal assistance and we are here to talk about the introduction of a piece of legislation called the workforce mobility Act this is new legislation that I introduced this week with Senator Todd young Republican of Indiana and it is groundbreaking federal legislation first-of-its-kind introduced in the United States Senate that will unlock enormous economic growth potential in the country and in particular here in Connecticut this bill is simple in its scope it bans the use of non-compete clauses in employment agreements all across the country what are non-compete agreements well they are what they sound like they are clauses in your employment contract that prohibit you from going to work for a competitor of your current employer once you leave that company approximately 20% of workers today have a non-compete clause in their contract and many of those workers don't know that it exists in fact 93% of employers don't negotiate the issue of non-compete clauses as part of your employment contract it's just stuck in there in fact about 40% of all non-compete clauses are stuck in your contract after you agree to the job and the scope of these non-compete clauses is pretty breathtaking now most people think of non-compete clauses as applying to higher income workers or workers that are involved in businesses that have a lot of intellectual property and that is true many times non-compete agreements are applied to individuals who are working in technology firms or are executives at companies in competitive industries but what people don't know is that there are millions of workers in low-income jobs that have non-compete clauses in their contracts - these are the workers that more often than not have no idea that the non-compete agreement is part of their contract may be the the most notable example was the fast-food sandwich chain Jimmy John's for years Jimmy John's had non-compete clauses in its contracts for fast-food workers meaning that if you wanted to go work for 50 cents more at Subway or at McDonald's you couldn't because you had signed an agreement working the cash register at Jimmy John's to not work for any of Jimmy John's competitors that's ridiculous and it constrained millions of workers to low-income jobs there's growing evidence banning the use of these non-compete agreements will add to economic growth first these non-compete clauses reduce the availability and the supply of workers when workers can't leave their jobs they aren't available to go work for other companies and so these non-compete clauses artificially constrain the free flow of labor which is frankly why a lot of conservative Republicans are starting to be interested in legislation like this second there's ample evidence to suggest that non-compete clauses suppress wages we need to be laser-like focused on raising wages right now people are working today but they're not making enough money and when you have people working for fast-food restaurants that can't go get another job in the fast food industry that pays a dollar more an hour non-compete clauses allow for companies to keep wages low because they don't actually have to compete with other companies and third there's all sorts of evidence and this is common sense that non-compete clauses hinder entrepreneurship because if you can't go start your own company because you're locked in to an agreement at your existing company then it stops the ability for new companies to form in industries where non-compete clauses are the rule and I guess the best reason are the best evidence to show how this legislation could unlock economic growth in the country is that there's one state that doesn't allow non-compete agreements and that's California Silicon Valley is an example of what happens when you can't put non-compete clauses in your contracts all of those startup companies in California they're a byproduct of California's decision to not let Don compete clauses hinder entrepreneurship now it's important to note that this legislation doesn't change the existing law on trade secrets thus it is still and would still be actionable for an employee to take a legitimate trade secret from his current employer and use it to benefit at a future employer and so there's still plenty of protections built in for companies lastly before I introduce Sal and James let me just talk about why this is important for Connecticut so Connecticut has a growing and developing high-tech sector financial technology here in Hartford biotechnology down in New Haven media technology in Stanford but because we are a growing high-tech economy we desperately need to bring in labor from surrounding states New York and Massachusetts where much of this labor is allow for non-compete clauses they are not amongst the states that have banned them so a national ban on non-compete clauses would much more easily allow for the flow of human capital into a growing high-tech market like Connecticut second Connecticut is a high-cost state thus we should be desperately focused on increasing wages for everybody including low-income workers and so when non-compete clauses suppress wages for low and middle income workers it particularly hurts workers here in Connecticut who are maybe much more sensitive than workers and other places to wage suppression because of the high cost of living here so this is a I'm excited about this legislation the first of its kind in the the Senate excited to have Todd Young a conservative Republican as a co-sponsor a lot of Republican interest in this bill we expect to be adding more co-sponsors on the Democratic and Republican side this is one of those pieces of legislation that is a chance of passage and I want Sal first and then James to talk a little bit about their perspective on it good morning everyone thank you senator Murphy for putting this together and taking the lead on limiting non-compete agreements that not only hurt workers but also her innovation and our economy what are non-compete agreements quite simply there are contracts between workers and companies that delay or prevent employees ability to work in competing businesses and they use as a condition of employment so I think agreement is a misnomer it's really an anti competition agreement that is foisted upon workers by corporate CEOs now an employee traditionally may have used a non-compete because they're trying to protect trade secrets or highly confidential information but recently we're finding that employers are forcing their workers to sign these agreement have no access to this type of information for instance some sandwich shops were trying to prevent their workers from taking jobs with any competitors now imagine being a low-wage worker who gained some experience and wants to look for another job with better pay with East ninth would prevent them from even being allowed to work in any similar type of job and that creates an environment where a company has zero incentive to improve their workers wages or benefits other workers have been forced to sign these agreements our camp counselors hair stylists yoga instructor instructors Amazon warehouse workers and even unpaid summer interns workers should not have job opportunities restricted by these agreements these unjust contracts deprive millions of workers the freedom to accept a job take new opportunities or to start a business in the same line of work or industry after they leave their current job the right to leave your job is the only source of real bargaining power for many non-union workers and it's especially critical for workers subject to mistreatment on the job are faced with low wages non-competes may even compel workers to stay in discriminatory or hostile work environments without the option to take their skills elsewhere the growing use of non-compete agreements is just another way employers are rigging the system by eliminating a workers right to move to a better paying position they artificially suppress wages which in turn reduces overall economic growth if you wonder how you could have full employment and wage stagnation this is one of the major reasons why change at the federal level is the best policy a national law barring non-competes are limiting their application to workers and low wage industries while also providing an appropriate excuse-me providing for private right of action would be the best policy outcome we stand in full support of this bipartisan effort to limit the overuse of non-competes and at once again thank senator murphy for taking the lead Thanks I'm gonna try to avoid repeating some of the things you just heard but overall it's notable to me that often in this building when we've been talking about raising the minimum wage especially the argument that has come from the other side has been people can conclude that sow we do it in this society what non-competes do is after you've been told that you're supposed to climb the ladder they say they pull you back off of the ladder and that's a very good reason for people on both sides of the aisle I think to support their elimination in New Haven legal assistance I represented low-wage workers and we see non-competes often enough in industries where nobody expects to see them we see I have janitor clients I've had CNA clients restaurant worker clients all sub thinking they're subjected to these non-compete agreements whether those agreements are legitimate under existing law or not really doesn't matter because if you're a janitor cleaning a building in New Haven you are not going to hire a lawyer to go to court to fight a non-compete agreement if you're if you come to my office maybe you could get some help but for most people that's not available so it's very important to low wage workers that non-competes be eliminated we think that about between 15 and 20 percent of low-wage workers have are forced to sign non-compete agreements in this country we think one in five workers overall so the percentage of low-wage workers affected is almost as high as high wage workers and I want to give you an example for a client I had named Maria Maria came to my office because she had lost her job taking care of her grandmother at home and she she was told by the agency one agency she couldn't do it because she had signed a non-compete agreement with another agency so we talked about that problem and I learned that this was not Maria's first time losing work due to a non-compete agreement previously she had been working at a McDonald's owned by one franchisee my friend another franchisee from a different town offered her a promotion to manager at his McDonald's but they had a no poach agreement between them that was implemented by the McDonald's Corporation and so the McDonald's that wanted to hire her for a manager was not able to so she had to stay at the lower wage at the original McDonald's then she went to take care of her grandma at home she was working through an agency and some point for reasons that had nothing to do with her the agency switched and the new agency said well we can't hire you signed a non-compete with the other agency whether this was true or not didn't matter because she thought it was true right so she has now lost two jobs including one doing the most important job to her that she could possibly do be doing which is taking care of her elderly grandmother due to an agreement which is completely exploitative you know we talked about wage theft wage theft is very exploitive we talk about discrimination against people coming out of jail very exploitative and reduces reduces people's opportunities non-compete agreements are in that same category and I applaud all the members of Congress who are working to eliminate them and I think this will make a difference than the lives of our clients thank you very much for for all of your work again this is it's interesting I had introduced happy to take questions I had introduced a much more scaled-down version of this bill in prior congresses it was a bill that bans non-compete agreements for low-income workers and the issue Minh and the advocacy behind this moving so fast that this year I introduced the legislation which would have been my preference at the start to ban them completely and got Republican co-sponsorship for it again there's a there's a movement within conservative political and economic circles to ban non-compete agreements because they are seen as fundamentally non non-competitive and so I'm excited about the prospects to continue to build out this effort and I'm excited about what it could mean ultimately for Connecticut's economy be happy to take any questions was pretty much awful no 20:18 was was targeted too low I think it was pretty non-exempt employees yeah we're slightly dim and my hope is that senator Rubio may join me in this legislation we're talking to his office currently but yes it was similar in that it was targeted to again that lower wage worker category in part because at the time I just didn't know if I could get you know broad bipartisan support for a for a full ban on non-compete agreements and again the ground on this issue has shifted such that I think we can get a we can get bipartisan agreement for this broader bill because then when I ran a piece where somebody attacked your version as onerous as opposed to Rubio's which was to cover people were broad consensus that ridiculous yeah I can't no I can't necessarily explain exactly why you have seen this movement towards our side except that I think it as we as we uncover more and more examples of these of these low-income workers that have been constrained it becomes harder for people to defend the existing system and I think there is also a conversation happening about the diminishment of startups in this country right we've had a we have a crisis in this country in that we are not starting as many businesses as we were 20 years ago and we're all exploring the reasons why we've seen this diminishment and entrepreneurship and I think as we've tried to explore the answers to that crisis non-compete agreements seem to be part of the of the reason evidence it was stress there is this shift not why but are you talking about just the fact that they're now some conservative Republic oh yeah I got you yeah no I mean it's it's I guess it's just the feeling that that I have and the interest that has been shown by a number of Republicans in joining me and the fact that senator young was interested in not signing onto my legislation from two years ago but onto a more aggressive bill and my sense is in talking to senator young that there is and I can certainly try to pull some of this for you that there is increasing interest in the conservative think tank world on this issue now admittedly to James's point it may be because Republicans are trying to come up with reasons to avoid increasing the minimum wage this they may be interested in trying to answer concerns that that have been raised about the fluidity of the labor market but there's no doubt that there's much more interest amongst my Republican colleagues in this issue than there was two to four years ago can you give us some other examples McDonald's was mentioned here I mean is this is this widespread at at fast-food and by that I mean you know Burger King and Salam's and the sandwich shop Oh was that a reference to Subway I mean who else does this so I think the large chains have are by and large stopping this practice and there's kind of two practices that they're reining in one are the know poach agreements which also in the case of my client Maria had a big impact that was not an agreement between the employee and the employer that was between two separate employers an agreement not to poach high-quality employees from the other which from the employees point of view is basically a no promotion policy or no competition policy those are largely going away or are totally gone because a large number of state attorneys general sued these sued the mother corporations the parent corporations for these no poach agreements as violations of state antitrust laws and there were large settlements in many states about that non-competes I still see used in a widespread manner they sometimes are used by fast-food franchisees they're used by janitorial services they're used often enough in home health care those are the industries I see them you do sometimes see them in real oddball places like landscaping companies and usually when you see them what the purpose of them is not necessarily to legally bind anyone to anything the purpose is to communicate to the employee that we've got you you're stuck and you can't leave often they are and often they're not it depends well there's company they basically there's a multi-factor test that judges there's judge made law in this and they're looking at essentially the reasonableness of the limitation and often enough if you had for example a fast food worker band a bad food worker from West Haven band to work in fast food at any other job for a year within 15 miles if a judge sees that we are hoping that we can win that argument with the judge but the judge would decide that we would hope they would we would win the argument but it doesn't matter it because for the most part because McDonald's employees are not going to hire a lawyer to challenge a non-compete agreement in court just so I understand even though these may be individually owned franchise homes owned by mr. Smith one's owned by mr. Jones you sue the mother corporation and you can block it that way certainly with the no poach because the no poach agreements were corporate directives from on top so in terms of the no poach agreements you had companies as diverse as Carl's jr. Jiffy Lube Jackson Hewitt agreeing not to take each other's employees and in fact there were 60 different corporate franchises that formerly engaged in these no poach practices as soon as you hit it with some sunlight though they go away the Washington State Attorney General was instrumental in making these corporate owners change their policy so you know the sunlight has been a very effective disinfectant on non-compete clauses and non poach agreements and so you know this legislation which is the strongest that's been introduced in the Senate thus far you know may have in fact likely will have some impact even if it doesn't get signed into law this year I think it the US Chamber of Commerce and right yeah I don't think this is a layup and you're still but um you know there are as James mentioned there is a patchwork of state laws there are a small handful of states like North Dakota and California that ban them out right and then other states have these tests and so if this book and again I think there's growing interest in states modifying their non-compete laws sometimes when you have you know aggressive state action creating a diverse quilt of laws on a particular on a particularly burst and 'red the national associations will look to the federal government for for national legislation so I think again as there becomes more interest in this issue as states look to modify their laws that might change the disposition of some of the above some of these companies and again I doesn't I would argue that the only person who's protected is the is the employer of those employees the employer many employers are losing the forest through the trees though they might get protection of the employees that are currently in their company they are losing the benefit of a free labor market whereby many other incredibly qualified employees might knock on their door if these non-compete agreements didn't exist so sometimes employers who defend these things you know don't understand the benefit that would come to them if the labor market freed up yeah yeah sure obviously questions of government and instability fall under the 25th amendment Pence's but do you see any concerns about because of the length president behavior that may color our support for it or at least a greater willingness well I'll say this I am I was on the floor of the Senate as members came back from the meeting at the White House and both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate who were at that meeting were visibly shaken by the behavior of the president and that's not always the case I a lot of my Republican friends you know are you know pretty good at keeping a straight face as they defend him it was hard I noticed it was hard for some of my Republican friends certainly Democrats to try to defend the president's behavior in that meeting um I mean I listen uh I think the president is behaving especially recklessly today but if you watch his speeches from the campaign trail in 2016 they're not a lot more coherent than the speeches that he's giving today and so I think we should focus on limiting the impeachment inquiry to the president's actions because I'm not sure that his behavior is so fundamentally different to the behavior he exhibited during the campaign that you would you would you would resort to the fairly extreme remedy of impeachment or the 25th amendment to get rid of him I mean bringing the g7 nations to your own resort and making millions of dollars off of it is corruption at its core and you know it's been buried by all of the other news surrounding his corrupt actions in Ukraine and his abandonment of the Kurds but it's just extraordinary that the president would so brazenly advertise making money off of his position Remer I mean we all expected that the president was going to separate himself and his family from his business interests when he became president he didn't he still is going to make money from all of the business that foreign leaders are doing in his hotels and his family members are still involved in businesses overseas evanka well she's been at the White House has been gaining licenses in China so it wasn't I I think that this is a fundamentally corrupt act bringing the g7 to the president's own personal resort so that he makes millions of dollars off of this event but clearly it's clouded out by a lot of other big news that raises just as serious concerns about his conduct race on the on the obviously on the Democratic side I don't I don't correct my brother I don't think you've endorsed anybody and you personally know all these senators who are running what is your synopsis as a student of history student of politics you follow this very closely supposedly Warren picking up momentum I mean I I just think we have a long way to go until the caucus in January you know if you if you I am a student of history and you know if you look at the history of Democratic nominations in the past there were lots of candidates who looked dead and buried the summer before the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary who all of a sudden became our nominee you know John Kerry is probably a great example I mean he was I think 7th or 8th in the polls in Iowa a month before and and he rose to win the caucus and go on to be our nominee so I don't think you know you should count anybody out at this at this point and I think that there's lots of voters all across the country who are you know who are still very much undecided and I guess my broader analysis from the beginning has been that I think you have I think you have these two competing interests amongst Democratic voters Democratic voters are always interested in the in newer candidates fresher faces who bring an excitement and to the race but this year people are so exhausted with this president so focused on trying to inject some stability back into American government that you know Canada like Joe Biden is you know getting a lot of attention and a lot of support because I think there's a lot of folks that are focused on on stability maybe more so than in previous Democratic primaries so I think you have these competing interests of Democratic voters that are probably going to be pushing up against each other all the way through the primary season perhaps the two frontrunners their questions about Joe Biden's age and it was with Turin some of the positions you stay like raise some eyebrows sure so where does electability be on your list of how do you are going to make up I my experience is that it's really hard to predict electability right so I mean right we all you know major major news organizations wouldn't cover Donald Trump for large portions of the Republican primary because they thought his candidacy was a stunt Barack Obama by many was considered unelectable or you know early in the race so I guess I'm just not worried too much about judging electability this early and you know if you believe the polls there's not a whole lot of separation between the candidates in terms of how they do against Donald Trump and what seems to affect it most right now is name recognition so I guess it's just not a big consideration for me right now are you looking to endorse somebody by the time the Connecticut primary or but the convention next year what is your time frame well I'm certainly not making a commitment not to endorse I very well may endorse I endorsed Hillary Clinton early in the 2016 primary I endorsed Barack Obama well there were still lots of viable candidates in the field in 2012 so in the past I've you know I've endorsed well the race was still very much undecided admittedly it is Mark pointed out it's a little bit trickier for me this time around because I you know have more personal friendships in this field than I've had in past fields but yeah if I really think that one candidate is clearly better for Connecticut than the other candidates I'm a you know I'm a choose to make an endorsement I also don't I I don't know that it's that important who I endorse I just I just don't know that you know I don't think it's gonna tip the balance I'm not even sure in Connecticut whether you know voters here you know too much UI endorsed so I also am not gonna you know overthink it and I I mean and I I wouldn't sort of hype you know having interest unless we really did so I think we I would predict that will grow our list of co-sponsors yeah because there's um I'm gonna do co-sponsors differently on this bill I think I'm gonna try to do one for one I think I'm gonna try to make it a real bipartisan bill and there's I you know I could have signed up a whole bunch of Democratic co-sponsors right off the bat but I think Senator young and I are gonna try to have equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats on this bill going forward to give it a better chance of actual passage okay thank you everybody appreciate it [Music] you

chairman I'll renew my request that the witness be sworn when John Stumpf was here his company had adversely affected only three or four million consumers we swore in that witness that is the precedent of this committee in situations like this Jerez already spoken to the matter mr. Smith you've made a point of that you're an unpaid volunteer for your company I want to thank you for that service aside from the ninety million dollars your uncompensated I know you've disputed the ninety million dollar figure so I'd ask you to respond for the record in detail how much you have made pension stock options and salary from Equifax during your term there and we'll see whether the reports of 90 million dollars are accurate timeline there is the period March to July when you should have noticed or your company should have noticed the problem should have paid attention to the homeland security advisory etc but on July so that's one part of the timeline another part starts on July 1 when you're a chief information officer told you about the attack and that the website was shut down now there are those in this committee room who have said that the company didn't act immediately on that on July 31 that's not entirely true in just one day August 1st three of your executives sold $2 of their stock that shows an immediate action right after the CIO report does your company have any policies on allowing executives to sell stock getting legal advice before they do so etc or is it up to each executive to decide how to obey these security laws congressman let me address both one it was there was never a report issued on the 31st used to be clear that was a verbal communication but right but you were told and the website was shut down there was it and if something pretty significant happened because the next day three of your executives sold two million dollars with the stock the websites ask you answer the question whether your company has a policy of getting approval and legal review before your employees sell yes there's a clearing process and how and how would you pass that clearing process selling the stock just the day after the chief information officer tells the CEO that there's been this data breach as a clearing process required for any section 16 officer these three were section 16 officers they all follow the process the chief and you don't think the process is broken when it approves the sale of two million stocks within 24 hours of when that she way of when the CEO gets a report of the most enormous data break what turned out to be the most important data breach we've had in your industry congressman I have no indication of the process was broken oh these three individuals who sold had no now to the best of my knowledge had no knowledge just of your luck I'm now you're the initial response of Equifax was to have a website advertised is your way to help consumers and then in the website you tricked consumers this was the plan trick consumers into forgoing their right to sue whose idea at the company was it to do that the arbitration clause is what you're referring to that exact never intended when we found out the arbitration clause was in there within one day you just found out somehow it it popped in and you didn't know it was there it is a standard clause in products where consumers have options to buy product it was never intended to be in there for the free service it was removed within 24 hours after a huge outcry including many members of this committee now you've put out press releases telling people that they may be among the 143 million people is that the intention of Equifax to send a notice to those whose datas were data were compromised or is it up to them to go to your difficult to use overburden website to find out we followed what we thought was due process we sent out press releases set up a website how about noticing are you going to give notice to the hundred and forty three million people I got to send him a letter no sir gonna send him an email no sir so is it every everybody out there figures there's a two-thirds chance they weren't affected and they may do nothing and you've not bought it you've you've exposed their data and you won't give them a notice not even an email four hundred twenty million US consumers have come to our website four hundred twenty million US consumers that's more than the number of people in the country says they've come multiple times which means that many haven't come at all you won't notify people I yield back time of the gentleman has expired

big idea 10 p.m. and 1am Eastern CNBC tonight a doorjamb an under the first federally ordered quarantine in more than 40 years tonight infected with an extremely dangerous form of TB travaux fluorosis and this is after taking two transatlantic flights possibly infecting other travelers earlier this month and we've told you the survival rate on this particular form of TB can be fifty percent he was on the no-fly list and he knew he was so does the superbug highlight security threats for the US and will fears about inflection spread to the market sorry joining us now is a chair of the House Homeland Security Committee representative any Thompson Democrat from Mississippi he's going to be holding a full committee hearing on this matter on wednesday june six but congressman Thompson let me just begin you know this man Andrew speaker new we have this form of TB he was in Italy he was contacted by US government officials and they said you could your infectious people could die don't get on a plane will get you home he gets on a plane and somehow people are saying he didn't break the law and this person shouldn't go to jail I mean I I this is unbelievably offensive well I think one of the things we want to look at at the committee hearing next week is to make sure that all the protocols were followed we're concerned that even though a notice was put out that this individuals are able to get back into the country unstop and in constant communication with authorities so we need to make sure that whatever our systems that we have in place at those systems work and in this instance they did not work congressman Thompson isn't this ending would you agree with this analogy someone who knows they have HIV has sex with someone without a condom and then says oh it's not my fault that you got HIV I didn't knowingly potentially kill you is that analogy fair but I think well I understand that analogy but what we're looking here is whether or not CDC in communication with DHS all those but not all those protocols were followed and then we need to see what went wrong one of the things we want to look here is how can we improve it if it officials in Italy will they notified what they say keep this person until we can get someone there we're not sure so what we want to do from an oversight perspective on our committee is make sure that our systems work I'm concerned that somebody with this dangerous of disease can just go around the world and virtually be unstopped get to a border the computer says you shouldn't travel and he's allowed to come into the country we go to New York our US Marshals pick him up at the hospital that we asked him to go to so there are still a lot of things with this that we have to work on I'm concerned about it a lot of other people and at the end we hope to get the facts 2000 Congress congressman there seems to be two issues at play here right one is whether the CDC should have tried to quarantine him in Italy I think the other one is clearly a security issue you know if this guy can run around the world with tuberculosis you know what can a terrorist who frankly I don't know if you had heard yet but apparently the father-in-law of Andrew speaker actually works at the CDC in the tuberculosis unit and I'm curious if you plan to be investigating whether he had any role in this I'm curious whether mr. speaker called up his father-in-law and said can I travel well I think part of what we can do in the public forum if the hearing is do that there will be some classified hearings on that bear specific subject and if in fact in a classified setting certain things come out that saying things were illegal and obviously we will take care of it but at this point some of the information we won't be able to share with the public but I can assure you our goal is to get to the bottom of it if this person should not have been traveling as we understand that to be the case then we want to know how was he able to leave the country how was he able to get that we knew where he was why we didn't intersect in in Italy and prevent him from coming back to this country and we knew in that the issue for us is what happens if someone uh we are not sure it's trying to come to this country and can get in we knew where this gentleman happened to be we had all the phone numbers and yet in steel he was allowed to come back into the country unstopped and that should not be what does it save a border control in a more in a broader sense your committee is obviously designated to be dealing with Homeland Security and and clearly this is this this tuberculosis issue is one thing but terrorism is another and and what is about where we really are at this point what to say that they are stealing our abilities our systems are all as good as the people who manage those systems our communication is only as good as the people who operate the communication system I'm very concerned about this I can assure you we work on it as diligently as possible but at the end of the day we'll just have to let the facts speak for themselves after the hearing after the classified briefings we move forward on it I'm happy that we now know where the gentleman is he's in denver getting the best of care we need to identify all those persons on the plane that he came in contact with all those things we have to do while also trying to get what systems failed in this process congressman Thompson we both appreciate it thank you so much for joining us we appreciate it and I just want to get a chance and enjoy talk to you for one more second about this all right Andrew speaker he said quote I'm a very well educated successful intelligent person this is insane to me that I have an armed guard outside my door when I've cooperated with everything other than the whole solitary confinement in Italy thing I'm not sure he's any of those things exactly he happens to be a lawyer I think ace you'd probably bear the cost frankly I'm all of the work that's going to have to go on for the next several weeks to try to find all of these people I mean forget about it whether it's illegal or not just think about the cost we're a Wall Street kind of show here that this is an enormous kind of cost that's going to take place over the next several weeks and months as they try to find all these people quarantine them test them the stuff that's going to go on in Washington this is the least he could do it some humility as a non intelligent non successful educated person all right look no I know we're laughing but nonetheless very serious matter and when one that we got very excited about we're going to take a break up on the other side

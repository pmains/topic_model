hi congressman tracy mann with a quick man minute the house this week is going to spend a lot of time talking about china and specifically a bill that the democrats put together called the competes act it's really the concede to china act understand unfortunately that this bill is 3 000 pages it was put together with zero republican input or support and many of the things that were in the buildback better plan that has not moved forward have been pushed into this plan they're trying to ram it through 325 billion dollars understand that the words coral reef appear in this legislation more time than the words china there's the climate change police it's sending eight billion dollars to the u.n um for climate change initiative unfortunately it's toothless talking points instead i signed a different legislation called the countering communist china act and this act actually has teeth it really talks about how we need to address china stealing over introduction property talks about highlighting the human rights abuses that we see throughout china especially in their genocide of the uber muslims talks about coven 19 and that we need to really look at the origins of kova 19 how it came about in wuhan how the chinese government chose to cover it up um this act also bolsters nasa security we ought to be doing those things instead of this bogus concede to china act we also need to spend more time really focusing on our trade relationship with china specifically the commitments that they made two years ago in the phase one um trade deal where they committed to buying a certain amount of our products and here two years later they're 16 billion dollars short of buying american ag products there needs to be clawbacks of that there needs to be accountability they made a promise they didn't connect they didn't they didn't keep their promise so discouraging but make no doubt about it for decades to come china is our adversary we need to have serious legislation put forward that addresses china unfortunately that's not what we're seeing in the house that'll most likely pass this

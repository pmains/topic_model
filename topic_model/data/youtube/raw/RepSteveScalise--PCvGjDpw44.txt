let's bring in house minority whip and louisiana congressman steve scalise we can leave that live shot up there in geneva because we're about to see the president walk up to the microphone and congressman great to see you thanks for joining us uh to what mike pompeo had to say earlier on all this talking about just the optics of this what we're about to see this is going to be president biden standing there alone giving this news conference after we saw president putin deliver a solo news conference the former secretary of state said that this shows enormous weakness not to stand up together with putin on that stage and talk to reporters he said putin showed up or loaded for bear the fact that you can't stand up six or eight feet from your adversary and tell the world what you talked about he worries that this shows weakness so set this up for us as we await the president uh to take questions from reporters here yes sandra unfortunately we've seen a lot of weakness from president biden as it relates to russia i mean you look day one president biden kills the keystone pipeline kills thousands of american jobs undermines our relationship with canada and then he turns around just a few weeks ago and he gives financial incentives to russia so that russia can build a pipeline to germany so he helps russia create russian jobs and russian energy dominance with germany and he undermines america's energy dominance that we had under president trump is he going to stand up to president putin on the hacking that's been done from russians the disinformation remembers president biden who was vice president when russia tried to interfere with our 2016 election i didn't see president biden stand up to him then i hope he stands up to him now but it's a long time coming and so far he hasn't proven that he's willing to stand up to russia in fact he's been helping russia every step of the way it's time that we get tough against all of our adversaries not just russia china iran look what they're doing with hamas in israel it's time for this president to stand up to the bad actors around the world what do you hope to hear from the president when he takes questions in a few moments we heard we heard from putin we heard his side of the discussions mike pompeo also saying just a moment ago he hopes that biden provides some clarity on the red lines um in the in this discussion with putin what do you want to hear well i'd like to hear him confront for president putin on what he what russia has done to interfere with many aspects of american life you know you saw the hacking of the pipelines there's a lot of other ransomware attacks that we see the disinformation that russia is very actively engaged in putin himself was engaged in more disinformation today it was really bizarre when earlier today president biden was asked if he trusted putin and he said yes how could you trust a former kgb agent especially one who has shown a history just in the last few months of trying to undermine america and again what what they've done uh with with cyber attacks uh with attacking our allies uh with undermining our energy security and biden helping him do that it's time for president biden to stand up to the bad actors like putin really interesting as far as what else we heard from putin what came out of this meeting he said he and biden don't see eye to eye on many issues but both sides show that they are willing to understand each other as he did call these talks constructive do you believe it's a good thing that these two world leaders are sitting down together and that they did meet today it's always good to have dialogue between the united states and people around the world whether they're allies or our enemies or or people that we're trying to address problems with and there are a lot of problems that i hope president biden has brought up to to putin and i hope he frankly puts red lines out there to where putin knows there there are places that he's got to go to resolve issues and if he doesn't there's going to be consequences what are those consequences you know why did president biden give him that gift on the nordstrom pipeline without at least addressing some of these other problems before he deals with something that hurts american energy security what about that sort of deflection as it appeared from putin that when it comes to these cyber hacks that it's not russia it's not his country he said it's the united states it's latin america pointed fingers elsewhere that's classic putin disinformation and again what is president biden going to do to stand up to that we know a lot of it's coming from russia and it's continued to come from russia the disinformation that comes from russia it's time for this president to stand up to to people like putin steve scalise from the great state of louisiana sir thank you thanks for joining us thanks andrew

rise today in support of my amendment to h.r 7617 which will increase funding for the law enforcement mental health and wellness act grant by 2.5 million dollars in order to comprehensively address policing in our nation we must address the mental health needs of law enforcement officers for example officers are more than three times as likely to die by suicide than from shootings rates of depression among officers are more than four times higher and rates of ptsd are five times higher than the general population that's why i have worked to substantially increase funding each year since these grants were created to help with law enforcement training peer mentoring and mental health program activities it is important that our officers know they are not alone and that we provide the resources they need to protect our communities as well as their own mental well-being thank you representative rose for co-sponsoring this amendment and thank you and you

a very important topic thank you all for being here previous hearings we've discussed how Isis is self financing and how that's kind of unique compared to some other Islamic extremist organizations in Syria and other places their self financing through smuggling extortion murder rate you name it these are bad people you I think general Dempsey you mentioned some of the things that we're doing have we been able to truly disrupt their their financing source that will lead us to help and guess break up their logistics we have certainly disrupted it there are some things that I be more willing to share with you and classified setting where we have reflections of the impact of some of the things we've done against their oil revenue for example but again some of that's probably best described in a classified setting okay but I will tell you the answer is tier the answer is yes we have significantly disrupted their financial support I mean because after all if we can drop the ability to buy beans bullets and band-aids I mean hopefully we could want another way to break their will to fight congressman I just add to that a couple of points we made this morning on this it is your point question observation is part of the comprehensive effort that we're using to stop them and it isn't just force yes that's big part of it but all the other pieces and just as you said you don't cut off that funding source they'll keep coming and so it's a priority piece of of the overall strategy and we are making progress earlier the status of forces agreement was brought up and it was said that we have more of a diplomatic note in y'all said you you feel like that's enough to protect our men and women in uniform from any form of prosecution in Iraq which led me to believe usually when there's a military force there's a civilian contractor force is there currently a civilian contractor force providing logcat type services to our men and women in uniform and what kind of protections do they have and how many and how many do you think may be over there okay yeah but we did not we intentionally have approached this mission in an expeditionary way so we're not dragging in a big log cab to provide life support for our forces we're dealing with it as a military now that said there is as you know there's an office of security cooperation in Iraq that deals with the FMS case it's the part that the secretary referred to is the part that never left Iraq where these two hundred military men and women who are helping procure weapons systems and then provide them to the Iraqis over time that is supported by a contract whether it's with a particular weapon system dealer or in some cases trainers and they have as part of the contract they have protections and immunities under the contract okay secretary Hagel I think this week you were quoted as saying you know you were actually at a Veterans Day speech at the Vietnam War Memorial and you publicly stated we must openly acknowledge past mistakes and learn from them because that is how we avoid repeating them I'd have to agree with you I mean Congress I think has been honest and just saying that sequestration and placing those devastating defense cuts on top of our men and women uniform was a mistake there's a lot there's a huge appetite to you know remove those defense caps but also I think a lot of people look at this administration and see that they've made some mistakes and how we've handled ISIL how we've handled a rock the 2011 withdrawal and I and I hope that you know through your comments alone that this administration and others will be honest and not glossing over the past but looking at it honestly so we can avoid making these mistakes because our men and women in uniform their lives depend on it so thank you thank

so care for seniors Act of 2018 I'll now turn to miss will or ski bill sponsored to give an opening statement Thank You mr. chairman I want to urge my colleagues to support HR 65-61 the comprehensive care for seniors Act of 2018 I introduced this bipartisan legislation with representative Jenkins to bloom an hour and kind I want to thank them for their hard work on this bill and their previous work on the issue the programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly commonly known as pace is a pro is a proven model for delivering high quality comprehensive integrated and coordinated community-based health care for seniors it helps seniors whose health condition otherwise would land them in a nursing home to remain in the community for as long as possible by allowing them to see health professionals and social service providers at local pace centers in 2016 CMS released a proposed rule to update the original guidelines from 2006 this much-needed update would allow pace programs to customize their interdisciplinary team around needs of each enrollee provide more services and community settings outside of a pace Center and give greater flexibility to partner with community providers HR 65-61 requires a secretary of HHS to finalize updated regulations for pace by the end of this year while still giving the secretary the flexibility to make updates and changes to the proposed regulation seniors facing health challenges should have the option to receive high-quality health care while continuing to live at home and the pace program helps them do that st. Joseph pace in Mishawaka Indiana has proven this model of care is effective in improving health outcomes and quality of life the pace program is long overdue for an update and this bipartisan common-sense legislation will ensure improvements are made quickly so more seniors can live longer at home I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense bill and I yield back the balance of my time the only heels about back I'll now recognize mr.

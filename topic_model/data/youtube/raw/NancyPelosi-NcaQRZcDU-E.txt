thank you very much Speaker I Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding I welcome to our group and appreciate his very important important remarks as we observe the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre as always I'm absolutely honored and pleased to join my colleagues at the distinguished former chair of the Foreign Relations Foreign Affairs Committee and now chair of the subcommittee congresswoman Ross Layton mr. may mr. Walton mr. Smith and I have been fighting this fight together for decades I thank them for their courage we both opposed our own presidents today a Republican I Democrat on a Democratic president on this subject this is a bond that we have had about respecting the dignity and worth of every person and when we saw what happened in Tiananmen Square it was almost unbelievable to see the government of China turning on its own people having tanks run over their children in Tiananmen Square who were speaking out against corruption who were speaking out for more openness before speaking out to speak out I have treasured this poster in my office over the years the 25 years it has been signed by every major dissident who has been able to leave China not many of them can go back but it is the symbol that mr. Chris Smith talked about of the man before the tank it's one of the most iconic figures in the history of democratic freedoms in the world however if you were to go to China and ask young people about this poster they know this picture they know nothing about it it has been censored they they cannot they don't tell people what that is some said maybe it's a commercial for something or I don't know what that is so powerful is it that even any discussion of it in China for young people at the University of Peking University which was a place where many of young people came forth and said they would like to end corruption expand freedom of expression what form of government they will have as mr. Smith has said it remains to be seen up to the Chinese people but the fact that they could not even talk about it without being run over by tanks it was stunning it was really remarkable he's stunning because we really not seen anything quite like that in the spring up to 1989 25 years ago a community of activist dissidents students and Chinese citizens stood up for their rights in Tiananmen Square a people were inspired by a path political of political reform advocated by some of China's leaders who were purged he want hooyo bung and Jo Jo young the people spoke out against the abuses of their government a people demanded respect dignity liberty a voice people cried out for freedom their souls yearning for a better future they called for the elimination of corruption an acceleration of economic and political reform for freedom of expression and assembly they called for a dialogue with China's leaders on how to make progress a people protested demonstrated marched a military was turned against the people it was supposed to protect the People's Liberation Army turned on the people of China and a young man again stood alone in the street bringing a line of tanks to a grinding halt you don't see it here but the track tanks turned they turned away from this lone man and did not run over him for all the world to see an image seared into the memory of all who saw it a photograph unforgettable to anyone committed to the promise of human rights a moment that then then and now challenges the conscience of the world we cannot have any moral authority to talk about human rights in the world if we ignore the violations and human right and rights and a big country a prosperous country an economic engine I remember my colleagues do to that at the time the trade deficit with China with the US we had a deficit of five billion dollars a year that was an enormous trade deficit and we thought it would give us leverage to free the students who were arrested in Tiananmen Square we just wanted to free them to respond to the moms the parents free those students others in the chamber had said we could use that five billion dollars at the same time to stop China for blocking a US exports into China or stop them from transferring technology missile technology and the rest to Pakistan and beyond but there were those also in the Congress and in the country and actually on the Chinese payroll because they were lobbyist advocates lawyers and all the rest they hired everybody who said oh no no no you can't use that five billion dollars for leverage to free those prisoners to stop those barriers to our trade to stop their transfer of technology to countries that might then turn them over to rogue countries you can't do that but if you remain calm there will be peaceful evolution and all this will come will be improved in fact our trade with China will grow their freedom will increase these people are still arrested the trade deficit is no longer five billion dollars a week a year five billion dollars a year it's seven billion dollars but not a year from five billion dollars a year to seven billion dollars a week and not one cent of it used for any leverage to free prisoners or to challenge the Chinese in terms of the violations of human rights in China and in Tibet it's stunning they just there's own the show that's just the way it is five billion dollars a year to seven billion dollars a week oh my god progress has been made but not by the American worker but not by us our economy no by the Chinese government it's really stunning it is really one of I think the the stories that has to be told about the us to stand up for who we are and what we stand for 25 years ago Tiananmen became synonymous with the battle for human rights in China again an iconic site for aniconic struggle for justice and democracy 25 years later the spirit of chandaman indoors in the hearts and minds of those continuing to struggle both in China and around the world what moral authority do we have to say to a small country you cannot violate the human rights of your people but we'll take anything the Chinese have to dish out because we have a commercial interest they're the heroes the heroes and we have to talk about them because the Chinese tell them nobody cares about you anymore these heroes still display the unmatched courage required simply to speak up and speak out I thank congressman Chris Smith for bringing this resolution forward and Speaker Boehner for tomorrow for this week holding an official remembrance again it is tomorrow to allow us to stand united with these heroes today any mention of these events of June 4th 1989 is centered from the Chinese people the victims and their families are imprisoned and persecuted by the Chinese government the human rights situation in China Tibet continues to deteriorate today the Chinese people may not know that truth about Tiananmen it's a long time ago many of the young people weren't even born yet corruption though they do know is rampant in the Chinese government the rule of law is not applied in a fair manner they suffer in justices with no redress of grievances air and water pollution are making them unhealthy and destroying their environment and that may be something that gets the attention of the government mr. wolf thank you for your leadership for your courage when when mr. Smith talks about going to Chinese prison number one I know that you led the way there today dings the line' and and the Tiananmen mothers bravely keep up their calls for dialogue and their supporters worldwide joined the demands that the Chinese government provide an honest accounting of the crackdown stop persecution of the families of the demonstrators and allow the families to mourn publicly without interference today huge elbow remains the world's only imprisoned Nobel Prize Peace Laureate as he and his wife Shia joined so many others still languishing in prison for criticizing their government are trying to exercise and secure their basic human rights we had to play a privilege of being asked by the family some of us to go to Norway when you shall bow would receive the Nobel Prize as some of you may recall there was an empty chair because the Chinese government would not allow him out of prison to go to receive the Nobel Prize and so we were part we joined some members that were selected to be part of the delegation was that one of the great honors of our lives I think we all agree that it was we're not here today just to acknowledge history we are here to learn from the memory of a dark chapter of our past and to write a brighter chapter of freedom and justice in the future we're here to support the tenement movement how many of those young people who got out of China who came through here told us their stories of courage we cried together they tried together to make sense of how they could make a difference for those people who were left behind we are here to support the tenement movement which indoors inspires and cannot be stopped I'm hopeful I'm hopeful because there are conversations that happen with the Chinese government I've had my own on the subject of climate change and environmental issues like clean air it said that are problematic in China that maybe there can be some communication that can be constructive I'm hopeful that the visits that we've had to each other's country to talk about one subject and another without getting anywhere near that taboo and their view of our talking about people or their freedom that perhaps in the communication that exists in the world today that maybe we should we have reason to be hopeful but with the passage of this resolution Congress will say to the people of China and freedom-loving people everywhere your cause is our cause we can never forget we must never forget we will never forget and again the Chinese government likes to say the prisoners nobody knows you're here they don't remember who you are they don't remember why you came here well we want to give light to that because over the years we have always joined together in a strongly bipartisan way to come to the floor to go to public events to tell say the names of people who we have not heard of their fate but that their mothers want an accounting for and as we do this we do so look forward to a day when the world's most populous country can be called a country where people can speak out be respected and when the Chinese government respects its own people it will command much more respect then so again I thank you congresswoman Ross Layton so much for taking the lead to bring this for congressman Castro for your very very important remarks to my pals mr. wolf and mr. Smith you've done so much you've made such a difference it's an honor to serve with you and to work on this important project together but that Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

thanks for coming out i can't think of anything i'd rather do than a groundbreaking in july outside this is uh fantastic um now look uh thanks for thanks for being here um you know canals like this we we often just drive over them and don't even think about it we don't think about what it does what its purpose is and and don't even realize oftentimes that we're crossing it but when you have events like the rain bomb that we had in 2021 the the thousand-year flood in 2016 uh the 1983 flood we become acutely aware not just of these bayous these ditches these canals these rivers but we become acutely aware of how critical their performance is you know you you look at all this debris that i think the corps of engineers brought in from mississippi as a prop and uh i'm kidding i'm sorry um you look at all this debris that was removed these are all obstacles or obstructions these are these are things that prevent this this ditch this canal from from draining this project is important and this one is the mayor noted it's five different uh bayous of canals we refer to as the five bayous project it's jones creek and ward creek and bayou fountain in the northern part of the parish it's beaver by you and black water by you and and this is really important it's about a quarter of a billion dollars but more importantly this by itself isn't going to solve all of our problems which is why this is part of about a billion dollars of investment in the amit basin that we're we're we're constructing right now everything from the over 500 million dollars for the co-meat diversion project pulling water off of the emit river and getting it out giving us more drainage capacity the highway 22 bypass giving us another outlet of the imminent river outdoor lake morrow park giving more drainage capacity the mayor i appreciate you prioritizing the master plan for storm water because we can't stop at what was needed for 83 or 2016 or whatever we truly have to look at development have to look at the future and so this is an important project and it's going to remove as was noted hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of debris and material but we cannot stop we've got to keep moving forward keep making investments and ensure that when we have rainy days we don't cause people to tense up and be concerned about flooding again because we can live sustainably in these communities and this is so much more important now because of what we're seeing with revisions revisions and flood insurance under this risk rating 2.0 program that's going to end up causing flood insurance rates to go up this isn't removing debris this is about sustainability this is about lower flood insurance rates it's about safer communities and i'll say it again it's part of a billion dollar program a billion dollar comprehensive program for the amy basin now last thing i'm going to say um i i want to i do want to thank the the mayor i want to thank colonel murphy and and mark wingate and nick and everybody at the core that have been prioritizing this but i want to say one last thing as i as they give you all kind of a punch and a compliment at the same time um look we provided funds for on the same exact day for livingston parish for livingston parish to do clearing and snagging 450 miles of clearing and snagging have taken place in livingston parish we're still working on 50 miles here we've got to have a process that reflects the urgency of the need we cannot stop we cannot be complacent and we've got to stay focused on faster outcomes so thank you and i think i am turning

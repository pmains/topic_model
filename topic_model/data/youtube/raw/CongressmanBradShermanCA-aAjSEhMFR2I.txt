I rise in support of the resolution and I rise in opposition to the recent decision of the Trump administration we had a situation in Syria that was stable we had a modest deployment of American troops we were successful in limiting American casualties to a very low number we had defeated the Caliphate our friends the Kurds who had incurred most of the deaths by the many thousands necessary to destroy the Isis Caliphate were safe in other words the situation was stable and favorable to the United States now we have taken an action in which America he is humiliated the Kurds are subject to slaughter our word means less in the world and Isis stands to be revitalized this is such an obvious mistake it is far defined anyone with any knowledge of foreign policy it regards it as anything other than an unforced error it is such a grave mistake that it makes you wonder whether it was an intentional mistake designed to give Russia territory in Northeast Syria for whatever reason we might want to do that it is time to reevaluate our policies toward turkey which since the 1940s we have cerf safeguarded turkey through our membership in NATO and theirs we protected turkey from subversion in the 1940's and protected it for the Soviet Union for decades recently over the last 20 years we've had a policy of obsequious humiliation tora in our approach to Turkey we have kowtow to Ankara in failing to recognize the Armenian Genocide in doing so we have taken a foreign policy normally based on truth and honor and instead humiliated our elves through it silence Indus and concealment it is time to recognize the Armenian Genocide by an overwhelming vote here on the house it is time for us to stop dishonor in our relationship with dirt I yield back

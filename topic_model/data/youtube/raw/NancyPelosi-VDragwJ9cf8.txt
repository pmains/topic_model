mr. speaker much has been this is what the eighth day of the Republican shutdown of government small businesses not cannot get loans to expand veterans of have some uncertainty about their benefits tuition us send the rest millions of women and children will go without nutrition programs those who desperately need the shutdown could be over in hours if Republicans would stop being the party of no and just take yes for an answer so in case you don't know I have some very good news for you Democrats have not only been willing to negotiate Democrats have already stated that they are ready to cooperate cooperate for example I have good news perhaps you missed the fact that are the two hundred members Democratic members of the House have signed a letter saying that they're willing to accept the Republican number of 986 even though as the gentleman said we don't like this number we don't think it's adequate but the fact is we don't like shutting down government more so in order to open up government to 200 members have signed the letter and five additional members have made public statements of their willingness to support the Republican number their space in this letter for the signatures of some maybe just 17 Republicans to sign but they don't have to sign the letter many of them had made public statements which we respect and and an honor as their public statement that they would vote for the Republican number of 286 this wasn't about you negotiated the speaker negotiated with Senator Reid Senator Reid accepted the Republican number republican house number the President of the United States accepted the republican house number the Democrats in the house accepted the republican house number the only people not accepting the Republican House number are the publicans in the house so when the leadership of the Republican Party particular go around saying it can't pass the boats are not there it does that mean he does not trust the word of his own members who have said that they will vote for the 986 let's find out let's bring the bill to the floor and that's we're saying just bring it to the floor it's passed the Senate the president stands ready to sign a number we don't like but prefer over shutting down government that is where you we don't like it we want to open the doors of government and we're willing to use the key of the Republicans number to do so newcomer last week Democrats went a step further imposed public and private discussion Speaker Boehner said that he would not doesn't want to go to conference on the budget even though he asked for regular order in march in march early march Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner said they wanted regular order that's a message to the president that Congress should work its will that was good news to us that means you pass a bill in the house you pass a bill in the Senate you go to conference to reconcile your differences perhaps the speaker didn't think that the Senate would pass a budget but they did as a matter of days practically hours after the House passed its budget but what happened to regular order it flew out the window after saying we want regular order no longer do the Republicans want to take yes for an answer and why well some of this is explained under the speaker's own statement Speaker Boehner said under rules under rules listen that word rules under rules if you appoint conferees and after 20 legislative days there's no agreement the minority has the right to offer motions to instruct which become politically moms to throw up on the House floor so to be frank with you we're following what I would describe as regular order what I would describe as regular order is not under rules under rules are the rules of the house the speaker awesome as the power of the speaker is and I understand that do not have the power to just decide what regular order is and if you don't want to honor it regular order just say you're not going to honor it but don't redefine it in order to keep government shutdown so listening to the speaker not wanting to shut government down wanting to at first and then after it was shut down wanting to open it the house democrats took a step unprecedented by any minority party in the Congress of the United States the house Democratic minority said we will surrender we will relinquish our right to motions to recommit that motions to instruct an insider term actually placing conditions on how we go to the conference table so he said to the speaker don't worry about that if that's important to you if you want to shut down government because you're afraid of a motion to instruct will allay your fears fear no more Mr Speaker we will not offer these motions that is end as an example we didn't offer the motion on the first night which was our right to do when this bill was introduced as that all of you will agree was so we have said we have made that claim this is as that unprecedented but is a necessary move to end the Tea Party stranglehold on our government and restore basic service services which millions of people in which millions of people rely guests for an answer 200 signatures and I wish a unanimous consent to submit this letter for the record that objection hundred signatures it's a beautiful sight because I want to tell you something it's about cooperation none of us likes this number all of us want to open up government that's why we signed it I want to thank congressman tim bishop and congressman patrick murphy and congressman keith Ellison for producing this result and put that there so we've said yes to your forgiving of the votes on something we don't like we said we won't do motions to instruct please take yes for an answer if you insist on being the party of no then don't hide behind something and say who won't negotiate we cooperated we gave you what you wanted and now here we are today Republicans are offering yet another motion to keep government shutdown some people call it in the press the super committee others call it the Ted Cruz committee whatever you call it I'd like to know who writes this stuff this is so ridiculous a proposal so ridiculous a proposal how about we go to the budget table and see how we can reduce the deficit produce growth for our country but all we're going to do is cut our investments in education investments in making the future better we're going to make seniors suffer more while we do not touch revenue and we will not allow any discussion of closing special interest loopholes that's how they want us to go to the table you must be kidding as I said who writes this stuff you know sometimes there's an expression that people use its it flippantly they'll say who do you think you are if you say something remember that from your childhood if somebody say who do you think I think we have to take that sentence very seriously who do we with an emphasis on think that would be interesting who do we think we are do we think that we are a party that is responsible all of us a congress that is responsible that wants to do the right thing for the American people know that we have to come here to cooperate with each other to get something done in a bipartisan way to my fellow colleagues on the Republican side I hope allowed mr. speaker they are members of the body do you think you have come here do you think you have come here to to make sure that people know that you can do this just because you're doing it it's just a waste a total waste of time and we don't have time to waste in fact we could be spending our time in such a more important way working in a bipartisan way on entrepreneurship creating growth for our country investing in the education of our people which by the way brings more money to the Treasury than any other initiative you can name early childhood k through 12 higher education Lifetime Learning you want to reduce the deficit invest in education you want to increase the deficit cut education but let's sit down and talk about that and the path to get there is one that says say yes to 986 we did your number says accept our offer we won't offer any instruction to the committee but don't continue to be the tea party of no mr. speaker yep I hope that the speaker does that allowed mr. speaker I hope the speaker will give us a vote so we can see this Congress stands on the serious responsibility that we have and if the Republicans will even accept what they are asking us to accept this rule should be voted down this commission is a joke whether you call it the Ted Cruz Commission or the super super in what way certainly not super in meeting the needs of the American people to recap a we're giving you two hundred votes for your number take yes for an answer be speaker doesn't want any conditions or discussion or anything else on the floor about the budget we're willing to accept that take yes for an answer

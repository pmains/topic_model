just off the plane from uh how's that aloha nice to be home yeah it's hard well not this one i mean this is pretty easy you guys you guys got the tough one there [Music] just off the plane from dc last night and here this morning beautiful saturday morning in waipahu at the filipino community center also known as the philcom center this is the heartbeat the center of our incredible phil m community throughout hawaii uh this great center behind us was conceived 30 years ago now by leaders of a philip philham community here in hawaii and it was completed in 2001 it's been open for 20 years now and it is it is really the the the spiritual and cultural and and uh educational and commercial home of our philan community throughout hawaii which at this point has been in hawaii since 1905 with the sakata coming over from the philippines the very very first generations in 1905 and they've grown now to about 400 000 plus here in hawaii incredible accomplishment incredible achievement past present future they're now part of 4.2 filipino americans across our country one of the most rapidly growing uh communities in our entire uh country that have expanded beyond just hawaii to places like you know california and so many other places i've got great members of congress my colleagues in congress sometimes from surprising places for example bobby scott bobby is is a senior member of the us house of representatives he chairs the education and labor committee one of the most powerful and influential committees bobby is african-american filipino he has an interesting history he represents uh norfolk virginia and so these are the folks that i that i associate with in in congress to try to to try to bring the best uh to our philharm community across the country many many issues uh ranging from from uh trying to get health care uh to our philharm community sometimes very unusual uh different kind of circumstances we clearly try to help with small businesses our phil ams are are really the center of our small business communities how's that aloha thank you where are you guys going where are you going all right see ya thank you and the center is really a part of that this is the largest um and still one of the only uh filipino community centers throughout our entire country so it is really a source of incredible pride to our philan community we're here because it's been been a year and a half since the center was opened uh the center uh supports itself uh through through uh meeting rooms uh convention rooms a cafeteria full-on cafeteria and dining room where many events are held not just for the philharm community and they've been closed for a year and a half so you can imagine like many many other uh organizations and and uh folks throughout throughout our state it's been a hard long hard road and so we're i'm here with the philharm community and other friends to just celebrate the center celebrate the community okay thank you just to celebrate and really just to clean it up get it in shape for a full reopening so i'm going to interview you a little bit is that okay sure all right so you are a toy area right that's correct all right tell us why you're you're so critical and important to the philcom center here oh jeeves i i don't consider myself a critical i did serve as its executive director you were the executive director of the philcom center and it's formative right were you the first executive director uh no i was actually the third third and what were your years of service i was here from 2004 until 2012. okay all right so the philcom center opened in 2001 right yes i think i have that right and it uh struggled a little bit coming out of the gate that's correct right because it was just um you know brand new to the community and and uh the finances were a little shaky in the beginning uh the community of course supported it but you you had to get it underway in terms of of actually serving the community because well actually roland casamina who is a nephew of mine and eddie flores were the two people that were instrumental right kind of putting this up and one day i got a call from roland casamina and asked me if i was still interested in the philippine center because i came in for an interview when they were trying to look for its space executive director they said yeah i still am two years after that interview they called me back and said are you still interested i said yeah sure i am and they said let me call you back in a couple of weeks and apparently the board met and they approved my appointment as the next director so roland called me and he said uncle they approved your appointment so when can you come back away i said well give me at least a couple of weeks so i can tell the mayor that i need to go back here you are you are a long-time city employee right yes i was with the city and the state for 38 years 38 years with with the state also with the state i was mostly at the university right but that was this thing yeah i see and then you were at the city though i was with when you came for 16 years right right right and so you came over here and you said 0-4 right yes until 12 did you say yes okay so what what were the um you know what were the challenges you had to overcome during that period that this was still early in the center's history yeah when i first came the ballroom and the kitchen were not finished yet there was a 1.2 million dollar federal grant that but it was a matching kind of run so we couldn't find enough money to match it we found about 800 000 i had to return the rest because we couldn't use it do you remember what kind of federal grant it was i i forgot what it was yeah it's probably a cultural um historical culture no it had something to do with physical construction oh i see okay so i couldn't spend it for running programs or anything like that it was to finish the center mostly the uh the ballroom and the kitchen which are the money makers here like if the ballroom is really going then you can make money off of large events and conventions and that kind of stuff it generates about one-third of the total income of the center right right in terms of income from the facility the majority of the income comes from the uh seven or eight rental units downstairs right right the commercial the other third and this room right here which is the meeting room yeah i've used it all myself in one way shape or form we used to have a teleconference capability over here and one of the things i had in mind before was have the famous doctor before he died and we were going to use our teleconference facilities to broadcast it to medical students in the philippines i see that's something that i never got off the ground but it would have been a fascinating project right so you know here we are where um today 20 years since the center opened 30 years since the first discussion of the center by eddie flores and roland casamina and you know the real leaders of the philcom phil am community at the time i mean what does the center mean to you now well i i think it has contributed a great deal in terms of improving the filipino identity in the community it just really served well as a meeting place and in the beginning and hopefully even now as it continues to exist that the filipino community is proud that we've been able to create this kind of facility for the communities yeah it's one of the only ones like it in the entire country right yes it's the largest community filipino community center anywhere in the united states anywhere in the u.s four million plus philams yes uh throughout our country of whom uh somewhere around ten percent are in hawaii but right here we have the largest it continues to be burdened however by a four million dollar loan uh we've been trying to paid it out slowly yeah uh one point softer in kovac 19 to keep your income going yes because you know the primary source of income here is gone but hopefully it will start to pick up was the center able to have federal emergency assistance during covet 19 with any of its uh debts or operations you will have to ask the uh your successor yeah highly i will so you know everybody in the in the philharm community here in hawaii knows who you are but there are many people that are of course not part of the community tell us a little bit about kind of where you came from i mean how did you how did you come to this position are you are you born and raised in hawaii or or what's your background where did you come from i i i was born and raised in the philippines actually and came to the country where where in the philippines in 1957 ah where were you born in the philippines i was born and raised in manila actually my father was supposed to attend the world's trade fair in new york in 1957 but he got operated on for officers right and he couldn't travel so he decided to send me with my mother and my elder sister to attend the world's trade fair at the coliseum in new york oh yeah and so i went after that we went to the washington state fair in seattle in washington were you representing the philippines that was representing my father's firm oh i see what was his philippine chamber of commerce so after that i ended up in san francisco after the world's street fair in the uh in seattle you know that was the year that the space neither opened anyway i got a call from my father and said you know son since you're already there and you might as well go to school and you know you can say no i don't want to i already had an elder sister in michigan so that's where i went but i spent a full year there it was too cold for me i decided to come back to hawaii hey how are you good to see you yeah aloha anyway i think they're asking us to come outside for a quick speech so we'll we'll continue this at some point toy so good to see you you've been such a great leader with uh with the community and of course the center here if you need any assistance in your campaign please thank you so much hi aloha hello morning aloha mabuhay it's so great to be with you i just actually got off a plane from washington dc yesterday afternoon i'm only here for the weekend um really this is uh the main reason i'm i'm home this weekend is that of course the opportunity came up to come down and and help you all with this incredible center and it's something that i really wanted to do it's it's so good uh to see folks that i've worked with now for decades uh on behalf of our philharm community and our state and our country and our relationship with the philippines and there are many people here that i haven't met uh yet and i'm hoping to spend a little bit of time with each and all of you uh while i'm working because i do intend to work i i don't intend to be a slacking off you know congressman that just kind of comes down here and doesn't do it so give me the hard stuff um it's it's it's incredible to be at the center it's hard to believe that it has been 20 years since the center opened it and 30 years since um the community first conceived of this incredible uh facility still the largest of its kind in our in our country and when you take a look at 30 years that's a whole generation a whole generation in which uh there's been such incredible advancement by the philharm community across our country over four million uh philharms in our country at this point four hundred thousand here i think you all know that uh here in hawaii in my congressional district i represent out of 435 congressional districts in our entire country i represent more phillams in my district than any other district in the country the second biggest is the second congressional right up the street by the way so here in hawaii we take very seriously in congress our obligation uh to to do right by our philharm community and by all of the issues that are so important to the community whether it be you know business or health care or our international relations with our brothers and sisters uh um in the pacific uh but for me um it has been of course like for all of you a difficult uh year and a half a year and a half where our lives were up ended our normal lives were upended in every single which way and we all needed to to fall back on our sense of ohana our sense of community uh to really get through this and um the philharm community did that so incredibly awesomely um it is just really heartwarming you know we forget that um we did a once in a 10 year census during the middle of the covet 19 crisis and of course the community was so incredible in making sure that you reached out and counted um all of the members of the community and others throughout our throughout our state that's so critical for us speaking of federal funding uh to get the census right uh and i think we did get the census right for the community and then of course as we went into uh literally trillions of dollars five or six trillion dollars of federal assistance to get us through kovid19 and into the vaccinations which is still unfinished business your community was so incredible uh along those lines and so um you know it's just been sometimes in the worst times you find the best in people in the best in communities and so i'm just really proud of you i just want to say that as your congressman i'm proud of our state i'm proud of our country in many ways for kind of getting through this in in pretty good shape okay so much for the past now the future of course we've got a lot of work to do we've got to get our country back in shape we've got to get our communities back in shape we have to rebuild our relationships around the world we've got to make sure that we do get federal funding to hawaii happy to work with you on whether we can figure out a way to help you uh here at the center but um that's all kind of beyond uh where we are today uh today i'm just really happy to be with you here to to kind of uh you know get this incredible center that that means so much uh to the community and by the way not just uh to the philharm community it means a lot to all of us whether we are filipino americans or not it means a lot to me uh that we have this center here uh and that it is uh fixed up and and looking good um as we come out of kobe 19 so um great to be with you and uh please um please you know as i'm working here for the next couple hours come up and story with me a little bit uh don't be shy i'd love to um you know for me this is an opportunity not just to help you out but to listen to you and make sure that i understand what your concerns and needs are so that i can take them back to dc anyway mahalo now dedicated to the filipino world war ii veterans filipino-american world war ii veterans still working for them in congress right now still trying to get uh we've gotten a fair bit of it done but we still have to get them the final way with the family reunification bill yes that's right where they can bring their families over here some of their families have been waiting for decades oh man you've done that before huh you look like you know what you're doing architects they just draw they don't actually do this i gotta annoy it because um you know it's construction i have to do quality control inspection yeah i wanna make sure that the uh the crew or the man knows what they're doing right right i need to know how things are being done where are you an architect uh well here i'm licensed here i mean uh with a company or with yourself or as an architect i have my own company a small company what kind of what kind of uh design do you do like all kinds residential commercial um boe projects oh school projects which i see yeah some commercial oh yeah what's your involvement with the center here i'm one of the board of directors ah yeah okay how are you being involved in the planning of this uh community center like 30 years uh 30 years ago it's uh people started talking about it yeah i helped him what's your name by the way just for the venezuela venezuela we've met several times yeah but i'm sure you've met a lot of people and you i'm just doing this for the tape yes okay and uh uh so where do you live over here uh in yeah i am yeah you lived there a long time or uh yeah 27 years 27 years wow and you grew up here in hawaii or what's what's your what's your history i came here in when i was 28. ah from from the philippines from the philippines uh what part of the philippines in manila mandela i grew up in manila ah what got you to come here to start with uh well when i married my wife she's from here i see so you followed your wife so you you met how did you meet your wife in the philippines or here ah i see and so so she said i'm going back to hawaii you can you can come or not that's basically it okay yeah so yeah so you still have family in the philippines uh everybody's here ah i see well very scattered all over the place yeah i got a brother in saipan yeah i got a brother in massachusetts yeah i got my brother in san diego and my my son is in new mexico he's stationed there he's in the air force i see and another younger son is in california so i mean you know what does the center mean to you i mean what uh what's the what's the significance of the center to you as a philan actually this is something that we can be proud of and you know this was built not only for the filipinos but it's open to all other nationalities right so that's basically what i know from the very start of the planning process yeah so i i was glad to you know be able to contribute in my own small way yeah so yeah it's an incredible uh it's an incredible center and you're right i'm not filipino american but i'm proud it's been decades since this last couple of decades now and uh you know um tough going in the beginning to keep it going and find find the rhythm in the community yeah covet 19 has been tough for the center you know better than me as a board member but um hopefully it'll it'll come back good yeah well we're uh hoping to so yeah all right june thanks so much all right i gotta finish my job here otherwise people will think i'm slacking okay was here at the beginning so he we were trying to remember where it was i guess it's right there how big is it is it that big the box yeah it's a box it has financial statements for the videos is that when it was the the cornerstone was late i guess no no no no uh 2006 right it must have been a hundred years 2006. yeah or maybe that's when it was power or there it says but we opened in december 2001 one yeah why do you think it's uh oh six well because that was the time that they talked that like to bury it yeah yeah they just think about it when yeah the building what do you what do you uh like what do you think um what do you think the people that open this capsule will will think about um they might be asking who are these people like you know none of us are gonna be around but what do you think the filipino-american community is going to be like when they open this capsule they're going to say oh this is how they prepared the financial statement of the time they would have an idea of how the building was you know constructed how it came to be yeah so it's historical yeah yeah the names of the first donors i know they're there but i mean you know if you think about it 2006 that was only one year after the 100th anniversary of the sakata yeah so that was it's about the same time yes 200 1905 i think they came yeah the sakata yeah yeah and so 100 years 100 years so that's in the middle and then you go another 100 years beyond that that's four generations from the from the sakata to this and another four generations from there yeah what will the filipino-american experience be like at that point in hawaii and what do you hope for oh well by that time i think in terms of population we're going to outnumber any other ethnic group it will be the largest you'll be the largest in hawaii but that's going to happen in the next generation probably yeah because you're number two it you're already number two yes yes you don't have that much farther to go until you catch the us howli's well it's still a big i think we're number one now you know it wasn't the only the japanese no you you're way past the japanese now yeah you passed the japanese about uh 10 or 10 years ago or something like that in sheer numbers um well i think that i think that um it's still the caucasian which is number one followed by filipinos yeah right so by that time i think i don't know if we can over you know oh i think you will i think i think it's a matter i think it's just a matter of kind of the demographics and i think the phil m community will be the largest in hawaii within 10 or 20 years 15 about 50 of all new immigrants are philippines right exactly and uh if you take a look at the national statistics the asian american pacific islander community is our fastest growing uh community of anybody in the country and within the aapi community the lambs are growing faster than most of the other aapi communities so 4.2 million now i'll bet you 100 years from now and you know 10 or 15 million and i hope that you know that growth will be reflected also in the social economic political yeah life of the community yeah yeah i think so the economic ones unfortunately is always lagging behind yeah i think the philam community a hundred years from now for for uh for a community that will be eight nine ten generations into its own history in the united states i think it will have retained its cultural and social and uh historic identity much better than uh many other communities uh just because the community spends so much time trying to you know maintain your your traditions uh well obviously being uh incredible americans you know sometimes uh the immigrant communities they come to uh like all of us come to hawaii and over time over the generations the relationship to the homeland uh culture traditions history the next generation doesn't really appreciate it and then it kind of gets lost and i don't think that's going to happen with the tel am community that's what i think is going to be true and yeah in a hundred years when we open this time capsule or whoever is comes be beyond us uh i think it's going to be a really incredible moment for the film community i think it's going to be almost like the sakata when they came here they never would have imagined that 100 years later the philharm community would have opened a center like this never would have imagined that yeah maybe the same thing we can't even imagine what it will be like then yeah it's a very proud very proud history and tradition encompassed in the time capsule so and you're right by that time the financial statements it's going to be automatic i hope the books still balance here oh yeah [Laughter] well aloha we're at the philcom center here and tell me who you are and uh where you fit into the center my name is kylie arrell and i'm the executive director okay so you you're in charge i like to think so and uh kylie you've been on the job for a month right yes just started i'm the new kid on the block but with that i think i'm looking at it with a fresh set of eyes and the different opportunities available to the center and um how did you how did you come to apply for the job and how did you come to do this job i actually didn't apply i was found by the executive search committee um that was built upon six different board members and so they had reached out to me um and in that process i was a selected candidate and where where did you come from what's your history where where's what's your background well so my mother's been a non-profit for about 30 years so my childhood really consisted of health fairs and going to the different events and volunteering here in hawaii yeah she was the executive director of american heart association for a while and then she was at queen's most recently but for myself i got to see that as a child and i really followed her into her footsteps and so from there i went to saint francis as their development director saint francis healthcare system and then from there i went to ronald mcdonald house we've been doing this for a while yes working with non-profit organizations yeah it's been my passion for a really long time and i really like to take on projects that it's in that pivot phase where okay we've been doing this for a long time and how are we going to challenge ourselves how we're going to come together to have new ideas and so that's really what allured me to failcom was they're looking at okay we've been around for 20 years and what do we want to do in the next 20 and that's something how is your what's your connection to our great phil am community so i'm a quarter filipino if you can't believe it or not i know i don't look it um but my mother is chinese filipino oh um so that is my you come out of the community yes i actually live in mililani too so i'm quite close that's why i'm born and raised in milwaukee where is your filipino heritage from what part of the philippines so that's the fun in or interesting part um when i was talking to the board members about my heritage i realized that i was a lot like many of the other millennials that are in that demographic were not in that generation that came off the boat and came through you know here for the farming or whatever those trade services were we're not part of that we don't speak the language but what we know it's beginning to dilute itself and for myself when i was talking to the board i was looking at as an opportunity to get more immersed into who i am i'm native hawaiian as well so that is always at the forefront we learned so much about being native hawaiian with kamehameha schools and everything but at the same time that only represents a quarter of who i am there's other this missing piece and so that's where i wanted to learn more um about the you know filipino community and their heritage here and how important they are because they are the second largest demographic sure in the state of hawaii so there's many of them and there's many different this is a really interesting thing to talk about and i was actually talking about some of the other folks here you know folks that have been here from the very beginning you know like toy and you know june and and uh of course you know they they have a really immediate connection back to the philippines their their heritage is from the philippines here so first generation second generation and how many generations for you back to so i'm fourth generation fourth generation yes and so what i was what we were doing was we were in front of the time capsule and i was um asking them what do you envision um when that time capsule is opened in 100 years which was 2006 then so yeah 2106. you know what do you envision the philam community is going to be like and so um what we were talking about was that the philam community is so strong in terms of its cultural identity it's ties to the old country it's the heritage that it will actually keep that tradition going forward even though as you say there's a lot of pressure into the third and the fourth generation to kind of leave it behind leave it behind in some ways surely and i think that that's something that my generation craves you know we're coming out of that tech boom right where there's facebook and instagram and so we're always looking for we're craving that authenticity and the best part to start is with ourselves and that's our heritage and those different areas and you know i look at them as a resource because a lot of the things that they foresaw have come to fruition and so it's not only respecting what all the hard work and dedication because it took a lot of effort to get this facility especially back then and the costs associated and even the upkeep they all made different sacrifices to ensure that we could be here today so now it's looking into the next generation it's it's how do we perpetuate that and even for myself you know i have a 11 year old and so if i'm you know not as immersed it's only gonna you know continue as we're gonna get further removed so in this generation like you're talking about toy and everyone you know as they get older that's history that's information that will get lost and so it's about bridging that together right right so you picked a pretty darn tough time to take over the filcom center i mean you know as you pointed out this is an incredible center it is such a center of the the philharm community and the community overall um it it was hard to get going uh 1991 to 2001 that was 10 tough years of mustering the support of the broader community to to fund it and then of course the construction and the opening and there were budget chart falls and um it's a it's it's a there's a lot of debt that the center has been dealing with and the way the center um tries to sustain itself and pay off debt besides um non-profits out there who do to support it is the commercial operations here so you have you know commercial tenants a ballroom a meeting room a full-on commercial kitchen and that's your income stream but that dried up during covet 19. it did and so now you're coming out of covid19 what's how are you doing and what's the plan moving forward to kind of recover your footing so it was really um you know we were fortunate because we like you're saying we have that revenue stream of the tenants and they were able to really help us um just kind of sustain you know just barely you know we weren't at a loss like other organizations where their programs completely ceased or events were completely done we did take a large hit with the ballroom not being able because that was actually a majority of our um revenue base and so for us you know right now we're looking at refurbishing everything because it's been a year of just a closure and it's just kind of sat here outside of other testing events and vaccinations but we haven't really been at full capacity and having people and welcoming them here so we're hoping to just stay within the guidelines and figure out how we can move forward and really start generating that revenue that's just it's really needed right now at this point in time i saw some of you i was i was down you know working on the front with where some of the commercial tenants are and i noticed that a lot of them had gotten assistance from the federal government covered 19 assistants emergency assistance uh some uh some medical uh professionals some small businesses who all were eligible and i'm pretty sure that they got it so i guess indirectly the federal government contributed it did i mean and really what i'm looking at too with my you know i'm fresh eyes coming on to the scene and really it's looking at all the different opportunities and just in the short period that i've been here i've realized that it's in the hands of many it's not one you know one revenue generated item line item on our balance sheets it's not one tenant it's not one volunteer it's really everybody in the community that's coming together in different pieces that are of the puzzle that just fit and that's how everything is just continuing um to move forward and so i think that's what makes this unique it's very different from any other organization so how are you going to get your generation and the generations that are coming up behind you the millennials uh to to stick with um the commitments of the heritage and to support the center and and to be their own boards of directors then you've got a whole nother generation of phil m leaders coming up right now right oh yes i think it's important to engage with them i think it's important to have them come to the center and figure out what are their professional goals you know what are their interests and how can you help because that's what we have here today everybody wants to help and they have a specialty and they're just kind of pitching in and i think finding that balance between you know what they're interested in and bringing them in and then having that opportunity of that you know the older generation who is so knowledgeable it's in those interactions that they can really deepen that experience um so that is what i'm trying to do currently you know we have new board members as well so i'm not out here on my own we have a handful of new board members and and they're in their 40s and so you know it's just kind of all of us coming together and being in partnership all right great well good luck to you and congratulations and uh of course i want to be a partner myself yes of course thank you so much okay aloha tell us who you are okay my name is rose chavez galanto and i've been a businesswoman since 1979 i am the ceo of hill solid gold a retail jewelry store oh and also since 1980 i have a real estate license with grand ventura realty and you're the the brand new uh president of the filipino chamber of commerce right yes as of like two days ago yes that's correct but you were vice president last year i've been a vice president for two terms uh during vanessa's term and nancy stern so this is my two years and after that i became president so you know how how long has the filipino chamber of commerce been around a long time yeah oh yes since 1954 54. and it's mostly uh businesses small businesses that are owned and operated by uh filipino americans yes filipino businesses and you know let me ask you a question because um you i think you just told me before if i'm not mistaken small businesses that you that you're involved in yes i'm trying to remember i think you said travel business jewelry business filipino chamber of commerce is a full-time job oh yeah and and well the question i was going to ask you was phil m's throughout hawaii and our country are very very much small business people yes many many small businesses owned and operated by filipino americans throughout hawaii critical part of our community why why why so much small business with filipino americans well what i'm i think about it is i think they want to really uh prosper under their uh business you know they really wanted to try hard you know to become successful right yeah and not afraid to go out on their own and do do a small business yeah they want to to be free and do whatever you know filipino is very talented people right right in their own expertise yeah and so you know you you're taking over kovid 19 it's still with us it's been really devastating to our economy here in hawaii and our small businesses i mean your travel business must have been very very difficult over the last year especially so how do how do you um see the filipino chamber you know helping out uh the the membership in terms of coming out of covet 19 now well you know what what we are doing right now is telling you to the public what is the process to go back to the philippines uh the other day to reopen trouble between here at the philippines uh the other day we were thinking that the philippines will open up because there is a 10 days quarantine in the hotel you cannot go out yeah once you arrive not even if you have a vaccine no not even you have a boxing it's a mandatory that

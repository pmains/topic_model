thank you madam chair over the last two years parents across america have taken action to demand better educational opportunities for their children from the people who lead their schools last fall as parents sought to make their voices heard at school board meetings throughout the country attorney general merrick garland issued a memo saying the justice department and the fbi should aggressively investigate parents who attend school board meetings the amendment i am offering today would ensure no taxpayer funding can be used to carry out this offensive and ill-conceived memo in fact three weeks after the garland memo was issued the national school board association which has had dozens of states leave its organization said it regretted what it had done and apologized for the original letter it sent requesting the attorney general take action however while the nsba has admitted its mistake attorney general garland refuses to retract is a memo today as members of this committee we can stop the attorney general from harassing intimidating and profiling parents who attend school board meetings and speak up for their children everyone on this committee can side with parents support this amendment and ensure no taxpayer funding is used to implement the garland memo i urge support for this amendment and i yield back

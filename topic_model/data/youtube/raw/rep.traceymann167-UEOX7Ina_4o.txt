thank you mr chairman and on behalf of the farmers ranchers and agricultural producers in the first district of kansas thank you all for participating in today's full commander hearing regarding beef markets this issue is especially near and dear to me since both sides of my family have farmed and fed cattle in western kansas for the last 120 years i grew up on a pre-conditioning feed yard spent thousands of hours doctor and sick cattle kind of the best of times and worst of times all wrapped into one but good family time the big first my district ranks number one in the country for the value of sales of cattle and calves at more than nine billion dollars annually there are more than 4.4 million cattle and calves raised in my district and significant packing capacity with more than 20 percent of the nation's beef slaughter capacity we see the entire bee supply chain in the big first from cow calf producers to cattle feeders to packers more broadly the bee sector supports grain producers manufacturers veterinarians and many other businesses that populate rural towns across kansas and across the country in a competitive cattle market it is vital for producers to be able to differentiate their product to eventually suit the taste of the consumer as seen by the growing demand for beef here in the u.s and internationally selective breeding and nutrition that have increased quality bring opportunities for producers to negotiate a premium for price for their cattle these contracts allow feeders to benefit from making a value-added investment and provide some certainty in the volatile market across the country cattle producers continue to face challenging market dynamics including historically wide gaps between wholesale beef prices and fed cattle prices packing capacity regulation and more i've talked to hundreds of cattle producers in kansas ranging from small cow-calf operations to some of the country's largest feed yards overwhelmingly i've heard that we need to increase price discovery in the cash market make sure that producers benefit when they provide a superior product refuse to let the government interfere in the free market and acknowledge regional differences there's currently discussion you know here in washington around the federal government mandating a certain percentage of cash or spot transactions between the feeder and the packer limiting the number of allowable alternative market agreements limiting the number of allowable tournament market agreements amas are popular across the big first and used by many because they cut cost increase efficiencies and reward producers for a higher quality product so a few questions uh first question um for you mr um schiffelbein and thank you for being here do you feel that the legislation proposed to limit the use of amas would negatively infect the beef market and how do you think it'll impact beef quality as i've mentioned before that amas and that transparency is is basically the signals from the consumer to producers and what to do so from that standpoint i know with certainty it's going to have an important negative impact okay because we need those signals strong and transparent and flowing freely from consumer to producer the whole idea of mandating the packers to me is a misnomer because when you mandate one half of a deal maker you're also mandating producers and that's where we get the rub when you're mandating producers on how they ought to manage their cattle and market their cattle i think bad things will occur and actually to the detriment of the one people promoting it i think the largest concern occurs into small and mid-sized producers like myself because when you're limited to a certain number all of a sudden now you have a packer picking winners and losers and it doesn't allow me to exert my thing that says because i have a superior product choose me choose me instead you're deferring to a packer so i think it goes down a very dangerous road especially for mid and small small uh sized feeders okay thank you uh another question for for you sir do you believe that the establishment of the cattle contract library you know that was done by this congress earlier this year similar to what is existing the swine contract library do you think that's going to provide more transparency to the the market and how do you think it's going to produce impact producers in in kansas and around the country well the intent certainly is there and again i mentioned before and i testified previously the devil's in the details and that's what raises some concern for our producers is the way it's put together may actually tell you whether it's favorable or it actually could be neutral to unfavorable depending on if the packers have more utility with the contract than the producers so to me i really like the approach of the pilot project but i think cons constructing it in a manner that is a benefit to producers is of utmost importance okay great i see my time's expiring uh thank you for being here and with that i yield back

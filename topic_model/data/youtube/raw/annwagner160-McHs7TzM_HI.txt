I greatly appreciate the courtesy of the ranking member I have to get to a financial services markup and I saw him on rollers case today and Thank You mr. chairman for organizing this hearing and thank our witnesses I had the great privilege of serving as the United States ambassador and was Western Europe under investor burns and miss Connelly I would like to associate myself with your opening statement greatly although we work closely with partners in the EU bloc our goals are not always instep we have historically relied on the United Kingdom to bridge gaps between the United States and EU countries this Conley how will the UK's departure from the EU affecting you policies in areas of interest to the United States such as sanctions and trade and regulatory policies thank you so much for that question it will the European Union will be greatly reduced should the United Kingdom depart the EU and an almost daily hourly basis this story is in constant change so but all things being equal the the United Kingdom provides for the European Union very export-oriented very a market economy driven is driving the European Union on foreign and security policy and this will be a great loss to the European Union when the United Kingdom leaves if anything we focus too much on the ins and outs of of this extraordinary brexit debate but we haven't focused enough in thinking about how much the EU will diminish and in some ways how much the United Kingdom will diminish from being out of the European Union this is why we're seeing in the EU the creation of what they're calling the Hanseatic League which is Northern European economies that are trying to in some ways fill the space that the UK will leave and being market driven export driven much different from the southern Europe there will definitely be a void miss Ms warmoth many of our European partners shared the United States concerns regarding Russians non-compliance with the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty or INF the United States has students withdrawn on the iron with NATO support I understand these recent developments worry some European stakeholders who fear resurgent us Russian competition will destabilize Europe what is the future of arms control in Europe and what will what role can European countries play in pressuring Russia's back into compliance thank you for the question congresswoman I think I'm very concerned about the future of the arms control regime in the wake of the decision to withdraw from INF primarily because I'm concerned about what it means for whether we extend the new start agreement mm-hmm in 2021 which i think is very much in the interests of the United States despite the fact that we are in a very low period with the Russians so figuring out how to extend that agreement which is in in our interest I think is is item number one on that agenda I think we need to continue to have our European allies and partners put pressure on Russia to work with us to extend that agreement and to call out their bad behavior as they have in many instances I do think that part of having a credible deterrent is showing a unified front and I would have liked to I think the way the United States withdrew from INF did not shore up that unity inside of the Alliance so going forward we need to coordinate so that we show a unified front aim is for the master burns during the Cold War our alliances with European countries helped the United States maintaining a durable balance of a power visa via the Soviet Union preventing catastrophic conflict frankly between the great powers today we are seeing China step into the balance or into the place I should say that the Soviet Union ones occupied what role will Europe lay in countering the rise of China I think his I'm Heather Connelly said the Europeans seem to be disorganized and not United on how to respond to China a great deal of divisiveness as the Chinese seek inroads the Chinese are running and owned the port of piraeus yes biggest point in these port in the Eastern med significant investments in the Balkans now in Italy so the European Union needs to needs to organize itself needs to develop a common policy because this is a major threat and they understand that the military advantage that the United States has had since the Second World War will be at risk if an AI machine learning quantum computing biotechnology our government does not have the the ability to keep up with the Chinese in these technological and the technological arms race Europe's gotta be part of that their labs their tech companies their research universities have to be with us and United in that so I think that in a NATO basis China has become an issue and in ambassador Lewis report and that I did with him that's one of our recommendations we have to think about China as a threat general I would close on this congresswoman general Milley said this morning when he testified up here on the hill that he felt that Russia was still the great existential threat I think we're facing to bigotry and threats in Europe I agree mr. chairman China's inspired again I thank the ranking member for his courtesy

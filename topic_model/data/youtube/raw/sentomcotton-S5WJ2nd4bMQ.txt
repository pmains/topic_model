oil yeah let's talk about this with GOP Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas Senator your reaction to the president's move yesterday um well to blame uh Energy company profits on war in Ukraine uh is simply to cover up his own responsibility for this why are oil prices high in American today it's because Joe Biden the Democratic party has declared war on the fossil fuel then so remember in the campaign he said that we're going to put them out of business we're going to end fossil fuel production so if you don't want companies like Exxon or shell or BP making high profits the answer is lower oil prices and the way to do that is to produce more American Oil this is an example of what I talk about in a new book Only the Strong the decline that American sets is not an accident it's not bad luck for Joe Biden it's intentional it's declined by Design they want gas to be four or five dollars a gallon because they want to end fossil fuel production in America it's going to kill them politically it is going to kill them politically so they sing a different tune in a few weeks leading up to the election but mark my words next week after the election is over they'll be back to their traditional rhetoric Waging War on fossil fuel production job owning Banks to not give finances to or energy companies this is Again part of their part of their plan to eliminate fossil fuel production they would need approval from Congress and that's not going to happen they would not the Administration has a lot of power to deny permits on Federal Land and federal water some high pipelines why is New England going to pay you know several multiples of what the rest of the country pays for natural gas this winter to heat its home it's because New York State won't allow new pipelines to be built to move that gas from places like Western Pennsylvania but what he was calling for yesterday is a windfall profits tax a tax would have to go through you it would and you know what he he's got to sound like he's doing something a week before the election he knows that's not going to happen yeah and that's exactly what this is all about it's about trying to conceal their ideological agenda in the days leading up to an election when Americans are worried about feeding their families and filling up their tanks and heating their homes so this week this week only the strongest out reversing the left's plot to sabotage American power uh and you're you open up with your service in the military you talk about the disaster in Afghanistan and kind of work your way backwards you also talk about energy and here's an excerpt that maybe you could share with us sure I write just as the blame America First Democrats prefer unilateral disarmament for the military they would unilaterally disarm our energy sector as well facing the political squeeze over high gas prices Joe Biden went to Venezuela and Iran not to Texas and North Dakota progressives look down their noses at coal miners and Roughnecks while averting their gaze from Chinese slaves who make solar panels and African child workers who Mine The Rare Earth elements behind so-called Green Technology right exactly you know what we've been talking about today is uh democrats for the most part want you to forget about what has happened over the last two years I want you to forget about how Joe Biden opened the Border uh the supply chain problems who closed the schools did all that stuff and you know they're doing their best they're bringing out Barack Obama who when you look at how many people actually lost on his side back in 2010 it's like he's the best they can do well 2010 and 2014 when I was first elected I mean Barack Obama is the most ideological man to be president since Woodrow Wilson I write about both of them in Only the Strong Joe Biden is his understudy this is really the third Obama term and although they want to shift their rhetoric during this campaign cycle as I write in Only the Strong it's a clear plan to undermine the sources of American power not just energy production but a strong and free economy a strong and fearsome military our sovereignty whether it's at our Borders or International Freedom of action these are all efforts to lay low the sources of American Power by a bunch of audio logs who are at best ambivalent about America and openly hostile to its past and our history okay Brian hold up the book please it's called Only the Strong if you buy it you can buy it at bookstores your local bookstores Amazon wherever you buy your books and you can read his latest op-ed on foxnews.com Senator thank you for coming on congratulations on the book A lot of times people write these books right before a presidential election to kind of launch things up I'm just wondering if that was the case with you well I think anyone who wants to uh hold power in Washington DC president or Congress would benefit from Reading Only the Strong so you can check it out local bookstore now how about that

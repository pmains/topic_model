congresswoman karen bass who represents the 27th congressional district that 37th excuse me congressional district includes parts of los angeles south la and culver city she's also the chair of the congressional black caucus good morning congresswoman bass thanks for being with us what an extraordinary life what a great american uh congressman lewis tell us how do you think congressman lewis would have wanted to be remembered oh i have no question how he would have wanted to be remembered he wants the voting rights act reauthorized and we passed the legislation over 200 days ago out of the house of representatives it is in the senate and i have no doubt that he would like to see that signed by the president as fast as possible and i say that also because we're coming on an election in a little over a hundred days and we need to figure out how to have an election where people don't have to risk their lives we should be able to vote from home and so he would want to first see voting rights restored and then make sure that we have a safe election in november three decades in congress the conscience of the congress what did that mean and what was it like for you to work with this giant well you know i'm in my 10th year here now in washington and when i first came into office the idea that i would be able to serve alongside an icon like john lewis you know i was a child when martin luther king was killed of course i never had an opportunity to see or to meet him and so to me for my generation it's like serving with with dr king mr lewis in this house and the senate with democrats and republicans without a doubt is the most respected member as a matter of fact a few minutes ago i was on the phone with the chair of the democratic caucus and we were talking about the tribute that we're going to do for mr lewis on the floor and typically the congressional black caucus does tributes like this and we said oh no this time the entire house of representatives has to do we call it a special order hour because it's mr lewis it'll be special several hours of tribute that we will do uh either tomorrow evening or wednesday evening at the age of 23 and just think about how young 23 years old he spoke at the 1963 march on washington sharing a podium with his mentor dr martin luther king jr and other civil rights leaders that was nearly 57 years ago and then you think about today the fact that our nation's still dealing with racial divide what did congressman lewis think about black lives matter movement and what our country is going through right now well you know i think what he thinks about black lives matter is similar to me uh it's another generation and if you truly believe in fighting to make the united states a more perfect union if you believe in fighting for social and economic justice and that defined his life then you understand it's a relay race and you understand that one of the most important things you can do in your lifetime is pass on the baton to the next generation i wasn't with him when he went to black lives matter square but i saw the pictures i saw his eyes and i know that he loved being there with the protesters and knowing that his days were coming to an end i mean he knew that you know he had a terminal diagnosis and i can only imagine that mr lewis was thinking that it's going to be okay it's going to be okay because there's a new generation that's prepared they are lifting the issue but but they're making it bigger than policing and now they're talking about systemic racism they're talking about u.s history and correcting it and uh and i i think that he was at peace you keep referring to congressman lewis as mr lewis and i heard i heard a you tell a story this weekend on one of the national programs about calling him mr lewis and he didn't want to be called mr lewis but i don't know if you want to share that memory or any other memory of of congressman lewis of your personal experience with him that you could share one of my best experiences with him was taking him to community coalition you know i i formed community coalition it's now its 30th anniversary and i took him there because i wanted him to meet two generations of young people who he had influenced we there were teenagers that were there and there were members of the community coalition that started as teenagers that are now in their 40s and they were there so we had 40 somethings and and teens and i wanted them to have an opportunity to share with him what he meant to them and specifically how they took the lessons of his life and are applying them to the work that they're doing today and i just think now of course when i was there we had no idea that he was that his life was not going to last much longer this was a couple of years before his diagnosis but i wanted to make sure that he heard that he knew that at community coalition the staff teach john lewis how they teach about what he did and uh and it's an african-american and latino organization and i wanted him to see how he had influenced them he would often say to me uh karen please call me john and him repeatedly no mr lewis i'm never going to oh well we so appreciate you being with us this morning uh congresswoman bass we we uh appreciate you sharing those stories and thank you very much absolutely thank you

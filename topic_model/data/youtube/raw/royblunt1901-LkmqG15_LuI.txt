hi blunt you know on this election Jason kandar's talked a lot more about my family than what he can do to help your family and that's not an accident the Clinton candor agenda is more of the same and bad for Missouri families like Obamacare with Clinton candor prices keep going up choices keep going down or a new energy tax on utility bills as if they're not high enough already these bad policies hurt our families and keep us on the wrong track I'm Roy Blunt and I approve this message

mr chairman and member of the committee i thank you for the opportunity to testify before your committee on the department of energy specifically on the yucca mountain decision i've been in congress now for twelve and a half years for eight and a half years i've served on the appropriations committee and the subcommittee on energy and water development which funds the doe including the does nuclear energy division in my short time in congress there have been three administrations four or five secretaries of energy and numerous nuclear energy administrators and under secretaries each administration has its own priorities concerning the direction the department takes with respect to addressing the energy needs of our country particularly nuclear energy i lived through the ifr bubble the g net bubble the n g n p bubble and the current s m r bubble the most frustrating dilemma i faced is this after spending billions of dollars going into ever changing directions how do you sustain a program with a 20 to 30-year lifetime frame in an environment of ever-changing policies what can we show the taxpayers for our investments to make it clear it's not a problem that i blame on the doe new administrations and secretaries are elected and appointed to enact their vision of the future but it is a reality that the short-term nature of our political cycles does not lend itself to solving long-term problems one of the ways we address this dilemma is by enacting statutes passed by congress and signed by the president these statutes become the law of the land binding on future congresses and administrations no administration or congress can unilaterally decide the law doesn't apply to them if the administration or congress decides it doesn't like the current law there are ways to change it enact a new law absent that the current law binds us all one of the most glaring decisions by the administration to ignore this fundamental principle of law is the attempt to withdraw by the administration to unilaterally withdraw the license application for yucca mountain currently before the nrc and to mothball yucca mountain let me be perfectly clear here we all know why this decision was made it wasn't about science or the suitability of yucca mountain or even the need for a geological repository for high-level nuclear waste it was a promise made during the heat of a presidential campaign campaign it was pure politics we could spend days debating the suitability of yucca mountain as a geological waste repository or the over 50 scientific studies that have been done on yakima yucca mountain we know more about this patch of earth than probably any other patch of earth in the world we could talk about the 15 billion dollars already spent on yucca mountain the 9.5 billion collected from the utility consumers for the nuclear waste fund and whether that should be paid back to the consumers as well as the 956 million paid out as a result of the 74 lawsuits resulting from the government's failure to receive spent fuel or the gao investigation which concluded quote doe's decision to terminate yucca the yucca mountain repository program was made for policy reasons not technical or safety reasons unquote or the fact that this interpretation is supported by volume three of the nrc safety evaluation report but all of this really isn't the point the point is the president is obligated to follow the law of the land as enacted by congress and signed by a previous president the nuclear waste policy act was amended in 1987 to designate yucca mountain as the repository for high-level nuclear waste for whatever reason i was not a member of congress at the time but that law passed and yucca mountain became the law of the land following a veto by the governor of nevada the house voted to override the governor's veto by a 306 to 117 vote and the senate followed suit by a 60-36 vote yucca mountain is still the law of the land congress has reaffirmed its position in fact i have with me here and i want to ask to put them in the record because they're available 34 recorded votes in just recent years assembled by the crs in which congress has reaffirmed its support for yucca mountain i can't fault secretary chu or secretary lyons for pursuing this policy decision after all they worked for the president and he made this misguided decision to ignore the law based on these simple facts the nrc licensing board review the administration's requested with withdraw the yucca mountain licensing application and denied that request nearly one year ago june twenty ninth two thousand ten the commission reviewed and voted on the licensing board rec decision but has yet to release its ruling nearly a year later the nrc is supposed to serve as an independent watchdog which is driven by science not politics unfortunately the chairman of the nrc has lost sight of its mission in order to affect a political outcome that has eroded the reputation of the nrc at a time when the public confidence is needed most and he should be replaced again i repeat the issue of citing the nation's nuclear waste repository at yucca mountain is a matter of law not politics it serves as the clearest example of an ever-changing policy which is costing the taxpayers of billions of dollars and diminishing our ability to advance a long-term energy policy for our country and i thank you mr chairman for inviting us here today

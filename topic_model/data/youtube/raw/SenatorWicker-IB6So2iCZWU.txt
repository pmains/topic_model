a Republican senator Roger wicker of Mississippi senator thank you for getting in front of the cameras we appreciate it well thank you glad to be on well you heard yes last week you praised the revised draft let me give you a hypothetical if Reince Priebus or Mitch McConnell calls you into their officers in the eleventh hour to convince you wouldn't you have said guys I'm already on board don't waste precious time go talk to Heller go talk to Lee go talk to Moran or whoever else was sort of straddling event I wasn't on the invitation list I don't know what the meeting was about it might've might have been about general topics no in part it was about healthcare but but let's let's move the cloth before the dinner had they come to you and said okay so senator wicker here's why this is a good plan you would I'm pretty sure say guys I'm fine with this go spend your time on somebody who isn't quite there yet oh goodness is that don't don't make me argue strategy I can tell you about the bill and I'm still hopeful yes I didn't need to be invited to the White House and others probably did but we're where we are and I still think there's a chance we can get this done which part of it done because right now there are not enough GOP senators to vote for a straight-up outright repeal of Obamacare right now how would you get it done okay well I really think god we need to we need to put that to the test there are 51 of us but voted for a specific plan in 2015 send it to President Obama and he vetoed it as we expected I do think we ought to at least be willing to vote to proceed to that bill you can't guarantee an outcome but you can vote in principle to get on a bill that a majority of the Senate has already voted for and I think we at least owe that to the American people I have voted consistently to repeal Obamacare I want another chance to do it and I'm hoping for a chance in a day or two to do that again I'd like to vote for a motion that gets us to an open process as the reconciliation voter AMA is and you can't guarantee an outcome but it certainly would put a lot of us on record and the people back home that put us in office would know where we stand we just show three senators who could guarantee an outcome and that would be a no that would show it wouldn't pass because these three are very much out there saying they won't do it so I know you said you don't want to talk strategy but this is what you do all the time as senators right I mean for example president Trump had it right by inviting Rand Paul an early and outright no he invited them to golf at mar-a-lago back in April to discuss the reasons behind the Kentucky senators opposition so I just wonder where was everybody else whether it's the White House team or McConnell's people where is the war room the like Sylvia Lincoln or LBJ or Ronald Reagan had when they wanted something passed we didn't really see any horse trading or discussion here well first of all let me let me concede that the invitation list last night might have been considered differently but also with regard to Rand Paul I can tell you he stood up today at the Republican meeting and and still wants to get to yes as a matter of fact he would be a YES on the motion to proceed correct if if we have the vote tomorrow frankly there are a lot of holdouts who still think we're moving in the door and the right door action they think we made some progress over the weekend people have been working with governors who have expressed reservations and and basically we think they're moving toward support which would bring some other people to a yes so I haven't given up and I think there's a solution out there that can get 51 votes because as in the business network we look at these things the market hit session lows when vice president pence was bringing up this very idea of a straight up vote for total repeal this morning he was before a crowd and he really didn't get a lot of attention or focus when it came to the big-money comments was we're going to throw this thing away start all over again and there was there was polite clapping certainly but you know what happened stocks plummeted when he made those comments talking about retail and jobs before that crowd and then the US dollar Senator hit a one-year low against the Euro against the Swiss franc those are traditional sort of flight to quality move certainly the euro team used to be but this dark cloud does it cast a shadow on the other policies like tax relief and and you get it done with Democrats in some way shape or form so we can get for those other issues all the more reason for us to get on the bill put senators on the record have a free and open amendment process which reconciliation absolutely requires and let the people back home start seeing where we stand on the various proposals now can we get tax reform done yes as a matter of fact I mean you could argue that if we have to hit the pause button on repealing and replacing Obamacare it would make us more determined to get some sort of results so I'm just trying to look at the glass half-full and I can report to you that there are enough members of the United States Senate who sincerely wish to get to a yes vote that it's worth keeping on with the negotiation process before we go said under with that glass half-full and we appreciate your optimism would you let a Democrat or to drink from it we do you bring them in yes no okay well if we if we repeal Obamacare as we did in 2015 and leave a two-year period absolutely it would be it would be regular order in the Health Committee chaired by Senator Alexander with Senator patty Murray of Washington is the ranking Democrat and yes it would be regular order and there would be a lot of a lot of participation that's something that that our friends across the aisle need to think about it would give us a two-year period for for them to bring the American people in and have their input okay good to see you senator thank you very much thank you senator wicker of Mississippi we appreciate it

you [Music] one of the best ways is to lessen the war on drugs and make more about rehabilitation more about getting back into the workforce and less about we're just going to put people in jail and throw away the key a Republican has introduced ten criminal justice reform bills his proposals include restoring voting rights expungement for federal crimes and giving judges more discretion over mandatory minimums Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky have introduced legislation called the Redeem Act that would make it easier for juveniles who commit nonviolent crime to expunge or seal those convictions from their records I passionately believe in this I think the war on drugs has had a racial outcome we ought to try to fix that as well there's a host of issues I've introduced five different criminal justice issues in the last two months we have two million young black men in jail for nonviolent crimes all month and you know I'm a Republican and I say you know we're to be the party of Family Values you can't have a family if you've locked up dad and so we have to change what we're doing [Music] there were Republicans who know better like Rick Perry a like of Michael Lee like Rand Paul who know better and there are other Republicans who weren't quite so social 87 senators both political parties came together to do something to try to begin to reduce the number of people behind bars the to long and what this bill does is unbelievable one other topic you voted for this criminal justice bill the other day it passed overwhelmingly 87 at 12 in the Senate all 12 no votes Republicans you were a yes vote how come you can be a minority because the color of your skin or the shade of your ideology there's many ways you can be a minority we have to be together to defend rights of all minorities I think there are ways that we can have criminal justice in our country I think there's ways we can have equality of education our country and I think we can have a quality of economic opportunity but if we keep doing the same thing over and over again that's the definition of insanity if you expect a different result [Music]

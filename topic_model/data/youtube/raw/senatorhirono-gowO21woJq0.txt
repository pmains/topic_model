THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM HAWAII. MS. HIRONO: RESERVING THE RIGHT TO OBJECT. SENATOR ROUNDS, I DO NOT OBJECTS TO THE SUBSTANCE OF YOUR BILL. AS A MEMBER OF THE VETERANS COMMITTEE, I AM VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO OUR COUNTRY BY NATIVE AMERICANS AND CERTAINLY NATIVE AMERICAN VETERANS. HOWEVER, FOR A LONG TIME I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET A VERY SIMPLE TECHNICAL FIX TO THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT THAT WOULD ALLOW NATIVE HAWAIIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO SERVE NATIVE HAWAIIAN WOMEN. AS WE ALL KNOW, VAWA PROVIDES SUPPORT TO SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, SEXUAL ASSAULT, SEX TRAFFICKING, DATING VIOLENCE, AND STALKING. TRAGICALLY, NATIVE WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THAT WOULD BE NATIVE -- ALASKA NATIVES, NATIVE HAWAIIAN, AMERICAN INDIAN WOMEN, EXPERIENCE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER LEVELS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE, WHICH IS WHY VAWA INCLUDES STOP GRANTS TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ELIGIBLE NATIVE ORGANIZATIONS, NONPROFITS, INCLUDING NATIVE HAWAIIAN ORGANIZATIONS TO SERVE NATIVE WOMEN. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT NATIVE HAWAIIAN WOMEN ARE REPRESENTED AMONG THE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH NUMBER OF SURVIVORS OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND SEX TRAFFICKING, AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT NATIVE HAWAIIAN ORGANIZATIONS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE GRANTS, BECAUSE OF A DRAFTING OVERSIGHT THESE NATIVE HAWAIIAN ORGANIZATIONS ELECTION DENIERS YIBL FOR -- ELIGIBLE FOR THESE GRANTS CANNOT SERVE THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN COMMUNITY. IT WOULD LIKELY SHOCK MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES TO LEARN ABOUT THE GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND SEX TRAFFICKING NUMBERS IN HAWAII, AND OF SEX TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS IN HAWAII, OVER 70% ARE NATIVE HAWAIIAN WOMEN AND GIRLS. BUT YET, NATIVE HAWAIIAN ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT ACTUALLY SERVE NATIVE HAWAIIAN WOMEN THROUGH THESE GRANTS. BY PASSING THIS SIMPLE TECHNICAL FIX, WE CAN ENSURE THAT NATIVE HAWAIIAN WOMEN CAN ACCESS THE BENEFITS AND SUPPORT INCLUDED IN THIS CRITICAL

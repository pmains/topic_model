we need the gentleman from Nebraska mr. Smith the gentleman from Nebraska is recognized thank you madam Speaker I I do want to say that I plan to vote for this bill I support the improvements in making the improvements it makes to savings and retirement which have gained bipartisan approval both in the Senate and here in the house I in particular appreciate hearing from agriculture cooperatives across Nebraska's that our district about the importance to them of the language in this bill reducing PBGC premiums for nonprofits I'm also incredibly pleased we are moving quickly to address the gold star families tax issue and hope we can complete work on that problem as quickly if not more quickly than the rest of the provisions in this bill I do have reservations and concerns about the process which got us here in the end some provisions which are no longer in the bill as we know the bill was marked up in the Ways and Means Committee on April 2nd we reported it out unanimously very bipartisan effort it was moved out of committee by a voice vote prior to the mark-up there were no concerns raised about the provisions in the bill provisions that would help families pay for the education of their children whether in home school or public school as we know many expenses come up for various reasons it's unfortunate that that took place and I know that this wasn't the first time actually it was the second time in two weeks that we are here considering legislation that was a product a bipartisan agreement in committee but it was altered before it came to the house it's very unfortunate and as I said at the beginning I'm going to support this bill it has many good provisions but I hope that we can avoid similar situations from undermining the committee process undermining the integrity of the committee system that we have that that empowers individual members working together with colleagues on a bipartisan basis let's not undermine at again.i I will vote for this bill it could have been a better bill and I hope next time we can address the these shortcomings moving forward thank you the gentleman from Texas reserves the gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized thank you madam Speaker I want to yield one minute to the gentleman from Oregon mr. bloom and our the chairman of the trade

funding for nj spotlight news provided by the members of the new jersey education association making public schools great for every child rwj barnabas health let's be healthy together and orsted committed to the creation of a new long-term sustainable clean energy future for new jersey [Music] from njpbs this is nj spotlight news with brianna vannozzi good evening and thanks for joining us this thursday night i'm briana vannozzi the political landscape is changing the leaked draft u.s supreme court ruling striking down roe v wade is forcing politicians out of comfortable corners holding candidates feet to the fire for their stance on abortion and opening the door for possible battles in what may have otherwise been landslide races come november as senior political correspondent david cruz reports that appears to be the case in new jersey's 7th congressional district where a key voting block could be up for grabs up until this week the midterm elections were going to be about the economy inflation and the cost of everything but republicans here and elsewhere were also counting on suburban moms particularly to be motivated by opposition to proposed sex ed standards for curriculum but the leak of that draft decision from the supreme court on roe v wade could now change everything especially in the race in the 7th congressional district particularly on the gop side we have tom kane jr who has been seen as the front runner this puts him in a sticky situation because i'm sure he was not hoping to angle this election or at least primaries on the issue of abortion and now this is going to be one of those issues that everybody talks about and when it comes to hot button culture war issues abortion is right at the top even more significant than those sex ed standards the gop was recently pushing as an issue for the conservatives on the 7th congressional district gop primary ballot tom kane is facing six opponents here the news from the supreme court served to recharge their efforts to paint kane as a liberal republican in conservative clothing he certainly does have some answering to do um right now the campaign is being run largely like a joe biden campaign of say as little and do as little as possible send as many mailers and as many large faces and names resembling tom kane as possible without really focusing on the issues and if you don't believe that the conservatives are coming out guns blazing here's phil rizzo who surprised many with his showing against jack citarelli in the gubernatorial primary last year tom kane loves abortion and it doesn't matter what people say it matters what people do and it doesn't matter what tom keane says because he could talk out of both sides of his mouth if he could talk at all we have to look at his votes kane press availability has been even tighter for the usually camera shy state senator he was likewise unavailable to talk to us for this story he did issue a carefully worded statement after the news of the supreme court leak earlier this week we're talking about a leaked working document from february he said in the statement and the court will make their final ruling in june ultimately i stand with the vast majority of new jerseyans against tom malinowski's radical position of abortion on demand right up until the moment of birth the idea of that he's a conservative is in another universe and i believe it's going to impact this race because this is a a republican district that got more republican with redistricting and and i think that this is going to be very helpful to our campaign among gop primary voters maybe but it's no secret that even among new jersey republicans there is support for keeping abortion legal says ashley conning of the eagleton institute about two-thirds of new jerseyans said they would be concerned if the supreme court took back roe v wade including a decent amount of republicans within those numbers as well so this is an issue that is not going to play well for tom kane whether we're talking about the primaries or the general if he makes it out of the primaries for malinowski whose district was considered a sacrifice by democrats in the recent redistricting it could mean a boost among his heretofore quiet core voters on this issue anyway the incumbent thinks he's got a winner we have his record and i don't think there's any question uh that a republican congress and he would help create a republican majority in the house of representatives would continue this crusade to ban abortion in america including in new jersey so what people expected as a tough race for dems in district 7 has been perhaps upended by the news from the supreme court this week and while november is still a while off the june primary is just weeks away and on the republican side at least the landscape has shifted putting into play what the front runner had hoped would be a lock i'm david cruz nj spotlight news the state board of education finally had its say on the raging debate over sex ed standards in new jersey public schools it's recently caused an uproar among parents communities and lawmakers when we now know where the board stands education writer john mooney covered the meeting and joins us with the latest john the sex ed curriculum was not on the docket yesterday but of course this was an unavoidable topic so what happened during the meeting yeah i think uh as you as you said it wasn't on the agenda the the standards in question uh specifically they're the health and physical education standards they were enacted two years ago and they won't you know officially be coming up for uh re-adoption for another couple years but um given everything that's been going on um and and there was no doubt that this was going to come up from among members and the commissioner was ready for it uh angelica alan mcmillan uh had a lengthy statement that um you know it was a good 10 15 minute statement uh ready to go right at the start of the meeting and basically said you know gave a a pretty impassioned uh defense of the standards as being really important for uh well-being of children both physically and and mental health and and herself a mother of three kids uh you know this is you know she she recognizes the mother the value of this and she she really stuck to her guns on it more so than she had been up to this point so it was unusual these these meetings are pretty staid um you know there's not a whole lot of back and forth and and you know she had it going right out of the gate and and i think it did sway a few members well was the rest of the board of the same mindset where did they fall yeah i mean immediately she got some defense from a couple members um including the board uh the board president kathy goldenberg and um and and also adding uh pretty personal uh you know defenses of this and not really you know about curriculum it's about teaching kids some of the things they need to know uh to navigate life and and you know i think it was it was really pretty interesting and a couple of them educators too and talking about the value of these things so uh it was a it was a good discussion and then there was some pushback from a couple members who had warned they were going to push back but you know the teeth had had been taken out of their uh out of their arguments by that point and and they they went ahead with it but also acknowledged that this wasn't going to change all right so now what happens next um these are the folks we look to for some of those answers and next steps what can you tell us well i think it's not you know it won't be unless unless more comes out out on it i don't think we're going to hear a whole lot more from the murphy administration but there are some bills in the legislature um and some of them are far stricter than even what we've been talking about you know winnowed down the standards to to virtually three subjects type of thing uh and that but there's some others that are looking for better transparency on this and and for districts to share their curricula before they adopt them and things of that sort and i think that's that's probably going to be the path and that may be even as soon as next week uh when the senate takes up some of these measures as well yeah not the end of it that's for sure john mooney for us thanks so much john nice to talk to you after roughly a year without a watchdog new jersey has a new leader keeping an eye on the prison system governor murphy today named terry schuster as the state's corrections ombuds person tasked with investigating complaints and conducting regular inspections at the department of corrections 11 adult prisons schuster is an attorney with a background in criminal justice policy according to the governor's office he's served in several correctional oversight roles and most recently at the pew charitable trust public safety performance project shuster will have his work cut out for him the previous ombudsman resigned amid a scathing criminal probe at the state's only all-female prison edna mahan where federal authorities found corrections officers had sexually abused female inmates and leaders failed to address years of other documented abuse an uptick in covid cases to report tonight the state is confirming just shy of 3 500 new positive tests today and seven more deaths it's the highest single day total in three months this as the u.s is poised to hit more than one million fatalities caused by covid19 nationwide new jersey is still being rocked by the opioid crisis despite years of new policies and dedicated funding to combat both the illicit drug market and overdose deaths it's no match for the amount of fentanyl poisoning drug supplies the synthetic opioid is cheaper to make and several times more powerful than heroin now it's killing in record numbers joanna gagis reports many of the individuals who are coming to integrity house for help are coming because of fentanyl abuse over the last decade the sharp rise in fentanyl overdose deaths has been alarming it now makes up 75 percent of drug deaths in new jersey in some cases the individual wants the fentanyl and obviously they don't want to die but they want to get as high as possible but in all too many cases the fentanyl is mixed into the drugs the individuals think they're taking like marijuana cocaine and heroin and they're usually an older generation and they want to stay away from the fentanyl where they're actually trying to find the heroin because they're afraid of the instant death that comes along with fentanyl instant death because fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin according to the cdc it's dramatically worsened what was already an opioid crisis in the latest data from 2019 fentanyl contributed to the deaths of more than 2 200 new jerseyans what started out as an oxycodone or a hydrocodone prescription opioid problem with some heroin really has turned into just an all-encompassing fentanyl epidemic when it comes to death and because it's synthetic produced in a lab it's much cheaper making it easier to sell and buy and it's completely undetectable when hidden in other drugs that leaves experts in the recovery field scrambling to find the best ways to fight this growing epidemic it's going to take an all-encompassing approach to both cutting off the stream of drugs and drug use and then cleaning up the mess that's been made through the availability of these illicit and to some extent legal opioids reverend leslie harrison says another war on drugs is not the answer incarceration is not rehabilitation incarcerating someone who is addicted to substances and they go to jail or to prison they're not receiving the mental health treatment that they need addiction is a mental health disease and it should be treated as such when the individual comes to us for help we want to provide treatment for them we want to provide services for them but at the same time we introduce them to narcan where we want them to know that there is an antidote that could reverse an overdose and there continues to be state funding and federal funding to help us keep a supply of narcan at integrity house some people might say why is the state paying to save the life of someone who's choosing this deadly drug every life is precious and whatever we have to do to keep the person alive long enough until they can enter treatment and make some meaningful changes in their life that it's a good investment and it's saving lives if the legislators would look at people as individuals laws would change and harm reduction centers would be open needle exchange centers would be open safe testing sites would be open so that people would be able to use in a healthy manner until they are able to or willing to look at why they are turning to substances that critical intersection where a person is ready to break their addiction and treatment is available to them for nj spotlight news i'm joanna gargas thousands of immigrants whose u.s work permits expired will be able to continue earning money under a new federal policy starting today extending their legal work permits for up to a year and a half as the government works to offload a massive backlog of applications raven santana reports i'm afraid if i don't get renewal i'll have to go back to ecuador i came to this country for security i'm here with my four kids and won't be able to provide for them if i don't have a work permit thirty-four-year-old paiola guapa sharing her fears of deportation after her work permit expired in february 2022 guapa who has been able to work legally cleaning homes here in jersey has done so under the employment authorization document also known as a work permit yes having a work permit is very beneficial and has given me an opportunity to get a driver's license and i'll continue having a stable job for my family and can build a better life that's why on wednesday the u.s citizenship and immigration services announced a new policy that would allow immigrants what recently expired or soon to expire work permits to continue working on those documents for up to 540 days or 18 months after the expiration according to uscis the change will help about 87 thousand immigrants whose work authorization is set to expire soon essentially what uscis is doing is giving themselves a cushion and saying we'll give ourselves another year to adjudicate these things knowing that people still have the benefit it's helpful but what's really helpful is when uscis actually adjudicates the underlying application eileen king english is an immigration law attorney with hardington king english llc she says while the extension does give people peace of mind it doesn't resolve the bigger issue of the processing time which sometimes can take up to a year she says if the processing time takes a year or longer you file six months ahead your work authorization expires after six months then you have 180 day extension but then if the work authorization is not approved by then they're sidelined work authorization processing is just a constant source of headache for foreign national families who are dealing with it and it's a constant you know every day of their lives they're checking uscis.gov to see whether there's been any movement or any update on their work authorization without my employment authorization i'm not going to be able to work what's going to happen how i'm going to pay my bills so like you know so it's a little bit you have to always have it in the back of your mind so we need your employment authorization 27 year old melissa khan first came to the u.s from venezuela in 2018. she's been on employment authorization for three years as she awaits her green card khan who works as a legal assistant for hardington king english llc says while she will benefit from the extension she does wish the process was expedited so i've been waiting since 2019 to file my green card in 2020 and now we're in 2022 and i'm still waiting for my green card and i know they're doing all this just because they're taking so long to process the way to remedy this situation is for uscis to adjudicate form i-765 in a timely manner and a timely manner i would say would be within 90 days for nj spotlight

can it be saved ted goldberg reports farming and fishing in new jersey isn't exactly a young person's game the average garden state farmer is 62 years old a big concern for 65 year old farmer alan habiak if we don't have the younger generation to follow us once we're done we're done i know you know in my family possibly my son and daughter they may be interested but we'll see farmers and fishermen play key roles in helping people put food on their tables but habiak says younger people aren't convinced that they can make a living by casting lines or plowing fields we need to show the younger generations how you can make money at it how it is something you know profitable and it's very rewarding the hope is a 300 thousand dollar earmark in this year's federal budget will help plant that seat by creating a workforce training program at middlesex county vocational and technical schools congressman frank pallone says it's a great alternative for people who don't want to attend higher education or people who want to make good money not everybody has to go to college and that you know technical training vocational training you know can lead to careers that are i was going to say just as important i'm going to say maybe more important than going to college and certainly probably a better salary food innovation is a crucial element in the county's economic development strategy our goal is to attract retain and expand businesses in key industries like food innovation this new program at our vote tech schools will help us do just that but we need the young people to get involved and and just to encourage them and prick their interests either you know in a greenhouse or in agriculture um you know to get them out there and you know look for a career it's not going to be you know you're not going to be a ceo of some high class you know corporation but the rewards are tremendous that money will seat farms in middlesex county and create partnerships with commercial fisheries habiak is a big fan of the new program as long as young people know what they're signing up for kids don't like to get dirty you know mom and dad are raising their kids don't get dirty you know back when i was young yeah we ate dirt you know it didn't hurt you it's hard work it's not an eight-hour day and you can be out there before sunrise or at sunrise and work till sunset

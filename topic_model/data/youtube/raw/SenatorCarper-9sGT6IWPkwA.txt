I rise this afternoon this evening rather I rise this evening to discuss the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 which is oftentimes referred to as the Magna Carta of environmental laws what I think about our nation's our most illustrious documents I'm reminded of the true expression of America and its aspirations I'm reminded of our Declaration of Independence in its embrace of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness I'm also reminded of our Constitution Delaware is known as the first state because we were the first state to ratify the Constitution December 7 1787 one week before anybody else Delaware became the first state and our Constitution is the most replicated and enduring Constitution in the history of the world it's not entirely unlike more recent expressions of America's values in guiding principles like the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 or NEPA NEPA has serves as one of our bedrock environmental laws for a half-century now according to its six pages of statute NEPA Serpas includes I quote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of men close quote NEPA enshrines democracy by giving the American people a voice to help decide the fate of federal decisions for 50 years NEPA has sought to ensure environmental protection public health and the notion that the American people have a say in federal decision-making like our Constitution NEPA is one of our nation's most enduring and replicated laws same principle of democracy and citizen participation that enshrined our Constitution are also enshrined in NEPA we've made changes to our Constitution over the years but those changes were made rarely and with great forethought however just 60 days ago the Trump administration proposed a rule that would fundamentally change the NEPA regulation for the first time in its 50-year history earlier this month I testified at the Council on Environmental quality's public hearing in Washington DC there I stated that unlike the ten commandments the NEPA regulations are not written in stone I understand that in 1978 there was broad consensus to finalize the NEPA regulations if we have the same kind of broad consensus today to update certain NEPA provisions this would be another story after all I've said often times that if something isn't perfect let's make it better there's a reason that NEPA is one of the most imitated environmental laws on this planet it's had a lot of success so any changes to the implementing regulations of this bedrock law let alone such substantial changes proposed by the Council on Environmental Quality - NEPA regulations require careful thought meticulous deliberation and bipartisanship consequential changes should be made rarely and with great forethought speakit of a bipartisanship one of our nominees before the Environment and Public Works Committee last year nominated for senior position in the Department of Interior said he was through these words she said bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions that's what he said he's a Republican from Wyoming said bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions NEPA was signed into law 50 years ago by Republican President Richard Nixon NEPA was passed in this body by a bipartisan majority NEPA was passed in the House by bipartisan majority and the reason why it's still alive and well and functioning protecting our environment is because it's a bipartisan solution and it's helped make it a lasting solution so any changes any changes to the implementing regulations of this bedrock law let alone kind of changes sought by a CEQ require a lot more careful thought and deliberation and bipartisanship CQ simply has not aimed to address the needs of all stakeholders witness the universal opposition of the environmental community NEPA is most constituent a consistent constituency Council Environmental Quality has counted this proposal their proposal now as a way to quote modernize NEPA however the proposal is instead an anachronism taking us back to a time when construction bulldozed and disconnected communities before NEPA was actually enacted in 1970 this proposal cast aside any consideration of front-line communities as well as a severe environmental and health consequences to come with eliminating the requirement to consider cumulative environmental impacts and indirect effects taking away that requirement is akin to creating a new NEPA mandate that would exclude the the impact to air quality or water quality from a proposed action simply put it makes no sense not only is removing these requirements a bad idea for public health and for our environment but doing so will end up costing taxpayers more when projects aren't failed to be resilient and as a result taxpayer investments are quite literally washed away by the next big storm or flood what's more this proposal gives the Fox the keys to the henhouse by allowing companies to write their own environmental impact statements think about that by allowing companies to write their own environmental impact statements that's a little bit like offering students self graded take-home exams this proposal also creates loopholes to avoid environmental review in public input which is especially harmful to environmental justice communities are often the targets of industrial investments in projects I take no joy in saying this but the proposal before us is one that is sadly myopic and ideologically driven I repeatedly called on CEQ to withdraw this proposal and I do so again today along with the policy I must also mention seek Hugh's refusal to open this notice to proposed rulemaking to greater public involvement that is commensurate with his gravity and scope in rebuttal to repeated concerns for more than 160 members of Congress and literally hundreds hundreds of stakeholder organizations see you stated that it is and I quote again engaging an extensive public outreach including through requests for public comments to hearings and other outreach close quote to hearings in the whole country in the whole country just last week with only three full business days prior to the close of the comment period CEQ finally told 166 other members of Congress and me that it would refuse to extend the public comment period thus providing the public as little opportunity as possible to have their voices heard both ctq's reply and its public statements make clear that CEQ believes that somehow deserves extra credit for allowing the part of effort of the public to participate in this rulemaking public involvement means not only an opportunity to come in it means taking those comments seriously by CEQ and acting on it let me be clear neither this CEQ nor any council Environmental Quality gets extra credit for the mere act of requesting public comments on America's bedrock environmental law see here certainly does not deserve extra credit for lying only 60 days to review and comment on this massive environmental protection rollback CQ also does not get extra credit for only two hearings in the entire country two earrings to receive public comment at these hearings and public needed a ticket and only got three minutes to speak think about that three minutes for a law that's been around for a half century that is a basic bedrock environmental law three minutes constraining comments to just a couple of minutes the idea of requiring tickets as if it's some kind of prize to participate in something that should be a Democratic norm and the idea of CQ failing to engage a single speaker in Denver or Washington DC think about that not engaging even one speaker in the two places where we actually had the public actually had the opportunity to come in not one that doesn't constitute an open process now where I come from and I think it probably does it for most other folks as well doesn't come close what we have here is a clear sign that CQ is limiting the involvement of the public and wants the clock to expire before the public can find out what's actually in the massive rewrite and that's what it is well to say I'm disappointed with see Q's response to our concern is an understatement NEPA is a 50-year old law but Americans have been given only 60 days to defended I'll go back to what I said before no laws written in stone the Declaration of Independence the Constitution of our country not written in stone everything we do I know we can do better but the way that CQ is approached this this chore this task this undertaking is not just disappointing I think it's shameful NEPA reminds us that our government is one that is of the people for the people and by the people but this proposal and this process bear that I've just described bear little resemblance to those words of Abraham Lincoln sadly they make a mockery of them well we just be clear I will continue to fight to defend NEPA and democratic tools it avails to the American people thank you madam president I yield the floor my friend from Oklahoma

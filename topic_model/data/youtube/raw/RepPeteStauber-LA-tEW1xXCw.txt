Thank You mr. Speaker I rise in honor of world Down syndrome day which was Thursday March 21st one of the greatest blessings in my life is my 16 year old son Isaac who has Down syndrome each day he brings joy to our lives and I am so proud of everything he has accomplished world Down syndrome day is an excellent opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges that Down syndrome brings but it's also a chance to celebrate just how incredible people with Down syndrome truly are it absolutely breaks my heart just breaks my heart when I hear some people say that they would rather get an abortion than have a child with Down syndrome the sheer ignorance of those individuals is disheartening to me they do not see what a blessing all of God's children are even if they are different and that is unfortunate for them if they met my son Isaac I know they'd have a change of heart when we talk about disabilities I want us to talk about the abilities of those like my son Isaac instead of focusing on what they can't do let's focus on what they can do the limit to what people like Isaac can accomplish is not determined by their condition but by how we but but by how much we love them and give them the empowerment so they can navigate the world of work education and public life as Isaac's dad and now as a member of Congress I am committed to strongly advocate for the inclusiveness of those who live with disabilities and the protection of their life always Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back

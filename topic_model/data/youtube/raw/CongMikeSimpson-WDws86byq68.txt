i can tell you that i sat down with mayors all over southeast idaho in my district last week several days just to talk about what was going on what was on their mind issues that were affecting them let them ask questions about what's going on in congress and stuff every one of the meetings turned into that what the hell is epa doing meeting and i can tell you having served at the local level i understand those concerns from the past these meetings were different these people are ready to to hand you the keys to their city and say the heck with it we're done it is frustrating they sit out here and there you take a community of 2 000 people it's looking at 20 million dollars in what the epa has determined they're going to have to do to get their arsenic levels down their water rates are already 150 a month twenty percent of their community is uh makes fifteen thousand dollars or less a year point extended income goes to their water rates in fact a lot of these mayors are new mayors because the last mayor's got beat in the last election because of what they did in terms of water rates at the behest of epa and the new mayors are literally i've never seen it before in my life they said we are ready to just say you guys run the city we're done because we cannot do what you're asking and the amazing thing is is no they're trying to get their arctic level down from 50 parts per billion to 10 or 20 parts per billion to 10 they're trying to get them down from 12 to 10. what's the epa doing to address that is there any flexibility that you have that you work with these small communities because i can tell you you're not only going to be the epa administrator you're going to be the mayor of about 40 communities in southeast idaho if something isn't done and that's true across this country to help them and the people are saying why are we spending this ungodly amount of money to reduce our arsenic levels from 12 to 10 and sometimes 11 to 10. is this parts per million yeah parts per billion billion and the only reason is billions because we'll measure it now as you can tell i'm frustrated

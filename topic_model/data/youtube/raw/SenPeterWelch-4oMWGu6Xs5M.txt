MASSACHUSETTS. MR. MCGOVERN: I YIELD TWO  MINUTES TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM  VERMONT. WELL WELL THIS FARM BILL --  MR. WELCH: THIS FARM BILL IS   OUTRAGEOUS.  THIS HELPS PEOPLE IN ALL OF OUR  DISTRICTS THAT NEED THE FOOD.  THIS BILL HAS HAD NO PROCESS.  IT IS A CONTINUATION OF AN   EFFORT TO RATCHET DOWN ANY HELP  THAT AMERICANS NEED. THAT HEALTH CARE BILL WAS GOING  TO HELP ON HEALTH CARE BY TAKING IT AWAY FROM 24 MILLION PEOPLE.  THIS NUTRITION PEOPLE IS GOING   TO TAKE $23 MILLION WORTH OF   BENEFITS, BILLIONS AWAY FROM   CHILDREN, VETERANS, ELDERLY,   DISABLED WHO NEED THAT FOOD? WHY? WE PASSED A TAX CUT. AND BY THE WAY, IT WASN'T PAID   FOR, $2.3 TRILLION ADDED TO THE  DEFICIT FOR A TAX BILL WHERE 87% OF THE BENEFITS GO TO  MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND   INDIVIDUALS EARNING OVER   $890,000 A YEAR. WELL, THE BILL HAS COME DUE AND  WE HAVE A PROPOSAL HERE TO COME  UP WITH $23 BILLION TO PAY FOR   IT AND THAT'S TAKING MEALS OFF   THE TABLE OF DISABLED PEOPLE.  AND BY THE WAY, THE WORK   REQUIREMENT, WHAT IS IT REALLY?  THAT SOUNDS GOOD.  WHO WANTS TO WORK? EVERYBODY WANTS TO WORK. WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS   SO-CALLED WORK REQUIREMENT BY  PAYING BUREAUCRATS AND GIVING  THEM THE IMPOSSIBLE JOB OF   PUTTING PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ABLE  TO WORK INTO JOBS THAT DON'T   EXIST. TALK ABOUT CYNICAL.  THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS.  I'M FROM VERMONT WHERE WE HAVE   LOTS OF FOLKS WHO NEED HELP AND  WE HAVE LOTS OF VERMONTERS WHO   WITH VERY LITTLE MONEY ARE DOING THINGS TO PUT MEALS, GOOD MEALS  ON THE TABLES OF THOSE FAMILIES. DON'T PASS THIS FARM BILL. IT TAKES THAT NUTRITION AWAY   FROM OUR VERMONTERS AND OUR  AMERICAN CITIZENS. I YIELD BACK.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN

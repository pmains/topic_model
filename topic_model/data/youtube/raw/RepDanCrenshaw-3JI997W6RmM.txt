we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw all right we're ready to go canyon brim hall that's quite the name thank you sir yeah it does well within introductions i like it uh yeah is it are you from arizona yes sir i'm uh like a sixth generation arizonan uh you know born and raised and uh now i'm out in dc so a very different place a lot less uh dry and warm yeah yeah that's true it's about the snow here in a second so your parents i mean was there some like arizona connection to why they named you that yeah um so uh my my family uh my mom's side has a lot of native american heritage so while you can tell it was diluted quite drastically uh by the time it got to me uh one of my great grandparents uh really wanted to help kind of carry on that family legacy right of native american history and culture and she basically asked my my parents if she could name one of their children and the name that she came up with was canyon and my parents you know being from arizona uh my mom's pretty pretty hippie uh you know we're like yeah that's great it's very arizona and has the native american tie-in and you know it ever but to the general world that's just really i'm from arizona my name is canyon it makes sense it does make sense that's quite well that's a great introduction to canyon brim hall and people would be wondering why that is um we usually don't even start the podcast that way but we did this time and i like it so um but the true topic is not your first name it is reforming section 230 uh which which you happen to be an expert on so canyon brimhall you're a federal government affairs manager at r street which is a think tank you work at technology and innovation and national security and cyber security teams promote pragmatic free market policy solutions to complex technological issues uh so canyon thanks so much for being on thank you for having me sir it's an honor so um let's just get right to it i you know always the what's the best place to even start the conversation maybe that's the first question because uh i'm tempted to say okay first explain the initial purpose of section 230 why it even exists in the first place and then let's get into why people think um either abolishing it or reforming it would fix a lot of the the problems that we see with censorship on social media yeah i think that's great and i think that kind of the first and foremost thing that we need to do with section 230 is clarify exactly what it is that we're talking about right because i think that there's a lot of misinformation that kind of gets thrown around and we end up in a game of telephone uh where nobody's really quite sure what we're talking about so starting off with kind of that historical context before section 230 uh you know in the budding days of the internet there was a lot of litigation regarding content on the internet um you know i'm not gonna spout off court cases for you unfortunately i wish i could but uh i'm not that good at uh you know remembering the names of all the defendants and litigants um but long story short uh his websites were were sued for hosting content especially if they ever took down some content but missed other content you know an example could be um if if people are posting you know defamatory comments on my website maybe i consider them you know nazi propaganda or even antifa propaganda you know these kind of very extremist positions or uh death threats harassment pornography um you know general harassment is is another good category um and what happened is uh people started suing uh the posters of this information um to say you know you hosted this information you should be liable for it so examples include america online uh myspace you know the earlier social media network that most people don't really talk about anymore and a host of other services america online was one of the big targets because they were one of the predominant players in terms of uh providing internet service to people and they i don't know if you use aol yourself uh you know they have their own kind of sandboxed environment where they had a lot of information that they kind of provided to you it was yeah it was kind of funny in hindsight it was yeah it was like its own it was like a simultaneously a website but also an internet provider as i recall it yeah exactly i i won't spend too much time on this but uh funnily my my mom actually spent uh several years paying aol to continue letting her log on to that you know web portal even though she could access her email for free using internet explorer or some kind of you know alternate um platform because she liked aol she was used to it she liked the the format that they had the way that they presented things um so she continued to pay for that i was worth it to her for several years until i convinced her otherwise um we all had grandma's like that yeah exactly so now she's on gmail so so she's great um so that that was kind of you know where things were and in the early days of the internet um so section 230 actually congress passed the communications decency act was originally an attempt by congress to rein in a lot of indecent materials online uh the problem that they saw was there wasn't enough ability for con for websites to moderate because if they did then they were getting sued uh you know an example would be if you you know took down one nazi comment but for missed another one um you could be sued for the nazi comment that you missed you could also be sued for antifa comments that you didn't take down because now those are on your website you've shown that you take down some things but you didn't take down this so you are now liable for this piece of content even if it's completely different than what you have taken down in the past you took something down you're now liable for everything right so congress you know wanting the internet to not be full of pornography and you know all kinds of disgusting things on websites um that turned out real well yeah well but see i i would argue that it has because when you go to twitter how much pornography do you see yeah i i don't i have never seen pornography on on twitter especially not you know hardcore graphic pornography like what you would expect to see on a pornographic website right um so yes these things exist but they are in appropriate places for people who pursue those things um similarly uh yeah i i won't dub tell us there but anyway so um that history meant that congress said websites we want you to take down more content we want you to be able to take these things down we are going to empower you using section 230 uh and a whole host of other laws to do that um most of the other laws in the communication seasoncy act were eventually found unconstitutional usually on first amendment grounds section 230 is one of the few sections that has kind of stood the test of time and has been litigated over and over again in order to enshrine that as a protection one example that i'll give of you know soon after the uh in the 90s after section 230 was implemented one example of attempts to silence conservative speech by suing the platform that hosts it uh was bloomin boom and fall v aol i said i wasn't gonna quote court cases at you and there i go uh but blumenthal v aol uh no not the congressman uh the the um they sued saying that aol was hosting drudge uh matt drudge his his reports aol was hosting the drudge report and because of that aol was sued for defamation because the drudge report was deemed by the litigants to be defamatory thankfully section 230 existed at this point and the courts were able to step in and say this is exactly the type of thing that section 230 was meant to stop you are not able to sue america online for defamation because matt drudge says something that might be defamatory towards you so i think that's kind of a i don't want to you know blab at you too long but i think that's kind of a good place setting in terms of the history of and how we got here yeah well it's extremely important um because i don't think people quite understand the the complicated nature of it and the the need to protect the internet from this sort of um whimsical lawsuits that could happen for all sorts of reasons that even conservatives would would disagree with um you know the goal for conservatives is pretty clear like we we basically want internet companies to abide by the spirit of the first amendment okay you and and and and and if not that at least operate within a very clear-cut set of standards there's a huge difference between aol and twitter you know i would argue um it's one thing for for you to host a a website like aol or or even like or even like a cnn website and which with the entire purpose of which is to publish content they are publishing content cnn is publishing content that they control that they're liable for aol is creating is putting services online that they control that they're liable for but on the but as a side note they also allow commentary under these things so that's quite different than what twitter is which the entire purpose of twitter at least as they allege is to is for commentary right it's a social media website which didn't exist when section 230 was written so you know i think many people would argue rightfully that these are two different things and they require two different sets of regulations and so if our goal is concerned because democrats have a totally different goal they actually want more censorship and i'm not i'm not sure how to meet in the middle on that when your goal is entirely different than mine um and so that's a political problem that we don't necessarily need to discuss but if conservatives had the senate the house and the presidency and we were trying to figure out how to how to thoughtfully regulate uh this so that our goal is met which is the maximum amount of free speech while also while also understanding there's some things that should be taken down like maybe it's pornography maybe it's human trafficking right maybe it's you know things that are not protected under the first amendment like illegal things um incent and incentivizing violence things like that so so what's the right way to get there are there is there any of the current um talking points and pieces of legislation really get us there yeah you know i i don't think so um i think that you know there's a number of attempts to get at section 230 but i don't think that any of them succeed in solving the issues that that you're outlining um and in particular you know i i'd like to you know kind of dive a little bit more into what you're you're talking about which is the desire to have uh social media companies adhere to the spirit of the first amendment right um i think that in you know in theory i think that's great and i think that in um practice they attempt to create you know a space where people can communicate share ideas and those kind of things and and the core of of section 230 i think is really strengthening to the first amendment which is it said all it really says is that a speaker shall not be held liable for someone else's speech so the first amendment um also protects twitter facebook and these uh corporations and their right to free speech um so i'm i'm i'm a strong property rights advocate so i have a really hard time with this kind of concept that um because they have reached a certain size all of the sudden these these social media companies become kind of public publicly owned uh businesses we haven't to my knowledge used eminent domain to take over these companies we haven't you know nationalized twitter or facebook which i think would be a terrible idea so um i don't understand how we can be simultaneously pro property rights and say you twitter you facebook you're going to have to we're going to restrict your property rights and your first amendment rights on your platform um you know i'm i i obviously there's a difference in size and scale but i i think of this in terms of if i owned a restaurant and someone came in and started yelling racist things would i have the right to kick that person out of my restaurant similarly does twitter have the right to kick somebody off of their platform if they do something that they that you know that speech that they fundamentally disagree with the other part of what you were mentioning that i really think is important to discuss and think about is the question of whether or not platforms should only be able to get rid of unconstitutional or illegal speech um so you mentioned you know if they are held to the first amendment then something that if they don't buy if speech doesn't violate the first amendment then they it should be left up correct is that a fair characterization so i i think a perfect example of why that doesn't work is pornography pornography is not illegal but i as a twitter user don't want to be flooded with pornography when i go onto the site i think there's another great example of this which is parlor uh which i i assume you're familiar with they created their platform as an alternative to twitter and facebook and they started off by saying we will only remove um illegal speech we will not remove speech that is protected by the first amendment so what happened their platform was flooded with pornography and pictures of feces feces poop poop everywhere imagine if everything you posted on you know a social media website was responded to with a thousand pictures of poop that would not be a good way to have a discourse have you seen the comments under my twitter posts they might not be far from it yeah literal pictures of poop uh i could probably find some i mean it's not illegal i mean i don't think twitter especially well you know they have no interest in protecting conservatives either so it's that's kind of the point like i mean it's very horrible stuff it's you know let's let's let's not pretend that that twitter isn't some garbage heap of of human expression because it absolutely is right so and there is and you can find those kind of pictures you can find pornographic pictures on twitter it doesn't necessarily come across your feed because it depends on who you follow but i have a feeling that if somebody i followed posted that i don't think twitter takes it down well but what i'm saying is it is different than what you're articulating there which is this isn't somebody that you follow this could be random people on the internet coming to your twitter page and posting pictures of you know pornographic pictures they could be is that how parlor works i'm not on parlor yet you know yeah that was essentially at first their their their stance was we will not remove uh constitutionally protected speech but they have since learned from that mistake and have amended that policy and they had to put out a clarification that basically said well of course we're not going to just leave up pictures of poop and pornography and things like that of course that's not what we meant when we said we will leave up all constitutionally protected speech but that is what they meant they just didn't understand the unintended consequences of saying we will not remove it as long as it is is legal um there are a lot of legal things that we still want to be able to remove from the internet in order to make these platforms something that we want to use yeah okay so yeah and i i i think we probably end up agreeing because what i was saying earlier was like right you need to have some ability to take things down that are clearly wrong if you want to go slightly beyond protected speech fine i get it right pornography being an example um you know standard maybe clear and transparent standards would be a good start and if and by the way i think of twitter facebook instagram if they had just set clear and definable standards from the get-go we nobody would really be arguing if you said look you can't say these words these are words that we just don't accept right and these are defamatory words um they're racist words we will if you use that word your post gets taken down that's a very clear standard by which to meet um if you say something violent if you're clearly um inciting violence we will say well of course that's not protected anyway but you get my point um of course the problem is is their standards are loose and they've become unbelievably partisan and um nobody trusts them anymore they have other ways of throttling they have other i mean and i've seen this you know i don't like to act paranoid about it but i've seen it sometimes on my own page where you're like this is just not how this normally goes right there's clear difference in what's happening with this particular post i've seen pages similar to mine and as far as growth go and all of a sudden they stopped and i've seen you know i've seen instagram influencers just stop growing all of a sudden it didn't make any sense we've been following the exact same growth rate for for a year now so there's very obvious things that happen and that's you know that's harder to prove because you're not necessarily taking a post down or or fact checking it which is a little bit more obvious to people um and so again again it seems like you know you and i probably have the same goal here um and we're just we're not sure how to get there i for one have been very skeptical of the claims that just getting rid of section 230 would fix all of this um and not lead to a bunch of other consequences so maybe let's start there you know because because that's that's in the news right now the president wants to veto the ndaa because um it doesn't have uh the removal of section 230 in it um again i totally agree with him on the need to do something about this i'm not sure removing section 230 is the right answer and i'm sure as hell don't think that adding it to the ndia is the right answer so you know that's but that's a different question what happens if you remove section 230 just in its entirety just abolish it gotcha yeah and that's a that's a perfect question um i think that we really go back to in many ways the internet before section 230 that i was outlining earlier which is uh platforms would be sued for the content that um creators put onto their platforms platforms being a very broad range of of services websites that we communicate with especially anybody who has you know a comment section or some ability uh for users to to participate um it would essentially force internet companies into one of two options one moderate everything essentially create gatekeepers that's that will pre-approve all content before it's allowed on the internet more getting into more similar to like a newspaper or news organization you know the mainstream media um which would be we are not we are liable for everything we put on here we're gonna vet it we're gonna check it we're gonna you know fact check it and decide and we'll even say we don't personally agree with this we don't want to attach our name to this as our stance so we're not not going to allow that to go up onto our site the other option would be a totally hands-off approach that does zero moderation because as i mentioned earlier taking down even one piece of content opens you up to litigation for all content on your website so that's where you end up with a situation that um you know if i i i like to think of you know in kind of concrete terms i look at you know websites especially ones for like children um we absolutely want section 230 protections for websites designed for children because that's what allows them to take down these things again going back to pornography it's not illegal but we definitely don't want children exposed to pornography you know when i was a kid i used a website called neopets.com i don't know if you've ever heard of that but it's very tailored towards children it's got fun games and message boards and those kind of things without section 230 i imagine that website and what it would be like if they chose not to moderate at all then which would be one of their best options legally speaking um then that website could be flooded with pornography child exploitation um you know materials it could even even something as you know maybe relatively innocent as feces you know i don't know that we want our children to be exposed to that type of an environment or they just wouldn't have comment sections i mean because i guess the websites you're talking about are websites that allow some interaction by users yeah exactly there's no real impact if you don't allow any interaction with from your users if it's only a one-way stream from the website to the to the user then section 230 at least as far as i understand doesn't really apply yeah okay so and i think that makes sense from a legal perspective you're putting in either one of two extreme boxes you're either getting massive censorship um because you don't ever want to be sued or you're getting no censorship at all which is kind of you know a conservatives would be somewhat okay with that i think but but to your point on parlor like you know that's a good experiment that shows um god it gets a little wild out there um and those websites can still exist under a section 230 world you know you look at websites like uh reddit 4chan 8chan reddit has really cleaned up a lot of its its uh subreddits in more recent years but and 4chan essentially got shut down and became 8chan um the idea there being these are the these are the free you know anything goes type of type of situations where you know you can find a lot of you know racist homophobic uh you know defamatory you'll probably find a lot of pictures of poop um on those websites really you really you always bring it back to the poop i really always bring it back to that um so i think that that um those types of websites still exist today and they can exist so that we haven't foreclosed that avenue of speech that just i don't want that to be all of the internet okay so i want to read what section 230 actually says and see i would argue based on this reading that i think twitter for instance is surpassing the intent of 230 to an extraordinary degree by limiting political speech um or even fact checking frankly and and so because because it says no provider user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be and here's here's the words that are important obscene these are all just synonyms obscene lewd i hate this word lascivious filthy excessively violent harassing or otherwise objectionable whether or not such material is constitutionally protected now i think the intent of that is is kind of obvious i don't think that and that intent is met by fact-checking basically what is often an opinion a subjective opinion and political speech which is what's driving everybody crazy um what are your thoughts on that and could could we make that clearer in the law and fix this so i think that the way that that was worded and particularly including the otherwise objectionable standard and the reason there are so many synonyms is because they wanted to be all-encompassing their goal was so that some some small thing wouldn't kind of fall through the cracks because someone could say oh that's not really lewd it's just filthy you know they've said no any of that none of that's allowed um and if you if it's even if we didn't think of a reason why it's not allowed here's here's a standard that you can apply to that situation um i think that um it kind of help me understand a little bit better what what exactly is the core of your question what why are they my question is could could we reword that line there um to be more narrow and right and and say like look i don't have a problem with the obscene lewd you know because you know for your example of poop right filthy i don't really have a problem with these but the otherwise objectionable part does open up the door for quite a few more quite a few more sensor examples of censorship yeah so i'll give you an example of an otherwise objectionable um issue that would not be covered by the the other words were we to say get rid of that that portion of the standard uh my colleague shoshanna weissman uh who i believe was on the the podcast actually with yeah before a long conversation on sloths yeah yeah yes she loves sloths she's she's really great and so she has written about this issue of dating sites dating sites are dealing with romance scams um so one of people will create fake profiles to catfish people to trick them into sending them money or various you know activities um essentially in wrapping them in a web of uh of manipulation and exploitation um that does not necessarily fall under the obscene lewd lascivious filthy excessively violent harassing metrics yeah but it is otherwise objectionable which is why we have that standard and this is one of the things that that shoshana has emphasized if we eliminated 230 dating websites would lose the ability to remove fake profiles uh because it doesn't meet any of those other criteria um so it's important to have that otherwise objectionable as a catch-all because here's the other big point that i i would make on this getting rid of section 230 would be a giveaway to trial lawyers yeah people lawyers lawyers would absolutely love it if you made it so that they could sue more people surprised right um you know i'm never surprised in josh hall for example a former attorney general and obviously a very much a legally minded person um says that he wants to be able to sue social media companies that's kind of like a you know no duh kind of situation a lawyer wants to sue people yeah of course it's also worth noting that the demo you know joe biden has called for eliminating 230. and um given that the democrats have a totally different intent in mind which is more censorship it gives me pause when we talk about you know because we have totally different goals here and i'm sorry but two totally different goals cannot be met by the exact same action right just completely agree logically thinking here so yeah i completely agree and it always gets me in these hearings when you know the republicans and democrats will say look how bipartisan this issue is we're all here you know beating up on these tech ceos that we all agree that we hate facebook we hate twitter we're so bipartisan that's not what bipartisanship is we have two totally different goals exactly it's not agreeing to hate the same person or company it's agreeing to solutions the solutions are where you get to bipartisanship and they couldn't be more divergent on that fact because exactly like you said republicans are pushing for more speech to be left up less uh you know social media interfering and deciding what to take down or or tag or you know any of that kind of stuff and democrats want more of that it's it's shocking to me to hear uh in these hearings for example you know uh congress people will bring up specific instances of moderation and they'll say i disagree with this moderation decision you should not have taken down this post and the companies will say you know i'm sorry you know that's just based on our policies et cetera et cetera right afterwards a democratic member will stand up and say i disagree i think you should have taken down that post faster and i'm really upset with you that it was up for even 72 hours how dare you leave you know defamatory information up for 72 hours so you know and i think that that really gets to the core of my concern with the proposals for changing section 230 is they all put the government in some kind of uh an arbiter place of deciding what is and is not acceptable speech and acceptable curation censorship all these various things and that is exactly what the first amendment is supposed to protect us from it is supposed to protect us from having a an essentially a ministry of truth that will tell social media companies thou must leave up this content and must take down this content that is government compelled uh or forbidden speech and that especially with an incoming democratic administration i would think that conservatives and republicans would realize that having giving giving more power to the federal government to determine what speech is and is not acceptable online is not a good idea okay so i'm running out of options here um so well well here's the next question then what would you change about section 230 to to modernize it because it wasn't written in the in the scope of social media you know i i think that that argument strikes me very much similar to when people say that the constitution must be out of date because it wasn't written to assume all of the technologies of today but we can amend the constitution with with an overwhelming majority of signatories so absolutely but i just i don't think that its age is kind of inherently uh limiting factor in it we'll erase well okay well let's let's put that aside for forget about when it was written but yeah is it working right now you know for again to meet our goals here yes uh i would say yes um because social media companies websites more broadly are not flooded with a torrent of litigation that causes them to shut down um and you know it's easy to get lost in this world of facebook and twitter and those kind of folks who quite honestly could probably handle at least some amount of that litigation i worry much more about your mom and pop websites now um i i please share with me if you've heard differently but in the regulatory environment we have right now with section 230 i'm not hearing about mom and pop shop websites getting sued into oblivion for someone posting a comment or a review on their website that is something that we don't have and i think that if you the the real thing that scares me about changing section 230 um is the flood even the threat of litigation is enough to chill speech and to significantly change how businesses operate um even if their lawsuits are frivolous section 230 in its current form prevents those lawsuits from being brought up in the first place and that kind of protection especially for small players and on the internet i think has given us exactly the internet ecosystem that we have today we have all of the largest most successful technology companies in the world sans maybe what uh spotify in europe that's pretty much their their main success story um that's because of section 230. i don't know if you're familiar with jeff kosef he wrote a book called the 26 words that created the internet you read earlier you know the the wording of section 230 it's 26 words it's really very simple and i wish more people would read it um that is the foundation for the entire do you have it do you have those 26 words in front of you can we read them i sure do yes absolutely so uh uh it's section 230 uh subsection c1 is treatment of publisher speaker no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider okay that and that that makes sense right it it does um and um but let's get back to intent i'm going to read in a quote from andrew mccarthy i think he he puts this rather well said quote clearly congress was not of a mind to grant immunity from speaker publisher liability to interactive computer services that suppressed content based on their subjective political objections to it such a grant would have contradicted congress's aforementioned described objective to promote true diversity of political discourse right so i mean this guess gets to the goal that we have right and so you've pretty well established that you don't think changing section 230 would really meet that goal because of all the unintended consequences that associate with that um literally an hour ago i just recorded a podcast with brendan carr commissioner at the fcc and um he tends to agree i mean i think he's a little bit more on my side on like you know maybe we can more narrowly focus um section 230 but he brought up something rather interesting which might be a better solution which is looking at consumer protection law um because because the thing is is that these these companies twitter facebook they they they created their monopoly um on on our internet discourse by basically claiming that this is where free speech happens this is where you can connect this is where you can talk and and they got everybody in on that okay then over the over as years went on they started to change their minds right and they started to to act as especially as political actors so you know are they upholding um you know their their initial sales pitch right did they did they engage in false marketing to the consumer is that a better way to to look at this um you know i'm not a lawyer so i'd be remiss to tell you whether or not that would be successful from my understanding of it it has been ruled by the courts that um that terms of service or those kinds of voluntary agreements that the companies basically the company lays out for its users are not legally enforceable so i don't know that it would be uh how how successful you will be uh you know in bringing those litigations but obvious but i definitely think that that is a proper that the ftc the pro consumer welfare standard you know the uh that is the proper way to look at these types of situations um particularly when it comes to anti-trust situations i i heard in there you know they established their monopoly and i i know this isn't a discussion on antitrust but i would push back a little bit on that and say you know i think it's it itself is ironic the sentence facebook and twitter created their monopolies um that in of itself seems self-con it seems self-contradictory um twitter is not a monopoly because facebook exists and vice versa also parlor gab um any other number of social media networks so i don't think that these are monopolies to begin with and then the other part is that's like saying you know uh suing a company because they have a mission statement saying we want to make the world a better place you know we want to inc do these x y and z and then suing them and saying you didn't meet up you didn't fulfill your mission statement i don't i don't think that that's probably going to be very effective yeah well okay well let's let's narrow the question then i agree that i'm not so sure litigation would be effective there um just based on current law i think maybe the question is is that where we we focus our policy objectives is that where we focus future legislation um basically narrowing how they can actually write out these um extremely because what they do is they have very vague standards and and i think we could argue that that the enforcement at those standards because they're so vague to begin with are extremely arbitrary and extend and extremely subjective which in turn um damages consumer protection rights i mean whether it's whether it's new policy or new legislation is you know is that is that the better avenue to again get to the goal that we want to get to right force these companies to actually have coherent standards by which they operate which in turn which in turn you know you could argue is a consumer protection issue you know because you know yeah they have they have these standards and you have to sign on to them to to to to create an account but the methods by which they're enforcing them are unbelievably subjective and partisan that's that's well known at this point and it's obvious um so are they you know you might argue that they're already violating consumer protection law and if they're not then should we be should we be looking at policy or legislation that that defines that better yeah so i think that when we get into these areas of talking about um you know kind of the what they promised to people um and then how they've changed over time i think that that's actually really indicative of exactly the problems that i see with putting government into this into this position um the reason that they you know first of all i would say facebook was originally started as a not as some bastion of free speech on the internet it was started by mark zuckerberg as a way for college students to hook up with each other um you know i think if we're being honest about the situation so um i don't think that you know and even if at some point they had said you know yes we should have these these lofty goals you know that was never the the true goal of them to begin with what we have seen over time is actually political influence political pressure has forced them to become more and more moderators and determinants of content you know i look back to 2016 donald trump uh the election and how much how much complaining there was especially from democrats about misinformation and russian you know manipulation of our election system by with all the speech that was proliferating on these platforms um as a result in order to you know facebook and twitter and other social media platforms essentially have bent to political pressure to say okay we're going to moderate more we're going to take down more content more speech and i have a really hard time imagining how we would craft a law that would not just further that exact treatment you know if you've got democratic senators democratic members of congress president biden who you mentioned you know it has has come out against section 230 if they're the ones writing the rules for what you know is an acceptable term of service what uh you know how what level transparency or neutrality do you have to meet in order to receive these you know section 230 protections i think we're going to end up in a worse place uh not a better place and just in general i think that this strikes at the core of you know as as a defender of the first amendment first and foremost these companies have a right to speech so i don't know that it's appropriate for us to say uh you know they can't have certain speech or they must have certain speech or their terms of service must be specifically you know worded in these ways or conclude include this information um yeah i think that that's a really slippery slope that that really puts the government in control of you know what speech is and is not acceptable on the platforms okay so you kind of shut down every single um solution i've sort of offered here so isn't it obvious so the final question would be like well is there a solution if we both agree that there's a problem and that we have a specific goal in mind that we agree on and we're not meeting that goal just uh which is basically protecting the spirit of the first amendment and more importantly stopping the arbitrary and subjective censorship of political speech which arguably and i think strongly arguably um i know that's not correct english influences elections in major ways and has has extreme consequences so what is the solution yeah so i think you know it's i am not going to say that there is no bias on social media platforms i think it's obvious that there is um you know there are user bases skew liberal there are more liberals on twitter and facebook in general than there are conservatives they're employee bases skew liberal um they're located in the silicon valley um i think that that's all just that just makes sense and to the average person that's intuitive right of course there's bias in these situations um my issue is i don't think that you know putting that power in the government's hands would make it less biased and i'm more interested in a world of competing biases because i don't believe that there is such a thing as a neutral truly neutral arbiter of facts and information i think a lot of things come down to uh subjectivity and opinion so i'm much more interested in ensuring that there is a competitive marketplace where alternatives to facebook and twitter can exist like gab like parlor um if you so you know going back to saying what happens if we get rid of section 230 i don't think those websites exist i think that those websites get destroyed under the under crushing litigation before they're able to get off the ground but i think that facebook and twitter probably continue to exist um because they're the large incumbent players who are able to you know engage in regulatory capture um you know it's not a coincidence that mark zuckerberg says oh yes please regulate us we would love it if all of these things we do voluntarily right now we would love it if all of our competitors were forced to do those same exact things of course they feel that way that would benefit facebook and harm their competitors um so i think that when we you know and the other part you know i so there is obviously some amount of censorship online but the other part that i want to emphasize is we have to be very careful especially as conservatives that we don't um you know kind of shoot ourselves in the foot and make something that is maybe not perfect even worse uh you know i look back to donald trump's comments he said without the tweets i wouldn't be here straight up he said without without tweets without twitter he does not think he would be president and many people have agreed with him that that is a way for him to cut through the mainstream media to cut through the gatekeepers and the people who would censor him and get his message directly to his followers so i think that that narrative the fact that donald trump has used it successfully and used it to become president counters the idea that the internet is just a wasteland for conservative thought where as if it's not useful for conservatives if anything i would caution people from you know there's there's analogies made to well you know cnn or well newspapers they're subjected to these regulations why aren't facebook and twitter well how much conservative commentary do you get from those publications do you really want the mainstream media to also and how they operate to also be how facebook and social media companies operate so i think that it's important for us to protect the opportunities for speech that we have especially for conservative speech that would otherwise be censored you know the the social justice warriors would destroy would would make sure that donald trump was not heard if we subjected these platforms to increased regulation so i would actually say that the status quo that today with section 230 is much better for conservatives than the alternative of a world without section 230. even if it's not perfect yeah yeah i mean i definitely see your points on many cases there and i have to i have to bring that up when i talk about it too i say you know the the media itself is so unbelievably biased i mean they're god we deal with it every day their their ability to create narratives um by by by writing objectionable stories um and then using that as a sort of a sort of i say persuasion by listing of like look at this this and this and there's only a tiny bit of kernel of truth to each of those but taken in an aggregate seems to be true they're very good at spinning narratives in that way um the only way for somebody like me to fight back is through my social media accounts right so um exactly and that is absolutely true um even though but but they're trying to infiltrate that as well right because i guess the left understands that our only way as conservatives to get our voices heard is on these platforms and there's they're trying to chip away at that and that only seems to be going in one direction and so i mean so i kind of have to keep asking the question we have to stop that direction we have to stop that flow before we're completely censored out of existence like that you know again the mainstream media has already done its job um by by by allowing the left to completely control that institution um and uh even though we have our own conservative media well as we've seen with say the new york post story on hunter biden social media companies will will disallow them to to to even promote their their protected first amendment right as a freedom of the press so i mean it's just it's going in a bad direction um and the only entity powerful enough to stop it is the government itself i mean i would love to believe that competition is the answer but parlor is really just a place for conservatives to talk to each other at this point it's not reaching your your average citizen um whereas twitter and facebook do i mean they they they do have a strangle and i understand that yes there's two of them and in theory that's a competition but in in practice in all practical reality it is not it is a it is a monopoly um from silicon valley and a select group of people that work there that all think exactly the same so you know it's just it's it's this is why conservatives are so hungry for some kind of solution because i think the idealism of the libertarian um stance on this which is that competition solves everything isn't necessarily working in this case and um we're hungry for solution i mean you even said it's not perfect so i guess the question is is there a way to make that that regulation perfect i mean you know and it's i'm not so sure it means government is regulating that speech i think it means a law that is written whether it's along the consumer protection angle or whether it's along the section 230 angle that just more narrowly narrowly defines what you can take down i mean could it be as simple as saying political subjective political speech is not part of this protection right you you can't you can't do that um because that's because of the overreaching consequences of that you know again the fundamental question of of what of what government right i mean the government already read i mean section 230 already um makes you know again it uses words like obscene lewd filthy accessibly violent so it's already doing it so so what is the problem with adding a few more words to that sentence to more narrowly define or exclude what they can do you know in order to protect the spirit of the first amendment yeah so i i think first and foremost that's my answer is protecting the spirit of the first amendment also means protecting the rights of those individuals to you know take down speech that they that they don't want on one on their platform yet we get into this tricky situation where you know i i don't really fully understand exactly where conservatives who are generally you know pro property rights uh start to think okay but you're too big and again i would push back on the kind of monopoly idea because i i don't believe that that's that that's accurate and looking back you know once upon a time facebook was supposedly a monopoly sorry not facebook myspace was supposedly a monopoly and it's it still exists myspace is still a thing you could go and make an account right now you might even still have one if you used it back in the day um but they are not a player in the in the scheme of things this idea that facebook is a monopoly is really kind of surprising to me uh and seems very short-sighted because um i barely use facebook many of the people my generation i know don't and one of its biggest competitors if not its biggest is probably tick-tock which is a rising star and is not twitter um you know a common competitor google right google is commonly touted as a monopoly or a giant company with uh outsized power and the ability to dominate markets well okay what happened to google plus the social network that google started it failed uh because people didn't like it so i think that we while it seems in this very sm this moment right now it seems hard to imagine a world where facebook and twitter aren't the dominant players i think that in some ways that's a failure of imagination because if we look to the future there will almost inevitably be new services new platforms that will come and will challenge them you know even the acquisition of instagram was itself facebook attempting to uh innovate ahead of the curve in order to stay in business and they may not be as relevant today as they are if they hadn't done that because instagram was a budding competitor um so i think that you know first and foremost i would kind of challenge those ideas that there is this kind of market dominance or mark that it is inevitable that these are the players and then i would be very skeptical of having the government detail exactly what you can and cannot take down i think that leaving it up to the uh the uh sub because everything is subjective uh they're so hard to find objectively uh you know this is wrong this is bad um you're always going to have someone subjective making these decisions and i would rather have those subjective decisions be made in the companies than i would in the government and especially when the government is largely controlled by liberals who are calling for increased censorship of speech that really scares me yeah but i i kind of feel like we're talking past each other because i i i also do not want regulators um in in the administration any administration saying now this was right this was wrong you know the et cetera et cetera yeah because that that's that's just that's just somebody else giving a subjective opinion that's not the goal here the the goal here is to is to maybe force into law that you have to have better standards by which you operate right because of consumer protection rights um you you can't you can't ask people to sign up for something based on this set of standards and then just and then just run willy-nilly with these standards which are so vague and so impossible to to to predict really like because it's impossible to predict what will be taken down what will be fact checked based on those standards so by simple consumer protection measures you could argue like you know the best way to do this is to have um you know clearer standards in place by which we can all operate that allow for no subjectivity right you know again like none of this would be happening if these if these companies would just say look this is what's right and this is what's wrong you can't say these words you can't post the pictures of poop you can't do this exactly right and and then then you wouldn't have all this space for this nonsense um yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense and i i see where you're coming from with that um i think that the the issue that we get into with is you know how do you tear what are the words you know that you want to ban you know i think this kind of gets back into like the the car they can decide well they can decide twitter can decide what words you can't say right if they want to say you can't say the word republican all right well at least that's clear you know but the problem but the problem is is that they don't do that the problem and again this is why i tend to agree with with with brennan carr's analysis on this and he's a lawyer on this so you know that's why we had that conversation um it's i it was a pretty persuasive argument he makes that maybe that's the better avenue um because because now it's about you know what you're really signing up for here are the standards and now government really has no control beyond that because yeah you as long as the standards are clear government you know litigation would would be you could still sue them and say you are not operating on clear standards um and you have to clarify your standards so i think it's the best of both worlds because it allows what you know the more libertarian stance to say well twitter you can still be that liberal platform but now you're going to have to explicitly say that you're a liberal platform yeah and i want to be clear that um what so far what we've discussed has been pretty much entirely you know government action and those kind of things i i will agree with you in the state sense that these companies can do better and i wish that they would um i think that transparency is a big portion of that and you you mentioned towards the beginning of our discussion that we probably wouldn't even be having a lot of these issues we wouldn't have these discussions to begin with if twitter and facebook provided clear and transparent um terms of service that very articulately said here's what's allowed here's not what's here's what's not allowed here's you know this these specific phrases or terms or types of images these things are banned these things are allowed i think that that is would be a good thing for these companies to do because i think it would be good for their business i think that it would enj it would endear them to their users so from a purely business perspective wanting to provide the best experience to your users i think that you should provide transparency um i also don't always agree with you know individual moderation decisions so and it would be really nice and sometimes i see ones where i'm like dang that why is that up and this other thing was taken down yeah and that's awesome exactly and i think that also has a lot to do with the just the mechanism by which they do they do take downs which is a notice and takedown regime you know they have millions or billions of pieces of content that get posted on their website on a regular basis and the way that they decide what to even scrutinize let alone take down is usually based on user reports so a user says i don't like that they flag it and then that gets put into either an algorithm or into a manual curation system and as i mentioned earlier i think it's obvious to everyone that the employee bases as well as the user bases for these companies skew liberal um so of course you're gonna end up with more conservative content taken down if the entire regime is okay we've got a bunch of liberals on our platform and they're gonna i've also heard anecdotal evidence that liberals are more likely to flag content as inappropriate whereas conservatives are more likely to say i don't agree with it but i'm not gonna flag it and just based on how the platforms work that's going to result in more censorship of conservatives so i i wish from in a free market perspective that twitter and facebook would voluntarily adopt more transparency metrics because i think that that is how they will stay relevant going into the future and one of the ways that they won't get overtaken by a competitor because i could see that as a point of competition in the market if a social media company arises that says we have very clear and transparent um criteria for what we will and will not take down that is a competitive advantage for that company with users who will say thank thanks oh this is exactly what we've been waiting for this whole time no more arbitrary takedowns none of this kind of stuff that's exactly what we want so that gets back to kind of my my you know what i was saying as far as competition and new entrants challenging them or it might even be that a new entrant challenges them and then forces facebook and twitter to adopt more transparent rules um which i think would be a a very good thing my skepticism comes in when you say you know like the federal government should mandate that they have transparent rules um or what you know and and what does because then i have lots of questions what does transparency mean um what can i make them as and and i as a corporation would say okay i'm gonna try to make these as vague as possible if i'm being held to them legally because i'm going to want to be able to wiggle out of things later on the down on the road down the road so i i don't think that a government mandate would result in more clarity or more transparency i think that it would result in less you know i look at things like gdpr right in europe i'm sure you're familiar with that the data regulation that basically uh you know we are all now dealing with because we get a pop-up on every website that says do you accept cookies i don't think that that has made our information any more secure it just means that now their companies have us check a box every time we go to a website so that they can get out of liability so i think that you would end up in a similar situation where they would do something boilerplate in order to meet the technical requirements of the law that congress passes but i don't i think that it would get further from the spirit of what you're going for which is true transparency and i think we get that through competition in the market i hope so i hope so i mean we might just have to agree to disagree on that but it's because it has been a very good and thoughtful and and fact oriented conversation because there's just so much confusion around you know i mean if you ask you know a typical american right now it's it really is just no just get rid of section 230 and everything's fine the reality is far more complicated than that um but we we certainly have an interest in in um in improving this and and to me it certainly is about transparency and clarity of terms of use and standards by which they operate and um you know i would i would you know i i'm not as i'm not as hopeful as you are that competition will solve that um it just doesn't seem to be working it seems to be getting worse and um even with parlor and everybody moving to parlor i don't think jack dorsey cares it just i i just don't um and if and if he cares his his his board members and his um staff certainly don't care and you know and again i don't know what's inside the mind of jack dorsey maybe it's just maybe it's pressure from his employees that force them into this i don't know i don't really care i just know that it's it's not working um and we've got to be very thoughtful about how we we get to the objective that we want which is protecting the first amendment and um and i don't think we foresaw that that certain politically oriented companies would have so much control over the broader narrative that americans um absorb and that they listen to you know it's we we're always worried about the government having too much control over over what people heard and what they listen to but um there are entities that are that are arguably far more powerful than the government in this in this respect and um and they're not acting in good faith and so it's a it's a difficult problem as this conversation has noted yeah absolutely um canyon uh anything else to add yeah there's just there's just one thing i was going to mention on in you were talking about the new york post story and i think that that's a really good example of both of you know a mistake on the part of the platforms that i think that twitter probably should not have you know taken down that content in the way that it did but it is it's a it shows the difficulty of moderating and content moderation i would like to emphasize is very difficult especially when you have people in congress on on the opposite side of the aisle telling you to do the exact opposite thing with a specific instance of content where one member is telling you take it down and another is telling you leave it up um i think that they have done the best that they can in a very difficult situation um and and they make mistakes that's absolutely the case but i would i would argue that the new york post story actually um illustrates the benefit of social media because okay they they throttled it they you know limited its exposure but i still heard about it you still heard about it it's still on twitter today i can go on twitter right now and find a thousand copies of the new york post story in fact sometimes when a story gets censored it actually causes it to gain steam and get more attention i would argue that new york post story might have gotten more attention because it was censored by twitter than if it had not been censored at all it could have just quietly gone into the night but censoring it really drew attention to it and i would challenge people who think that you know reforming section 230 or eliminating section 230 will improve the situation i would challenge them to look at the mainstream media if the mainstream media had decided that that new york post story was obtained illegitimately you know in this instance via hacked materials do you think that we would be able to go on to the cnn website and find information about the new york post story no they would have scrubbed it they would have censored it they would have made sure that there was no mention of it anywhere so if anything i think that that is an illustration of consumer pressure against twitter caused them to actually host speech that they had formally censored and that's a power that we only have in social media and not in any other form of media so please let's not make uh social media more like mainstream media because i think there's a lot that we would lose yeah yeah it's a definitely a fair argument um all right canyon thanks so much for being on thanks for the thoughtful discussion on this i really appreciate it congressman likewise i really appreciate your thoughtful questions you know and so much we we can get engaged in rancor and you know talking past each other but i think that you and i have really engaged in a thoughtful conversation i appreciate that yeah it was great and and uh i think educational as well all right appreciate you being on and i think educational as well all right appreciate you being on

[Applause] hi my name is Sal Esquivel I'm a former state representative and state senator from metro area congressional district 2 is fortunate to have someone like cliff fence running for the seat first of all clip is the only person that has lived their whole life from the far eastern part of the district and understands farming and agricultural issues second cliff has an excellent knowledge of water and land use snip was always the go-to guy on these issues in the house third clip is a great grasp of how revenue is generated since he said on the revenue committee in the house for many years he also understands how it should be dispersed again he was the go-to guy forth cliff wasn't not an environmentalist but he does understand a balanced approach to these issues instead of taking out all the dams in the Klamath Falls Northern California area and this is unlike some of the candidates that are running as well fifth cliff is pro-life he's always supported President Trump supported the Supreme Court nomination of Cavanaugh and again that is unlike some of the candidates that are running last clip is the most honest person I have ever known cliff has never misled me is one of the most appealing virtues and that is his honesty and is comforting to all people that deal with him cliff is a man that will go to DC and do his job instead of worrying about keeping it we need more people like cliff Vince to fix the existing system in DC come this next election make sure you mark your ballot for cliff Ben's congressman District two [Applause] [Music]

the gentleman from Texas mr. Gooden is recognized for five minutes thank you madam chairwoman Thank You mr. odden for taking the time to attend today's hearing even if you haven't always felt welcome at times before presenting these questions I just wanted to highlight the significance of today's hearing and a few pressing concerns around the intent and purpose of the narrative built around today's hearing that the CRA regulations that were in place since 1995 lacked objectivity fairness transparency and consistency and they were very confusing and this is my personal take but the concerns voiced by legitimate stakeholders and the 1500 plus comments on the proposed note over the past 18 months I see your heads nodding in agreement 98% of the comments said the current regulations are confusing 94% of the comments at current regulations lack objectivity fairness and transparency and 88 percent of the comments said that current regulations lack consistency and in fact the current regulations are riddled with loopholes as we've discussed here some that even allow for CRA credit for loans to wealthy households in the LMI areas which inevitably inevitably lead to their gentrification which is something that my colleagues across the aisle have voiced some disturbance with and I agree with them so it's only natural to conclude that we actually really do need broad reform of these policies and we need it to be consistent transparent and objective and as clear as possible and I believe that that will fulfill the CRA is true intent and purpose to ultimately serve LMI households and individuals however instead of supporting your firm reforms which I think are great the majority has decided to question everything throughout the stage including their implementation and I've heard a lot of Reliance today on dissident voices earlier today you were questioned about your knowledge of the overwhelming opposition that we had here a few weeks ago you it was difficult for you to get the response out but only one republican was that that it was very partisan so we've heard about this letter that I think was sent to you by members of Congress they were all Democrats so we've seen a very partisan take on this but nonetheless you're here we're happier thank you have a few questions you mentioned that expansion of qualifying activities will encourage more capital investment lending in services and LMI rural and distressed communities and would you please expand on that so two ways we think that that works or actually three ways one you identified by not allowing people to get credit for mortgages to higher earning people in low to moderate income areas second of all is publishing the list of what qualifies so communities can look broadly in their community and say where could we get credit for CRA which would motivate a bank to take on transactions like that and then the third is at the top of the house once we look at the individual assessment areas a bank can choose to move dollars at the top of the house around once they've met a certain criteria and go out to places like Indian country or family farms or do additional small business lending outside their assessment areas we think that will populate more activity across America thank you in December you mentioned there was a lot of support for the reforms from the public as well as banks but you also stated there was strong opposition from certain groups who are those groups and why are they against these there's a long list but I I would say you know congressman Potter to try to put it into two buckets either they're on the take or they don't understand it we've spent a lot of time trying to make sure people understood it as the comments that you made objectivity transparency all those things are what you would think people would want but there are groups who are economically benefited by not having that objectivity and when there is a merger or an acquisition they show up and and basically demand money from financial institutions or not support the merger which leads to those loopholes I mentioned and I'd like to know how you've tackled the issue in your reform proposal to kind of take care of getting rid of these loopholes that people are taking advantage of well I think you do it by having objectivity because if at any point in time and if our were proficient at our goal a bank will be able to know every 90 days whether they're in compliance with CRA it's like capitals if we said to a bank we're not going to tell you until after the exam whether you pass the capital exam people would say well that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life but that's kind of what we do is CRA so well if you can look at every quarter your balance sheet and decide am I in compliance with the capital laws why can't we decide every 90 days if you're in compliance with CRA thank you I appreciate your time and I yield back to the chairwoman

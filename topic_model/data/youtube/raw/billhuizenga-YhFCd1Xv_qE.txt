Thank You mr. speaker section 1504 of the dodd-frank act was like many other provisions that were ultimately including in the sprawling law they had absolutely no relationship to the underlying cause of the financial crowd housing crisis however some of use this financial crisis to hijack federal securities law in order to push a socially motivated agenda specifically section section 1504 the dodd-frank act requires companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to annually report payments such as taxes royalties fees production entitlements and those types of things made to foreign and US federal government relating to the commercial development of minerals oils and natural gas companies subject to 68 section 1504 must report the type and total amounts of these payments made for each project as well as the type and of payments made to each government these payments cover as I said taxes and other things that are really business expenses while this may be a laudable goal using federal securities law and the NCC to enforce social issues is inconsistent with the FCC's core mission and completely inappropriate just to remind everyone the FCC's mission by law is 21 protect investors to maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and 3 facilitate capital formation I would like in what they're doing by having the SEC put this rule in place it's sort of like requiring your police department to be in charge of road repair too it's just not their expertise the FCC recognize this fact and stated that section 15 or but 1504 quote appears to be designed primarily to advance u.s. foreign policy objectives not investor protection or capital formation notwithstanding the merits of the underlying policy goals and conducting more American foreign policy is not what Congress created the FCC to do in fact just moments ago the US Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson as the Secretary of State and I would suggest that we let him direct our foreign policy when with all due respect to the commissioners and the SEC staff none of them are really foreign policy experts as we debate this resolution let's be clear on what this isn't about some have tried to argue that a vote to vote vacate this this provision is a vote for corruption somehow this couldn't be further from the truth now I understand and sympathize with that with the sense and the feeling of this that this rule makes the supporters feel better about themselves but it does not solve the real world issues you know this foreign rules that has been brought up is really like comparing apples and oranges with the foreign rules that vs. this particular rule and if we allow them to rewrite this particular rule we might actually mirror what the EU and what other foreign government governments are doing so and despite the claims to the contrary HJ Res does nothing to undermine the ability of the SEC and the Justice Department to police against foreign corruption in fact both of these agencies still have at their disposal federal laws including the foreign corrupt practices at Act which prohibits bribing foreign officials general is recognized for additional terms hey mr. chairman and even without this sec extraction rule in effect fraud will still be fraud and corruption will still be corruption both will still be illegal activities that should be punished to the fullest extent of the law voting for this resolution is a vote to right the ship it's a vote to reset the regulatory process Congress needs to send this flawed legend regulation back to the SEC drawing board and instruct the FCC to get the provision right by promulgating an appropriate rule under section 1504 and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and with that I yield back gentleman yields back

welcome back to squawkbox the newly formed select committee on strategic competition between the U.S and China holding its first hearing tonight there's a high profile witness list that includes a former National Security advisor an expert in manufacturing and a Chinese human rights activist our next guest is part of that committee and also just returned from a fact-finding trip to Taiwan joining us right now as Congressman Jake uh Atkins good morning to you um hoping you can help us understand what you're hoping to find out today good morning thanks for having me on this committee is about competition and the competition is about values the Chinese Communist party does not believe in the inherent value of an individual whereas the United States was founded on self-evident truths about human and civil rights but those truths while they're self-evident are not self-actuating we've got to defend them at home and overseas and this committee's purpose is one to create shared awareness about the scope of the challenges we face with the a newly expansionist an aggressive CCP but second to put forward discrete policy recommendations that you know 70 percent of Congress can get behind that we can build a sustainable bipartisan super majority around but what is that what do you think the U.S policy and economic goal should be here and and let me put it in sort of a context given that we're uh we always talk about business on this show if you're a Starbucks if you're a Nike um name your company that's or a Tesla that does enormous business in China what should you be thinking right now what should you be doing I think it's helpful to do a discreet example here I just returned from Taiwan as you mentioned where semiconductors was the focus of many of my conversations and we are in a moment of critical competition around semiconductor manufacturing the United States leaves the world in chip design but not in chip manufacturing where Taiwan and and South Korea are preeminent and through the chips and science act we're making Investments to ensure that the United States can not only design but also build its own chips now how does that relate to China China on the lagging edge of semiconductor design and Manufacturing the 20 to 28 nanometer chips is looking to flood the market and the reason that's a problem is that those are the chips that are critical from military and Industrial applications and if they flood the market and put out a business western or East Asian foundries China could have a choke point over the chips that are integral to a military and Industrial applications everything from white goods in your kitchen to Hypersonic missiles that kind of leverage that the CCP could have over the rest of the world is unacceptable it's unacceptable in semiconductors and we're going to be looking at different sectors where they might have those choke points okay so let's let's stipulate or let's just suggest okay you're right and then this may be uh the future that we're or at least a challenge ahead again I go back to the question of all these U.S businesses that are doing business in China Apple among them um what are they supposed to be doing do you see a day or a moment that looks to you like you know what happened frankly in Russia when you know Starbucks and McDonald's and every other American company literally closed up shop and said we got to go home now given the intertwined nature of our economies with China yeah yeah China's 10 times bigger and more integrated than the Russian economy is hear that loud and clear but to your question diversify this is not a a strategy that's going to rely on protectionism I do not think that we want American Business to retrench behind the two oceans what I do think though is that American Business uh needs to be diversifying Supply chains the United States needs to engage with the global South with Latin America with sub-Saharan Africa with southeast Asia we've got to be building strong ties of trade investment and information exchange that creates Diversified resilient Supply chains that helps contain Chinese Communist party and ensures they do not have leverage over us on critical choke points um you and tick tock no uh you got kids are they on Tick Tock sorry did you say should I no I said are you asking I I was asking if you're on Tick Tock I for better or worse than on Tick Tock I have I have kids they all want to be on Tick Tock and I was sort of curious what you think should happen I'm looking at that right now I've got deep concerns about Tick Tock in a number of fronts one of course is their ties to the CCP and and the data sharing they're doing there but two and maybe even more importantly to me is a father of young kids is the effects on on children's socio-emotional development from tick tocks algorithms and the way that they really try to hook kids and monetize their attention spans I think all social media companies Tick Tock included need to be on the hot seat in front of Congress do you feel differently about Tick Tock than you do for example I have the same you know the same problems that you're talking about with Tick Tock which I have as well because I've got kids I've got with you know YouTube uh you know they they figured out the algorithm pretty well you could look at Instagram Etc I've got a problem with any social media platform that looks to monetize children's attention spans that age range of 8 to 18 is highly vulnerable for cognitive development for socio-emotional well-being and these platforms do not have our kids well-being at heart I've got a unique concern about Tick Tock because of their role on disinformation in Taiwan the CCP is using Tick Tock to sow disinformation and erode morale particularly within Taiwanese youth about their ability to withstand Chinese aggression final question and maybe to start where we began you just got back from Taiwan if you're if you're a betting person I don't know if you are or not five years from now do you believe that China is going to try to take over Taiwan I think the more likely scenario in the near term is not an amphibious Invasion although of course I don't fully discount that I think a more likely scenario is a combination of an energy blockade plus a disinformation campaign you could see a situation where the pla Navy tries to blockade energy Imports to Taiwan they only have about two to three weeks of reserves and while doing so launches a sustained and pervasive disinformation and influence campaign through traditional and social media channels to try to erode Civic confidence on the island and replace the government that to me that one-two punch of energy plus disinformation is a highly viable and concerning threat we got to go I'm getting uh I'm getting called but I do have to ask you this uh U.S government obviously subsidizing chip makers but now saying we're only subsidizing those chip makers if you provide child care uh and some other social benefits given the National Security concerns that you have is that square yes Child Care is infrastructure and we need to uh be holding companies to account to provide it if they're taking taxpayer dollars irrespective of the now security issues you just raised total corporatism there you you uh you criticize China that's that's like the same kind of I don't know that you don't think that's a bridge too far and you can't just say Child Care is infrastructure that's not what people think of uh as infrastructure Jake you know that no I I disagree actually if you come talk to my constituents what they need to be productive workers is child care I know we could we could use things across the board but just calling it infrastructure doesn't all of a sudden you can do entitlement um you know it's an entitlement Congressman I want to thank you for joining us uh I know we ran along hope to get you back on the program we can talk more about this soon thank you coming up Bob Iger

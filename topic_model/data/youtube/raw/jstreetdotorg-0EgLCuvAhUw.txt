Vasil here Salam alaikum first of all Thank You J Street for hosting us as a civil society and shining a spotlight on those working every day on the ground to transform the israeli-palestinian conflict a special thank you to the women Leadership Forum for their ongoing support of inclusive feminist political activism my name is huggabug club and I'm the Regional Director of the Alliance for Middle East peace and to those who don't know all map it's an network of over 100 groups working every day in every sector of the society to break out the vicious cycle that separates us and rehumanize the lost generation of the past 20 years today the Alliance for Middle East peace has three flag ship efforts first advocate for the and make visible the efforts of the civil society and remove the barriers to the funding of our efforts to establish an International Fund for israeli-palestinian peace just remember that that will provide not only millions of dollars to expand and scale the people-to-people world but will create a formal structure for achieving peace on ground where politics has failed finally and the mission that is closest to my heart as the regional director of the Alliance for Middle East peace is to support all of our members until we rise as the undeniable voice and collective civil society movement for peace as well as being the regional director of all may I stand here tonight as a proud liberated free Palestinian woman and it's not coming from vacuum I've seen the power of my father taking leaps of faith in humanity in a situation where his house was taking over by Israeli soldier engaging them in an attempt to create a human connection as an equal I heard for years a story of my grandfather taking a road trip with his Jewish Palestinian neighbor and his Christian Palestinian colleague to Haifa Beirut Damascus and a man then back to heaven when I was not allowed to leave Hebron or Palestine freely I was raised by a socialist mom who refused to teach in Saudi Arabia and that's a big deal while women are not free I also was raised by two strong grandmothers who challenged political and social realities to secure quality education for their daughters firmly believing that this will contribute to the liberation of the people of Palestine thank you I read books in dark nights by candlelight I still do that to educate myself about a world that is truly free and supports justice for all I cried all night hugging for the first time the Palestinian flag that I was not allowed to embrace as part of my identity I watched a cousin with special needs leave his house to buy cigarettes ending up with 18 bullets in his body left bleeding for hours to his death in a town under 24-hour military curfew I heard my cousin's cry out when their father was arrested in the middle of the night I myself have escaped life-threatening situation time and time again while trying to get my to my school or to take my mom to the hospital yet I found 28 reasons not to give up on peace my 28 nieces and nephews that I am blessed to have they are the reason why I get up every morning and find a reason to crash to cross the checkpoint to seek partners for peace on the other side of the Green Line I simply want to do my best [Applause] [Music] I simply wanted to take responsibility and do my best so they don't have to go through what I have gone through to survive and maintain my humanity because that's what's on stake though many can't see past of the media's perverted image of the humans the holy people who live in the holy land I see hope daily in the midst of darkness why I see thousands of Palestinians using self-restraint while crossing humilating and dehumanizing checkpoints to get to work in Israel each one of them has a reason to be angry and hateful yet do not give an end for those who seek a Gandhi in Palestine I see hope in Israelis who break the law to come and stand for justice in south hills of Hebron yes I see it in Palestinians and Israelis with whom I work who seek an honest open dialogue internally to sort out the emotional mental and political walls that prevent them from reaching their utmost potential as free liberated human beings I see Palestinian and Israeli bereaved mothers who transcend over pain to build a stronger front against war hate and violence if Palestinians and Israelis who witness death and loss on a daily basis can melt down walls of oppressive systems and still manage to keep their human dignity then the world has to step up its game to left them rather than fail them once again yes we live in a leaderless world not just in her region by the way but across the world should we give give up on people should we of course not we the people find ways to liberate ourselves from fear hate and anger free people know how to create a reason to live and let others to live free people know how to reconcile and coexist how long must we wait for the right time to give the people of Palestine and Israel a chance to claim their liberty and humanity I think the time is now and in such in the darkest moments ever now is the time for feminist inclusive political activism championed by girls of creativity for peace and women of women which piece now the time is to tap into the human potential that lies within the graduates of dozens of peace building programs left alone creep creating a critical mass that live and act in support of freedom dignity justice and peace now is the time to scale our efforts to move beyond the belief that our work just is just a nice afterthought it's not we're nice bye though you are very nice but we are in the business of creating resilience and that's not to be taken for granted come come we have to create communities in which our heroes are not will not have medals of death but champions of life I am here I am here to tell you to hold on to our hope on to hold on to your hope in us please do because we don't have the luxury of losing hope that's not something that we can afford in a conflict zone our path may be just a narrow bridge but we shall not fear we shall not fear our deep commitment to him humanity and justice is confirmed daily by women and men who refused to be victims and refused to be enemies we're not each other's victims were not each other's enemies I invite you and implore you to join the children of Jerusalem who stayed loudly and clearly clearly and proudly that peace begins with me as a child born in Jerusalem raised up our community our voices our stories and become part of will love us and be partners to us and finally to the Jewish American community it's time for you to follow the steps of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and March for justice and peace with today Martin Luther King's thank you and Salaam [Applause]

hello everyone this is congressman dan muser i like you was very disappointed in president biden's speech last night what was supposed to be a state of the union was a state of denial the american people had hoped that the president would reverse course from his failed far-left agenda instead we heard a speech completely devoid of reality that touted and fabricated victories in the last 14 months our country has been weakened by every measure and the american dream is diminishing because of self-inflicted policies that can easily be reversed americans public safety is at risk crime is surging and our border is overrun by illegal immigrants and illegal drugs labor shortages supply chain disruptions inflation and the threat of more taxes are stifling economic growth and contributing to growing trade deficits americans individual liberties have been threatened they have been forced to deal with overreaching mandates attacks on our free speech and limitations on our personal privacies energy prices are skyrocketing because biden's policies destroyed our domestic energy independence you know president biden has shut down every domestic fossil energy initiative since he's arrived in office he's hauled to the keystone pipeline stopped oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters discouraged banks quite deliberately from investing in fossil energy projects and as recently as last week paul's new oil and gas drilling permits we didn't see too much about that in the newspapers this anti-american energy policy was detrimental for the us skyrocketing gasoline prices and its full impact is on display now as the west continues to rely on russian oil as putin illegally and unjustly invades ukraine president biden has sanctioned american oil and gas companies more severely than any sanction he's levied against russia this is absolutely baffling to me and i know to you while the byte administration has weakened our economic and national security russia and china have grown closer together his foreign policy is best defined as too little too late and has emboldened our adversaries and eroded the trust of our allies the world is rallying however to support the ukrainian people and their president whose courage and patriotism is inspiring when invited to to leave kiev by our by president biden he said i need bullets not a ride the u.s european union and nato have now put up a united front finally against russia that cannot waver i like to consider myself an optimist but but certainly a realist i will continue to work towards strengthening our national security and our domestic economy in spite of this continued democrat leadership which will change soon president biden and democrats need to realize the world is a serious place and it's time for us to wake up and woke down before it's too late well i appreciate uh uh everything it's an honor to continue to serve and um we're gonna work real hard we're gonna keep up the fight we're gonna keep up the faith and we certainly need to win back the house uh come uh this year come this november so thank you very much thanks for your continued support thanks for your continued friendship and i look forward to seeing you soon

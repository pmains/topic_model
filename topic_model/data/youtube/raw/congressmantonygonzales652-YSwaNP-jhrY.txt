well this is just mind-blowing my next guests are both texas lawmakers who have witnessed the crisis firsthand and urging the administration to take action joining me now are texas congressman tony gonzalez and august fluger mr gonzalez you saw this describe it for people because we can see it with our own eyes but when you are there outside of the pictures you get the full sense of the enormity of the problem yeah i represent del rio and right now in del rio it is as if a hurricane has hit that small town you know border patrol and other law enforcement agencies are doing everything they possibly can the unity that they've done that they've posed to come together to get through this crisis is unlike any other the latest updated numbers i have as of this morning are there 4 400 migrants still remaining under the bridge but there's a there's over 2 000 migrants on the mexican side of the border i mean the border patrol agents are literally saving lives just last night one of the migrants delivered a child they literally delivered a child underneath the bridge these are the type of things that are happening every single day throughout not only in del rio but other sectors as well meanwhile in el paso they uh the el paso agents caught two million dollars worth of narcotics this is a problem that is continuing to grow continuing to spiral out of control and expelling migrants that do not qualify for asylum is part of that solution but mr fluger as you heard there are many democrats who are now demanding that the administration reverse course you even had the envoy just resigned saying that it was wrong to be sending these people who don't qualify for asylum back to haiti your thoughts well it's clear that it's a crisis and president biden getting attacks from both sides of the aisle is because he can't get a handle on this situation you have a democratic mayor of del rio mr lozano who is has been crying out for help tony gonzalez is doing a great job my hometown is about two hours from there and tony's doing a great job of representing the interest in getting the story out what i saw is is just horrific on saturday fifteen thousand migrants meanwhile yesterday when asking mayorkas a very simple question is the border more secure under your leadership he said well it's neither more secure nor less secure i'm sorry we have almost 1.5 million illegal immigrants as opposed to 500 000 last year it's incredibly disastrous what's going on mr gonzalez what happens when all the border patrol has to focus on thousands of migrants there in del rio the border is actually quite long and we just do not have enough resources to cover all of it yeah there is a national security uh uh event that that is just brewing i mean you can see another 911 type event uh on the on the horizon with everything that the debacle in afghanistan coupled with a wide open border a southern border it just creates a an environment ripe for disaster for americans in the big bend sector the sector right over very remote part of the southern border agent very few agents very limited resources you know if this administration was serious about protecting the southern border they would focus on technology that's a softer one of the softer three elements that they could do to secure the border but they have done nothing it is as if there are is it as if the biden administration is waiting for another 911 to happen mr fluker what do you think happens in the next few days i mean you have the biden administration trying to save its legislative agenda on on economics and changing all of that okay so they have that bucket yeah the afghanistan continues all the americans are not out the special immigration immigrant visas are not out you have inflation concerns and then you have this crisis on the border and the only time that they actually have had for example the one in charge kamala harris speak to it was when she mistakenly said that the border patrol was whipping migrants well it's clear that they're trying to shift the narrative away from the real disaster whether it's afghanistan or our southern border our country is now less secure because of president biden where are the democrats who just two years ago went to the border and cried out for help i asked another question to secretary myokas yesterday and that is what is the number of known or suspected terrorists that have entered this country because the outgoing border patrol chief who left on his own free will wrote a letter and said that it is in record numbers the american public deserves to know that we're not going to let this administration shift the narrative away from the real disaster we are less secure because of them whether it's afghanistan or at our southern border we need the president and the vice president to go there to acknowledge that this is a problem and to defend american interest in american citizens maybe last question to you mr gonzalez with with the left now agitating you've seen the president ran as a moderate right or that's how he said he said he was a moderate not a part of the bernie wing bernie sanders wing but now you have the left asking this who do you think ends up winning his attention in this matter yeah i think the loser in all of this is the american public you know here you have the house democrats uh finally getting some of the house democrats finally getting involved in this border crisis and it's not because of the 33 abuse allegations by hhs for migrant children uh it's not by some of the other chaos you're seeing but it's racially driven you know one out of the 1.5 million migrants that have come over many of them are brown many of them have a hispanic descent coming from central and south america why was there no outrage then the loser in all of this is the american public well i know that secretary miyarchus is not the only one who works 18 hours a day trying to do its uh work i know that you two do as well we appreciate your time this morning thank you

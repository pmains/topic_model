[Music] welcome back to Face the Nation Virginia Senator Mark Warner is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and he joins us here sent her as a Democrat how do you remember 41 President Bush was a class act and I think he realized and reflecting on this program this morning American leadership is critical but that leadership needs to be both economic military but also moral leadership and I think President Bush to think about the transition from the end of the Cold War's Vice President Cheney was mentioning her his ability to deal with the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre in China or his situation with Kuwait he always knew that America's stronger with alliances and the rest of the world looked to that American leadership in all those realms as I mentioned militarily economically but also morally and I think it would be all of us as we reflect on his legacy to remember that those lessons are still important for all of us to keep in mind it sounds like you're describing a different brand of republicanism than than what you're seeing now a bit different yes I want it I want to get to your role right now on the Senate Intelligence Committee where you are the ranking member this week we heard that the president's former personal attorney Michael Kohn pled guilty to lying to Congress about a financial interest specifically a building in Moscow that the Trump Organization was seeking to build during the campaign and that was reportedly discovered after this after the special counsel came and asked your committee for a transcript of what Michael Cohen had said what does all of this signal to you well it signals one that if you lie to Congress and then I was with our Chairman chairman burr on Friday we said if you lie to Congress we're gonna go after you want to make sure that gets referred and we've made it's rare to go forward with the prosecution we've made a number of reforms but I think what it also says and is that Donald Trump is a candidate said no dealings with Russia I think if I'd been a Republican Democrat in delegate going into the summer of 2016 I think would have been a relevant fact to know that actually Donald Trump was still trying to do business with the Russian government maybe that's why he was so reluctant to say anything bad Vladimir Putin but we also know at this point is not only were this ongoing business deal but you had the president's son and his son-in-law meeting with Russians we had the president's campaign aides being aware that there were the Hillary Clinton emails we had the president's campaign chairman Paul Manafort offering the brief Russia Russian agents there seems to be all of these paths lead to ties with Russia and mr. Trump continues to deny any of that well the president is essentially saying seeking a profit is not a crime right and and separating out this allegation of collusion with Russian intelligence versus his organization's business what I what I'd say is we can debate whether it's a crime or not but he was during that period was denying any ties to Russia and I do think it would have been a relevant factor frankly for Republican delegates to know that during that time period when he was saying only good things about Vladimir Putin as a candidate for president he was still trying to do business with that very same government do you know that candidate Trump knew about the pursuit of this tower again I'm not I only know what mr. Cohen has said and clearly most of the individuals are affiliated with the Trump have led themselves into being accused of lying with the instructor to lie Michael Cohen I don't know I think that is a very relevant question that the American people need an answer to you said at the beginning of our conversation you've made a number of referrals to be clear what you're investigating here is sort of parallel to what the special counsel is doing there in terms of pursuing criminal charges potentially but we saw these two probes intersect this week when you say you've made a number of referrals are you saying you've said to the Special Counsel a number of Trump associates are lying and we have proof of it again I'm not going to go into which individuals have been referred well they referred for well if we've seen something that we feel it would be appropriate to go to the special prosecutor as chairman bair mentioned we'll make those referrals and we want to make clear that lying to Congress is a crime in the case of Michael Cohen the Special Counsel came to you is that correct we have an ongoing relationship with the special counsel we have as you said the two different approaches the special prosecutor is a criminal investigation we are a counterintelligence investigation and we've concluded obviously that Russian interfere intervened massively and we need to preclude that from happening again we're also looking into the question of whether that there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians I believe there are clear evidence that the Russians were offering information about Hillary Clinton we know that that's been documented a number of these meetings the question about whether it was full conclude collusion that is something both chairman burn and I are reserving judgment until we see all of the witnesses and we've got more folks to see a matter of other business you saw the president at this gathering of world leaders in Argentina he unveiled what is an agreement I guess in principle with Mexico and Canada for a new free trade deal he says he's gonna reject the old NAFTA and get this new one approved and in place no problem is it going to be that simple it's not going to be that simple and candidly he based I've done a full review at this point but I think he could have actually renegotiated most of this activity within the existing math dust framework but he wanted to put his own stamp on and now Congress has a right to come in and review whether it's labor whether its environmental whether the deal is actually better and I think these are all open questions and I think you've already seen pushback from folks in both sides the aisle you're not ready to say you're gonna vote for and that's dead and ready at all at this point all right senator thank you for joining us thank you we'll be right back with more Face the Nation and our

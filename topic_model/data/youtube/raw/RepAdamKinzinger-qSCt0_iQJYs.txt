MILITARY MAN, TERRY, AND HE IS JOINING US AGAIN. CONGRESSMAN WELCOME BACK TO TMZ LIVE GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. THANKS SO YOUR REACTION FIRST TO WHAT LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID. YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH HIM AND THE REASON HAS IT STOPPED SAYING THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO DO IT. I THINK WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT YOU KNOW, PUTIN IS ISOLATING HIMSELF. THE HOPE IN SOME OF THIS THESE SANCTIONS. THE SANCTIONS AGAINST THE OLIGARCHS IS THAT THE POPULATION DOES TURN ON. I DON'T KNOW IF I DON'T PUT IT QUITE THE COLORFUL WAY THAT LINDSEY GRAHAM DID THE AND THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO PLAY A B A BIT MORE PROFESSIONAL, BUT I THINK HE'S SAYING THE TRUTH, WHICH IS IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THAT SAY THERE'S A LOT OF PAIN WITH THESE SANCTIONS. WE HAVE MAYBE UPWARDS OF 9000 RUSSIAN SOLDIERS ALREADY DEAD. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH. I HEAR YOU SAYING CONGRESSMAN AND LIKE, HARVEY SAID, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT THIS BUT FIRST SENATOR SAY THAT SENATOR TO SAY OUT LOUD OH, WHAT IS THAT ? WHAT MESSAGE? DOES THAT SEND TO THE REST OF THE WORLD? WHAT IF UH, VLADIMIR PUTIN WENT ON AND SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDEN. YEAH, I THINK THAT'S THE POINT. AND I THINK AGAIN, AND THAT'S WHY I SAID MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT WAY. I THINK IF YOU CAN KIND OF WALK AROUND THE OBVIOUS AND SAY, LOOK, THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE NEED TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE VLADIMIR PUTIN IS NOT GOING TO BE STOPPED BY HIS WELL. THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT. IT'S KIND OF TURNABOUT IS FAIR PLAY, AND THERE'S NO OBVIOUSLY REAL RISK TODAY. IT'S NOT JANUARY SIX. AND UH, YOU KNOW, DEPOSING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US. WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THAT THERE IS AN OFFERING THAT OFF RAMP EXISTS WHEN THEY DECIDE THAT THE INVASION OF UKRAINE IS COSTING THEM WHEN MORE THAN ANY BENEFIT. THE PROBLEM IS VLADIMIR PUTIN FOR 20 YEARS HAS MADE IT CLEAR THIS IS WHAT HE WANTS, AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER DETER HIM AND I FEAR THAT, AS YOU KNOW, WE THINK IT'S BAD TODAY. YOU WAIT TILL HE TURNS WHICH I PRAY HE DOESN'T GET A CHANCE TO. BUT HE TURNS KEY THAN WHAT HE'S DONE. AND ALEPPO, FOR INSTANCE, IN SYRIA, THE WORLD'S GOING TO BE A GAS BEYOND WHAT WE ARE. EVEN TODAY, I HEAR EVERYTHING YOU'VE JUST SAID. AND IT MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE, BUT, UM, YOU KNOW, YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING IT WHAT LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID COULD HAVE BEEN DONE MORE SUBTLY. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU STILL EMBRACE THE MESSAGE, WHICH IS THAT MAYBE THE ONLY WAY OF STOPPING THIS GUY IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE EMBRACING THAT AND NOT NECESSARILY THE WAY IT WAS DELIVERED. YEAH I THINK WHY ARE WE TARGETING THE OLIGARCHS? YOU KNOW THE BECAUSE THE OLIGARCHS BEYOND JUST THE MORAL THING, THEY STEAL MONEY. THEY ARE THE ONES HOLDING THE MONEY FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. THEY'RE THE ONES KEEPING HIM IN POWER. THERE'S AN UNHOLY ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE OLIGARCHS AND VLADIMIR PUTIN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY, YOU KNOW, NOT NECESSARILY ASSASSINATION. BUT IF THE OLIGARCHS GET TOGETHER AND DETERMINE THEY WANT A NEW LEADER. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN AND WHAT I FEAR IS MORE AND MORE DEAD PEOPLE. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN A MOMENT. WHERE EVERY CHOICE WE MAKE EVERY DECISION WE MAKE IS GOING TO HAVE RISK AND THAT'S NEW FOR US THAT HASN'T REALLY EXISTED SINCE THE COLD WAR. BUT WERE THERE. THAT'S THE MOMENT WE'RE IN. WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT WHAT LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID. IS THAT YOU EXPECT OBVIOUSLY DEMOCRATS TO GO AFTER HIM. BUT PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN PARTY HAVE GONE AFTER HIM. WHAT YOU JUST SAID. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM OTHER REPUBLICANS THAT LOOK, WE AGREE, BUT HEY, LINDSAY, YOU KNOW, PIPE DOWN OR SAY IT. DIFFERENTLY. UMT LIKE YOU KNOW, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A RIFT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND SLIGHTLY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE LASTING. I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FEELING THAT I MEAN, ORGANICALLY . WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPING VLADIMIR PUTIN SOMEHOW IS NO LONGER PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA AGAIN WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE WITH OUR WORDS BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN MORALE IS SUPER LOW RIGHT NOW, THE ONE THING WE DON'T WANT IT. IS GIVE AMMUNITION TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AROUND AROUND SOMETHING. AND YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH I'VE SAID THAT WE NEED TO KNOW FLIES IN UKRAINE , I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THAT COMES WITH REAL RISK. I JUST FEAR ULTIMATELY, AND WE'RE GOING TO BE IN A POSITION TO HAVE TO DO IT ANYWAY. RIGHT NOW. THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE THE UKRAINIANS HAVE. BESIDES FRANKLY, PROBABLY BETTER INTEL PROVIDED BY THE WEST. UH THEY HAVE THE FIGHTING SPIRIT. THEY HAVE THE WILL TO DEFEND THEIR HOMELAND. AND I THINK YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT CAN LAST. I CERTAINLY HOPE IT CAN LAST FOREVER. BUT THAT'S THE MOMENT WE'RE IN IT WITHIN THE PARTIES. LOOK, I LOVE WHEN SOMEBODY IN THEIR OWN PARTY TAKES ON OTHERS IN THEIR OWN PARTY, BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE NEED TO BE INDEPENDENT AND HOW THEY THINK ABOUT STUFF. I THINK LINDSEY GRAHAM BELIEVES WHAT HE DID WAS RIGHT AND I RESPECT THAT. AND I BELIEVE PEOPLE TAKING HIM ON OUR GOOD. I RESPECT THAT BECAUSE WE CAN NO LONGER BE PARTY DRONES ANYMORE BECAUSE PARTY DRONES IS WHAT'S GOTTEN US TO THE KIND OF PROBLEM IN OUR DEMOCRACY THAT WE HAVE WHEN YOU HAVE ONE TERRIBLE MAN. LIKE YOU KNOW, DONALD TRUMP COME UP AND TELL EVERYBODY THAT THEY HAVE TO THROW OUT REALITY AND START BELIEVING WHATEVER HE BELIEVES, INCLUDING. WE SHOULD HOLD BACK WEAPONS FROM UKRAINE SO THAT I CAN GET DIRT ON POLITICAL OPPONENT. YEAH A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT THEY FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IS OFF WITH PUTIN. I WANT TO TRY A THEORY ON YOU, AND THIS IS JUST BY WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON. YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT THAT LONG TABLE WHERE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE NEAR ANYBODY WHEN HE HAS MEETINGS DURING COVID. IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE HE HAS BECOME PARANOID OVER COVID THAT HE'S SO AFRAID OF INTERACTING WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT IT SEEPED INTO HIS PSYCHE WHERE HE'S JUST A PARANOID HUMAN BEING ALL AROUND NOW, AND IT MAY HAVE EMANATED FROM WHAT IS THIS BIZARRE CONDUCT? WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S JUST TRYING TO STAY A MILE AWAY FROM EVERYBODY. I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE. I MEAN, I THINK, IN THE END THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. HE HAS JUST BECOME SO INSULATED AS A DICTATOR. HE DOESN'T LIKE PEOPLE TELLING THEM NO. AND PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO TELL HIM. NO YOU SAW THAT, FRANKLY, TOWARDS THE END WITH ADOLF HITLER AND OTHER LEADERS LIKE THAT, UNQUOTE, UM, WHERE THEY JUST BECOME INSULATED. THEY DON'T GET TRUTH. BUT I ALSO THINK IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE. I MEAN, COVID AT A MENTAL IMPACT ON A LOT OF AMERICANS, AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS WOULD AFFECT HIM. AND NOW YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T TRUST ANYBODY. HE KNOWS THIS WILL BE UNPOPULAR IN RUSSIA . THERE'S RUMORS OF MARTIAL LAW COMING IN RUSSIA, AND HE PROBABLY HAS EVERY REASON TO BE PARANOID, BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY REALLY IMPORTANT DECISION MAKING. AND THE THING I DO FEAR ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS HE'S A STUDENT OF HISTORY. HE WANTS TO BE REMEMBER, AND HE'S NOT GOING TO LET ANYTHING. STOP HIM. WELL, LOOK GODSPEED TO YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN CONGRESS BECAUSE WE SOMEHOW GOT TO FIGURE OUT TO GET OUT OF THIS MESS. WE'RE GOING TO END ON A HAPPY NOTE. THE LAST WE SPOKE, YOUR WIFE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH. I UNDERSTAND. SHE HAS SO CONGRATULATIONS. HOW'S EVERYBODY ? GREAT IT'S HIS NAME IS CHRISTIAN ADAM KINZINGER. HE IS SIX WEEKS OLD NOW AND HE'S AWESOME. I LOVE IT. IT'S GREAT, FANTASTIC, GREAT, LIKE ENDING ON THAT NOTE, SO CONGRATS. CO

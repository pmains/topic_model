senator great to have you here uh this evening you hear the desperation in these people's voices what would you say to them tonight you know without question this virus has been devastating to so many families you know kelly and i lost a good friend today and we're grieving from them and our prayers go out to their family but the thing is is we ought to at least still use logic to try to figure out how we stop this i think ultimately the vaccine will be very successful but i don't see any evidence that crowd control hand washing standing six feet apart all these things they tell you to do closing down the restaurants closing down the schools there's no real evidence that they're changing the trajectory of the disease if you look at the incidence of covid it's going up like this it's going up exponentially despite all the mandates so those who say they're a science just aren't paying attention to it look this isn't a lack of compassion i want people to get you know the vaccine i want them to be able to avoid this scourge but at the same time keeping all our kids home isn't changing the course of this disease they've studied this in four different country-wide studies they've studied the incidence of the disease they've studied the transference of the disease and they've found that closing schools doesn't work even the socialist de blasio is now opening schools so now we have our governor and our state closing schools right about the time that everybody else is finally accepting that closing schools isn't working yeah i want to ask you a little bit more about that in a moment but i do want to ask you about the stimulus uh because you know that is obviously such a painful part of this as well just the financial burden as you heard from angela marsden and the others in that video uh there's 455 billion dollars of the already allocated stimulus that has gone unspent i know you have concerns about that and also about some of where this money has gone i think the most important thing is if you want to get people back to work you can't pay them more not to work than they get for working right now there's about three and a half million jobs that would be filled immediately if you weren't paying people more not to work so it's sort of this big heart small brain syndrome people say i want to give people money they're out of work but if you give them more than they normally made by working they'll continue they you institutionalize unemployment so it's a big mistake to continue unemployment above the normal level what i would have done all along throughout this is i would have extended unemployment but i wouldn't have given additional money to those unemployed because it serves as a disincentive to people getting back to work so more stimulus is just more borrowed money and not good for the country right now you look at grow the the the gdp for the last quarter going up at 11 you look at unemployment at six percent i saw a statistic today that said we had growth numbers in the job numbers this last set of job numbers private job numbers that were better than 95 out of 96 months of president obama's term so we really should be looking at this in a rational way and not saying oh let's just print more money and borrow more money we're getting out of this and as soon as we get the vaccine we're going to get out of this in a rapid fashion and all i would say to government officials is let's get the vaccine out as soon as we can yeah i mean let's hope uh because as you say you lost someone there are people all across this country who have lost people that they love it's a serious disease i keep going back in my mind to what you said in the beginning you see that line that's going straight up and you see across the country everywhere i go people wear masks more now than they ever did in the earlier stages of this and you know it just raises the big curious question about how much we still don't know about this this awful virus doctor and senator um and i think one of the things that you know the supreme court got right when they made the ruling right before thanksgiving they said even during a pandemic the constitution isn't to be put away and forgotten you know the first amendment and the thing is is it's not that i'm telling everyone to go to church i think there are some people in our society where there are dangers to go and sit in church for two hours if you're in your mid 80s and you're listening to this i'm not recommending it but i'm also telling you that the government shouldn't tell you you can't go to church and the government shouldn't tell you can't send your kids to a religious school doesn't mean it's always advisable with schooling i think it is opening the schools is advisable and the government governor bashir and my state interfering with this is an interference of the first amendment i think the supreme court is going to strike him down very quickly or they're going to send it back and say hey look we already ruled on this just at thanksgiving that you can't infringe the first amendment but there's good advice and you can take advice and you can give advice but once you mandate it it doesn't become advice it becomes a form of tyranny so i think the government should not be in the form of mandating these things because sometimes the science isn't clear and sometimes they change their mind on the science month to month and week to week uh javier barcera his selection as the head of health and human services what do you think about that senator you know i'm concerned about the reports that say that he's been a champion for late term abortion and at the time of birth abortion and that's outside the norm even pro-choice people a lot of times will say they believe in some restrictions but to believe in sort of complete unlimited abortion to the time of birth or after i think is something that's a very radical position and i would hate to have him in charge of trying to dispense government monies towards that kind of policy so we'll look long and hard and i'll try to keep an open mind but my first impression of what i'm hearing about him is that he may be way outside the mainstream of what anybody in kentucky would think is right you know just back for a moment um to the to the loss of learning in schools very interesting piece today in the washington post a lost generation is the title surge of research reveals that students are sliding backward the most vulnerable are the worst affected you know i think we're going to be feeling the pains of this in our society for a very very long time all of these kids at home in front of computers if they're lucky enough to have one it's devastating what's this education gap and there's always been an education gap out there based on poverty and lack of education among the parents but now it's compounded because the kids had a chance they had an escape they got to go to a school and some of them discovered though the wonders of learning and some of them went on to be a phds and scientists they're not going to get that if they're at home and they're in a dysfunctional place where their parents are not capable of teaching them so really this this should be a strong message to teachers that we appreciate you and we think you do a good job but instead so many of the teachers unions have reacted and said hey no not me but the evidence is teachers are not dying from this kids are not transmitted to them yeah that's good it isn't an increased danger it's good news and it should be embraced as such um we're in a second i'm going to talk to the surgeon general about the vaccines and other issues but before i let you go i want to ask you your thoughts there was a debate last night between senator lefler and raphael warnock the reverend in georgia your thoughts on this very important race coming up you know i watched the entire debate and i came away thinking my goodness that rafael warnock must be a radical liberal but uh that point uh aside i think there was a distinction and he really can't escape all of his past statements about either defunding the police or that you know you can't serve god in the military and i i think these are statements that do put him out of the mainstream and i think you know i i met my wife in georgia i worked as an er doctor in georgia i know what georgians are like and i just don't know if they're going to want somebody so far out the mainstream somebody who actually has used the bible to justify abortion i don't know what part of bible that he's reading but a lot of that is really outside the mainstream of people who live in georgia senator paul thank you always good to see you

now from Committee Member January assist Committee Member Adam kinzinger Congressman thank you for joining us this morning since you all subpoenaed for more announced you were going to subpoena former president Trump uh this week we saw his first response on Truth social what did you make of it he didn't say whether or not he testify well I mean it was 14 pages of kind of every it seems like every statement the former president does now is increasingly long and even more rambling so I don't know I couldn't glean whatever he got from that what I know is this is we made a decision and in front of the American people uh you know not behind closed doors to uh to begin that process of subpoena and the former president he's required by law to come in and uh he can ramble and push back all he wants that's the requirement for uh Congressional subpoena to come in there have been some suggestions that he may be willing according to Associates to testify live before the committee is that something that's acceptable to you well again I think that's going to be a negotiation I have long learned in this that uh people will say something publicly uh you know look at the former secret service members who claim that Cassidy Hutchison was lying when she obviously was not about you know overhearing that conversation of what happened in the limo they claimed they'd come in and speak to us they won't do it they have yet to come in so I'll only address that when we know for sure whether or not uh the president has tried to push to come in and talk to us live you say he's obligated by a law to respond to the subpoena do you believe that the justice department if the president refuses should hold him in criminal contempt look that's a that's a bridge we cross if we have to get there um you know look we well recognize the fact that uh because of the committee only being able to exist till the end of this Congressional year because that was the uh the Mandate uh we're at a bit of a time limit here and uh as we're wrapping up the investigation we're also pursuing new leads and facts and we're we want to speak to the president look if he's made it clear he has nothing to hide is what he says so he should come in on the day we ask him to come into if he pushes off beyond that we'll figure out what to do next granted that you know this is not an unprecedented move by Congress but it's also we recognize this is a big deal this is a big move uh but the Amer this isn't about us it's about the American people George look what happened on January 6 was terrible what led up to that and what happened since is what I'm more worried about and democracies are not defined by those bad days but how we come back from those bad days this is that process this is laying out before the American people what happened and determine we can never do this again President Biden said yesterday the committee made an overwhelming case should we be expecting a criminal referral look again I I think the question of criminal referral really it doesn't have much of a point because obviously doj is moving forward on this anyway it's not a mandate but I think it would be and we're certainly going to address that issue and and we'll have more to come on that when we when we make that decision but regardless it looks like doj has already begun this investigation I take a lot of pride in two things number one our mandate is to tell the American people the truth come up with fixes I know that my kid and I know that you know the craziest conspiracy theories kid in 10 years is going to believe that it was Donald Trump that started January 6th so all these conspiracies today will go away largely because of the work we've done I also know that the justice department appears to be pursuing this pretty hard you say they will go away but you've got an overwhelming number of Republican candidates for offices across the country this year how Senate secretaries of State who are amplifying former president Trump's lies about the election last election basically election denieders so the threat is continuing isn't it it is it certainly isn't look I don't think this is just going to go away organically this is going to take the American people really standing up and making the decision the truth matters it's why I started my organization country first which is country1st.com to say I look I don't care if you're a Republican or Democrat because the battle right now is truth and the battle is the preservation of democracy and uh look with these deniers out there that can't even agree on basic facts or will lie to the American people or people like Kevin McCarthy who've been put in a very important position that refuses to tell the truth because that's much harder or that's much easier to just lie than to tell the truth and still try to win the speakership this is the fight and uh I would love to say this was going to happen easily it's going to take everybody's work out there working hard because I don't think you want to leave your kids a country off like what we've been living in in terms of how divided it is as you said the clock is ticking on the committee what should we expect next well right now look it's it's putting those facts together putting together in more of debt in in a deeper kind of way exactly what we know for instance the last hearing I did before this last one we it was about an hour and a half long that could have been about a four hour hearing so you'll see more of those details we'll start to work on recommendations and uh and then again we put out that report and really the torch has been passed yes to doj but also to the American people because we're saying here's what the deal is now it's up to you to stop this from a happening again and really take control as a self-governing country what kind of a country do you want to live in this is this is not acceptable how we've been doing it we can do way better Adam kinziger thanks very much yeah you bet

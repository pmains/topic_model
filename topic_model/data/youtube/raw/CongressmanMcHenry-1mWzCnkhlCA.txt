Thanks reclaiming my time that both seconds left in June of 23 well let me start this way is is a panel familiar with the the disparate impact regs put forward by the by HUD earlier this year okay some of you are familiar with mr. Calhoun are you supportive of the regs as HUD has promulgated them yes okay all right so I'm but in June of this year a group of industry trade organizations representing the mortgage industry sent a letter to the director Cordray the CFPB and secretary Donovan highlighting the regulatory conflicts that would result of CFPB's qm regs on one hand and HUDs disparate impact rules promulgated early this year under the Fair Housing Act and the letter states these and other rules implementing dodd-frank including those governing ability to repay and risk retention will tighten credit standards through facially neutral requirements that may lead to disparate outcomes for some category of borrowers it goes on to claim that this lack of guidance will create uncertainty resulting in higher prices to account for risk and less available credit for consumers so mr. Callen do you believe that that this regulatory impact could have a negative impact on consumers on one hand disparate impact standards and on the other qm and in perhaps restrict mortgage lending unnecessarily and result in suits no for two reasons historically lenders who chose not to do subprime lending obviously that had a disparate impact since half of all African American loans for subprime there were no actions private our public brought against them for that decision and we've already had responses from the regulator's saying that lenders choice of just doing qm loans will not be used against them in a disparate impact situation for that analysis okay now it has mr. Emerson as your industry received assurances from the government they're not going to pursue suits if you follow the box of QM but disparate impact suits so to get to that point I mean obviously I think our industry in the NBA sterling supports the Fair Housing Act but what we've now come in context with is the the CFPB and some regulars would come out and said what mr. Calhoun indicated but what we haven't heard we have not heard from hug and we have not heard from the DOJ and HUD is the per the group that promulgated that that rule and the DOJ enforces that and I think when you're thinking about the industry and where the lenders have been in the industry and what they've what's taken place through repurchase processes as well as oh I g dl j actions i think there's a lot of nervousness around that by not hearing from those two groups so some guidance from those two groups would be tremendously helpful for the industry to know exactly where they stand on the disparate income issue mr. Callen do you do you agree I see you not agree that that additional guidance would be helpful okay certainly certainly and in you know I'm certainly appreciate your organization mr. Calhoun's support for dealing with the added pressure of litigation as a result of QM does that follow the strict QM standards they will not be pursued and I certainly appreciate that i know we have disagreements on the final construct and the impact it will have the marketplace but mr. Harding's in in terms of the Community Reinvestment Act do you think it's possible for financial institutions if they're doing mortgages to meet their CRA requirements if they're only doing QMI mortgages or does it make it much more difficult maybe a wait-and-see it certainly will make it more difficult you know as you get to be a larger lender you also have to have an investment test as well as a lending test if it reduces your mortgage volume certainly there's some safe harbor percentages that if you're below that you may have to have more documentation so I believe it would make it somewhat more difficult to receive a satisfactory CRA rating okay I certainly appreciate the the witness's testimony today we obviously do have some deep concerns and this is really a deep concern not about the industry but about your ability to provide products to my constituents that desperately need them especially those that are in moderately priced homes where the question points and fees in moderate income areas especially in my district where because of the moderate income and the moderate price of the home the points and fees have such a larger percentage disproportionately to the cost of the loan and we need to make sure we work through that and with that thank you madam chairman gentleman's times

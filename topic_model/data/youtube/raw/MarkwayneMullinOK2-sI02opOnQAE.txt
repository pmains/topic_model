how about we get to two folks who actually share my frustration are actually fighting to make our government work for you first up is a freedom loving congressman mark wayne mullins and sir how are you this morning good carl but i'm sitting here laughing because you're ranting and i'm thinking man that's a guy in my heart you should be calling it your saturday morning rant because that was uh that was good because you're right you know but our federal our you know the the our founding fathers knew this and during the federalist papers when they were writing it they were talking about the importance of making sure we don't centralize government and and give dc too much power because they knew that i mean the farther you get away from the people the out of touch the out of touch they are the more out of touch or government officials become that's why we got to push this back down the local level and get it out of washington dc yeah well you know i was i want to ask you about the vaccine men's but i also want to mention this morning i tweeted out i was like hey you want to fix the problem in the swamp move every department out of dc take i don't know 100 percent yeah take the department of transportation plop them right in the middle of the i-5 los angeles traffic thing put dhs down on the southern border put the interior oh i don't know in the interior i mean this is a no-brainer right what you think but and then just keep in mind the mindset of individuals in washington dc that work at these agencies over 94 percent voted for clinton and voted for biden now that's a mindset that is obviously out of touch with the rest of america i mean they and they're regulating those individuals most of these individuals that work in these agencies have never worked in the private sector they started probably as an intern somewhere on the hill and they slowly walked their way up and then they went when they decided to leave the hill they went to an agency so they've never worked out of the beltway and they're trying to tell people that work outside the beltway how to do their job it is it is the worst way of government i've ever seen and honestly to even way the way um how to run the country i tell people all the time government is never designed to create jobs government was designed to create an atmosphere for entrepreneurs to create jobs the drug the job creators create the economy and the economy thrives at local levels not in dc you have no idea how refreshing it is to hear you say that because i had listened to bureaucrats all the time we created them you didn't create anything you didn't create anything when i ran in 2012 that there was a reason why because i remember i was in my office i just had a run in with the epa in 2011 and they had literally shut down one of my jobs because of the clean water act they had it was a long story but nothing that we did wrong they changed they changed the compliancy level and they literally shut down a company we were operating all over the country and when they um when they left my office i was i had the tv on and i was watching fox honestly and they were making a statement and actually who it was at that time was john boehner no punch of john benner because speaker boehner and i i think he's an honest man and i get along with him but he goes um he goes out there and he he says we've created we've got a job package to create 5 000 jobs i kid you not kids you're not this was the day that this happened to me and i sit there looked at it and i said no no you didn't you didn't create a single job in fact you make it more difficult for me to even be in business i fight you more than i fight my competitors yeah that's actually a great point you know it's funny before i get to this vaccine i own a farm upstate connecticut i have a tractor there so they got this new the government the government all knowing government puts this new mandate on like a 35 horsepower tractor so it's got to have all these catalytic converters and eco-friendly garbage so here's the thing congressman when i run this thing it it sucks off a bunch of the horsepower in order to filter the exhaust but then every 30 hours i have to hit this button and then put it in in region i put it in park have to put it on full throttle and leave it on full throttle and all the junk that it caught in the catalytic converters it just blows right out in this puff of black smoke for 20 minutes while it's this is the government unbelievable i'm preaching the choir though i gotta go hey listen you see what's on my shirt i'm not here i'm gonna actually have a ranch right now which by the way carl you gotta come too um but we you know we have tractors out here too and none of my guys like to run the newer tractors because they actually are less efficient than the older tractors but the all-knowing epa will save us so i got to get to the vaccine mandates now that we've solved the world's problems on nearly everything else so i'm just joining iran i love your rant i mean you know what it was just it was my wife was like you should talk about this on tv stop talking to me about it talk to everybody else so um this this vaccine mandate the senate 52 to 48 says i don't think this is a good idea to mandate putting you know putting people to in a position we have to put stuff in their body it's going to head to the house biden will probably veto it what's your take from here well this came up underneath the congressional review act cra and it was great to see manchin and tester uh both join republicans and vote against us this is like a 70 issue uh even those even those that have got vaccinated they don't think that it should be mandated now the mandate goes too far everybody i mean over 70 percent of the population believes that this is this is unconstitutional and you're going to see courts rule against that too but underneath the congressional review act it forces the hand of of of chuck schumer to make it to allow it to come to the floor on the senate side it's going to be interesting to see what happens on the uh on the house side speaker pelosi is she's all controlling and she has a a lot of tools and a lot of levers to pull to keep this from actually making to the floor so first of all i'll be surprised it makes it to the floor if it does make it to the floor i think it has a overwhelmingly good chance to pass you know you already have all 213 uh republicans that's already signed on to this uh and uh and i think there's i think there's more than five or uh democrats that know we're coming after them because we're going to beat them in their election and the more the more votes they vote like this the more opportunity we have to take back the house so in one hand i hope they don't vote for it but on for the american people i hope they do vote for it uh because without question i think we'll probably get if it comes before i bet we're over 220 yeah uh and it could be higher than that because once it breaks 218 the other ones that were kind of on the fence will probably go ahead and jump over vote for it too oh of course well i got about 10 seconds left congressman how are you people doing in oklahoma with these storms right now you know it rolled over our place last night of course storms in oklahoma that's just that's just an evening that happens all the time uh it concerns us when we start hearing all the deaths and stuff oklahoma we're a little bit more prepared for it we have the storm shelters and we have structures that are built a little different uh but uh we're doing great you know we enjoyed the rain and enjoyed the storm actually we just hated the hell because the hell came in and we were scrambling to get our vehicles parked underneath shelter but um our heart goes out to those that got hit man that just it burns it hurts my heart when i was hearing that we're over 50 plus and and the death toll is rising a lot of people's families change right here before holidays and uh we all need to be praying for them yeah tornado is like the dinner bell for you guys out in oklahoma for these for many people like in new england have a tornado i wouldn't know what to do i'd freak out oh we go out and watch it yeah exactly i mean it's crazy we're like hey if you can see it you're good to go yeah congressman mark whedon we appreciate you joining us sir thank you sir all right

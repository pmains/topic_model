so i want to go i want to go to our senior population i want to you know the people that get do get that medicine also through the mail the people get their social security checks those that do through the mail the people that depend on their correspondence with their children especially if they don't have broadband so the male is critical to their ability to live a quality life and so vic or or anybody else who want to talk about that i'd love to hear this sondra um i'm president of the arizona alliance for retired americans as you know uh seniors always vote we always vote and that's no different than my generation we vote now um 80 of the people that have died this you know since the covet has started has been senior 65 years or older so it's very scary out there and we are not only worrying about our health you know and then the president again uh started attacking our social security now he's talking about uh you know slowing down uh the postal service and the postal service is so um you know we really need that i don't know about well most um retirees i don't trust a lot of people with my money right so when i get my bills in the mail i don't you know i i send it back in the mail because i don't want people to you know i don't i want to see my what where my money's going and how i'm doing that so that is one really important thing another thing is that um we have um if a lot of us can't afford our mail you know i mean our our newspapers and a silly little thing like uh coupons with everything with our groceries going up and that a little you know 50 cents doesn't sound like very much a dollar off doesn't sound like very much that's very very important to seniors yeah good point you know i mean just little things like that and we have um our um you know our prescriptions going through the mail and that and with that i'm going to let vic tell his story okay i'm on you're on okay i'm on here we go anyway uh uh as you know i retired from the federal federal government i have my uh my primary insurance well my primary is uh is uh medicare but my secondary is through the national association of leader carriers health health care program and so any of the maintenance prescriptions that i have i have to go through the contractor with the cvs care mark well prior to mid-july uh if you would place an order uh you'd have the you'd have the prescription back within five days you know usually because it's a 90 day you you have to get a 90 day supply so uh i placed an order the uh 22nd of july and it was uh 13 business days hello hello and then i just i've just placed another order uh last week no the week before yesterday a week maybe two weeks this coming friday i have placed an order for it for an additional prescription uh so i didn't get uh you know i i got the email back saying said it would say was sent so the next day uh you know i checked i got the tracking number and it sat somewhere for four days so then finally i got an email friday saying would be delivered on saturday well it didn't show up on saturday so then it didn't show up again yesterday monday so i called the tracking thing with postal service and they finally you know it had been sitting uh at the uh processing center in phoenix since thursday so that that you know and that's a big issue i'm running starting to run low i'll you know start to uh consider calling my doctor and see if i get a local prescription because i only had like four days left of that prescription but that you know that affects a lot of seniors because most seniors when you're on long-term medications you have to you have to do a mail order and uh so without slowing it down it's just making you know it's it can be a serious issue especially like the i'll take blood pressure medication and that's definitely gonna be a serious issue so and to put a further stamp on this one um 80 to 90 percent of all of the outpatient prescriptions filled by the va are through the mail so our veterans more than anyone rely on the mail to get their prescriptions which by the way can save a lot of money in the health care system that we do get our prescriptions via via the mail that's a good thing but only if they get there on time so people can treat their conditions and pre-existing uh uh conditions uh successfully i want to ask you a question please yeah go ahead sandra i'm sorry i just wanted to tell you that i have another member that uh is uh in the military and um she gets her prescriptions through the mail and she says it usually takes 33 days it took her 13 days and it came from 10 feet so she's very upset and very worried that you know three days you're you know you're gonna um the normal you have a habit of when you're calling in your kids to know when you can get them refilled in that so going from three days to 13 days is very dangerous for seniors yeah and again this is you know the united states postal service is one of if not the most trusted brands on planet earth in terms of how they have delivered the mail successfully through weather wars you name it the mail has always come and how dare anyone whether it's for political reasons or because they don't really want to work with congress to get them the resources necessary that we're offering them to fully fund this united states postal service but how dare anyone uh put this brand this trusted brand at risk that americans have come to rely on jeff because you and so many hundreds of thousands of letter carriers that have worked before you have built this reputation i know it's got to be hurting to see that because of political stuff going on it's hurting the reputation of this so much much trusted american institution

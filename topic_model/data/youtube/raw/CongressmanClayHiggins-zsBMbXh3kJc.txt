we want citizens of every land to come to this country legally our border is wide open and out of control and Americans are dying because of it and I know secretary mayorkus is watching this or having his team of attorneys watch this good because over the course of the next year this committee is going to lay out the case against you sir if I could arrest you for violations of Louisiana revised statutes I would that was Congressman clay Higgins Republican of Louisiana house oversight committee house Homeland Security committee House Freedom caucus doing an amazing job and it's also raised some very important questions about January 6th we talked about some of them earlier uh were there FBI confidential informants dressed as Maga supporters on Capitol Hill before the mob got there question hadn't even occurred to me until Congressman Higgins raised it last year late last year Congressman clay Higgins welcome to Newsmax how are you sir thank you great good to see you sir God bless you how does it feel to be in the majority by the way uh how much more Authority how much more clout do you think you're going to really get things done you're doing your part but you got the momentum or what well we've come out to gauge strong I have to say I was visiting with colleagues today Republican colleagues and you know with 60 days in essentially and uh we're we're satisfied with the aggressive nature and the effectiveness with which we are executing our our agenda which is to reveal the truth and to perform for the American people reflective of our our commitment that we made very clearly in the commitment to America so committee service is a big part of that because there's been some incredibly nefarious actions on the part of our federal government for the last couple of years and prior uh that we intend to reveal when you talk to these government officials these Witnesses do you sense are they just totally incompetent or is this is I suspect part of a broad deep Sinister plot forgive me to destroy this country I mean it's just it's there's too much happening for this to not be on purpose no you're no you're accurate man I mean the Deep state is real it's arguably the greatest threat that our Republic faces uh we we have uh we found ourselves in a situation but allowing our government to grow ever larger and each year in significant growth of the federal government and the bureaucracies thereof and therefore these career bureaucrats find themselves in service for 20 25 you know 30 years and they're in charge and they're liberal and they have an agenda and that's to that's increase their power and they are uh they are focused on the American citizenry in a way that does not reflect the core principles of our country we we are we have been targeted by Our Own federal government and some of us are very focused on revealing that and that's exactly what we're going to do so a lot of these deep State bureaucrats they're they're polishing their retirement papers my brother we we're going to drive them we're going to drive them out of their offices and into courtrooms well the way you confronted FBI director Chris Ray and do we have time we can wrap up the segment with this well I'll just play a little bit of video uh Christopher Ray you asked him if there were FBI informants dresses Maga supporters and he is his answer was uh well he didn't answer your question it never occurred to me that they were there sir I wish you luck in getting to the bottom of that the January 6th thing is a total Scandal we're out of time unfortunately Congressman clay Higgins please come back soon thank you Greg yes sir

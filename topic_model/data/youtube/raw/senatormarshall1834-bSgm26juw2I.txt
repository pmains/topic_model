[Music] joining me right now is Kansas Senator and small business and agriculture Committee Member Roger Marshall Congressman it's great to see uh Senator rather pardon me it's good to see you this morning thanks very much for being here Senator I want to get your take on what the thinking is in terms of covid-19 because we continue to see China cover up and yet it seems that there's no blowback whatsoever from this Administration and Congress holding uh the ccp's feet to the fire this was a a mistake out of the Wuhan lab we're told we don't know if it was a biological weapon or intentional or what the story is but will there be any accountability now that four and a half million people are dead because of covid I sure hope so Marie you know we we did a timeline that takes us all the way back to September of 2019 when Dr she took a genetic lab Bank off offline and that was probably the first part of the cover-up we actually are looking at some information takes it back to August and now what we need though is all of Congress on on multiple committees to take a deep dive in this and why the Democrats don't take this serious I don't know but there's lots of evidence now that point to this virus going back to at least September of 2019 and the Chinese Communist Party covering this up yeah I know but we don't see any policy with any teeth tell me what should be done in terms of the CCP we know what the Chinese Communist party has been doing not just the the covid-19 timeline where all of the circumstantial evidence continues to show that it originated in a Wuhan lab but you're also talking about uh just missteps on the global Road bullying its neighbors in the South China Sea uh stealing intellectual property invading countries like India killing soldiers there invading Hong Kong 25 years early and throwing down the national security law will there ever be accountability for a CCP which has become much more inward than anybody expected and Communists in the last 10 years well Maria certainly uh this has turned into an economic weapon for China as you know they're the only country that benefited uh on from a dollars and cents standpoint but we think it's more than circumferential evidence we think there's a preponderance of evidence out there that would support this was leaked from the laboratory in Wuhan and most likely was made there as well and we just got to bring this to light we have to have the whole world approach to it as well I think that what we need is a full-throated hearing process where the president needs to release all the all the information that they have emails and phone calls going back to at least September of 2019. we need the Eco health system which was funded by Dr fauci and the NIH to show us their genetic sequences we need our own Nia to share with us the genetic sequences that Dr she put up there and then we took them down for some reason I think that those genetic sequences will lead us to the to the final covid-19 viruses that they are the witnesses that are still alive so we need that information we need to be able to look really closely much like if I knew your DNA and had a set of other DNA from people I could figure out who were your parents we could figure out where the parents and the cousins to covid-19 were if we could look at these DNA lab Banks yeah I like what you're saying but you got to have the cooperation of the CCP right they won't cooperate on any investigation into covid-19 and it doesn't seem like uh this President is going to force the issue or hold them accountable and by the way Senator you're talking about a coveted 19 disaster killing four and a half million people across the world you're talking about as we speak 1.3 million illegals coming into this country year to date you've got right now uh 10 000 people standing under a bridge in Del Rio Texas waiting to get apprehended try to get a massive debacle in Afghanistan 13 of our servicemen dead and yet you and your colleagues are negotiating about a green New Deal riddle me that okay Riddle Me That Batman you know that's the hypocrisy of this uh this white house it's one crisis after another created by this white house but but I do want to go back to the coveted Origins one more time there are DNA sequences that this White House can control the ecohealth system should have uh DNA that we can look at the NIH should have copies of DNA it would be much easier if China would cooperate but there is information out there that we should get at you know and to the point you're making here the hypocrisy that we have a we have a coveted vaccine mandate from this president but yet we're letting thousands of people cross the border every day 10 to 25 percent of them are positive for covid and then we're putting them in an environment into a super spreader events um you know I know back home this folks are so mad I've never seen people so mad as they are about this vaccine mandate yeah now shut it off I I think you're making so many important points and we're looking on the screen of your at your eight eight point plan in terms of pursuing the uh the truth here and we appreciate you pursuing this to get you the truth this is an important story uh equally important are these other issues I mean I'm joking about the riddle me that but this is a serious situation you you've got massive fires burning out across the country and this Administration is not acknowledging they're not acknowledging the Border they're not acknowledging the missteps in Afghanistan and yet they're saying let's change the conversation and talk about uh you know mandates for a vaccine do you think that this three and a half trillion dollar plan goes through what's the story in terms of it being tied to the infrastructure plan yeah well Maria like you pointed out earlier it's really a five and a half trillion dollar plan over 10 years and another trillion on top of that so it looks like right now to me the Democrats have formed a circular firing squad and we don't want to get in the middle of it I think we need folks like you just sharing the truth the truth of this legislation that it's Reckless spending it's Reckless taxing it's going to lead to Reckless inflation it's going to kill our economy and kill our jobs America needs to know this they have a choice do they want free enterprise capitalism or do they want socialism marxism-based economy ruled by the government so I I'm we're going to do everything we can to stop it we need Joe manchin and Kirsten Cinema to stand up strong and stop this Reckless spending yeah I mean you're on the small business committee you've got to believe that small business is going to get impacted by these significant tax increases that that they're talking about just at a time when the economy is beginning to turn you know exactly and I'm going to go back to the vaccine mandate which is killing small businesses as well we have hospitals and nursing homes desperate for for doctors and nurses right now uh this this economic plan of government control will kill small businesses uh you know the the milk of our economy yeah you you make a lot of good points because one one businessman said to me I'm having a hard enough time getting employees back to work I'm gonna have an even harder time now with this mandate on the vaccine Senator thanks for all you're doing we appreciate it and we'll be watching from covid to economics thank you sir Senator Roger Marshall joining us quick break

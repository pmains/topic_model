joining me now is congresswoman karen bass of california who supports the president's removal from office congresswoman bass welcome back to the sunday show thank you very much for being here i'm glad to see that you are safe could you briefly tell us where were you when the insurrectionists burst their way into the capitol well thank you for having me on jonathan and i was very lucky because i had just stepped away i had just finished talking to a capitol police officer who told me that the crowd was beginning to dismantle the stage but they had not come forward to the uh to the steps so i was very fortunate to have just missed it and so as i said in your introduction you support the president's removal um that you're supporting the what's presumed to be an impeachment effort that's going to start tomorrow why do you feel it is important dare say imperative that steps be taken to remove the president as soon as possible well first of all i absolutely do support it and if he had any dignity at all he would resign for for inciting such a catastrophic event but i think that every day that he is in the white house every day that he has presidential powers he is a clear and present danger to this country he has been for a very long time but he is also completely decompensating we're watching him come unglued and so what else could he do with those powers who knows we're already naming people that have been charged for their violence protect for being terrorists at the capitol is he going to come out and pardon them because he said he loves them so with the man so unstable who cannot handle the idea that he lost the election we just don't know what he's going to do over these next few days your reaction to republican members of congress trying to enlist the help of president-elect biden to stop your efforts your meeting democratic party efforts uh democratic house caucus party efforts to start impeachment proceedings in the name of unity well i think in the name of unity what they should do is all of those people that signed that letter they should get other republicans together they should go to the white house and they should do the job so that we don't need to impeach him how about doing what happened during the nixon administration where the republicans went to the white house and said it is time for you to go why don't they focus their energies there that's what they should do but one of the important reasons for the impeachment process to move forward is because we need to make sure that this man absolutely can never ever pursue public office again and one other reason i think impeachment should be pushed is because we want to make sure that this never ever happens again with another president of the united states congresswoman bass how concerned are you that that was just the beginning and not the end there have been reports that um the domestic terrorists and others are planning for coming planning to come back to washington on the 17th but also on the 20th the day of the inauguration jonathan i'm deeply concerned and frankly i was very concerned that day too but you know what i was not concerned about being in the capitol i was concerned about being on the streets of washington dc on january 6. and so the idea that the capital wasn't even safe was just absolutely shocking so i am deeply concerned but i don't think we need to act like this domestic terrorism is new i mean the week before the 2018 election there were four acts of domestic terrorism that he also incited but we seem to have forgotten that we have very short memories in this country and we cannot afford to do that moving forward i am very concerned about what is going to happen after he leaves office with this mob and one last question congresswoman bass when i interviewed congresswoman pramila jayapal of washington uh last week she raised concerns of hers that she has questions about whether what happened on wednesday was an inside job do you share those same concerns well this this is what i feel we absolutely need to do a 9 11 style commission because i could just not reconcile how this happened considering how much security there is at the police at the uh capitol and and obviously it was a catastrophic failure of the leadership and i'm glad that they're gone but why did this happen who was doing what you know i'm i'm thankful for those capital police officers that saved the lives of of the members of congress but you know i think there needs to be a complete examination i asked one capital police officer why weren't they doing mass arrests and they said well it's just too many people can you believe that i mean it's all just there needs to be an investigation on every single level members of congress staff capitol police everybody and with that we're going to have to leave it there congresswoman karen bass of california thank you very much for coming back to the sunday show thanks for having me on jonathan

thank you mr chairman thank you ranking member rogers and i appreciate our witnesses being here today i know you all are very busy so thank you for carving time out of your days for us um mrs mclean mentioned before and i want to touch on some more general um the matter of munitions specifically precision guided munitions and the testimony was discussed that there are a limited number of suppliers to for key components of those precision guided munitions those are critical assets they're in high demand what are we doing to ensure that we're going to keep these suppliers alive when it looks like our munitions budget is being cut by about 25 percent is that a concern for you and what are we addressing how are we addressing that going forward no it's i think it is a concern i mean i think we've learned a lot about uh supply chain and as you said some of these precision munitions uh take a long to they have some long lead type items that you have to purchase and that's part of our equation we take a look at so we may be buying long lead not necessarily you know we always have to be a little more finesse in these type systems we if we can't afford the entire munition we may buy the long range up front that the the long uh lead type items and go ahead and do that but we're taking we're taking a close look at that and and trying to do the best we can within the budget we have one i know for a lot of these suppliers predictability and consistency from one year to the next you know we budget in this 12-month cycle but they need to look out long-term so that you know they need to know that we're going to be there consistently by and for them to keep their their processes in place i want to touch a little bit more on um this issue we've talked a little bit regarding discrimination a couple of members have brought it up and as opening remarks uh chairman smith had addressed the issue of discrimination in the ranks and the services issues to eradicate it i think we can all agree that that's uh it's very important uh secretary warmuth you you spoke about the importance of building cohesive teams general you did as well and talking about the need for dignity and respect um you know in my experience whether it's sports teams military units businesses really the foundation of that cohesiveness i think is fundamentally comes down to trust and that trust is really built on a matter of character and competence and certainly if there's discrimination in the ranks that's going to erode at that character element i've had a i've been surprised i've had a number of constituents who are on active duty a lot of veterans but i'm placing more stock currently in the active duty folks reach out to me which is kind of surprising i never in my 26 years in the navy would have ever dreamed of going outside the chain of command to reach out to someone in congress but there's a lot of concern one in particular i i thought so much about i called this this gentleman up spoke to him at length he is a an army uh senior non-commissioned officer uh his concern is that we are sowing potentially sowing distrust among the troops and that we're kind of telling these people in a military that has civilian oversight that your leaders basically can't be trusted whether they know it or not inherently they've got bias and everything they do they do and every decision they make is viewed through a lens of race that they can't help i don't know that i necessarily agree with that but um general what what um well and he went on to say that i'm teaching these guys these folks and he's in a leadership position or training capacity these are folks that are going to have to give orders in combat they're going to have to give them and receive them and his concern is are we creating a climate of mistrust or when someone makes a decision that's in life or death moment and it may involve the death of soldiers is someone going to stop to think now is that decision is that order being given through a lens of race what what measures have you taken to help ensure that your commander's intent isn't being distorted by the time it reaches a deck plate levels i think what's really important is our approach to all these you know what some people call harmful behaviors how do you get after um sexual harassment sexual assault how do you get after you know extremist racism if there is in your organizations and i argue that's why it starts with building cohesive teams where you treat everyone digging respect and you you you you bring them together we've done a lot of you know it's interesting we had a i know we don't have a long answer but you know you go to someone that does this for a living that wrote the tribe and how you how you bring build cohesive teams for civilians well you get a small group together you take them a long hike you have them stay out overnight and that that's really good for building cohesive teams that's exactly what we do in the army is we've got to build cohesive teams we've got to trust commanders we've got to make sure as we change anything that you know commanders are the ones are going to make this happen leaders are the ones that going to make things happen happen in the army we should never forget that all right thank you general i yield back

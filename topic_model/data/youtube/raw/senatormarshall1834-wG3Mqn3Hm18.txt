want to go to senator roger marshall the kansas republican he's a physician by training sits on the senate small business committee so many other senate energy as well um senator it's always good having you and i i wanted to relay an item that shows maybe some middle ground or acceptable ground even among conservatives and and those you know second amendment advocates and and like who are saying maybe if we tighten um the restrictions around gun ownership uh libby emmons uses that in today's new york post uh conservative writer in which she says people under 21 are not allowed to buy cigarettes or alcohol and they're already rules that prevent 18 year olds from buying handguns in many states so she's saying what would be wrong with limiting these type of purchases semiotic weapons of the rest to the 21 and over crowd what do you think of that yeah well neil like you like many of your listeners i'm still mourning with the people of uvalde texas and grieving with them you know as a physician if we had a bad bad outcome uh we would try to to listen and learn from the situa situation as well so i think we need to be careful not to be yielding our political savers right now but what we can't do is to is to punish law-abiding citizens and take guns away from them in rural kansas the sheriff's officer is often 30 minutes or longer away so we do use them for our self-protection but i am listening i don't claim to have the answer i'm proud of what we've done before when when republicans were leading we worked hard to make our schools stronger harder safer and i think there's more things we could do i think that there's copic dollars left out there from those grade schools uh and in the in the middle schools high schools that they could use to make their schools even harder we did a good job improving background checks as way as well but i'm going to stand up and defend our second amendment well i i agree with you that there are far far you know good and responsible handgun owners gun owners in general than there are uh those with with mental issues and the like but it's those with mental issues that somehow in the present background setup we have don't get discovered i don't know why that is senator you know far more in this subject than i do but time and again we see people who should have been fingered who should have their name should have come up um maybe with youth violations that never made a background report because we don't put them in such reports but do you think therein lies the the potential solution to to get ahead of the possible dangerous types who could get their hands on weapons right so now certainly we do have a mental health epidemic and we're not going to fix that overnight so therefore you know how do we handle this situation i know in israel that they have technology that they're using to make their schools safer and i'm going to speak to senator cornyn about that technology to pick up through social media channels uh these people that that are uh having a mental breakdown for lack of a better word as well but we do need to improve that process these people do give signals as well but again we can't punish law abiding citizens but you would be open to to maybe looking at the wrong people getting their hands on weapons of all sorts i i'm listing as well as i can right now i know lots of kansans are reaching out and we're trying to find a good spot got it you know sir you you've got a good deal of attention not too long ago helping uh you know someone who was at the border who was suffering from heat exhaustion could you tell us a little bit about that and because you said it reminds us of some of the bigger issues here that go beyond just numbers yeah so i took a group of sheriff's officers from kansas to the border kansas is now a border state we have somebody die almost every day from fentanyl poisoning we rode with some sheriff's officers and they're the true heroes here we did encounter a person that was being human trafficked and was able to rescue her she was having heat exhaustion almost heat stroke she hadn't had water for two days and and really we gave her some simple first aid as well but these problems that we're having in texas now on the border the arizona border as well are now impacting all of us and just so proud of the office there the the officers there the efforts that they're making but this human crisis has been created by our president he needs to go see this for himself the very people he thinks he's helping he's putting them in harm's way uh just the tragedy that they're going through down there is just horrific senator thank you very much i'm sure that particular individual to say others who took advantage of your kind care appreciate that thank you again and we'll see what happens next about

if you think about this we're about two years from covid kind of coming into our world you i know are leading this bipartisan group of senators that is pushing for a 911 style covid19 commission to investigate the origins of the virus i i just here's the thing that i don't understand why don't we have this already why don't i i just don't get it we're we're talking about all of the impact that covet had on our country on the world how many people have died how we're reacting to it how much it's cost and i don't feel like that that there is this sense of urgency to find out what caused it so we don't have it again and frankly if china did cause it what we're doing to hold them accountable yeah yeah sean it's inconceivable that we don't have some type of a an investigati investigation going on with subpoena power right uh there's been like 12 or 14 investigations into january 6th but none on the origins of copen but the good news is we have bipartisan support now this is the first bipartisan support we've seen so i want to certainly thank senator feinstein and senator gillibrand and one of my good friends on the republican side joni erstrom leading this charge we do need a full-throated investigation into the origins of covet as well as our response as a nation to covet as well so i think these are first steps a 9-1-1 style commission with subpoena power and also to start declassifying some of those documents as well it just feels like there's been a cover about going on from the beginning though greed senator marshall thank you and all the members of your family for their service really appreciate it on this veterans day thank you john thanks lindsay you

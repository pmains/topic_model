they're outraged at President Obama set five leaders freeze Senator Lindsey Graham Klein the terrorists the Taliban dream team but listen to what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid just said Montano has been there far too long and I think that we should get them out of there as quick as we can we've been held up from doing that by the Republicans not wanting it any of them to be tried here in the United States even though our record here is really quite good so I'm glad to get rid of these five people sent a backdoor cutter so how does Senator Lindsey Graham respond to that he joins nice to see you sir and San majority Harry Reid says he's glad to see the five go well Harry Reid is disconnected from reality the level that I even didn't understand until he said that I wish they would have died in jail there's not one shred of evidence that letting them go was based on the fact they're no longer dangerous these people will let go for political reasons they were traded for sergeant Bergdahl the likelihood of an American citizen being kidnapped in the future by terrorist organization and light of this decision goes through the roof these people will go back to the fight as I understand the terms of the agreement they're required to stay in gutter for one year they will go right back to Afghanistan they were political and military leaders of the Taliban there's no evidence Senator Reid that these people have renounced terrorism quite the opposite there now heroes why they're going to be some classified hearings yes and I have more terrible objections I mean like these classified hearings is it you know why can't the rest of us know I can do it mean if they weren't you should have an open hearing in my view something really genuinely comes up classified then you close the doors absolutely I mean I'm so what why don't we know more about this well they're starting out in a classified setting but we'll go public I just think it's politics i think the senate democrats don't have an open hearing these are the same people and that insisted on an opening hearing when it came to detainee abuse want onam obey abuses remember abba grave in Iraq we had an open hearing we put all of our dirty laundry out there for people to see now when it comes time to this release they wanted behind closed doors that will not stand I've been a military lawyer for 31 years these people are not prisoners of war their unlawful enemy combatants member hoods a terrorist organization the war is not over when we leave Afghanistan we're fighting al-qaeda their affiliates and people who provide material support like the Taliban these people will go back to the fight President Obama has put Americans at risk all over the planet and these people will go back to Afghanistan as sure as night follows day all right Eddie no key for the Washington Post just published an article online which says that this discussion about five detainees being released goes back to 2011 with Congress yes and every time the president asked we said he'll no Panetta said no gate said no Diane Feinstein said no Lindsey Graham said no why would anybody in their right mind release the leaders of the Taliban with American blood on their hand who have sworn to go back to the fight to realign with al-qaeda to attack our country yet again and when the president says one of the principles that he follows closely is to never leave a man behind on the battlefield this is the same president who was missing in action on the night of the Benghazi attack this is the same president who never picked up a phone and intervened in Libya to try to get our rescue team out of the airport in Benghazi so they could go help the people under siege this is the same president will not account for his time during the attack of sep tember the 11 2012 so if you really that dedicated to protecting our people come clean with what you did during the Benghazi attack mr. president senator we also want to ask you about the accusation of President Obama intentionally bypass Congress to released the five Taliban prisoners back in 2008 presidential candidate Obama promised he would not bypass Congress with an executive action called signing statements here it is do you promise not to use Paris I needs to get your way yes Congress's job is to pass legislation the president can veto it or he can sign it but what George Bush has been trying to do is part of his effort to accumulate more power in the presidency is he's been saying well I can basically change what Congress passed by attaching a letter saying I don't agree with this partner I don't agree with that part I'm going to choose to interpret it this way or that way that's not part of his power but this is part of the whole theory of George Bush that he can make laws as he's going along I disagree with that I taught the Constitution for ten years I believe in the Constitution I will obey the Constitution of the United States we're not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an end run around congress center that's exactly is justification that he says it's a signing statement that gives him the power to ignore that 30-day provision well you don't have awards for hypocrisy but if you did he would win in 2014 the one thing about george w bush if he were president these guys would still be in jail they said they should be in jail everything the candidate obama complained about about he did but here's what he did he bypassed a process where the intelligence community to give input where the Congress could have a say because he wanted the result he wanted last week to be a great week we're going to pull all of our troops out by 2016 not realizing that empowers our enemies and puts our nation at risk and I got the one captive back he thought everybody would be cheering but when we see these five guys on TV it reminds every American that radical Islam is our enemy that he's let our enemy out there going to come back to killing Americans just assures we're talking about this tonight the president is disconnected from the fact that radical Islam is a threat to our way of life what his excuse is earliest were understanding is that they said it was his health at first was the emergency to avoid the Lorelei defining statement I do calls to protest guarantee you that they had made up their mind to do this in the same with the president the president that he wanted to stories about Afghanistan I got the one guy that the Taliban have have in captivity back and I'm getting all of our troops out by 2016 they consciously put these two things together it's blowing up in their face that's a serious accusation well I think it's true there is no other conclusion there is no Intel to suggest these guys were now safe to release I haven't seen any evidence at all from the intelligence community that the guy's life was threatened you we get briefings all the time about what's going on I haven't seen any information that Bergdahl's life was threatened all right was burned off this it clearly fly this week is bergdorf held by the Taliban or the hakan e network because we dealt with the Taliban yeah well the Taliban insisted that their five leaders be released so clearly we were negotiating with the Taliban I don't know who had physical custody of him but there he he was not a prisoner of war and these five people are not prisoners of war we're not fighting Afghanistan or the people of Afghanistan we're finding terrorist organizations their unlawful enemy combatants of what the president decided to do is ignore a process has been in place to keep us all safe he got the outcome he wanted he bypassed the intelligence community he bypassed the Department of Defense in terms of the risk these guys perf unlawful I think I'm wise probably unlawful but it is very minimum it stinks to high heaven he's put our nation risk what is the likelihood that other families are going to experience terrorist attacks with our loved ones being overseas now because of this decision much greater this week than it was last week senator thanks sir thank you now back to the five Taliban leaders just

thanks Sir Charles cernerman thank you Mr chairman uh chairman genzel the last time you came before the committee I asked you to move expeditiously to adopt the asset management advisory committee's recommendations on diversity and last October 22 centers including nine members of this committee sent you a letter supporting the recommendations and asking for immediate approval can you give us an update on the status of adopting these recommendations so I thank you Senator we've looked at uh there was four recommendations and there's some sub points in those recommendations and we've uh working and I think we've informed your staff about this with regard to two important ones in there one is a recommendation around guidance staff guidance on how asset managers are selected and whether their years of service or their assets under management could be uh need to be taken into consideration or not and another one is with regard to eeo complaints and how those complaints are shared with other agencies and like and I think we've made some good progress on those two I I've I feel that the staff will probably shortly be putting out that guidance and we continue to look at the other two matters well look I appreciate that you're giving us some of these recommendations serious attention but at the same time I must say I'm disappointed in so many other areas the SEC under your leadership has taken bold steps to protect consumers to strengthen oversight of markets such as your proposed climate risk disclosure rule however when presented with Amax non-controversial unanimous recommendations that would promote diversity in the Asset Management Field you haven't been as aggressive so can you commit to make concrete progress on these recommendations by the end of the year so uh Senator I take uh very seriously uh how important diversity inclusion uh Equity is important broadly in our society but to the SEC as an agency uh our senior leadership is probably the most diverse and inclusive that we've ever been as an agency we continue to lean in to try to make sure that our agency everybody can bring their best self to work and and work and that we get the benefit of of of of of the talent across this great nation and in terms of uh in terms of policy uh it's it's held up in court right now but last year uh self-regulatory organization uh NASDAQ put in place a listing requirement with regard to their Boards of directors and diversity and that was their decision not ours it predated me but uh we approved that and on these four uh uh committee recommendations as I said I think we've made some pretty good progress on two of them I think that guidance will be out in the near term and we continue to work on the others well I'd like to highlight one of amac's recommendations that I think would be particularly impactful uh the AMAC recommended that the SEC require enhanced Disclosure by investment companies and investment advisors regarding diversity within their Workforce and Leadership you and I have spoken about the importance of leadership diversity at your confirmation hearing I just heard your comments now I think that disclosures about diversity are incredibly important which is why I introduced the improving corporate governance through diversity act do you agree that enhancing diversity disclosures for advisory firms Investment Company boards and Consultants would Empower investors and fund managers to make more informed decisions again as I said I think that we benefit in our in our in in our organization at the SCC and in our great nation by tapping into the talents across this our diverse Nation um and we're continue to look at this uh recommendation of AMAC with regard to uh disclosures well one of the key findings of the AmEx study is that and then for my colleagues AMAC is is an Advisory board that is that is created uh you know under the uh I believe is the SEC so one of their findings is that quote investment performance by diverse asset managers is equal to or greater than the investment performance of firms that lack diversity and ownership and Senior leadership despite differences in size and length of track record and that's why they recommended that the SEC issue guidance clarifying that fulfillment of fiduciary duty does not require automatic exclusion version of asset managers who are new to the industry or do not meet a certain threshold of assets under management in your view is it necessary for fiduciary to automatically exclude newer or smaller asset managers in order to fulfill their Duty um uh Senator uh on that on the guidance I I share that view I think that you just said and I think that's the guidance that the staff is working on to put out and you're right the the AMAC as a federal advisory committee it's under the committee let me pause let me close by saying fundamentally using the excuse of fiduciary duty to exclude women and minority-led firms runs contrary to the actual data Amax study along with a host of other Studies by McKinsey for example and others have repeatedly shown that diversely diversely led firms outperform their non-diverse counterparts and so given this data um I think that we can agree that new or smaller asset managers being automatically excluded under the guise of fiduciary duty uh is actually not helping investors it's harming them and so that's why I've been pressing on these issues will continue uh to work uh with you we hope to have a robust response by the commission thank you Mr chairman thanks

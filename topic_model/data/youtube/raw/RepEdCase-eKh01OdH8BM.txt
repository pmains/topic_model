all right we know that a government shutdown was narrowly avoided but there were still disagreements among democrats on president biden's agenda congressman ed case joining us live now from washington d.c good morning to you congressman good morning aloha from capitol hill i know it's been a very busy week for all of you out there i want to start off by talking about that infrastructure bill that one trillion dollar one i know late last night the vote was delayed i wanted to ask you will there be a vote today and will you support this bill i completely support this bill that's been my number one focus for months now this is a bill that would be the largest infrastructure investment in our country's history it would generate about two million jobs throughout our country it means about two billion dollars to hawaii and thousands of jobs it has already passed the senate it just needs one vote in the house to go to the president it's wildly popular throughout the country because of the size of the investment and because it's an example of congress being able to do its job and so my full commitment has been uh to getting that vote on that bill as to your question um i don't know as i sit here i just came out of a caucus meeting a long and difficult one to be honest uh that there's there's there's different views on whether to proceed today or not i said in caucus we needed to proceed and vote on it today you say that this bill is popular so what is the delay why does this keep happening well some people out there in the country want to link this bill to another bill uh they they don't want this bill to pass at least until the other bill um passes or looks to have a good chance at at passage uh the so-called reconciliation bill and they're holding this up and i've said for months that i think that's exactly the wrong strategy on a number of fronts i think it's i think it's the wrong approach for the country i think we need to get this infrastructure money out um into the country and i'd love to get it to hawaii to create those jobs and and and boost our you know crumbling infrastructure and this is also about climate change there's there's there's tremendous amounts of money in here for climate resiliency for responses to climate change in hawaii and so i have not been on the same page with them congressman i just want to be really clear about this you support that one trillion dollar infrastructure bill you've been very clear on that now the second larger bill that 3.5 trillion dollar build back better bill that is something that you have been reportedly hesitant on now is that true well i haven't been hesitant on on passing a reconciliation bill that's not true there's a lot of misinformation about that out there i've always said that i supported a reconciliation bill with many many very positive uh programs i'm in it that i support uh and that i think a majority of my constituents and the country support but you know i'm focused here in congress on the practicalities of what you can actually pass in congress very very slim majorities in both the house and the senate um the other party is not going to help at all on reconciliation and so you've got to find uh the sweet spot where you can actually get everybody on the same page to pass reconciliation i happen to believe and i think that everything that's happening today proves me out and i've felt this way for a long time that it's unrealistic to talk at a 3.5 trillion dollar figure whatever you might want um and so i'm trying to get that bill done um but i think we've got to get real about what it's going to take to get it done and i do not want to wait around on on the one trillion dollar reconciliation until we figure out uh the other bill so basically to boil this down your concern is that you don't want to link these two gigantic bills together you want to get that one trillion one dollar pass by itself correct correct i don't want to link them and i think that by the way the delay on on the one trillion dollar infrastructure bill has actually hurt its chances of passage uh and and so um i've also been concerned that delay and linkage will risk um the first one which is which is ready to go so the ad campaign that we've been talking about our hawaii action is behind this now you're saying that there's no truth to this ad campaign well they disagree with me on linkage so let's start there um they're they're they're clearly attacking me on the basis of of my belief that we should pass the bipartisan uh one trillion dollar bill now uh they clearly uh feel that we should not do that and and they're you know they're frankly trying to you know leverage um that against uh 3.5 trillion which as i already said is unrealistic i'm trying to get them both done so i don't you know they can disagree with me on that we do disagree what i object to is very very specific misleading statements uh in their ad campaign um that do not reflect my record at all so that's that's a different matter to me and as a matter of fact they've already you know had to retract some of what they put in their ad campaign because i pointed out to them it was incorrect for example um they claimed that i would not be you know willing to um rescind the trump tax cuts in order to pay for some of reconciliation i mean that's patently false and i pointed it out to them and they pulled that and there's other stuff in the ad so hey i can i can i can take somebody disagreeing with me but i'm going to call it out if they're disagreeing with me unfairly or frankly deliberately misleading uh the people out there for example um they they say that i'm against um you know good paying union jobs well i think i just spoke at some length to the fact that the infrastructure bill that i want to pass now what would specifically increase the number of jobs throughout hawaii to include union jobs so there's there's a lot of spin in the ad campaign and i got to call it out so in talking about that 3.5 trillion dollar plan the second bill that we were talking about i wanted to ask you about senator manchin's proposal he says that he has a top ceiling of 1.5 trillion he wants to bring it from 3.5 to 1.5 is that something that you see being more palatable and being more able to pass through congress well you know i think i think it's pretty obvious at this point that the sweet spot where we actually can pass something through congress is not 3.5 trillion and i say that whether you agree with it or not um and i and i also you know i think we have to face the realities that it's going to take everybody in congress to pass this bill i mean otherwise we can just you know kind of yell and scream at each other for another number of months but i'm into getting things done and so what is the reality in congress senator manchin has said 1.5 trillion personally i think that's too low personally i think we'll probably end up agreeing somewhere between there and 3.5 trillion um but um you know you've you've got to get the job done at some point uh and that's what it that's what i'm very impatient about i want to get the job done well we want to see you get the job done while you're on capitol hill but we know it's been a very busy week congressman we appreciate your time here on sunrise today thank you so much

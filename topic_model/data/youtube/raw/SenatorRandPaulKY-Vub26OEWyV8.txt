bring in two senators who will serve as jurors for donald trump's second impeachment trial democrat amy klobuchar republican rand paul senator klobuchar let me begin with you and we just heard uh john carl say that there is some hope senator klobuchar that there will be some bipartisan support for the president's bill do you believe that or will democrats have to go it alone hey guys why didn't you i was sorry senator klobuch are you there okay let's start with senator rand paul instead i think we have some audio problems right there uh senator paul let me begin with a threshold question for you this election was not stolen do you accept that fact well what i would say is that the debate over whether or not there was fraud should occur we never had any presentation in court where we actually looked at the evidence most of the cases were thrown out for lack of standing which is a procedural way of not actually hearing the question there were several states in which the law was changed by the secretary of state and not the state legislature to me those are clearly unconstitutional and i think there's there's still a chance that those actually do finally work their way up to the supreme court courts traditionally and historically don't like to hear election questions but yes were there people who voted twice were there dead people voted were there illegal aliens who voted yes and we should get to the bottom of it i'll give you an example in my state when we had a democrat secretary of state she refused even under federal order to purge the roles of illegal voters we got a republican secretary of state and he purged the role to make a difference in those things i have to stop you there there no no election is perfect but there there were 86 challenges filed by president trump and his allies in court all were dismissed every state certified the results afterwards yeah but after investigations and the department of justice led by william barr said there's no widespread evidence of fraud can't you just say the words this election what i would suggest is what i would suggest is that if we want greater confidence in our elections and 75 percent of republicans agree with me is that we do need to look at election integrity and we do need to see if we can uh restore confidence in the elections well 75 percent of republicans agree with you because they were fed a big lie by president trump and his supporters who say the election was stolen why can't you say well i think we're unified i think you make a mistake hey george george george where you make a mistake is that people coming from the liberal side like you you immediately say everything's a lie instead of saying there are two sides to everything historically what would happen is if i said that i thought there was fraud you would interview someone else who said there wasn't but now you insert yourself in the middle and say the absolute fact is that everything i'm saying is a lie well senator i said what the president said was a lie because he said hold on a second he said the election was stolen this election was not stolen the results were certified in every single state after accounts and recounts you're saying that absolutely it was you're saying there was no fraud and it's all been investigated that's just not true that's not what i said sir i said the department of justice found no evidence let me finish my prayers you said something that was not true say we're all liars you're just simply saying we're all liars i said it was a lie that the election was stolen promise that you're right we're wrong well let no well let's let's talk about the specifics of it in wisconsin tens of thousands of absentee votes had only the name on them and no address historically those were thrown out this time they weren't they made special accommodations because they said oh it's a pandemic and people forgot what their address was so they changed the law after the fact that is wrong that's unconstitutional and i plan on spending the next two years going around state to state and fixing these problems and i won't be cowed by liberals in the media who say there's no evidence here and you're a liar if you talk about election fraud no let's have an open debate as a free country there's there's no widespread evidence of election fraud that overturned the results that was stated as well by the department of justice led by president trump's attorney general in wisconsin there were accounts and reasons never stopped even that's not true even that's not true william but there was yes he said that yes that was a pronouncement there has been no examination thorough examination of all the states to see what problems we had and see if they could fix them now let me say to be clear i voted to certify the state electors because i think it would be wrong for congress to overturn that but at the same time i'm not willing just to sit here and say oh everybody on the republican side is a liar and there is no fraud no there were lots of problems and there were secretaries of state who illegally changed the law and that needs to be fixed and i'm going to work hard to fix it and i won't be cowed by people saying oh you're a liar that's the problem with the media today is they say all republicans are liars and everything we say is a lie there are two sides to every story interview somebody on the other side but don't insert yourself into the story to say we're all liars because there is some dirt there are not effects there are not two there are not two sides of the story this has been looked at in every single state the other oh sure they're certified there's two sides to every story george you're forgetting who you are you're forgetting who you are as a journalist if you think there's only one side you're inserting yourself into the story to say i'm a liar because i want to look at election fraud and i want to look at secretaries of state who illegally change the voter laws without the permission of their state legislatures that is incontrovertible it happened and you can't just sweep that under the rug and say oh nothing to see here and everybody's a liar and you're a fool if you bring this up you're inserting yourself into the story a journalist would hear both sides and there are two sizes i'm standing by facts there are not two sides to facts i did not say that this was a perfect election i said it was the results were certified i said it was not stolen it you're is people are liars if they want to investigate what happened in the election that's not what i said in fact the tens of thousands of absentee ballots did not have addresses on them and normally were disqualified but this time they were counted should we examine that i don't know whether it affected the election or not but i have an open mind and if we actually examine this we find out it didn't that's fine but it still should be fixed there there's there can be more investigations the investigations that have taken place have shown there is not enough fraud to change the results of this election that has been certified by every state it was stated by the justice department and the attorney general and i accepted the state certifications but doesn't mean that i think that there wasn't fraud and that there weren't problems that have to be investigated and it doesn't mean that the law wasn't broken i believe in pennsylvania they broke the law and i believe if that ever would get a real hearing in the supreme court it was denied for standing it wasn't actually taken up if it were taken up i do believe that the supreme court would overrule and say that they did break the law illegally i asked you a very simple question was the election stolen or not i think there was a great deal of evidence of fraud and changing of the election laws illegally and i think a thorough investigation is warranted senator paul thanks for your time this morning

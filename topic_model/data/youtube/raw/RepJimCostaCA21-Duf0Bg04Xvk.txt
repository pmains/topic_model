the Subcommittee on livestock and foreign agriculture will now come to order this morning we have an opportunity to review animal pests and disease prevention response capabilities in the last year's reauthorization of the farm bill that we all worked on together there were some changes and we think efforts to better assist America's poultry industry and the purpose of this morning's subcommittee hearing on livestock and foreign agriculture is in fact to determine how those changes are coming forth so I want to thank our witnesses today for joining us to review the challenges that America faces American agriculture by animal pests and diseases and the ability for the United States Department of Agriculture to control those challenges it's important topic that many of us have followed these issues on behalf of farmers and ranchers throughout the country certainly in my district and we in this subcommittee take responsibility to oversee the United States Department of Agriculture's response to outbreaks that occur nationwide and obviously we take that role very seriously the livestock and poultry farmers throughout America are facing difficult times for a number of reasons obviously the trade wars are having their impact and challenging markets but some have you even been faced with issues of natural disasters of floods and other kinds of impacts that are they are facing the last thing we need to do then therefore is to have to deal with a never known another devastating animal disease outbreak clearly that is something that we want to prevent of all possible costs the USDA APHIS veterinarian services have traditionally and today play a critical role working with a host of stake holders in preventing and monitoring and responding to disease outbreaks whether we're talking about livestock operations large or small are a part of this effort so I'm glad that we have undersecretary Greg Eibach and dr. Burke Healy with the committee today to testify as we speak poultry farmers in California I can tell from I tell you from my own personal experiences are dealing with a outbreak of virtual ant Newcastle disease this Newcastle disease has since May of 2018 has confirmed by the USDA over 800 excuse me over 400 cases of this disease with all but two having occurred in California flocks last week I met with an affected egg farmer in my office they told me that they had over a hundred thousand chickens that had been contacted with the disease so I think all of us fear that that can can spread luckily it was detected and we were able to stop that in the case of that outbreak in in the San Joaquin Valley the poultry industry knows all too well what happens when a disease gets out of control remember we are only a few years removed from the outbreak of avian influenza that claimed more than 50 million Birds 50 million birds and cost farmers millions of dollars to eradicate in parts of our country and no by no means our poultry farmers the only ones at risk around the world today pork producers are concerned about the African swine fever which has caused a loss of at least 20 percent of China's hog population with more likely to come we based on estimates that already exacerbates the hobbled demand for US feed grains in that country which could wreak havoc on the US if it reaches our shores we're also conscious of the constant calculating threats to cattle and other species like foot-and-mouth disease cattle fever to exclude others all of these are potential causes of concern for our livestock industries as a conferee in the 2018 farm bill was a priority of mine to make sure that livestock and poultry producers had new tools to prevent the disease these diseases and the right resources and the right resources to fight them if they ever did during that process we've created two new programs and I'm very interested this morning to hear about the efforts to implement these two new programs the National Animas disease preparedness and the response program and the national animal vaccine and veterinarian countermeasures Bank we reauthorize the national animal health laboratory network we think all of these tools are very very important to ensure that we guard our livestock industries I'm also proud of the bipartisan House led effort to secure 300 billion in new funding for animal pest and disease prevention control I want to thank former chairman chairman Conway and certainly a chairman Peterson and others as we came together in a bipartisan effort to do just that today I look forward to hearing how implementation of this is going on and those other important programs I'm going to be focused on your timelines in terms of implementation of these efforts within the USDA I want to hear more on the status of aphids efforts to prevent and respond to threats that I've mentioned as well as many others that keep America's farmers and ranchers up at night they keep them up tonight I can assure you they keep members of Congress up at night so what's the US USDA doing on the timelines to implement the changes in last year's farm bill very simply stated what are you doing to implement the changes and what are your timelines what can you tell the committee this morning I think that this is critical work I'm committed to staying in touch with USDA will use this subcommittee and a bipartisan basis to ensure that we provide the proper oversight for our livestock and poultry sectors to make sure that we get the strategy straight and on the right track and that we support your efforts so in closing I'd also like to get any thoughts that you might have with innovations that are taking place in biological technology I think it shows promise and certainly dr. Healy I'd like to get your thoughts and what promise it shows and what the USDA is doing in that area of innovation as it relates to ba√≠al biological technology with that I'd like to recognize the ranking member as dingus gentleman from North Carolina mr. Rao sir for any opening remarks that he'd like to make

and we go now to Arkansas Republican senator Tom Cotton who was a regular on the 2022 campaign Trail boosting GOP candidates he's out with a new book called Only the Strong and he joins us this morning from McLean Virginia good morning to you Senator and on this Veterans Day weekend I do want to thank you for your past military service um well thank you Margaret that's kind of you and thanks to all our veterans for their service and all of our nation's Wars story of the moment headwinds 8 out of 10 Americans said they felt it was out of control Republicans had issues like economy and crime really break in their favor President Biden has a low approval rating how did Republicans end up with this complete disappointment foreign I wouldn't say it was a complete disappointment on the one hand we had strong Republican leaders running on positive records of accomplishments who won very big victories if you look at Governors like Ron DeSantis in Florida Brian Kemp in Georgia Mike dewine and Ohio Kim Reynolds and Iowa Greg Abbott in Texas we had Senators with the same victories like Marco Rubio in Florida and Tim Scott in South Carolina Ron Johnson in Wisconsin but on the other hand obviously we hoped that we would have won more seats I I think the lessons in our victories can be applied to some places where we came up a little bit short we need to focus on serious substantive accomplishments and issues like crime like our wide open border like addressing runaway inflation even in places where we came up a little bit short like Lee zeldon's race for governor in New York he performed very well compared to Republicans in recent elections and he probably helped save the House of Representatives by bringing four new Republican congressmen elect across the Finish Line in New York so I think we have lessons in places we had victories that we can apply to places where we were disappointed sure but you lost the ball game in the Senate Senate Karl Rove blame blank quality and Glee put the blame president Trump he said Mr Trump turned what should have been a referendum on Mr Biden's terrible record into a choice between himself and the current president as in 2020 lots of Voters chose Mr Biden should Mr Trump Remain the leader of the Republican Party well Margaret when the party when any party is out of power as Republicans are now we don't have a single leader uh the former president is obviously very popular with many of our voters but we also have important other leaders as well like some of those Victors I just mentioned uh earlier like Brian Kemp in Georgia Ron DeSantis in Florida last year had Glenn Junkin have a great Victory and a bluish Democratic State like Virginia I hope to remain a leader in the United States Senate as well in addition to people like some of those I just mentioned who are re-elected like Tim Scott so when you're in opposition you don't have a single leader that won't be the case until we're through the 24 nominating season and when it happened we have a new nominee you said you're not going to run for president in 2024 the former president says he intends to announce he's running on Tuesday should he be the automatic nominee or should he face a primary well Margaret since I opted against being a candidate in 2024 I don't plan to be a pundit or a strategist well you just threw out a whole bunch of names of guys who might be running for president Senator are you endorsing that and I I know almost I I know almost all of them personally and I respect their accomplishments not just their big victories uh on Tuesday or last year in Glenn's case but also their accomplishments in office but you know I know everyone already wants to focus on 2024 I just want to remind everyone that we're still in the middle of the 2022 midterm because we're in overtime in Georgia and the most important thing we can do is elect Herschel Locker to make sure that we can keep the pressure on Democrats in the Senate not to Veer far to the left as they have over the last two years that's why I think everyone should remain focused for these next three weeks should leadership elections in the Senate be delayed until December um and should Mitch McConnell remain as a Republican leader in the Senate well I don't see why we would delay the election since all five or six of our leadership elections are uncontested you know the the great wrestling champion Rick Flair used to say to be the man you got to beat the man and so far no one's had the nerve to step forward and challenge Senator McConnell so I support Senator McConnell I support the other slate of candidates for our leadership elections I think it's better that we move forward with these elections so we can focus again on the Georgia runoff all right um I want to ask you as well about what will be a consequential meeting tomorrow between President Biden and president Xi Jinping of China their first to face face-to-face of the Biden presidency um Mr Biden says he wants to talk through red lines to understand critical interests can the U.S avoid conflict with China at this point we want to avoid conflict with China most certainly uh in the military sense I don't think we can avoid conflict and tension in terms of diplomatic and economic and political competition I would urge the president to be very firm in drawing those red lines we don't want to see a repeat of what happened last summer in Russia When Vladimir Putin walked away from their Summit in Europe attempted to go for the jugular in Ukraine especially a month later after the collapse in Afghanistan or a replay of something I write about in my new book Only the Strong of the disastrous Vienna Summit in 1961 between John Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev which encouraged Russian leaders to Rampage all around the world for the next year so I hope the president is very clear in drawing red lines for instance saying that the recent rule against China using American semiconductor technology is only the first step I hope he's very clear about Taiwan that we'll continue to arm Taiwan so it can defend itself and if China goes for the jugular in Taiwan then we will come to their aid that's the simplest way to avoid military conflict is to be clear and firm up front but would you recommend in terms of China not going for the jugular but a slow strangulation to take over Taiwan which I know you know is one of the scenarios National Security officials are concerned about well the simplest thing we can do for Taiwan is what we should have started doing for Ukraine before Russia invaded Ukraine is to provide them with the Weaponry that they need to stop an invasion it's urgent that we do so now because unlike Ukraine Taiwan is an island which means China could blockade it and we might not be able to resupply them once China might start military conflict so it's urgent that we accelerate armed sales to Taiwan the kind of anti-ship anti-aircraft missiles and sea mines that they need to fend off the potential evasion from the Communist Chinese with China it's a hard problem set because as you know our economies are so interlinked iPhones are made in China we learned during the pandemic how dependent we are in the supply chain they own an enormous amount of U.S debt you're arguing to separate the two economies but people like Hank Paulson of the Bush Administration have said that'll end up with a less stable world with really dangerous economic forces here how do you possibly do that well Margaret as I right now in the strong it was a bad mistake by leaders in both parties going back 30 years to allow China to get itself so entangled in the United States and to allow us to become so economically dependent in so many ways whether it's things like high-tech electronic equipment or low-tech basic pharmaceutical ingredients or medical equipment what I say and Only the Strong is that we should try to decouple in a strategic sense so we don't harm our own people but we're no longer dependent on those critical sectors that we depend on to keep ourselves safe healthy and prosperous it's one thing if Americans buy you know say children's toys or plastic Christmas trees from China it's another thing if China has the market cornered on things like basic pharmaceutical ingredients or The Rare Earth elements that are so vital to all modern Electronics right we'll do so in a smart way but we have to be aggressive and quick about it we'll watch to see if there's congressional action on any of that Senator thank you for your time today

welcome everyone good morning everybody hear me in the back yeah welcome this is the session on u.s. foreign policy in 2018 elections thanks everybody for coming my name is Andrew Albertson I'm the executive director of foreign policy for America which is a nonpartisan membership driven advocacy organization founded after the 2016 election to strengthen support for principled American engagement in the world and I just want to start by saying how excited I am to be here just being in this incredible conference seeing how much is going on the incredible number of people who are here I think all of us feel the sense that this is a difficult year it's a difficult because we're concerned about what we're seeing our country and sometimes all of us or at least just speaking for myself I feel buffeted by the news by the latest tweet when I wake up and I see it and I think this is the answer so for me this feels like the antidote it's people coming together with the conviction that not only can i push back I can do my part I can take action but there are thousands of people who share my values who are committed to the same goals who are working together determined to make sure that we can look back on this year as a historic turning point so I find just being with all of you and be here inspiring and I'm so appreciated that to have this opportunity now I've been asked to offer a few framing remarks just as we get started with this discussion to set the stage and I want to do that but let's just say that the outside that there's two stories for this year there's a story that I think should worry us and we need to face up to squarely there's also a story that should give us a lot of hope so the first backdrop to the elections I think is you know what President Trump has done and is doing that worries us all so first a military first foreign policy toying with the idea of attacking North Korea extending our troop presence in Syria scaling up support for the saudi-led military conflict in Yemen a massive increase in our defense budget and juxtapose with that a State Department where a out of the top ten positions are vacant where workforce reductions in the junior ranks guarantee that we won't have the qualified senior foreign service officers in the future when we need them down the road and budget proposals that would cut non-military engagement in the world by a shocking third the second thing you know I think is a president making foreign policy decisions that appear to be self-serving or corrupt or at least inexplicable for reasons we can have a hard time understanding and third President Trump is tarnished American credibility and reputation by walking away not only from traditional American values but by crumb commitments that we've made to allies and adversaries alike he walked away from the Paris climate agreement from TPP from us responsibilities to refugees and perhaps most consequentially president Trump is now threatening to walk away from the Iran deal on May 12th so that's one story that's one important backdrop to the congressional races that we're watching the other story though is the fact that we're living through a period of incredible National Civic renewal where millions of people are getting engaged and taking actions they never had before in their lives and that's incredibly exciting just to look at this one way raise your hands if you've participated in a protest or a March or some other kind of political event this year all right fantastic raise your hand if you've contacted your member of Congress either sent a piece of mail or made a phone call okay this is a great audience all right Washington Post studied did a study and nationally 20 percent of Americans said that this year they'd attended a protest rally or speech an unbelievable uptick in that kind of political action the four largest protests in our country's history took place in the last 15 months as far as contacting elected officials Washington Post again did a study and said forty percent of Americans have reached out to an elected official on some issue it says an incredible number at one point the Senate was receiving 1.5 million calls in single days at the height of the health care debate a sent one Senate office reported the mail correspondence went up last year by nine hundred percent now I had to pause and just say and talking statistics on this the pollster Celinda lake did an incredible 28,000 person study of who is calling members of Congress and the statistic is that 86 percent of people who called the members of Congress on the health care debate were women so so when we're talking about the story of civic renewal in this country we do have to look at the fact that a lot of that isn't is incredible surge of women being active the last question I wanted to ask how many in this room decided for themselves that they wanted to run for elected office we're excited to have Amy here on the panel there are a few there are a few in the audience but that's another part of this story is the incredible uptake and candidates running we're seeing at one point and I'm not sure what the numbers are exactly right now but at one point it was a quadrupling of the number of candidates that typically run in a given year for Congress so all that adds up to the fact that we're living through an incredible moment and I think we should all have a lot of hope and optimism about what's possible and that's in part because the great candidates like Andy so in addition to promoting our policy agenda a foreign policy for America we also endorse and support candidates for Congress and so just as a data point we've now had conversations with almost 100 candidates who have a foreign policy and national security background that's just an unbelievable number that are running like that and want to be champions for progressive internationalist foreign policy of those candidates we've only endorsed eight and one of the first ones is the first panelist I want to introduce Andy Kim so Andy yeah Andy is a Rhodes Scholar he served in Afghanistan with the State Department as an advisor to General Allen and General Petraeus later he served in the National Security Council as a rock director where he played a leading role in the effort to defeat Isis last year Andy decided to jump in the arena and run for Congress so Andy if you could start us off tell us your story why did you decide to take this plunge and run for Congress is that any better there we go well thank you so much for having me here this is a real honor and a real privilege to be able to speak with all of you and be part of this broader community you know when I was thinking about joining up on this panel the question about foreign policy as well as for the 2018 elections and you know I get asked that question you know why am i running why foreign policy was my career and I think the two are very much the same so I'll be brief here for me when I talk to my to the voters in the Jersey third congressional district and talk about my career talk about why I'm doing this I tell them that for me foreign policy was a story of my life you know I'm somebody who is the son of immigrants my father was born and was raised in North Anna Jin South Korea he was a survivor of polio he's somebody that was homeless during his childhood and the United States gave him an opportunity gave took a chance on him gave him a chance to study here in the United States he was able to become a PhD and a medical researcher and genetics dedicate his life to try and cure cancer trying to cure Alzheimer's you know my mother also grew up right in the end of the the the Korean War you know when the United States came in and and changed the course of my family's life forever and she was able to come to the United States as well become a nurse work in the hospital systems in New Jersey you know my family is rooted in foreign policy every aspect of what we do and for me I took that a step further I dedicated my career to foreign policy and serve in this country I was you know Andrew mentioned some of the things that I've done and I had the privilege of working alongside of him with in Afghanistan alongside our armed service men and women and a lot of brave diplomats and intelligence officers and others and I saw firsthand what goes into defending this country what goes into securing our border securing the American people and right now for me a lot of that same passion for service is what brought me to do what I'm doing right now I feel compelled to stand and fight for my country fight for this area of New Jersey that gave my family every opportunity you know this this place where I'm raising my two baby boys and that's what this is really about is that when I understand that for me my story is a foreign policy story my family's story is foreign policy and I dare to say that probably all of us can see ourselves in this and I think that's what's so important it was when I talk about foreign policy on the trail when I talk about why I'm doing what I'm doing these aren't just stories that we see in the news these aren't just issues that were debating in a news room or in the chamber of kind of Congress you know these are human lives these are decisions that are affecting us our families people across this world and the more that I can make sure to anchor myself in that kind of humanity and understand and recognize what's being done and the impact that it takes on real people I think the more connects with voters the more we understand the importance of this election the important role that foreign policy and national security would play in this little upcoming election so I'll stop there thanks Andy the second panelist I want to introduce is is me Kyoya yang so Mika is the vice president for third ways national security program where she works tirelessly to craft a security strategy and messaging that is both tough and smart before Third Way Mika had a long career on Capitol Hill including serving as professional staff member on the House Armed Services Committee the subcommittee staff director on house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence defense policy advisor to Senator Kennedy and finally chief of staff to representative Ana su and you may recognize me from all the time she spends on MSNBC and cable makeup it's so great to have you here in your job it'd be great if you could share a little bit more about kind of the work you're doing at Third Way and especially with candidates and I think you have a special vantage point on all the incredible candidates who are stepping up and running this year thank you Andrew um so at third way I run the national security program and our national security program focuses on the politics of national security which is a little bit different than thinking through the what are the policy implications what we see often for candidates and for elected officials their policy choices are constrained by the politics of their particular districts and so to understand how they might need to go forward on any particular foreign policy issue you need to have some sense of how the public feels about this so we've been doing public opinion work to understand how the two parties react and how their bases react to national security for quite some time and so I get called to brief candidates like Andy who I had the pleasure of briefing earlier this year on what what are the dynamics and the politics of national security and what we've seen over time going back to at least the Vietnam War is that people view the two parties very differently on national security and in particular they view Democrats they're less likely to trust Democrats than Republicans on national security so if as a base matter irrespective of what the particular foreign policy decisions are and that waxes and wanes over time but we've seen recently two times when the Democrats were equal to or more trusted on national security than the Republicans one was during the height of the Iraq war the disaster that was the Iraq war and people opinion turned dramatically against that in the 2006 timeframe and Democrats retook the house in that you know surprising and somewhat landslide election and we saw that the Democrats draw even to Republicans again in the 2012 cycle the last midterm election in 2014 what we saw was a 23 point gap between the Democrats and the Republicans where the Democrats were behind and that in that 23 point gap we saw a massive wave for the Republicans they took the they took the house they took back they defeated a lot of incumbent Democratic senators who are not expected to lose that cycle and national security became a very important issue that's came up out of nowhere when most candidates had filed their petitions to run national security was not on the agenda but by the summer of 2014 when Isis bulldozed the border between Iraq and Syria and Russia went in and took Crimea from Ukraine national security became a tremendous issue for the for that election cycle we also saw a lot of media coverage of Ebola coming across the southern border Democrats response to that was not particularly good and a lot of Democrats didn't know what to do with that and we saw a lot of candidates lose what we see this midterm cycle unlike those in this 2018 cycle is that we have seen a tremendous recruiting of candidates who have strong national security backgrounds like Andy people who have dedicated themselves to this series of issues Seth Moulton has done a tremendous job of recruiting veterans we've seen a lot of even civilians lévesque expertise at State Department and and Pentagon running for Congress these are not typical candidates we've seen before often what you see running for Congress are people who are really well established in their local community but have very little expertise in national security and so what we see this time is people really stepping up who have a history of service to the nation in a very particular field saying I want to serve my country again in a different way and so I think expect that if national security rises to the fore in this cycle the way that it has in the past that we will have a very different response from our candidates because they have a lot of experience in these issues but what we see also in the 2016 cycle was there was a real backlash against experience and expertise that the Trump that President Trump ran as the most inexperienced national security candidate that we'd ever seen against the most experienced national security candidate we'd ever seen and she beat him on every single public public opinion poll on who would be the better commander-in-chief and yet she still lost because what we saw as people were very frustrated with inside Washington and the sense that the inside-the-beltway experts were not connected to what the needs of the people are so this is the real risk for all of these candidates who are running the cycle with real national security backgrounds is how do they navigate this path this anti expertise wave that we saw in the last cycle with theirs their backgrounds and their tremendous experience in these issues and I think that's the real challenge is making sure they're still reaching people to speak to their needs and fears on these issues as we go forward that's great thank you mica and that the the third panelist I want to introduce is will Fisher and and actually I think that cues you up early nicely actually so will is the director of government relations for vote pets the largest progressive veterans organization in America prior to his work at VOC fats will spend nearly a decade working at the National afl-cio on a variety of political legislative and organizing campaigns around the country he is a really intimate sense of I think how veterans are responding to this moment and getting engaged and and I should say will served in Iraq with the US Marines so well great to have you here thank you so much and good morning everybody so thrilled to be here with each and every single one of you I think it's interesting when we talk about you know foreign policy and 2018 as a panelist today you know there is this idea of all the domestic issues could certainly be sort of a driving force but one of the things that we try to lift up is you know to the old you know harking back to Pericles a bit right with foreign policy you may not take an interest in politics but eventually it's going to take an interest in you and I certainly believe that with the arrival of people like John Bolton into the White House and with the possibility of the Ascension of Mike Pompeo into to being the next Secretary of State we are at a very very dramatic moment in which foreign policy will continue but in a very very upfront way affect not only every single person in this room but every single person who is drawing breath anywhere in this world to it vote that's what we do is you know as Andrew mentioned we're the largest progressive veterans organization in the country we have over 500,000 members in all 50 states and on the domestic side we try to work to lift up the fact that yeah every issue as a veterans issues because veterans are part of society just like anyone else now what we also do is work to lift up the voices of veterans from all eras from different conflicts to talk about how that experience of their time and service impacts their outlook on foreign policy and how that can help shape those of decision makers and one area specific to 2018 I would say well we do a great deal of work is in the recruitment of progressive veterans to run for higher office right now we have more than 30 veterans who have been endorsed and who are running for federal office we have people running for statewide office for gubernatorial races as well and certainly hundreds of veterans and down ballot elections but these you know we don't just endorse them a just because they're a veteran right you know if that were the case Roy Moore would have not an endorsed Bliss and he wasn't hey but til we work with these folks to identify you know progressive champions people who are progressive own foreign policy outlook people who are progressive in terms of domestic policy issues who can come to this town come to this town and help drive good progressive policy and as we've seen you know there have never been roughly fewer veterans than there are in Congress right now and I think that we're seeing that reflected in basically Congress at you know just doing away with its War Powers oversight and giving the president not just this one either the one before that and the one before that through you know these never ending authorizations of military force that have now you know since Donald Trump became president I think up to eight countries in which Americans had been killed in combat action and and if you know if John Bolton and Mike Pompeo and the Donald Trump course for war continues to have their way that number of countries and that number of individuals will continue to grow so that's what I'm excited to hear to talk with y'all about today on how we're doing that and how we talk about these issues whether it's Syria whether it's AUMF whether it's Korea the jcpoa or others but every single one of the issues that we're talking about affect every single one of us and I think when you really are when we're talking about things like the Iran deal and we're thinking about you know Donald Trump taken to Twitter and capriciously talking about our nuclear arsenal you know what that's doing is turning where you sit right now into a battlefield we are all conscripts into those wars and we have a person making that happen through being logged onto Twitter and being dictated by the hosts of Fox and Friends of what our foreign policy should be so Andrew back over to you thank you so Andy I want you to help us understand what it's like on the trail and and sort of the conversations you're having but the other thing it I wanted to raise you mentioned me the other day that for you and your district foreign policy national security it's a local issue and I thought it would be great if you could kind of share a little bit more about what you mean by that and I'm also wondering do you think that's specific to your district or do you think that is true for a lot of candidates and a lot of districts around the country so happy to talk about that so that's absolutely right I mean when I told Andrew was for me in my district in New Jersey third congressional district a foreign policy and national security is a local issue we have where the home of Joint Base mcguire-dix-lakehurst we have tens of thousands of armed service men and women that show up to work every day my neighbors go to work in fatigues and I think that you know it's important for us to recognize that because when we see the types of conflicts in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world we recognize that that could very much impact our own communities we've seen it happen the years and that's something that you know we talk about on a regular basis for me on the clinic on the campaign trail we do talk about national security and foreign policy a lot I think people ask me you know does it come up a lot well it comes up a lot because I also think it's important to talk about I find that when we talk about these issues of the Middle East or Iran or North Korea or others that it's clearly something that people are very concerned about I think the issue is is that maybe a lot of voters don't necessarily know how to ask the right questions or they feel maybe a little intimidated digging into this but when we start digging into especially on issues recently on North Korea those are very much issues and I feel a lot of passion and concern about a lot of worry and so I don't want to shy away from that because you know these are issues that obviously I've dedicated to a large part of my career too but as I mentioned in my earlier remarks what's key and important and talking about this is not talking about that as if I'm just talking on a news show but talk about how that's impacting our own communities you know talking about how as I was saying earlier you know the humanity behind these issues and relating them to each and every one of us and I think that's the connection that candidates you know should be trying to draw when they're talking about these types of issues across this country I don't think that national security is a local issue just because we have the military base just because we have you know tens of thousands of veterans in our district as well they're veterans in every single district in this entire country there are people that are concerned about these issues everywhere and I think it's be a good thing for candidates all over this country to be talking about these issues and making it known how where we're at especially because I agree that with this new foreign policy national security cabinet that we're seeing being formed and I worked in the Situation Room before and imagining Donald Trump at the front and seeing John Boehner to his left and possibly Secretary of State Pompeo to his right you know those are those are going to that's gonna bring about a new national conversation about foreign policy and national security inevitably so it makes sense for us to be ahead of that and make sure that we're getting our message out there and talking about in on our own terms I think that's a it's really important we talk about John Bolden and Mike Pompeo in this moment quiz question what what is the common thread between Barbara Comstock Mike Coffman and bi amassed all three were endorsed by John Bolton who runs a PAC or ran a PAC as supporting candidates is trying to find a nice batch of John Bolden acolytes in Congress who will be there to vote if there's a congressional authorization for the use of force well John Bolton be a factor in these elections mica anybody I think so it's very clear we are at a very important transitional moment in the Trump administration when he first came in everyone was so worried about his bombastic language on the campaign trail and the way that he would just pop off and say that he could shoot people on the street in New York and right you know who's gonna bomb these people all over the place but when he came in during the transition he picked some people to be in his national security cabinet who seemed like grown-ups right we called him the axis of adults we talked about mattes we talked about Tillerson to lesson to keep a Lee we were talking about people who are much more traditional Republicans a little bit more restrained and used to force a little bit more thoughtful and potentially people who had learned the lessons of the Iraq war what we're seeing now in the replacement of HR McMaster with john bolton with her placement of Tillerson with Pompeo with the rise of jena Haspel at the CIA we are seeing trump picking people who he's much more comfortable with people who are yes-men and enablers people who are more likely to encourage his instincts to revenge to escalation and so this is a very important moment that we're wrestling with right now in the Senate as we go through these hearings and the senator menendez pointed out and his closing at the Pompeo nomination hearing people are going to say a lot of things very reasonable to try and get through Senate confirmation but as he pointed out it's which one of these people are we really voting to confirm are we voting to confirm the people who are saying these you know I will be responsible and I will speak truth to power or the people who when they weren't seeking this office we're urging regime change in Iran were arguing for regime change in North Korea and not thinking about the consequences of those actions on the American people on the people that we would send to go do those things and I think we will really we are at this moment of transition where if these people are installed it does not take them very long to make the kinds of disastrous foreign policy decisions that we saw in the 2002-2003 timeframe so convinced at real quick to her point one thing I would say is in terms of john bolton and matter i think it cannot be undersold enough how much he will matter you know john bolton to a lot of people is just like finding an old calendar right from an era in your life that you didn't like and people connect him and john old trump spent so much time when he was running for president going into working-class communities and talk about if i am elected president i state i am not going to get us into dumb wars I'm not gonna go send young men and women and all over the world to go fight these never-ending you know regime change type conflicts and yet what has he done now brought in the drum major of the war in Iraq John Bolton into his office and what that is shown is that there is not a bit of daylight between Donald Trump and Dick Cheney and I think that the American people and the electorate will absolutely take note of that there's one other thing about which raises that that raises about john bolton which is really important to a large extent we have been spared some of the worst foreign policy instincts of the president because of his incompetence right he says things on twitter and then Madison's like that's not a real order I'm not gonna do that John Bolton is a guy who knows how to manipulate the intelligence to take the nation to war he did that his intelligence briefer when he was at the State Department came as a whistleblower to Congress when I was there during the Iraq war to say this is a guy who is twisting the Intel to suit his own needs and he was so toxic that he was unable to win conformation in the Bush administration because of his abusive treatment of his subordinates and because of the ways in which he manipulates intelligence and now he is the guy who was closest in a few steps away from the president every day talking to him about issues for war so I think it's really important that we square up to this question of you know are we careening towards a new military conflict right 15 years ago there was a vote I guess I also want to put this in perspective we're celebrating the 10 year anniversary of J Street and there's a there's been a lot of work that's been done that Third Way has done since 2005 6 yeah both vets has done it since 2006 there's a lot of work that's been done over the last 12 years a lot of efforts made 15 years ago there's a vote to authorize these a military force in Iraq now there's a there's rumblings of a very different kind of AUMF though this that could come rather soon in Congress what has changed in your perspectives over that last 10 years stretch since J Street has started and do you what has changed in terms of how you in terms of political incentives the members of Congress were thinking about as they vote on issues of war and peace this year for me I mean this is a very personal issue as well I mean um you know the Iraq war decision 2003 is what spurred me on to dedicating my career to foreign policy and and working on conflict issues doing everything we can to try to bring our armed service men and women home as as soon as possible I think for my generation and that grew up in that through those Wars you know I think there is a lot of initial immediate concern about seeing that kind of same ramp and when we seen say when we see some of those same figures back in these of power like John Bolton you know it certainly is something that perks up our ears and gets our attention you know I think what we are mindful of as a broader public seeing this both from the outside as well as having been inside the Situation Room on these decisions is the incredibly important role that information is going to play you know we have much more informed public in terms of the ability to push that information out about these foreign conflicts about these crises that come up I know that when we were dealing with with the rise of Isis and doing everything we can to push back and and and and fight back against that threat you know this issue about information was front and center one information can we trust what information you know does does the American people need to have and I think what I want to see go forward this year leading up to the elections and then from that point onwards is for that to be discussed and that information to be available to the American people and have a broad conversation we're gonna be dealing with a lot of major issues going for potentially even a discussion and and a debate about conflict and it's very important to bring the American people into that discussion and not rush things through make sure that that information is available that it's credible and what worries me is when I see how this administration and this Congress has been moving forward on health care on taxes and all these other issues that they try to jam through in the middle of the night that American dialogue that discussion that that information that you need to understand what our country is doing is missing so when I think about what's about to happen whether it's the discussions about the Iran deal or a new AUMF or North Korea dialogues you know that's what's we got to make sure is happening that there is transparency to these actions and that people can be held accountable for the decisions that are made I think when we talk about authorizations for use of military force and when people say is this strike legal or illegal right should we take the nation to war it sounds right this is one of the dangers of the expertise it sounds like oh we're letting the rules get in the way of what the the real foreign policy question is and I think the important thing to remember is that debate about whether or not we have a use a ssin for use of military force is a proxy for something that is embedded in our Constitution which is that it gives Congress the power to declare war because you wanted the people's branch to be held accountable for the decisions to send Americans into harm's way and to take the nation into a place that was going to risk a lot in human lives and in in financial cost and so what we have seen is recently or Oh actually over time going back to the Clinton administration a slow erosion of Congress's power and ability to stand up to a president and say no the people have to have a say in whether or not we're going to war and part of the reason that it's so important is because for you as voters that vote is a proxy for you to say my representative made a decision that I believe in or didn't believe in and I can hold them accountable for this during the Obama administration when they were thinking about seeking authorization for the use of force to strike the Assad regime for its use of chemical weapons Jack Kingston said a Republican from Georgia said look we nobody really wants to have this debate because we'd rather just complain about it but we don't want to be on the record on how we actually feel about this and that's what Congress has been avoiding Congress has not stepped up to its role to be a check on an executive in the fundamental questions of war and peace in a very long time and it is very clear that this particular Congress they didn't he doesn't care because they didn't even bother talking about sending up an authorization for the use of military force unlike the Obama administration who at first sent one and then managed to avoid the conflict completely this is so that they don't actually have to answer for this to their voters in this question of should we in fact be involved in this conflict in Syria and there was an attempt in the Senate to actually hold members accountable to the question of whether or not we should be involved in the civil war in Yemen but unless voters are saying to their members of Congress we care that and we want to know where you are on these things Congress will continue to avoid responsibility one thing just quickly I think we talked about AUMF authorization of military force and you know we mentioned the one for the war in Iraq I just want to point out real quick just to give some context this year young women and men will be deployed to Afghanistan were in the US military who were literally wearing diapers when they're being sent to Afghanistan was being debated last right just think about that for a moment and how Congress is surrender and just abdicating their War Powers and it's it's a travesty and I do believe that it is one of those things that the more and more veterans progressive veterans who are elected Congress the more and more authorization and retaking back of some of those roles and responsibilities with as it relates to War Powers will be so I just want to think again back to candidates and these incredible challenges we're seeing as I said one of the stories this year I think we just have to look at is not only are there incredible numbers of women who have called members of Congress incredible number of female candidates Amy McGrath Elaine Lauria Mikey Cheryl all Naval Academy graduates and the same a couple years apart all right well I'm curious it's have you seen something different from some of the female veterans who are running this year you know I think to just be more up them right I mean I think a couple years ago you saw a thing Tammy Duckworth right and it was sort of became a recognized person and candidate across the country and now she's serving as a u.s. senator and we're really happy about that and then you're seeing more and more but I think that them also that just goes to the fact that there are more and more women serving in the military these days I think that this goes to the fact that we have been at work now for 17 years coming up and as such yeah there are more women veterans and all women veterans are going to be taking charge and wanting to run for higher office and we're seeing that all the way down the ballot right you've seen that in local races and of course at the federal level and you just pointed out I think they're none to either nine or eleven female veterans right now who've been endorsed by both that some of whom you just mentioned I started my career working for Pat Schroeder and I want to say we are actually at a seminal moment of women in the military right now Pat started her career fighting for the right for women to serve in combat and she lifted the combat exclusion for women in the Navy in 1991 many of these women who are running today were women who were first able to serve in combat billets as a result of those actions right in combat aviation on Navy ships we just saw the listing of lifting of the ground combat exclusion and as late as the Obama administration what that means is something very fundamental for women veterans until that women have been relegated to roles that were clerical medical-legal desk jobs this now is a moment for the first time where we have real women warriors we saw women serving in ground combat adjacent positions going out on patrols in the Iraq war in Afghanistan for the first time we have a generation of women who have proved their mettle and in battle and this is actually a fundamental question for the leadership of any nation going all the way back to Plato who deserves to be a guardian and for so long women were excluded from that definition they were not people who were in the eyes of the nation willing to put their lives on the line on behalf of the nation to defend it and now for the first time we are seeing that and so now for the first time we are seeing a generation of combat tested women who are running for office Tammy Duckworth was one of the first sacrificed tremendously for the nation and so we are seeing something really really profound now one can argue in Israel they've actually solved this problem quite a long time ago with the integration of women into their NT IDF but in America we are at a very profound moment about what it means for women as candidates and as veterans Aniyah helped us think in terms I think we've talked a lot about how important it is to check the Trump administration for Congress to step up and do its job in a variety of ways so you're let's let's imagine forward now it's January 2019 okay you've won your race your race is right on that mark where you know if you win it's likely that Democrats take control of the house let's imagine Democrats take control of Senate what does that change what can you do in Congress what will you be thinking about in your first few months I try not to think that far ahead just so I don't jinx myself but you know for me what I promised the people of my district is not just better policies but better politics and what I promise them is you know I am gonna move forward I'm gonna you know make sure that I'm the most accountable accessible and transparent member of Congress that there is you know that means you know I pledge to have a public town hall in the district every single month it means that I pledge to have daily reports coming out from my office about what I'm doing who I'm meeting with what issues are coming up where I stand that we can do this together so when I think about what would happen if I were to win this election and what we can do going forward first and foremost I want to be the representative that the people of my district deserve the kind of representative that's gonna be true to that and understand that I would then have 750,000 bosses that I have to account to and that's why I need to respond to them so first and foremost it's about you know making sure that my district that the constituents there have the kind of voice that they've been wanting to have in Congress second it's about making sure that we can be the types of leaders that this country needs at this moment that we are not afraid to speak out on the issues that we need to that we are ones that are going to take firm stances and that we're going to be independent thinkers who this all and we can work together to be able to figure out the best way forward you know I'm I'm proud of the fact that I was a career public servant you know I'm proud of the fact that I've served under you know Republicans and Democrats and when I was out in Afghanistan working alongside armed servicemen and women no one there asked us if we were Democrats or Republicans you know we're just focused on the mission at hand and I think the mission at hand right now in my mind is clear but the problem is is that so much of what we need to get done to help the American people and help get our country on a better path is being overshadowed by this hyper partisanship that's been so corrosive and decaying our democracy and I think that that's why you see a lot of candidates that come from a service background we feel compelled that the oath that I swore to protect this country and serve this country didn't then the day that I left my working government that that would continue on it's not just something that ends at the end of the workday you know the way my parents taught me was that service isn't just a job it's a way of life so I want to make sure that we use every lever that we have at our disposal in Congress to make sure that the American people have the information that they need that we can have a real discussion in Congress and in this town in Washington DC about what these steps are we'll go on forward and I think what's gonna be important is that by controlling the house if we're able to take it in controlling the chairmanships of the committees and controlling a lot of those different levers we can make sure that these types of Fiasco's like passing a tax bill in the middle of the night without even the legislators having time to read they let alone the American people that those are not the types of actions that are done especially when it comes to national security issues where in my personal opinion you know those are issues on national security where we need to really keep the partisan politics out of it and really think about this in terms of you know the lives that are on the line especially our armed service men and women and other Americans that are in arms way terrific I'm gonna ask the same question to will and Myka what's at stake but just before I do that just so you know what we'll do next is transition to asking your questions and so take a moment to think about what questions you want to ask these three but well Mika what's at stake you know limiting it to this foreign policy discussion I'd want to be brief and say that it really is going back in seizing back some control over War Powers by the Congress Mika was talking earlier about John people like John Bolten enabling the worst parts of Donald Trump and as you know sort of the news of the day continues to close in around Donald Trump in the headlines are being dominated by his personal lawyer's office being you know rated or you know so on and so forth you know Donald Trump instinctively he's a reality TV show huckster and what does he want to do now you know flip the script and john bolton could say you want these headlines to change balls let's go bomb somebody and they will and Donald Trump is the kind of person who would absolutely go along with that and that's why it is so extremely important for Congress to not abdicate their roles in in overseeing war powers and I believe that that is absolutely what is at stake not just you know electoral leap but as I mentioned earlier for the lives of every single person on this planet I agree with my two other panelists I think what's really important here is that the basic structure of the Constitution is checks and balances right Congress was designed to check the executive the courts were there to oversee both of them what we see right now is the Trump administration trying to pack the courts from all of the nominations that they held back from the Obama administration we saw that on the Supreme Court this year we see a compliant Congress not asking this administration to give them real answers on what the strategy is for Syria or in North Korea so they can just go behind closed doors and then sort of wing it as they go forward right we get these back-and-forth policies on trade and our relationships with our allies and on NATO at this point the real question is are we going to continue to allow a system that is so fundamentally unbalanced or we as the American people going to restore some checks to the system with that I do want to open it up to your questions I've taken my fish share I use the microphones to just line up behind here what we'll ask everybody is to just keep your questions brief so we can get to as many as possible and I think make sure to you know phrase your question in the form of a question please but I just want a little more clarity on the AUMF does the president have to come to Congress or can Congress take the initiative and if Congress the current Congress does not take an initiative can the next Congress do something and could you just introduce yourself my name is Edith Goldman I live in Maryland thank you thank you um so just to run through the technicalities of the AUMF and war powers um if a conflict is otherwise legal under international law for example self-defense the president can go 60 days on his own authority without coming to Congress and past presidents have argued that particular kinds of conflicts for example the Obama administration argued us about Libya they were gonna go 60 days and then stop before coming back to Congress but what we've seen is an expansion of conflicts going forward Congress has two ways that they can check the president one is to deny an authorization for use of military force some presidents would consider going forward because they don't really care about the rules potentially this one and then the other thing that Congress can do is cut off funds and this is when there have been serious threats to cut off funds the presidents have actually withdrawn once in Vietnam and once during the Iraq war please hi my name is Abe Janek I'm a student at UC Berkeley and my question is with John Bolton in office if Pompeo is not confirmed who do you think would be Trump's second choice and what's the best-case scenario if Pompeo isn't confirmed for foreign policy under the Trump administration going forward what I'm not sure I have the best pulse on the latest palace intrigue in terms of of you know who would be after that I mean I think you know seeing who else is in the foreign policy world certainly is you know something that he would consider it's a he seems to yeah so you know I'm not sure exactly what other names would be out there I don't know but I wouldn't dare try to go you know spelunking into the mindset of Donald Trump and who he would want if Mike Pompeo is not confirmed uh the short answer though is if Pompey has not confirmed that the current acting secretary John Sullivan who's the number two in the building would continue on as a Secretary of State and he's a reasonable person and a careerist but potentially other nominees they've talked about including nikki Haley and then beyond that we don't know potentially Tom cotton who's never met a war that he didn't like yeah Jason burger is from San Diego California on the AUMF I was wondering Thea's can touch on has any polling been done do you guys know what the reaction would because this seems like with all the partisanship it seems like one of the things where you have a you know ron paul is agreeing with barbara lee who's agreeing with Tulsi Gabbard it's like a left and right but then the middle it tends to be really quiet on this so Congress seems to want to stay in Congress most of them at least and that's how they're voting recently so what's what do the polls say is to do they do people actually want an AUMF or do they think the president could as the commander-in-chief just go out and keep doing what he's doing I think it's a great question I'm so happy that you mentioned the bipartisanship because it is an area where it is not uncommon for example in the house side to have you know Barbara Lee and Walter Jones doing an event together about War Powers or you know on Yemen recently you had senator Sanders and Mike Lee doing an event together to around Yemen and authorization from force there and this is an area where you see some bipartisanship and I will tell you in it not directly relate to polling but I have been pleasantly surprised at for the lack of a better term the name ID of AUMF and I think because of the never-ending seemingly never-ending Wars people are aware of this this AUMF and yeah I mean look everybody's not everybody but people are a lot more hawkish when they don't have to vote on it and I think that people know that how one voted for the war in Iraq right that's gonna be in everybody's obituary who voted on it and as such people tend to be a little less than I don't know if we want to vote but people want to see Congress getting skin in the game and taking these votes and debating where we are sending young women and men and certainly something we work to lift up every single thing I think the real challenge for Andy gets elected it's gonna be what does the AUMF actually authorize which conflict how broad how long and I think this is the reason that Congress has avoided having this debate thus far because to deal with Isis there's this question of like well they cross borders do we cross them to do we stay until they're defeated what does defeat look like should we be involved in fight against all terrorism iranian-backed terrorism terrorism that's only threatening the United States I don't think that people have a good sense and are not being forced to narrow down what is America's national security interest here so that we can be very precise about exactly what it is that we're trying to fight but that's exactly why I think it's so important that we have candidates and members of Congress for strong national security and foreign policy background we know we want people in Congress that can actually talk about these issues with real substance and and real intelligence and be able to convey that to not only their constituents but they'll have for these types of forceful debates you know where we can have real discussions about that and then they can go toe-to-toe with your experts and diplomats and members of the executive branch to be able to hold them accountable so that's why I'm really excited about doing this and like I said as somebody who has a joint military base in my district you know if the like I want to make sure that I have that saying that we are defining that and we were giving as much transparency to that process hi my name is Elliot Davis and I'm a sophomore studying at Duke University my questions that you missed one of the questions earlier discussed in the panel was come November of 2018 if you have Democrats taking back the house in the Senate what would be different and you focus more on the political change which is really important but I'd like to hear a little bit more about the policy change of what bills would make the it to the President's desk and what policies would actually be enacted before 2020 thank you well you know I think some of that's gonna depend on how the Senate does as well and seeing how you know how how this plays out across the board I mean what I would like to see for instance and I won't diverge too far from the topic of this discussion but you know I think that when I go around my district and talk to voters about what's on their mind making sure that we're talking about a positive agenda as well you know what I hear a lot about is infrastructure your jobs things that we can do working together we all recognize that our country needs to have a new foundation for our 21st century economy something that's gonna propel us forward to have a real vision for what that next phase of our economy in our country is so you know I would love for us to be able to find ways to have agreement on infrastructure ways where we can address key issues like the opioid crisis that you know is killing hundreds of people you know every day in this country I think the way I see it is when we talk about national security so much what we're talking about here is foreign policy right but I think venture to guess a lot of us would agree you know for me the opioid crisis is a national security crisis for me climate change is a national security crisis for me you know so much of what we're faced with goes back to that core issue why it is I got into the work I'm doing and what national security means to us and I hope that that kind of framework allows us to find better avenues for bipartisanship you know being very you know being mindful of the fact that if elected I know that President Trump still gonna be in the Oval Office and that's gonna affect the kind of legislation that's get passed and eventually turned into law so you know I hope some of those issues are ones that we're gonna be able to make progress on but that's gonna really be dependent on you know what shakes out in both the House and the Senate and what the atmosphere is and I hope that the can people sent a clear message that they want to have a Washington that is focused on them and not that hyper-partisanship that we've been seeing so far please I'm Jonah Klein Burton I'm a student at Washington University and I guess I'm wondering you mentioned that vets had endorsed a lot of down ballot and local candidates as well so if they win how do you see people with progressive values and being veterans affecting the foreign policy discourse at the local level well to the point that was made earlier that you know a foreign policy is a very local issue and if you're a state senator or a mayor or a city council person and you have a military base close bad that's obviously gonna be very effective very affected by our international relationship foreign policy you know I think another thing that people when you talk about the Korean Peninsula you know obviously there are very important conversations on what that a war there would look like in terms of lives lost but I think that you know and there's another angle of this conversation of what does that look like in terms of treasure the number of South Korean businesses that have factories and plants all over the United States of America and all of a sudden if the Korean Peninsula is engulfed in flames what happens to these thousands of people in the United States who work at Samsung and all of a sudden and that's not happening so very much on a local level you know those city council races mayoral States in at state house yeah that dads are definitely involved with foreign policy and look at the same time if you're running for states in it now there's a chance that you're gonna want to run for the United States Congress down the road so the more and more we have veterans getting engaged progressive veterans getting engaged the more and more will build that out for the long term because you have to remember you know in like I said earlier the number of veterans who are in Congress right now has basically never been lower it was and as Vietnam veterans begin to retire you know it will be Iraq and after understand veterans and those of that similar era who will be coming in to those places and eventually hopefully getting back to the point where we have more and more veterans in office debating these issues of war and peace want to make sure we get to all the questions here so maybe two of you can share your questions this round hi I'm rabbi Pam wax from the Bronx I want to follow up on that veteran question are we also seeing vets who are running as Republicans number one number two what is the pulse of vets in general whether they are voting more Democrat these days and for mr. Kim to address what makes you a Democrat as opposed to a Republican having worked and for both under both I would the first part of your question yeah no worries hi my name is Susan Davi I work for the friends Committee on national legislation which is a Quaker peace and social justice Lobby my question goes back to something you touched on earlier the difference between the mixed campaign trail signals were sometimes it was very bellicose and then sometimes it was very much we want to get out whereas now it's really been solidified that it's much more the bellicose aggressive type of foreign policy and you said that you think that that message has been heard loud and clear by voters but do you really think that that message has been heard by Trump's support base because a lot of people did vote for him thinking that we would be getting out of conflicts but this seems to be the opposite of getting involved in more and more thank you because could you answer that the last question first yeah so on this question of trumps bellicosity I feel like one of the things that we saw over the weekend with these serious strikes was actually a really negative reaction from his base where Laura Ingraham and Alex Jones of Infowars were very much against these strikes and worried about getting pulled into another war so it'll be interesting to see how trump reacts to that while at the same time he's getting pushed into this bellicosity bye-bye Bolton at base though he's a bully he wants to threaten and yell but he doesn't actually want to get into the fight so a country is willing to say you want to go we'll go right like then he's gonna back down and you saw that reaction from China on the tariffs and you see that reaction from the Russians on Syria so I think that when he's faced with real consequences of actually having the u.s. get its nose bloodied in the process like many bullies he just doesn't want to do it and he's gonna back down then too the first part is a question it's on the pulse of veterans in general are the Republicans running and are there more veterans voting so you ask other veterans who are running with Republicans as well yes in terms of where veterans are politically we are seeing a huge number big-time enthusiasm among veterans in the progressive space especially in the wake of the election of Donald Trump a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of mobilization around yes these foreign policy issues but also a lot around domestic policy issues veterans leading the charge against the idea of having military parades or arming schoolteachers so on and so forth and this foreign policy area is definitely a certain another one I think you know the issue of the day where that is being very seen are huge numbers of veterans speaking out the idea of a secretary state might mop a one because this is a worn peace issue but at the same time that Mike Pompeo and being the idea of a Secretary of State Pompeo is counter to the values that veterans hold dear this is someone who is a bigot this is someone who supports torture this is someone who is anti reproductive health who doesn't believe in climate change so on and so forth and we are hearing from huge numbers of veterans all across the country speaking out against Mike Pompeo and the idea of him being the next Secretary of State and the face of our nation to the rest of the world yeah for me I often think through this the the final experience that I had at the the White House actually the last time I was there is at the end of my service there in the Obama ministry and I had this incredible opportunity of being able to take my parents who I told you the story about what they went through in their life and walked them into the Oval Office and introduce them to President Obama the president United States while I was holding my then four month old baby boy in my hand and you know three generations of my family in the Oval Office meeting the president I think about that a lot because I think that as that's America you know that's the America that I love so much and when I think about everything that it took to get our family to that moment about immigration about the fact that I did my entire education K through 12 in the public school systems in New Jersey when I think about my father being a polio survivor and both my parents being in the medical field and teaching me that without your health you don't have the opportunities for the American dream you don't have those types of efforts act and get you to that next stage and that mobility so for me those are the values that make me a Democrat make me proud to be a Democrat I'm proud to be running in this cycle doing what we can to be able to push forward this isn't about this vote or that vote to me it's it's really at the core of just what do I believe are the values that drive me that have given my family opportunities that have helped my district and I truly believe that those are the values that we're trying to push forward right now so I do want to see we can get all the rest of questions so just if you could keep it really short rapid-fire we'll take these four questions and then we'll try to answer them please go ahead hi my name is Noah Redlich I'm a freshman student studying at Harvard University and during the campaign trail President Trump as was said earlier challenged the foreign policy establishment said he wanted to get out of NATO or pull out of NATO he wanted to withdraw troops from the Middle East but as president I would argue he's done the exact opposite he's sent more troops to Afghanistan he's kept us involved in the war in Yemen and he's now sent airstrikes into Syria so is your message on the campaign trail the Trump has been too hawkish and he's been too much relying on these hawkish voices in the establishment like Bolton or he's been too isolationist and too outside the mainstream thank you thank you hi I'm Joseph Ellis luck I'm a senior at Sharon high school and I was interested in mr. Kim talked about the culture in the military that regardless of politics the military is able to establish one goal and really get it done and I think at a time when veterans in America dine at home more than the dine overseas how can we get more vitamin voices in to get bipartisanship in Congress and in our politics thank you my question is really for Mickey my name is furry Chris I had a trust a small trust do you believe that campaign finance reform that was championed by McCain and Feingold for years is dead and secondly have you discovered in your in your surveys that you do that the right wing elements of both parties are the ones that have precedence and moderate Republicans have no place in the Republican Party moderate Democrats have no place in the Democratic Party thank you last question hi I'm Lloyd truffle man from Westchester New York listening to this panel has been great because there's a certain amount of optimism that I'm feeling maybe others of us are feeling in terms of this blue wave that seems to be rising but yet with regards to foreign policy my question is you look Trump's approval rating since the day he came in has been staying there at 40% of those people supporting him and nothing that's been going on really has changed it much most Americans are not engaged in foreign policy on any level if you ask them to name an ambassador or the Secretary of State they wouldn't know so I'm just wondering you know are we being a little bit too inside the beltway a little bit too optimistic about chances for the the midterm elections or should we be maybe a little bit more concerned especially in light of the basic destruction of the of the of the news media and and common ground around that so I guess I'm asking should we be more worried and if so what really can we do to try and push things in a progressive direction so thank you all for these great questions you could do you think you could speak to this question you know Trump started as isolationist now he's looking like a hawk you know what's the right way for candidates just Chicken Hawk and if you could also I don't have anybody would like to take the campaign finance reform question um so just really quickly on that Trump is he a hawk or is he's an actual agent and then I'll talk about that moderates and campaign finance reform um I think it's really I don't know that he knows what he is on any given day right he wakes up he's one thing by the end of the day he's something else the tweets are all over the place which makes them really hard to run against as one or the other but the bigger problem is he's just incredibly erratic and that is really dangerous for our allies and adversaries alike not to know where the United States stands right you need to know where we stand as a nation the American people need to know where we stand as a nation and he's extreme in both directions and it's just really damaging to our credibility around the world and here at home that he's just all over the place but I think that that's reflective of the question about the rise of the extremes on either end and the lack of a voice for the moderates what we've seen on social media what we've seen in the Trump era is there is extreme polarization in the two political parties where people are becoming less interested they're so angry they're less interested in finding that common ground and the country faces some really big problems that need solutions we can't just yell at each other and it can't be a zero-sum game on solutions and so then the question becomes where are those pragmatic voices who are willing to sit down with people who disagree with them and say all right where is our common ground where can we find some compromise where can we find a place where we can move forward on these on these problems and the challenge when the electorate is so extreme that they only want people who are going to be a hundred percent in agreement with them and not recognize that this is a country that the basic structure is about compromise and moving forward it's about finding common solutions it's a big and complicated country and so if we don't find a place for those moderates who can say hey I am willing to work with you on trying to find a solution and maybe it's not a hundred percent solution but maybe it's 75 percent let's do let's book the progress we can get today and move on if we're not willing as Americans to elect those kinds of people then we're really in trouble and trying in terms of trying to find solutions if I could say it seems like a lot of a lot of folks have made this point that if we elect more veterans veterans who have served together in Iraq and Afghanistan towards a common mission they're going to find more middle ground is that your take how do you view that I do think that yes there is a level of Asprey de corps that exists between veterans and I think that you see that on the hill and some of the bipartisan groups and caucuses that some of the veterans are very much involved with I do think though that it's important to always remember that you know we don't want to go out and elect veterans for the sake of electing veterans but elect veterans who celebrate ideals which we believe in like I said earlier I mean Roy Moore is a Vietnam veteran I sure as hell will work to get him elected to the US in it right um Mike Pompeo graduated top of his class at West Point he's a veteran now I don't think he ought to be Secretary of State but what I do think we should do is work to find veterans who again hold on to those ideals and share those ideals that we hold dear and work and do everything we can to get them elected to office the first point you asked about Donald Trump look I think there's a real question in this country right now and I don't mean to try to gild the lily and say that we were before that but right now if you are a head of a foreign nation the United States can do you cannot trust what the president United States says to you and I think that that is a real thing that makes this time in which we were living right now so incredibly dangerous the last thing to your point about veterans and the issues veterans are facing at home one of the things I work to lift up every single day is the fact that there is not an issue being debated that does not affect veterans because veterans are part of society like anyone else you've mentioned you know like Economic Opportunity there is a veteran class in the United States it's fundamentally part of the working class I did not serve in Iraq with anyone named Trump or Koch right I served with people from the working class who have returned to the working class so when you look at these domestic policy issues they are all very much veterans issues the farm bill is being debated right now that includes funding for snap right 1.5 million veterans household turned to SNAP benefits last year 23,000 active-duty households fight for 15 is being debated well one in five veterans in this country are in a minimum-wage job to them fight over a livable wage is very much a veterans issue we can go on and on and on and again I cannot stress enough that there is not an issue being debated and if you check out vote vets you can always figure out how we are communicating how those issues impact veterans and military families and Andy I wanted to say for you this question are we being too optimistic our folks take him for granted certain outcomes how would you respond well I would say now is the time for this kind of optimism you know we need that hope you know we need that belief that things can be better and for me you know I had this experience when I worked in the Situation Room where you know we were getting word of this tens of thousands of Yazidis fleeing up to the top of Sinjar Mountain with Isis in hot pursuit and I think about that a lot because you know we went through that process of seeing a potential genocide of the ezd people we were able to find people to work together come up with a way in which with 24 hours we had air drops tens of thousands of pounds of food water shelter material dropped on a mountain on the other side of the world deep in enemy territory I saw what our country can do when we put our minds to it and when we focus on that mission there's a reason why we have these this global leadership in this global power and I'm optimistic because I've seen a better cover I've seen a government that can inspire a government that you deserve and for me what I see right now they answer some of those questions I mean what we see is a is just a lack of strategy a lack of vision for what we need on the foreign policy side and when even though you know even though people in my district might not be able to name who are the cabinet members on foreign policy what they can tell and see on a visceral basis everyday is the sheer dysfunction in what's happening right now in Washington go ahead and when I just just finished off on that is that it's comes down to this question do you feel like you're in good hands do you feel like if there's a major crisis that this government that this Congress that this administration is gonna be able to do things in a way that you will feel in good hands and that you will feel like they will approach that in the way that you want them to approach it and I think that's the issue so even if they don't know John Boehner or Pompey or you know some of the other key figures what I can tell you is they know what they see and they don't want that dysfunction and I think that's what a lot of this is gonna be about so I say stay optimistic we have that hope because we can and deserve a better government and we do know I was put a safe one to your point because I know I can I think one of the things I'm picking up what you're saying is one of the most difficult parts of the time which we're living right now is finding oneself trapped to live almost in a vortex of opposition of constantly only talking about those things to which one is a post and I think it's very important whether you're running for office or just an engaged citizen to help make that in optimism stay alive to keep that fire burning is yes to keep talking about those things to which we are opposed there's no shortage of them but also remembering to constantly be lifting up those things which we believe in as well so that's just I wanted to pick you back a little bit on that it's a fantastic place to wrap up I'll just leave where we started which is I think there are two stories to this year and there's a story of a lot of the concerns we had a lot of the concerns we raised we all know how much is at stake I also think we debated a little bit about whether this is going to be a national security election whatever happens whatever issues are in the background I think it already is I think that that one of the storylines that's gonna happen in 2018 is we have seen an extraordinary number of candidates who have run in part because of their background in service and national security and foreign policy and and that is connected with voters and they have run in part because they care deeply about these issues we're incredibly fortunate to be seeing this in is a huge number of candidates that are running with that background and that passion in that commitment and it gives me a lot of hope for what we're gonna see next year if we can its the optimism point if we all do our part and we do see a transformation of Congress I don't think we've seen a number of candidates like this over the past several years I think there are reasons and people have been building to this over a long time I think it's it's helpful to view that in a frame in the through the lens of J Street's ten-year anniversary all the work and that has been done and I think it also keys up to the next conversation is gonna be happening in this room about how the policy shift has happened in Congress over the last ten years again because of all the work that people have done here on year cycle and cycles so thank you all for this incredible discussion thank you for participating with great questions thank you to our panelists I put this wonderful back and forth and I will just invite everybody to hang around for that next conversation including another of our endorsed candidates and see Soderberg

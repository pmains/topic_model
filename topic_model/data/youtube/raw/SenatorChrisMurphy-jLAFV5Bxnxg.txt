Thank You mr. chairman thank you both for joining us here today the civil war in Syria has now raged on for more than eight years huge swathes of the country are decimated millions have been displaced though the crisis may have faded from the headlines it's in part due to the fact that the international community has just accepted these tragic events as the new normal Syria is now where international law and the rules of war have gone to die war crimes once considered unthinkable and outrageous the bombing of hospitals chemical weapons attacks are now commonplace the administration has declared three goals of our US policy there the defeat of Isis political settlement and then their withdrawal of Iranian commanded forces but at the same time that we supposedly want to accomplish these big goals the administration has cut stabilization aid to Syria pulled out non-military officials such as start forward largely been m.i.a on negotiations in Geneva and sought to push off the Syria file on our partners rather than then lead and I think it's an incredibly important time for us to consider this very very well-timed report I also think it's time for us to admit that our policy in Syria over the course of two administrations has been a failure and we need to do some post-mortem about the overall lessons learned it's clear that our policy has failed and despite the Obama administration's significant covert military support for forces opposing Assad the war has continued to rage for over eight years our decision to provide the rebels with enough support to keep going but not enough to actually defeat Assad served to drag this war out and kill thousands more innocent people than had we limited our involvement at the outset a similar argue that our mistake was not intervening sooner which would have kept Russia and Iran out of the Syrian theater forced Assad to step down and allowed for a political process to move forward it would be nice to think that US military inventions could accomplish these worthy objectives unfortunately mr. chairman history provides scant examples of where the u.s. directly intervened in a foreign civil war and achieved its policy goals these types of intervention always sound good on paper but often end up getting us bogged down into a quagmire as they confront the messy reality of insurgencies imperfect partners unreliable intelligence and unintended consequences sometimes military restraint though it may feel unsavory in the face of evil it's sometimes the best policy if our action will ultimately create new problems than it solves I hope we're able to talk about these broader realities as well as the path forward inside Syria itself we have a lot to discuss today and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses

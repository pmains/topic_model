Thank You mr. Prez let me say that I'll be brief but but I want to go concern and should be a matter of concern to all Americans when new presidents are elected they've always been given the opportunity to put their team in place in short order now regrettably this has not been allowed to happen for this new president in this Congress and and here are the facts now nine months in office President Trump has had only 182 of his nominees confirmed that is an unacceptable unprecedented 39% it's it is a low statistic grossly low statistic by historical standards when at this point in President Obama's administration 65% of his nominees had been confirmed at this point in george w bush's administration fifty-three had been percent had been confirmed under Bill Clinton 76% had been concerned confirmed and under President George HW Bush 70% and yet because of delaying tactics by our colleagues across the aisle this president who needs a team in place as every president has done has only 39 percent of his nominees in office this has been done through an abuse of the process beeping pardon me by our friends across the aisle a distortion of the rules requiring cloture on non-controversial nominees we're requiring well-qualified nominees to be subjected to a 30 hour debating period for a motion to proceed and another 30 hour debating period typically where there's only silence on the floor of the Senate for the actual confirmation now this is inconvenient to the administration but it's it's injurious to the American people with more than a thousand executive positions needing confirmation we need these people in place the American people need these people in place to work for the American people right providing hurricane relief there are people who would be part of the administration working on that had we not had these delaying tactics critical national security positions people who are fighting against Isis are waiting for confirmation and people who would be part a key part of the counter terrorism efforts are waiting four months to get work now we we had a spate of this in July and I was one of several senators who called on the leadership to just keep us in session in August to to take care of some of these and we demonstrated by the action of the majority leader that by canceling part of the August break we could break log jams as of the end of July we only have 56 Trump nominees confirmed by keeping us in session for one extra week and taking away our work period back home we confirmed 76 nominees in one week as opposed to 56 the previous six months of this year we can do that again and and I would simply say to you mr. president and to my colleagues on this side of the aisle and on the other side of the aisle I am among those calling on the majority leader once again to adopt an aggressive schedule that includes working all night that includes working weekends and including includes canceling some breaks we need once again to break this logjam the American people spoke in November and through our democratic process they elected Donald Trump as president United States he deserves the same consideration from minority members of the current Senate that previous presidents Democrat and Republican got from minority members of the Senate free the process up eliminate the distortion of the rules let's have a more aggressive schedule and let's once again break this logjam and I yield the floor

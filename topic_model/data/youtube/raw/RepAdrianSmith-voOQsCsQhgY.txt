Thank You chairman Thompson for calling today's hearing and certainly thank you to our panel of witnesses I'm glad we're having a hearing on ways we can improve the tax code for families and small businesses rather than wasting time on a rush to impeachment which seems to be a high priority among some members the tax cuts and Jobs Act was transformative legislation to provide tax relief to middle-class families fix our broken tax code and make American workers and companies competitive against foreign counterparts whose tax systems had become vastly more attractive to investment in growth tcj helped working families by doubling the standard deduction and increasing the child credit including its refundable portion much more than that the real impact on working Americans of tcga along with the deregulatory actions of this administration has been strong economic growth and the historic job market markedly in decreasing unemployment increasing wages and creating opportunity for all Americans including those on the bottom rung I strongly disagree with those calling for even deeper wealth redistribution such as vastly increasing refundable credits and moving towards seventy percent or even ninety percent marginal rates even President Obama understood the importance of reforming that the corporate tax code and lowering the corporate rate however we weren't going to reform the code only for large corporations and leave our families and small businesses behind there is broad agreement we should continue to work to modernize our tax code and that temporary tax policy it's not optimal for anyone families businesses or even us as policymakers families and small businesses shouldn't have to spend an entire calendar year wondering whether expired tax provisions will be reinstated retro actively in the 115th Congress we took a number of steps in an effort to address temporary tax policy first this subcommittee held an extensive hearing which provided stakeholders and interested parties the opportunity to step forward and discuss the future of these provisions more than 20 parties have appeared before the subcommittee to begin this conversation I encourage our colleagues who are new to this committee to review that hearing record second we attempted to address concerns about temporary policy through two pieces of legislation as part of tax reform 2.0 the House passed legislation to make permanent the tax relief provided to families and small businesses in the tax cuts and Jobs Act I have not spoken to a single colleague who helped to pass tcj who wouldn't have preferred to enact permanent policy in 2017 but unfortunately the Senate lacked the votes to make that happen in one of our witness as one of our witnesses will point out we would see even more growth if these provisions of tcj were made permanent and finally toward the end of last year the House passed legislation to address the two dozen so-called tax extenders which expired at the end of 2017 in particular we should credit stakeholders interested in the short line railroad and biodiesel tax credit for stepping forward and bringing us constructive ideas to help provide long-term certainty to those provisions these short line and biodiesel proposals followed on a previous round of tax extenders where we were able to make several provisions permanent and find long-term solutions to the wind and solar tax credits recognizing those industries were reaching a point where taxpayer subsidies were no longer necessary for their viability it is particularly disappointing we couldn't complete our work on extenders last year because these industries which worked with us in good faith are now in their 15th month without an extension and with no solution in sight as this conversation moves forward I believe we can continue to work together to find bipartisan solutions regarding the remaining extenders we look forward to working across the aisle to provide relief from uncertainty first in the short term but ultimately we hope for the long term I yield back

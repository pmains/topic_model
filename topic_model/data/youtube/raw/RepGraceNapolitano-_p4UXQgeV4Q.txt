well congresswoman napolitano madam chairwoman distinguished members of congress ladies and gentlemen thank you for uh your time and everyone welcome to those heroes those of you here in the room and those joining us virtually to what we are calling a long long overdue recognition for a very special leader for those of you joining us virtually my name is lieutenant general scott spellman i'm the commander for the u.s army corps of engineers and i am proud come on in sir i'm proud to be here today in the halls of congress to present this year's gold to flurry medal to a woman who has dedicated her life to improving the lives of all americans and that is of course congresswoman grace napolitano the de fleury medal has a long and proud history in the us army and certainly in the engineer regiment and instead of me reciting all of that history here for you this morning what we've decided to do we have a short six minute video that talks to the significance in the history of this award so karen if you could play the video please i am lieutenant general scott spellman 55th chief of engineers and commanding general of the u.s army corps of engineers i'm coming to you today from stony point new york on the banks of the hudson river it was at this location in july of 1779 that one of the heroes of our regiment lieutenant colonel francois de fleury exhibited exceptional leadership under fire and was later recognized by the continental congress who even had a medal struck in his honor the de fleury medal was named in honor of francois louis to cedra de fleury a french military engineer serving in the continental army in 1777 de fleury volunteered to serve with the american army in our fight for independence from britain the continental congress appointed the fleury a captain of engineers and quickly proving himself in brandywine he was promoted to lieutenant colonel on june 1st 1779 the british captured stony point new york on the western side of the hudson river and for planks point directly across the river to the east possession of the two strategic forts brought a key part of the river under enemy control and also threatened the americans position at west point located less than 15 miles upriver after reinforcing stony point the british commander regarded it as a little gibraltar recognizing the danger general washington planned a daring surprise assault on the night of july 15th through the 16th he ordered a recently formed light infantry corps led by brigadier general mad anthony wayne to attack stony point before consisted of four battalions colonel christian old denmark fevenger led the first battalion with the flurry as second in command on july 15th the corps except for a small diversionary force unloaded weapons and turned in their ammunition secrecy was so tight the troops did not know they were going to attempt to recapture stony point for such a risky assault surprise was vital and the attack was to take place in total darkness fixed bayonets and hand-to-hand combat were the orders of the day the continentals launched a two-prong attack on the fortress the fleury led the assault up the rocky southern slope first over the wall the flurry was followed by a wave of american bayonets rushing to the flagpole the fleury cut the british colors from their staff just after midnight the 29 year old defleury single-handedly struck the colors of the british 17th regiment of foot by 2 am general wayne triumphantly wrote to washington saying the ford and garrison are ours our officers and men behaved like men who are determined to be free so it was that on october 1st 1779 the flurry stood before the continental congress to be praised for his valor at stony point for his intrepid behavior the continental congress ordered that a medal be struck in his honor on the obverse of the medal is the latin inscription translated as a memorial and reward for courage and boldness on the reverse again in latin fortifications marshes enemies overcome beneath the fort is the legend stony point carried by storm july 15 1779 today the hallmarks of the army engineer regiment stand on twin pillars supporting combat operations and building vital infrastructure in the united states the regiment currently consists of two elements the 91 000 army engineer soldiers serving in active duty reserve and national guard troop units and the 35 000 largely civilian members of the u.s army corps of engineers under the leadership of the chief of engineers the combined engineer team provides engineering expertise to the army in response to the nation's toughest challenge in 1989 the engineer regiment adopted the defleury medal as a symbol to recognize today's engineer achievements because of the shared values demonstrated by the man for whom it was struck the engineer regiment makes four award levels of the de fleury medal steel bronze silver and gold number one the gold medal the united states army chief of engineers is the only person authorized to award the gold medal each year to an individual whose contributions to the u.s army corps of engineers and the army engineer regiment exemplify boldness courage and commitment to a strong national defense starting in 2011 two gold medals are awarded annually one to an individual outside the regiment and of national prominence and one to an individual inside the regiment the credit for today's de fleury award program goes to major general daniel r schroeder who in 1989 was the commanding general of fort leonard wood and u.s army engineer school commandant he wanted an award that would tie together the history of contributions of the army regiment the u.s army corps of engineers and the birth of our great nation today the u.s army engineer association is the arbiter of the de fleury medal program the first gold to flurry metal recipient was honorable john o marsh jr the secretary of the army in 1989 the most recent recipients are major general retired randall castro and congresswoman grace napolitano of california because values have special meaning to our engineer soldiers and those who support them it is only appropriate that our premier engineer award represent a soldier who served violently during the birth of our great nation and we saw those values on full display 242 years ago right here on stony point and lieutenant colonel francois de fleury essay ons army strong building strong well ladies and gentlemen that's why this award is special to the u.s army engineer regiment i will just add to the history that we showed in the video there that colonel francois de fleury returned to france and was given command of a regiment to fight alongside napoleon and was wounded in a retreat from waterloo and following that he retired to civilian life but madam chairman i want you to know that when we presented your name to the award committee the votes came back unanimous and i'd just like to tell everyone why and i'll tell it this way i've i've had the opportunity to testify before you and your committee on a number of occasions as we work to develop water water resource development acts i know we're working on word 22 at the moment i've had the opportunity to work alongside you on projects that are important in in your district california's 32nd district whether it be the whittier narrows dam safety project update of water control manuals forecast and form reservoir operations and and many others and i would just say that what is special about miss napolitano is that she not only cares deeply about projects in her district as she should and she forces us to keep our pencil sharp but she also cares greatly about the infrastructure across this nation and ma'am that that is evidenced by the tools and authorities that you fight for for the army corps of engineers so that not only can we do our work better in la but we can do it better across the country for everyone so with that we we thank you that's a a rare quality that has not gone unnoticed with the now 38 000 men and women of the army corps of engineers and that's why we want to give you this very special recognition i'll tell everyone we say our vision in the army corps of engineers is to engineer solutions for our nation's toughest challenges and madam chairwoman you give us the tools and authority to do that each and every day and we want to thank you for that and with that madam chairman i'm going to ask you to come forward and i'm going to ask katie to come forward and read the certificate

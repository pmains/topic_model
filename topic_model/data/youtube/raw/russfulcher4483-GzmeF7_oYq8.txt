you'll hear a lot of people talk about stem science technology engineering and math but I've actually lived it I've got an undergraduate degree I've got a graduate degree I've got engineering training all within Idaho institutions and I believe more people need to have similar opportunities you'll see from my website that I've got a plan to save some money and and without raising taxes we can take some of that money and we can enhance stem training opportunities for students in Idaho you can do that through dual credit opportunities so that students can get college credit while going to school in high school you can offer more scholarships for science technology engineering and math and some resources for universities and colleges to enhance their stem training capabilities by doing so then you offer enhancements to grow your economy with higher wage jobs and as the governor of this state I can do that

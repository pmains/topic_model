a director Olsen Fort Hood occurred not too far from my district I went to the memorial service the West report just recently came out for the past well since the tragic incident it's been downplayed first it was a workplace violence incident senior intelligence officials including your predecessor downplayed the email exchanges between mr. us on an l lackey which always concerned me since then we found out that the San Diego Joint Terrorism Task Force pleaded with the Washington field office to respond to this as they saw it threat the WFO responded that this he's doing research we can't investigate her by looking at websites in it in one documentation that this was a politically sensitive issue i think that failure to contact the DoD resulted in the deaths of 13 soldiers and the next to 911 the biggest terrorist attack on American soil real briefly one of these emails particularly literally outlines exactly what major Assad did and it's a one on may 27th 2009 and at the end of it he says so I would assume that suicide bombers whose aim is to kill enemy soldiers or their helpers but also kill innocents in the process is acceptable I mean there is a huge red flag in this email I you know as a former DOJ prosecutor working with JTTF I can't imagine I can see San Diego's concern and I can't imagine why wfo did not give that greater attention do you have any response I can say congressman obviously the the Webster report an extensive study of exactly how focused on the FBI how the FBI responded I know that the director of the FBI and has indicated that a number of the recommendations from the web support are being implemented in terms of changes to information sharing technology and policies I mean I can say as a personal level also as a former prosecutor at NCTC the fort hood shooting along with the 2009 abdul mutalib attempted attack are sort of seminal events for us as far as trying to learn what we can from those lessons I mean those are hard learned lessons but we need to continue to be vigilant to do better at at spotting those types of indicators and sharing that information appropriately I was sure hope so when you get a major on a major base and the United States talking to the number two terrorists in the world and that's not transmitted to the general in the commanding officer in charge of Fort Hood I think that is absolutely unacceptable and in particularly have to read these emails I feel misled that senior intelligence officials misled the Congress by downplaying the extent and the importance and significance of these these emails and I see my time is expired time John was expired the gentlelady from Callaway as I did gentleman from California mr. Richardson is recognized for five minutes

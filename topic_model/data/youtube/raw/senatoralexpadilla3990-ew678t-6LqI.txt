for more I want to bring in Senator Alex Padilla from California he's a member of the Judiciary Committee center it's always a pleasure to see you on this day where there's been two major decisions from the Supreme Court I want to start with these two decisions the EPA decision and the the decision on remain in Mexico what do you how do you see things well obviously you should look back with you uh look the uh decision on the Romanian Mexico program uh unexpected but we will take it and let it serve as a reminder as the panel is discussing Congress needs to act our immigration system remains broken there's too much uncertainty we recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of the DACA program we get hundreds of thousands of dreamers are still in limbo because of pending mitigation we had this case moving forward we have the title 42 debate that's still happening so a lot of work that still needs to happen and Congress needs to act in the interest of not just immigrant communities but in the interest of our economy and we're going to play such a an important role in so many essential sectors as essential workers uh that this needs to remain a priority and we need to act sooner rather than later uh and look on the other decision coming from California it's a big book to our climate policy uh that's uh you know a reminder that Congress needs to act because California is exhibit a in the climate crisis Senator you know I I you have been one of the few people who consistently and clearly mention and discuss the issue that there are two sides of a very important story there is the immigration reform or immigration situation and then there's the humanitarian crisis on On the Border people who are trying to come to this country to ask for Asylum it's a petition not even being allowed to do that then there's immigration reform and you're talking about DACA and you're talking about the 11 million people who have been here many of them for decades participating and contributing to our economy and yet so I I always I'm very grateful that you are very clear and in your definitions of things but let's talk about MPP there's an MPP 2.0 that Eleanor was talking about that the bite Administration has instituted because of this uh situation in the Supreme Court I what should now be the policy on the border to deal with this humanitarian crisis senator the first we've got to remind ourselves and everybody around us somebody coming from any other country to seek asylum in the United States is allowed under not just our federal laws but international law it is not a crime to seek Asylum but our Asylum system is broken we do need a border that is safe we do need a border that is orderly but we also need a border that is Humane and that is what was lacking under the prior Administration and the Supreme Court ruling today and hopefully a similar uh conclusion to the title 42 debate I think can push this Administration in that direction that's that's the bottom line Senator let's talk a little bit more broadly about this session overall do you see a pattern in this particular Court's decision making I'm very concerned I mean despite the decision on the remaining Mexico program here this morning we saw what the Supreme Court did years ago when it came to voting rights but just this session alone the extreme wing of the conservative wing of the Supreme Court uh doing 50 years of protection of Roe v Wade the decision on the concealed carry case out of New York rolling back gun safety at the worst possible time in the wake of the Uvaldi tragedy among others and now this uh ruling that undermines the federal government's ability to tackle the climate crisis which is real existential and here today at the Pres clear on Present Danger not something theoretic for 15 20 years from now so uh the Supreme Court has uh at the hurt itself in terms of people having confidence uh in it because of the justification of many of the rulings look at the Roe v rape decision the way they went about that now calls into question so many other rights and protections that we've uh enjoyed for years and so uh Supreme Court reform I think is very much on the table and it will uh also mention this we'll say because there is a bright spot here today is the day that we will see the swearing-in of Justice katanji Brown Jackson so it doesn't tilt the numbers on the Supreme Court but it certainly gives me hope yeah and as a matter of fact of course we're going to be mentioning that today when you talk about Supreme Court reform is on the table what do you mean by that senator uh well look good I know there's a lot of ideas on the table about the Supreme Court we've got to start with accountability we've got to start with ethics you know for uh uh just take one example that most people are uh should be familiar with uh justice Thomas's wife and her involvement with the January 6th Insurrection of last year and then just this is Thomas never choosing himself on cases that stem like from that deadly Insurrection clearly the Supreme Court uh and the justices on the Supreme Court are in need of uh more ethics and accountability and Senator I want to ask you about this tragedy in San Antonio it's the deadliest human smuggling case ever in the U.S 53 people dead they were essentially burned to death inside this tractor trailer no air no water and they're still not able to identify all of them what's your reaction to this I mean my heart's broken it's 53 that's just five minutes it's 53 uh for somebody it was a mother a father a brother a sister a son a daughter and why were they coming to United States so desperate for a better life and better opportunity if they're willing to risk their lives and in this case gave their lives in pursuit of a Dream It's a a tragic example of how broken our immigration systems are two things I got to mention who said number one uh anybody who has a problem with uh irregular migration is what we call it uh then needs to commit to investing in fixing the immigration laws in in the United States so that we have better robust and more orderly uh legal migration people are coming here to work plain and simple talk to any business leader and Economist and they'll tell you there's a labor shortage in America today and it's leading to the inflation that we're all paying price for uh number one number two a lot of my Republican colleagues say well no no no we're not going to address immigration because you've got to punish the cartels whether it's the remain in Mexico program as it existed uh or forcing people to try to come to United States under these daily conditions that is continuing to reward the Bad actors that's that fix our immigration system and improve our economy and by God be the the Humane United States of America that most people around the world uh respect this for or have in the past right and boy I mean Senator you want to talk about punishing the cartels there are hundreds of millions of dollars being made by these human exploiters throughout the area precisely because of the reality of the immigration reality in our country they are making hundreds of millions of dollars off the suffering and yes death of innocent people Senator Alex Bali I thank you for being with us as always thank you have a good day

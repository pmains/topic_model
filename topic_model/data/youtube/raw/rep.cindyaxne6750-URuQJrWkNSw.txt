I will representative Cindy accident plans to unveil a bill today to target a company she calls predatory she sat down exclusively with our Tommy Clarke to share her plan to help Iowa local homeowners Tommy Alec she wants the private equity firm which bought several central Iowa mobile home communities to put people over profit so today she introduced the manufactured housing Community Preservation Act the goal of that bill is to keep these communities affordable the legislation will create a grant program to help purchase mobile home communities while ensuring the seller gets a fair price she's doing this after utah-based company Haven park capital came in and announced their plan to raise rent as high as nearly 70 percent residents protested and got the company to agree to a smaller increase but many say they still can't afford the new charges they do know that this is an interest of folks across the board to make sure that we don't have these predatory practices hurting people in our communities so I think we're going to get a lot of good traction on this and move this agenda forward and stop this type of predatory action that literally is pushing people out of their homes now Haven Park refutes claims of price gouging saying the mobile home parks are in high-growth areas with rising land values I asked representative asked me about that she says it's important to value land but not on the backs of hard-working people

 LEADER. MR. CLYBURN: MADAM SPEAKER, I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT ALL MEMBERS HAVE FIVE LEBLG SLATIVE DAYS TO REVISE AND EXTEND THEIR REMARKS AND INCLUDE EXTRANEOUS MATERIAL ON THE SUBJECT OF OUR SPECIAL OARED. MR. CLYBURN: MADAM SPEAKER, I FIRST GOT INTERESTED IN AND STARTED STUDYING HISTORY BIBLE VERSE, AND EVERY EVENING BEFORE RETIRING TO BED, WE HAD TO SHARE WITH OUR PARENTS A CURRENT EVENT. WE DIDN'T HAVE TELEVISION. AND THEREFORE IN SUMTER, YOU GET THE PAPER IN THE MORNING BUT BACK THEN IT WAS AN AFTERNOON PAPER. AND IT WAS MY INTEREST IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN OF HARRY TRUMAN THAT ATTRACTED ME TO POLITICS. HARRY TRUMAN ASCENDED TO THE PRESIDENCY FROM THE VICE  UP AGAINST THIS SKYON -- THIS SCION THIS BIG-TIME PROSECUTOR FROM NEW YORK, THOMAS DEWEY. ONE CHICAGO NEWSPAPER WAS SOHE , ALL THE VOTES COUNTED, ME. THIS MAN WITH LIMITED EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, A DISABILITY, WITHOUT ANY OF ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF WHAT WOULDTY W. AS WE LOOK BACK ON HISTORY AND PEOPLE CONTINUE TO WRITE ABOUT HISTORY, THEY KEEP UPGRADING TRUMAN. MOST PLACES I SEE NOW HE IS IN THE TOP 10. IN MY. AND I BECAME A FIRM THE PAST, ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT  IT. AND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS ME TO THIS FLOOR TODAY. IT'S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE STAYED HERE ON WHAT WE CALL INTENTLY TODAY AS WE DEBATED THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS A VEHICLE BY WHICH WE WOULD SEND TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION THIS FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT, A BILL THAT THIS BODY APPROVED AND SENT OVER TO THE SENATE AS H.R. 4. AND UPON JOHN HONOR OF JOHN LEW. THAN BODY GRANTED UNANIMOUS CONSENT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. NOW JOHN LEWIS AND I FIRST MET AS 19-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENTS. I WAS IN ORANGEBURG. HE WAS DOWN -- WEEKEND THAT I FIRST MET MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. NOW, AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, AND WE SEE QUITE A BIT OF IT SNCC, AND SCLC THAT WAS BEING RUN BY MARTIN LUTHER KING JR., RALPH ABERNATHY AND OTHERS AND WE ASKED DR. KING TO COME AND MEET WITH US SO WE COULD TRY TO RECONC DR. KING CAME. AND AGREED TO A ONE-HOUR MEETING. THAT MEETING CONVENED AT 10:00 S WELL, I GUESS, BOY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN THE SAME. I STARTED READING EVERYTHING I COULD ABOUT DR. KING. I WENT BACK TO MY CAMPUS AND I GOT HIS BOOK. HIS FIRST BOOK, OVER THE YEARS. AFTER THE 1965 VOTING THE MARCHS WE WERE HAVING. I WAS LIVING IN CHARLES TORN AT THE TIME. MY LATE WIFE AND I. GOT IN OUR LITTLE FALCON AND ME. DR. KING TALKED THAT DAY ABOUT E BACK OF THE BUS. WE MARCHED FOR A LOT OF SOCIAL THINGS. BUT HE SAID TO US ON THAT DAY, IT IS TIME TO MARCH TO THE BALLOT BOXES. MARCH TO THE BALLOT BOXES.RWERE. IN FACT, NOT LONG AGO, THE LOCAL COMMUNITY DECIDED TO HAVE A 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION OF THAT EVENING EVENT AND CALLED ME AND ASKED WOULD I ANNIVERSARY. AND I TOLD HER THE REPORTER, WELL, I THINK I'LL REMINISCE A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT THAT DAY. AND THE SPEECH HE GAVE. AND HE SAYS WELL, DID YOU SEE LE IT THERE. AND OF COURSE HE QUESTIONED ME. WANTED TO KNOW WHAT  WAS SO BAD, UNTIL ON OUR WAY THERE WE HAD TO STOP AND WAIT IT OUT. AND WHEN I GOT THERE, I WAS SURE THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO HAVE A CONDUCIVE FOR THE CONVENTION. THE REPORTER WAS KIND OF QUIET. HUNG UP. A FEW DAYS LATER, THE REPORTER CALLED ME BACK. THE THAT DAY IS PRETTY ACCURATE. I SAID, WELL, I LIVED THROUGH  IT. THE THINGS YOU LIVE THROUGH PAR. MY MOTHER WAS A BEAU TITION -- WITH ME, WE WOULD OFTEN HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT INFORMATION THAT FLOWED THROUGHOUT THE BEAUTY SHOP. IN FACT, I WROTE ABOUT ONE DAY COMING HOME FROM SCHOOL, ONE OF THE RULES WERE THAT HAD GROWN UY MOTHER, IN THE COTTON FIELDS ADJACENT TO THE ONE THAT SHE GREW UP IN OVER IN LEE COUNTY, SOUTH CAROLINA. AND WHEN I WALKED IN, I SPOKE. AND GROWN SINCE I LAST SAW YOU AND, MY GOODNESS, SHE SAID, YOUR VOICE IS BEGINNING TO CHANGE. THEN SHE ASKED ME A QUESTION. WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP.AN AND HOW I HAD DEVELOPED THIS INTEREST IN POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT. AND TOILED HER I WANTED TO GROW -- I TOLD HER I WANTED TO GROW UP AND I WANTED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. THAT LADY LOOKED AT ME AND VERY STERNLY SAID,ULD NOT HAVE THOSE KINDS OF DREAMS -- SUMTER, SOUTH CAROLINA, SHOULD NOT HAVE THOSE KIND OF DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS. IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR A LITTLE BLACK BOY TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF DREAMS. MY MOTHER NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT DAY LET WHAT THAT LADY. YOU CAN BE ABLE TO LIVE OUT YOUR DREAMS AND YOUR ASPIRATIONS. MY. I DIDN'T GET HERE SO TODAY, LOON THAT HISTORY, I RECALL THI CITI. AND OF COURSE FOLLOWING THAT 1866 LAW, SOUTH CAROLINA HELDITU SOME OF WHAT TOOK PLACE IN THAT CONVENTION. THERE ARE TWO THINGS KIND OF INTERESTING ABOUT THE CONVENTION TO ME. NUMBER ONE IS THE MAJORITY OF THE ATTENDEES AT THAT CONVENTION . IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING. THE SECOND ONE IS, THERE WAS AN ATTENDEE AT THAT CONVENTION, ROBERT SMALLS, WHO WASNK. HE WAS A DELEGATE TO THE SOUTH T SMALLS FELT ABOUT SLAVERY. HE DIDN'T LIKE IT. IF HE DID, HE WOULD NOT HAVE ENGINEERED THE ESCAPE. HE WOULD NOT $1500 FOR HAVING DONE SO. AND HE TURNED THATM  NAVY. HE WAS ACTUALLY INDUCTED INTO THE ARMY AND ASSIGNED TO A NAVY SHIP. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SOME SHIPS NOW NAMED FOR ROBERT SMALLS. IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO ROBERT SY HAVE FELT, AFTER ROBERT SMALLS GAINED WEALTH, HE WENT BACK TO SOUTH CAROLINA, WHERE HE WAS BORNED AND RAISED AND WHERE HE HAD BEEN A SLAVE, AND HE BOUGHT THE HOUSE HE HAD BEEN A SLAVE  IN. AND THE MCGEE FAMILY THAT OWNED HIMD BEEN THE HEAD OF AND HE HAD BEEN A SLAVE IN AND NURSED HER, KEPT HER THERE UNTIL HER DEATH. HE FORGAVE, BUT ROBERT SMALLS NEVER FORGOT. HE DIED IN 1915. BASICALLY OF A BROKEN HEART. WHY? BECAUSE ROBERT SMALLS, WHO HAD . NOW IN 1868, JANUARY 14, 1868, IS WHEN HE GOT HIS STATE RIGHTS AS A FULL-FLEDGED AMERICAN 1895T SMALLS GOT ALL OF HIS RIGHTS STATE IN THIS UNITED STATES CAN BE TAKEN AWAY BY THE WHY TO PROE VOTING RIGHTS OF PEOPLE OF  COLOR, IS BEING THREATENED BY THE OTHER BODY OVER THE FILIBUSTER. I HAVE OPINION SER IF. AND THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS PUT AT RISK A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, WE WORKED AROUND THE FILIBUSTER IN ORDER TO RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT SO AS NOT TO RUIN THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CONVENTION THAT TOOK ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS AWAY, IN 1897 GEORGE WASHINGTON MURRAY LEFT THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, BEING THE LASTE FOUR BLACK REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS HOUSE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, THREE OF THEM WERE BLACK. THE VERY FIRST BLACK PERSON EVER ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. I WANT TO CLEAN THAT UP BECAUSE SE LEGISLATIVE BODIES. IT WAS NOT IT WASN'T UNTIL, WHAT, 1913,  WHEN WE CHANGED THE CONSTITUTION IN 1913 TO ALLOW FOR THE POPULAR ELECTION OF SENATORS. SO THE FIRST PERSON HIS HONOR. IT JUST SO HAPPENS IT WAS ON THE 150th ANNIVERSARY OF HIS  ELECTION, WHICH I BELIEVE WAS  DECEMBER 12, IN A SPECIAL  ELECTION, DECEMBER 12, 19 --  1870. AND IT 150. IT'S NOW 1870. 1897, GEORGE WASHINGTON MURRAY  LEFT THISE YOURS TRULY WAS ELECTED IN 1992. 95 YEARS. AND FOR MOST OF THAT TIME -- I  HAVEN'T COUNTED ALL THE DAYS AND THE YEARS, BUT LET ME SAY REPRESENTATION IN THE  LEGISLATURE, AND ZERO  REPRESENTATION IN GOVERNING  BODIES ALL OVER THE STATE. I REMEMBER THE FIRST BLACK IN  SOUTH CAROLINA THAT GOT ELECTED  TO THE COUNTY COUNCIL DOWN IN  BUFORD, SOUTH COUNTRY OF OURS, T WE ARE DOING HERE TODAY IN  ALLOWING STATES TO PASS LAWS  THAT TAKE SUPPRESS WITH ALL THE  VOTE AND SOMEONE DECIDES TO GIVE YOU A BOTTLE OF WATER TO QUENCH  YOUR THIRST, THEY JUST MADE THAT A CRIMINAL ACT. YOU CAN GIVE A BOTTLE OF WATER  TO ANYBODY WALKING THAT. AND THEY WENT EVEN THEY JUST DI. WE GOT 19 STATES -- AND I WANT  TO HASTEN TO ADD HERE -- ALL OF  THEM ARE NOT SOUTHERN STATES. 19 STATES, TWO OF THEM UP  VOTE AND TO NULLIFY THE EFFORTS  OF VOTERS. THAT'S THIRD-WORLD STUFF. THAT'S BANANA REPUBLIC STUFF. THAT IS NOTMY  COLLEAGUES ON THE OER SIDE WAS ARGUING ABOUT AN UPSET -- AND  UPSET BECAUSE SOMEONE IS  COMPARED -- I THINK MAYBE UPSET  WITH THE PRESIDENT.  WE'RE DOING HERE  WITH THESE NEW LEGISLATION --  DOING WITH THESE NEW LAWS, JIM  CROW 2.0. NOW, I AIN'T INTO ALLHIS STUFF SO I DON'T KNOW W THAT. BECAUSE JIM CROW WAS NOT JIM  CROW UNTIL IT BECAME JIM CROW. RECONSTRUCTION -- ONE OF THE WA  MUDDLED. I HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT ME  BEING THE FIRST BLACK  CONGRESSMAN SIE  RECONSTRUCTION. THAT IS NOT TRUE. EIGHT BEFORE L OF US SINCE RECONSTRUCTION. RECONSTRUCTION DIDN'T LAST BUT  ABOUT 12, 13 YEARS, DEPENDING ON THE DATES WHICH YOU WANT TO USE. REC RECONSTRUCTION ENDED IN WENT IN. THE BLACK CODES WENT INTO PLACE. THOSE THINGS, THOSE LAWS,  STARTED WITH THE SUPREME COURT  DECISION IN 1872, COMING OUT OF  LOUISIANA -- KIND OF HOMER PLESSY, WHO WAS A MAN THAT WAS ARRESTED AND FINED $25 FOR  RIDING IN A FOREBIDEN CAR ON --  FORBIDDEN CAR ON TO READ TO YOU  SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID IN THE  1895 CONVENTION BY ROBERT  SMALLS. IT'S REALLY INTERESTING HERE. THESE ARE THE WORDS OF A FORMER  SLAVE. SINCE RECONSTRUCTION -- I'M  QUOTING ROBERT SMALLS -- 53,000  NEGROS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN  SOUTH. SINCE RECONSTRUCTION --  REMEMBER, RECONSTRUCTION ENDED  IN 1876.  
I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW --  NOTHING -- SHOULD HAVE BEEN  HANGED -- FOR THESE CRIMES. I WANT YOU TO BE MINDFUL OF THET WE HAVE MADE AS GOOD A  CONSTITUTION AS THE ONE WE ARE  DOING AWAY WITH. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT. THEY WERE DOING AWAY WITH THE  CONSTITUTION OF 1868 THAT GAVE  ROBERT SMALLS VERY  WELL WHAT WAS IN THE MAKING. THERE IS ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN  THAT CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION  WITH HIM WHO ALSO SERVED IN THE  CONGRESS, THOMAS E. MILLER, WHO  SERVED IN THE CONGRESS. IN ORDER TO GET HIM OUT OF THE  THIS CONSTITUTION, IN ORDER TO  GET THE RIGHT TO VOTE, YOU HAD  TO BE ABLE TO INTERPRET SECTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE  UNITED STATES. YOU CAN'T GET THE RIGHT TO VOTE  UNTIL YOU INTERPRET THE  CONSTITUTION. NOW,N, JELLYBEANS WAS IN A JAR. THESE WERE LAWS PASSED BY  STATES. AND ANYBODY WHO MAY THINK THAT  IS SILLY, TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TO  COUNT OR GUESS HOW MANY STUPID E LAWS THEY ARE PASSING ARE. AND WE, IN THIS BODY, AND MY  FRIENDS ACROSS -- ON THE OTHER  SIDE OF THIS BUILDING ARE  CONDONING THAT. SAYING THAT WE CAN'T CHANGE THIS PROCESS TO GET RID OF THAT KIND  OF SILLINESS. STUFF. LET ME GO ON TO TELL YOU WHAT  ELSE ROBERT SMALLS SAID IN HIS  SPCH. HOW CAN YOU EXPECT AN THE  INTERPRETATION BY THE MANAGER OF AN ELECTION? I GUARANTEE YOU, SOME OF I WANT EVERYBODY PUT ONE CONSTRE PART OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE OTHER JUSTICE PUT AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION. HOW DO WE GET 5-4 DECISIONS IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT? BECAUSE FIVE PEOPLE THINK ONE WAY, FOUR PEOPLE THINK THE OTHER. SOME MORNING, ROBERT SMALLS HERE, BACK IN NEGRO OR ELSE WHYD YOU IMPOSE A HIGH TAX ON IMMIGRATION AGENTS WHO MIGHT COME TO HELP THEM LEAVE? THAT'S VERY FREE-BORN ATTORNEY. HE WAS A COLLEGE GRADUATE. AND I SAID TOO THAT HE SERVED IN THE CONGRESS. AND IN THE 1895 CONVENTION, AS I TOLD HERE EARLIER, IN 1868, THE MAJORITY OF THE DELEGATES WER SIX. THOMAS MILLER TOLD THE INSTITUTIONS. BUILT AND SYSTEMS. PROVIDED FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE D EAF. AND REBUILT THE JAILS AND COURTHOUSES. IN SHORT, HE SAYS, WE CAN RECONSTR PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR EVERYBODY. AT THAT TIME THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, ONLY THE ELITE WERE PROVIDED EDUCATION. AS I SAID HERE, THEPENNEL SYSTEM HAD BEEN CREATED IN SOUTH CAROLINA BY A MAJORITY BLACK LEGISLATURE. SCHOOL TO EDUCATE THE DEAF AND MUTE. DONE BY A MAJORITY BLACK LEGISLATURE. THA. NOW, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT ROBERT SMALLS HAD TO  AND FINDING THAT THE LAW YOU PASSED ME MAY Y TO YOU. WE JUST SAW THAT LAST YEAR. IN JANUARY, WHEN GEORGIA ELECTED THE SENATOR, THE SENATOR SENATO, DAVIDURDUE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING INTERESTING ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT PEOPLE BETTER START THINKING. GEORGIA DECIDED SEVERAL YEARS AGO, I REMEMBER WHEN IT ELECTION SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU HAD -- IN GEORGIA, YOU HAD TO HAVE 50% PLUS ONE. AND THE MAN WHO PROPOSED IT ARGUED ON THE FLOOR THAT HE WAS DOING THAT IN ORDER TO DUTE, NO FULL NYE THE A BLACK PERSON D TO THE SENATE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WANTED TO HAPPEN. HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF TWO PEOPLE WERE RUNNING AND NOBODY GETS 50%, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A RUNOFF IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BETWEEN THOSE GOT A SMR DAVID PURDUE GOT THAT LAW, DAVID PURDUE WOULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED -- RE-ELECTED TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE ON THAT DAY. BACK IN NOVEMBER. HE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE RUNOFF BECAUSE HE HAD 49.8%. BUT THEY PUT IN THE LAW THAT YOU GOT TO GET TOLD PEOPLE. YOU AREN'T MAKING THIS LAW JUST FOR ME. YOU'LL WAKE UP ONE DAY AND THIS LAW IS GOING TO APPLY TO YOU. JUST ASK DAVID PURDUE. NOW ON  SIDE, THE GENTLEMAN WAS SHORTSIGHTED IN HIS DEBATE IN THE LEGISLATURE SIMPLY BECAUSE WALNOCK TBHAS THIS RUNOFF -- WAS IN THIS RUNOFF. IT WAS BLACK AGAINST PLACE. THE LAW THAT WOULD HAVE RE-ELECTED PURDUE WAS TAKEN AWAY AND THEY PUT IN PLACE A LAW THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO ENSURE HIS ELECTION AND HE LOST. AND HE LOST ON BOTH THEY SHOULD BE CAREFUL, THEY SHOULD BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL. BECAUSE WHAT MAY LOOK LIKE A GOOD THING TO DO TODAY MAY NOT BE SUCH A GOOD. I THINK, MADAM SPEAKER, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU BACK A FEW OF THESE MINUTES. I COULD GO ON. I'VE GOT SOME OTHER 1895, I JUST FREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WENT IN IN THAT CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, THE GUY WHO PUT UP THE RESOLUTION, WAS ROBERT SMALLS. THE PENAL SYSTEM THAT THEY PUT IN PLACE, THAT WAS THE ENVY OF THECONVENTION, MAJORITY BLACK PEOPLE, TRIED TO GIVE THE VOTE TO WOMEN. IN 1868. SOMETHING THAT DID NOT HAPPEN UNTIL THE 19TH AMENDMENT. OF WHAT WE MIGHT CALL  CLOSE WII CALLED IT A POINT ISN'T QUITE SD THAT WAY BUT I'M NOT THAT EQUI. FIRST THEY CAME FOR THE SOCIALISTS. AND I DID NOT SPEAK A TRADE UNI. THEN THEY CAME FOR THE JEWS. AND I DID NOT SPEAK OUT BECAUSE I WAS NOT A JEW. THEN. AND THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT TO SPEAK FOR M

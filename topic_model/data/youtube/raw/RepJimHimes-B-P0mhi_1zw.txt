I think Carrie and the other secretaries gave a very very strong defensive the deal and there there there I think very deliberately and very smartly asking that we look not at the deal in and of itself in other words you can always dream of a better deal but look at where we were when Aaron was a nuclear threshold state before this negotiation began and consider where the deal puts you in contrast to where we were and then consider the question that Frank is very very difficult to answer which is imagine not doing it where does that on those two fronts it's they're they're they're making a lot of headway I think you sound convinced yet that you've been what was a very technical thing obviously there's and look if you're a representative it's uncommon on you to hear from everybody and I don't think any of us have heard from everybody yet so I think there's a for most of us there still a process to be undertaken but from my standpoint the burden of proof given what I've learned so far is on the opponents to explain why this is really a bad deal relative to where we were and why this is a bad deal relative to where we will be if the United States unilaterally watch away from one of your colleagues came out here and expressed concerns over what he said were side deals that Iran kind of put the IE IAEA and that they carry essentially admitted in the briefing that he didn't have all the information on those is that a concern for you well it may be a concern but that's in fact the way the IAEA does and has always operated meaning the IAEA to have the confidence of the member states and the NPT agrees not to disclose everything publicly and in fact to negotiate on a bilateral basis so hey would we like to know everything that the IAEA is doing maybe so but that of course is not and has never been the way the IAE operates

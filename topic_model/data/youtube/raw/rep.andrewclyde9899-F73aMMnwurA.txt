Congressman Andrew Clyde Congressman Clyde thank you very much I want to talk about this bill you're putting forward but I want to read a quote from Twitter by using social media companies like Facebook and Twitter as private sector proxies to carry out its bidding the federal government is brazingly infringing on the American civil liberties and dangerously violating our constitution My Free Speech Defense Act ends this Injustice Congressman Clyde you're from one of the best districts the The Ninth District of Georgia one of the most conservative in not just in Georgia but the nation you're a combat veteran uh former naval officer what is driving this what is why are you all over big Tech and really working with the federal government to carry out the bidding sir oh thank you Stephen for having me you know this is a basic constitutional issue here we have been sent by the people of our district to preserve and defend their constitutional rights and the primary the most important one of all is the right of free speech and what we see that's going on is the government colluding with big Tech to silence People's First Amendment rights and that is wrong you know the Supreme Court has been very clear it has great precedence when it when this when they lay out that you may not do indirectly what you are prohibited from doing directly else the prohibition is null and void and the first amendment is alive and well it is not null and void but that's what the government's trying to do here through Facebook through through Twitter through other platforms social media platforms they are trying to silence conservative pro-gun you know pro-life voices and deny us our first amendment constitutional rights and it's wrong it has to stop and this this uh Free Speech Defense Act is a good step forward to stop this Congressman Clyde before we get into Elon Musk in these Revelations come over the last couple days because you've been working on this for a while what initiated this with you why did you get over this topic months and months ago and start working on this bill one clearly with the Democrat with Nancy Pelosi the the ability of to go anywhere was limited what what drove you to do this well uh first of all this bill is a marker it lays down you know what should happen so we're going to reintroduce this bill you're right uh in this Con congress with Nancy Pelosi at the helm uh no good Republican bill is going to go anywhere but we're about to take the majority in less than a month and so we will reintroduce this bill but we want the American people to know what we stand for and this bill I think uh screams loud and clear we will protect America's First Amendment rights from being trodden upon by the government because that's exactly what's happening and it has to be stopped how are they using big Tech how are they colluding with big Tech to do indirectly with the Constitution prohibits them from doing directly how what what was the collusion let's leave Twitter off to the side for a second but Facebook or others how were they colluding and becoming basically an arm of the federal government in in oppressing uh or suppressing free speech well first you have you know back election interference back in 2016 where you've got the FBI going to Facebook and literally having weekly meetings with Facebook telling them hey uh you're about to hear some things about uh you know uh Hunter Biden that's going to be we believe a Russian disinformation and that was completely false you know here you have the FBI literally who has Hunter Biden's laptop and they have the evidence right there of criminal activity and they are colluding you know in a conspiracy to cover this up and to to prevent the American people from seeing this and the FBI is not even doing their job there uh so they are are doing their best to cover it up so that they get their preferred candidate Joe Biden into the White House that's absolutely wrong right there you know and and then you have sisa all right who is a part of the Department of Homeland Security and I'm on that that committee right there that have has oversight of cisa creating literally a portal where Facebook and other and the DNC and others can can submit to them examples of social media posts uh where where actually sisa can submit to to um uh Facebook examples of social media posts so Facebook can cancel them you know prevent them use their algorithms to prevent them from going anywhere uh and it's inexcusable it's unconscionable it's unconstitutional it's illegal and that's what we're going to investigate come uh when we take back the majority the the system things blowing up today because it got it has a Stephen uh what Rikers Rickers out in Maricopa County it turns out he's involved with cisa they have these election officials that are that feed them info they think is misinformation tell our audience you sit on the subcommittee what is sisa and why does this have such a central point of kind of the the uh the interface or or the connective tissue between the tech companies and the federal government well CIS is the cyber security infrastructure Security Agency and you know what they're supposed to be doing their job is to help the Americans the citizens the the civilians in our country to protect them against uh foreign attacks from hacking you know from um uh being held hostage from ransomware etc those sort of things that's what sisa is supposed to do to help protect our country from ransomware attacks but for them to be involved in things like this and disinformation uh in in colluding with big Tech to silence conservative voices uh things you know information that they don't agree with that's not Sis's job in fact that is a violation of our constitution so that's incredibly concerning and it must be investigated it must be fully and Prince fully exposed and transparency must come to uh to the American people as to what sisa is doing councilman Clyde we've watched the hearings in your participation in others and I want to make sure the audience understands the difference from being in the minority and how big a deal is this actually take the majority we've seen you guys ask questions request documents you kind of get blown off what's kind of shocking is uh and I'm not saying people are perjuring themselves that all come later with her but the Congress the congressman consistently blown off by these government officials that just don't like the question or don't want to give you any information am I too far off base in that the frustration you guys have had over the last couple of years now you're absolutely right when we're in the minority especially when the Executive Branch the administration isn't in the other party then um you know the those agencies feel like oh they can slow walk the information uh they can uh heavily redact it uh you know they just don't need to really answer the questions that we we give them but in the majority we have what's called subpoena power and The subpoena power is the ultimate right there to hold them accountable they must show up they must provide us this information um and it's it's legally required and so when we're in the majority we have that and we are going to use it to its fullest extent so you've worked on this for a long time so a lot of people say hey this is kind of a Don Quixote you know tilting of windmills this will never happen then you had Elon Musk was forced to close in the crime scene that is Twitter and he's gone you know just wild over the last what week to 10 days you got my taibi have Barry Weiss uh he fired Baker yesterday he put out a tweet a little while ago before you came on saying that basically saying hey information was withheld from us and maybe even destroyed what is the example of Twitter just in the last 10 days done to reinforce your confidence that you're on the right track and that something's going to happen well you know I think what Twitter has done is they have exposed The Smoking Gun right here um and I think that's a beautiful analogy and I want to thank Elon Musk you know for exposing this and showing the American people that election interference did occur uh that criminal activity has been covered up by a government agency by the FBI by sisa uh you know and that's not right and uh I'm glad that I'm on oversight that we can investigate this expose it because once it gets exposed and we can stop it by the way oversight I think yesterday on Newsmax uh Comer Congressman Comer said hey the bank records are going to show the direct involvement of Joe Biden I mean Comer's coming in a little hot which we love but we call it zen master Jean-Pierre because she's always doing the misdirection Jujitsu uh she's kind of blown it off she's saying Andy Clyde and these guys it's old news the hunter buying things the distraction the country's got more important things to deal with he's talking about things that nobody really finds Revel irrelevant what do you have to say to the White House about this Congressman Clyde well I think uh that uh the young lady needs to get with the program here um because what's happening is and Amy Comer our soon to be chairman is spot on when he says that uh this is really not about Hunter Biden this is about Joe Biden and how compromised is the president you have these Ukrainian you know deals this money laundering this uh uh Cash Coming going back and forth in Ukraine uh from Hunter Biden and how much is Joe Biden involved not is he involved but how much is he involved how is he compromised you know when the president is compromised in the United States national security is compromised you know why are we sending billions and billions of dollars to Ukraine uh what does Ukraine have on Joe Biden you know we're gonna find those things out these bank records that Jamie Comer talked about uh they will give us a lot of that information and we need that information for proper oversight so I think it's very important and and we're going to execute on it Congressman before you got into politics you were a naval officer three combat tours you had a security clearance your Aviation Logistics officer that went to be a CV even at that level you were Lieutenant like I was when when you punched out and at your active duty time just with the security clearance you had when you look at what the compromises and the documentation that's on the laptop from hell I mean how shocked are you about that Federal authorities haven't moved on this to date that it's left to Elon Musk in war room and uh and Miranda divided the New York Post and Emma Joe Morris over at Breitbart how shocked are you being a guy that had a former security clearance and what they would have done to you with any compromise sir oh oh Steve and I'd have been buried under the jail I think if uh if I'd had done any sort of thing like this it's I you know it's absolutely inexcusable uh what we see and you know I believe in protecting our nation that's why I served that's why you served uh to protect our country to protect our Constitution and um uh with a clearance you fully understand um that you don't compromise you don't allow yourself to be compromised and that's not what's happened here you know Joe Biden I think is fully is completely compromised and we're going to find out the extent to which she has compromised Clyde I know your combat vet but tells myself because that's a pretty big charge to make against a commander-in-chief and a sitting president of the United States no matter how much War Room in our audience thinks he's illegitimate he's there uh and to say he's compromise is a pretty big charge because you know where that leads and I know where these investigations are going to lead um give us your background oh thank you Steve I'm a naval officer I started out the 11 years active 17 Reserve as a Naval Aviation Logistics officer and transitioned into the reserve as a CB Navy construction Battalion and that's where I served my three combat tours with the first Marine Expeditionary force and Second Marine as well in Iraq and Kuwait and then you know became a small business owner as a in the reserve as well and so I'm a gun store owner as well and um you know as a Navy officer you're right when you throw around terms like uh you know compromised and and you have a commander-in-chief that's that's compromised and which compromises our national security of our nation but we have evidence we have evidence of that it's on Hunter Biden's laptop uh we have other evidence uh you know through bank records suspicious activity reports or SARS there's 150 of them uh the Biden that has been attributed to the Biden family so it's very very concerning and it's things that we are going to um investigate and expose because we need to know the extent of the of the corruption and the extent of the compromise Congressman people are just now in this reason we're really thankful you step you know you car some time out for us today because we're trying to give platforms to people that the nation maybe not know even the Maga movement Congressman Comer's perfect example yourself is oversight have the titanium backbone to really get on top of these things these egregious things I mean you've you've made a uh your bill you've made a great point that I haven't heard enough that the government can't do indirectly what's prohibited from doing directly right in the city it's too cute term I hate using the term swamp because it's too cute the administrative state and its Partners now in big Global big business uh just do it blatantly right up in your grill that's what I say it's not a deep State it's an in your face State and they kind of just go around town they got the lobbyists they got the money they got the best Consultants they paid off every Law Firm so you can't even get a law firm because everybody's conflicted out because they're on the payroll does oversight do you believe uh you and the other men and women are going to step up here have the titanium steel you're going to need because you're going to take incoming like nobody else do you have the titanium steel to take these investigations and to use this oversight and to take them to their natural conclusion sir Steve I think we absolutely do beyond a shadow of a doubt I believe we will uh you know Jamie Comer is going to be a great chairman and uh I'm going to be help him lead in some of these investigations um but we have evidence hard evidence not fake evidence like the Democrats claimed on President Trump we have hard evidence on President Biden and on Hunter Biden and that extends through the entire Biden crime family we will investigate these and we will bring to the American people what we find uh and uh yeah we're going to take incoming fire I get that but that's all right I've taken incoming fire before in my life and uh and I'm okay you know um that's just part of the job it's part of what we do and um we're armored up for that too Before I Let You Go borception is going to join us here in a sec he stepped out for a meeting I really appreciate that but I got to ask you uh Georgia 9th it represented yesterday are the folks in the ninth I mean where are their

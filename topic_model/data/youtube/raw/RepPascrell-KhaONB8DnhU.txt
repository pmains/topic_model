Pascrell mr. Taylor and to also reinforce what I hope will be a worthy discussion going forward on the law enforcement trust and integrity Act which has a number wide range of civil rights groups and police groups who are already beginning to support us this bill has been introduced before and we were lucky enough to get a number of good the co-sponsors of organizations who believe in our community police cooperation I happen to come from Houston where our first african-american police chief was Lee Brown who is known as a father of community oriented policing which is the premise I believe this resolution getting to know your officers engaging with your officers and and finding a way to empower both police and community working together so the law enforcement trust integrity bill which I look forward to working with the ranking member of the full committee and ranking member the subcommittee and the chairman of the full committee and the chairman of the Subcommittee on crime deals with accreditation deals with development programs that are helpful to law enforcement processes to address questions raised and as well the medallion for the family members collection of data and what I like the profession training funding that will come about two additional professional training that many of the departments would long for and welcomed when we began to discuss it so Atria's 285 is a very important statement being made that I hope that all of my members will join too and that is that we need good police community relations we need to develop and empower the creation of police and community alliances we do it in Houston Texas we have layered officers most people have never heard of constables we have them in Texas the Rangers we still have the Rangers with historic history of course we have our police in the different cities and counties and and small towns and then we have the deputy sheriffs and sheriffs in our counties all throughout and many of these organizations do public service and barbecues and certainly we all gather together when we have a person fallen in duty and as well we continue to work when there's a tragedy dealing with civilian as well so we must do everything we can to improve the relationship between law enforcement and the communities we serve and research shows that in order to succeed we must expend the resources needed to improve communication and collaboration between law enforcement and the public there'll be many offices up this week we should see all of them and engage in a friendly and welcoming way and we should reinforce the value of having a nation of laws and those who enforce it that we're also neighbors and that we should look forward to increased community police interaction and relationships and with that I ask my colleagues to support this resolution and let us work together for good in a nation as great as America is with that I yield back my time gentlewoman from Texas yields back the question is Virginia's now recognize mr. speaker this is a good bill I urge my colleagues to support it and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back the question is will the house suspend the rules and agree to House Resolution 285 those in favor say aye those opposed no say no in the opinion of the chair 2/3 being in the affirmative the gentleman from badass yeas and nays the yeas and nays are requested all those in favor of taking this vote by the yeas and nays will rise and remain standing until counted a sufficient number having risen the yeas and nays are ordered pursuant to Clause 8 of rule 20 further proceedings on this question will be postponed purpose does the gentleman from Virginia seek recognition the Speaker I move to suspend the rules and pass HR 4850 for the justice served act of 2018 the clerk will report the title of the bill HR 4850 for a bill to amend the DNA analysis backlog Elimination Act of 2000 to provide additional resources to state and local prosecutors and for other purposes pursuant to the rule the gentleman from Virginia mr. Goodlatte and the gentlewoman from Texas miss Jackson Lee will control 20 minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia Mr Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all members may have five legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on HR 4850 for currently under consideration without objection the Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume is recognized I rise in strong support of HR 4850 for the justice served Act of 2018 introduced by the gentleman from Texas judge Carter all of us in this body are familiar with Debbie Smith and the tragedy of her attack and the triumph of the law that bears her name many of us have had the pleasure of meeting Debbie and her husband Rob and hearing her story firsthand the Debbie Smith act was the nation's first piece of legislation aimed at ending the DNA backlog that plagued our state crime labs the Debbie Smith DNA backlog grant program was created in 2004 and since then it has enabled States to process more than seven hundred and twenty five thousand cases and upload more than three hundred and twenty seven thousand DNA profiles into the FBI's combined DNA index system or CODIS I had the honor to be the chief sponsor of the Debbie Smith authorization act of 2014 when Judge Carter reached out to me about this bill I was encouraged but I also wanted to know how Debbie Smith felt about it I learned that not only did she support it she and others helped craft it when we reached out to Debbie and Rob to get their thoughts on the bill they stated getting hits doesn't mean as much if we cannot prosecute I agree with Debbie and judge Carter on this very important point the bill in front of us today makes a very small but important change to the Debbie Smith act that small change will increase the capacity of prosecutors to address the backlog of violent crime cases involving suspects identified through DNA evidence this bill will allow victims of crime and their families to receive justice by giving prosecutors the tools they need to investigate solve and close cold cases that's small but vitally important change is why the justice served Act of 2018 is endorsed by the National District Attorneys Association rape abuse and incest national network Debbie Smith Maj County sheriff's of America federal law Enforcement Officers Association sergeants benevolent associations the Fraternal Order of Police the National Association of police organizations consortium of forensic science organizations joyful Heart Association the National Alliance to End sexual violence the major cities Chiefs and the National Criminal Justice Association we in this body should join these organizations in supporting this very important piece of legislation I want to thank my friend the gentleman from Texas judge Carter for introducing this legislation and all of his hard work in supporting it to Fair to paraphrase Debbie and Rob getting a hit is nice but ensuring justice is served is better please join me in supporting the justice served act of 2018 I reserve the balance of my time the gentleman reserves his time the gentlewoman from Texas is recognized speaker is to address the house for such time as I might consume well let me from the beginning acknowledge the ranking member for being on the floor on these important bills during this police law enforcement week in commemoration these this week is one of the weeks that over the years that all of us as members have enjoyed the most seeing a lot of our law enforcement representatives from our hometown jurisdiction and just seeing them from all over the nation so I rise in support of HR 4850 for the justice served Act of 2018 thank my colleague mr. Pascrell my fellow Texan judge Carter and other members for bringing this forward this legislation would help ensure that prosecutors have the resources to go after perpetrators of violent crimes pacifically those who've been identified by DNA evidence I want to just say that again mr. speaker Violent Crimes which leave in its in its wake either the bloody loss of life or some victim that is ruined for life because of the viciousness of the crime some of their children families elderly so this is a very important element of law enforcement is a fair investigation of crimes and bringing forward the perpetrator in a fair and just and constitutional manner to do so they need tools Congress has appropriated over 100 million per year for the last decade to reduce the DNA back laws and improve a crime laboratory capacity the justice serve Act of 2018 does something unique it capitalizes on these investments by allowing a portion of the Debbie Smith grant program to be allocated to prosecute perpetrators of violent crimes mr. Goodlatte is right I remember meeting Miss Smith and the tragedy that she faced but the way in which she wanted to commit to making life better for many others and I thank her for that and as she appeared before our committee in years past according to the FBI data over a million people were victims of violent crimes nationwide and 2016 and in many of these cases especially cases involving sexual violence DNA evidence is a crucial component of the prosecuting the perpetrators the Judiciary Committee is about to begin its effort of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act of which my office has worked extensively with other members who previously had great commitment to this legislation we look forward to a bipartisan initiative and we know that in the elements of sex crimes and domestic violence the DNA kits are extremely important among other evidence that can be found prosecutors often however face large caseloads and lack the resources to properly ensure that violent crimes are adjudicated in a timely manner even when a suspect has been identified through DNA evidence HR 4850 for the Justice serve Act of 2018 encourages a resolution of this problem by providing additional resources none to take away from the important work of the purpose of the Act but to add these additional resources as are available through this legislation prosecutors need to investigate solve and close these cases giving them those resources to do some remember investigating solving and closing have the component of making sure that we do justice as well this includes additional funding for the prosecution of cold cases where new forensic technology has identified a suspect it's important to note that the need for additional funding is not is not the only problem that impacts prosecutors ability to deal with perpetrators of violent crimes but according to the rape abuse and incest national network rain the overwhelming backlog of untested DNA evidence is currently one of the biggest obstacles to prosecuting perpetrators of sexual violence based on public reports at least a hundred thousand rape kits have said untested in evidence rooms warehouses and the like these rape kits often containing DNA evidence collected through a sexual assault forensic exam medical process evidence is collected from a victim's body or clothes this evidence is a crucial factor in achieving justice and it's vital that prosecutors have this evidence so this legislation Debbie Smith act was passed to alleviate my comments that I just previously made and it's been inactive since 2004 and it's made a great impact but now we have the opportunity to use some of those resources to help move along some of these violent cases and to assist prosecutors again in the fair adjudication the jetés adjudication to bring justice to those who have suffered a violent criminal act lost their life and certainly enhanced the justice system so I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and at this time as a speaker I'll reserve the balance of my time the gentlewoman reserves the gentleman from Virginia is recognized Mr Speaker I reserve the gentleman from Virginia reserves the gentlewoman from Texas is recognized yes I am ready to yield to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey who has worked without ceasing on legislation that will help our law enforcement officers and I'd like to yield to him three and a half minutes mr. Pasquale the gentleman from New Jersey is recognized thank you mm-hmm Thank You mr. Speaker I also want to rise today in strong support of this bipartisan piece of legislation justice serves act HR 4850 for as the lead Democrat sponsor the piece of legislation in co-chair of the congressional law enforcement caucus I want to thank Judge Carter in authoring this bill currently funding is available through the Debbie Smith act to reduce the DNA rape kit backlog however these funds do not address the growing backlog in the prosecution pipeline unfortunately this backlog is occurring because resources are limited and they're not enough funds to reopen every case even when DNA analysis has identified a suspect that's not acceptable my home state of New Jersey we are well familiar with this issue due to lack resources and regulations the extent of the untested rape kit backlog in New Jersey is unknown that itself is unacceptable addressing the rape kit backlog would bring justice for the many rape victims across our state in many others victims like a 15 year old girl was assaulted while working at a deli in New Jersey a few years ago and whose assault there was finally brought to justice in 2013 using DNA evidence but only after he assaulted another young woman as a result many of the rapists going undetected are repeat offenders countless assaults could be prevented in trauma spare if we caught these perpetrators the first time and addressing the backlog and bring justice to the falsely accused as well last year we learned the story of Rodney Roberts and the Jersey man who was coerced by his own lawyer to plead guilty for the kidnapping and the rape of a 17 year old girl in 1996 despite professing his innocence for 10 years Roberts appealed to have his DNA tested against the original rape kit but prosecutors claimed there was nowhere to be found eventually the rape kit was located the DNA evidence cleared him of all wrongdoing in 2014 after he served 10 years in jail there are too many incidents at which an untested rape kit is lost prosecutors do not have resources and innocent people are armed to address this funding gap that justice served act authorizes the Debbie Smith act to provide prosecutors with the resources and the funds to reopen investigate and close cold cases going forward I will look forward to working with Judge Carter to ensure that the Debbie Smith act is properly funded so we can keep our promise to survivors of sexual assault I would like to thank the National District Attorney's associate Association the rape abuse and incest national network and Debbie Smith for this support for HR 4850 for mrs. Speaker I urge passage of the Justice serv Act thank you and I yield back the balance of my time gentleman from New Jersey yields back the gentleman from Virginia is recognized Mr Speaker I have no additional speakers

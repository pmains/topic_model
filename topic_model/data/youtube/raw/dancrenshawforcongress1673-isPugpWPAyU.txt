find our mission and then we find each other when I asked for your vote I know it was something with deep meaning every vote is an element of trust that you place in me every vote is another ounce another weight that's just upon my shoulders it reminds me of the enormous responsibility that is service to the American people your vote is a message of trust and this is a trust that I do not intend to squander Texans are a people that work hard to make sacrifices our love our neighbors love our country will live with virtue and believe in the American ideal the greatest set of ideas for a free people that the world has ever known you deserve representatives that believe that and that will embody that we all vote we all come together in our constitutional republic every election to cast our ballots we are deciding what kind of country we want to be we are making a statement about who we are what we stand for and how we are to approach governance so what do we want to be let's start with what all Americans I think can agree on we want a stronger economy and better wages we want American businesses to thrive or in an environment where a single entrepreneur can change the role with a good idea how are we getting in the way we want a country where success is praised not punished a country made up of citizens with strength and character and courage we're not a people to shatter at the first side of a fence or hardship [Applause] [Laughter] we want more affordable health care we want our doctors in charge not government bureaucrats around sure we want to know if the next time a hurricane comes our infrastructure can handle it we want smart decisive knowledgeable leaders in Washington with the right experience to take on threats from China Russia Iran and terrorists across the world representatives to understand America's special role in this world who know that America is a force for good not congressmen who rushed to be first in line to blame America for the sins of others want towns and cities where the role of law is respected where we value our police and our first responders both educate and protect our children and still in them the basic values that make our country great our work personal responsibility and love of country life liberty equal rights and we want government to be there to protect those inalienable rights bestowed upon us by God freedom of speech of religion of fair trial and the right to own property and defend ourselves on that Robert whoa so the question then becomes in every election how do we get there our guiding light our anchor for the difficult decisions that we must make or America's foundational principles it's personal responsibility its individual freedom its limited government and it's in god we trust' that's written in the halls of Congress to that coin in your pocket because we figured out a long time ago back in 1776 when our founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal that in order for a diverse people to live together in a complex society we must empower the individual not divide people into tribal groups separated by race or gender or class the miracle of American exception is 'm exceptionalism is the ability of a diverse people to live peacefully together and prosper more than any other nation in the history of mankind this country it was America that ushered in a century of prosperity and defeated the murderous socialist ideologies of communism and Nazism it is America that has stood up for the free market and the idea that you own your own labor and your property and you are free to enter into an agreement with any stranger should you both benefit from that transaction it is this simple idea that has caused poverty to plummet and tribal warfare and suffering to decrease to the lowest levels in human history is this idea that gives us the miracle of a supercomputer in your pocket a store full of food to buy cheaply and conveniently or a home that can be heated or cooled with the flip of a switch over a billion people have been lifted out of poverty in the last 25 years alone and the ideas that seek to protect liberty and human rights and prosperity has been underwritten by one country in one country along the United States of America [Applause] America is a compilation of the best ideas from throughout human history it is the ultimate conservative experiment in the sense that conservatives show a natural gratitude and appreciation of the past trials and tribulations rusul and taught us about a purposeful moral existence under God Athens brought us the gift of Reason Rome taught us the importance of laws and respect for founding virtues London taught us that all men are subject to law even kings and that balance of power and checks and balances are paramount to Liberty the lessons of Jerusalem and Rome and Athens in London during the Enlightenment were encapsulated in Philadelphia where mankind finally understood that inalienable rights were given by God and that the government's purpose was simply to protect those rights not change them we're Patriots we believe that the ideals that our country was founded on are the right ones that doesn't make us perfect we don't always live up to those ideals and we have work to do but when we struggle and when we feel lost and we feel as if our country is on the brink the last thing we should do is throw out the very foundations that our country have made our country great in Texas we still believe in those foundations I think that most Americans do but sometimes sometimes we need a reminder a reminder of the things that bring us together a reminder of all that is good in this world and a reminder of the incredible things that we have accomplished more than any other people in the history of humankind that's what we voted on today and as a team that was the message we spread it became the dream that we shared you all became part of that dream and it caught fire and people were reminded of the good things the great things that make up the American spirit I have great faith that when we leave here tonight we will not rest we will not be satisfied with this victory we're going to keep going or you keep sharing that dream we're gonna keep fighting for the values that made our country great and keep us free thank you for your support thank you for your trust tomorrow we're back at work [Applause] we can't possibly take pictures with everybody at night so this is all ready to do [Applause] everybody to get in the selfie mode right now get in a selfie mode already taking pictures that way to get into something Donovan let's do it right here

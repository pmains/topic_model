thank you Mr President Mr President across the street this morning oral arguments are occurring at the Supreme Court in two challenges to the president's Reckless student loan giveaway there are two main parts to the president's scheme there is the outright forgiveness of ten thousand dollars in federal student debt twenty thousand dollars for Pell Grant recipients which is set to cost American taxpayers somewhere in the neighborhood of half a trillion dollars and then there's the president's radical revamp of the income driven repayment system which will bring the total cost for the president's plan to somewhere close to a trillion dollars the president's new income driven repayment plan is probably garnered less attention than the than his plans for student loan forgiveness but as new income driven repayment program is just as problematic because it sets up a system in which the majority of federal borrowers will never never fully repay their loans one scholar at the Brookings Institute Institution left of center Think Tank estimates that and I quote the vast majority end quote of college students will be eligible for the program and that current and future borrowers enrolled in the program quote on average might only expect to repay approximately 50 cents for each dollar that they borrow end quote repay approximately 50 cents for each dollar they borrow the urban Institute another left of center Think Tank estimates that just 22 percent of those with bachelor's degrees enrolled in the president's new income driven repayment program we'll repay their loans in full by contrast the Institute notes that under today's IDR program we would expect 59 percent of individuals with bachelor's degrees to repay their loans in full Mr President the non-partisan pin Wharton budget model estimates the cost of the president's new income driven repayment program at 333 billion dollars to 361 billion dollars the range over 10 years however Penn Wharton notes that I and I quote again these estimates do not yet include the effects of students increasing their borrowing end quote these estimates do not yet include the effects of students increasing their borrowing and needless to say students are likely to increase their borrowing it's common sense in fact the Brookings institution notes that borrowing is likely to become the preferred means of paying for college under the president's plan and of course as student borrowing increases so does the cost to taxpayers because it is taxpayers who will be footing the bill for all that student loan money that's never paid back Mr President both President Biden's outright student loan forgiveness and his student loan forgiveness masquerading as income driven repayment are going to cost the taxpayers a lot of money there are the direct costs of the plan that will be paid for by the federal government in other words by taxpayers including those who never went to college and those who have already paid off their student loans and there are the indirect costs like the fact that the present student loan giveaway is likely to prolong our current inflation crisis the committee for a responsible federal budget where President Biden's own treasury secretary once served on the board has estimated that the president's plan would and I quote meaningfully boost inflation end quote meaningfully boost inflation now you would think that the president might have learned his lesson after helping to set off the worst inflation crisis in 40 years with his massive American Rescue plan spending spree but apparently not and Mr President it's important to remember that taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for student loan cancellation of Americans for Americans they should say who if they graduated from college enjoy greater long-term earning potential than many of the Americans who will be helping to shoulder the burden for their debts this isn't a government handout for the needy this is a government handout that will disproportionately benefit American Americans who are better off and of course Mr President the president's student loan giveaway will do nothing nothing to address the root of the problem and that is soaring College costs in fact it's likely to make things worse faced with the knowledge that many of their students will never have to fully pay off their loans colleges will have zero incentive to cut costs and students are likely to feel less pressure to choose a more affordable College option since there's a good chance that they will only have to pay back part of their student loan debt it might even have it forgiven entirely it's not hard to imagine a future Democrat president deciding that it's politically expedient to imitate President Biden and just cancel a huge portion of student loan debt outright especially since College costs in college debt will continue to soar under the president's plan Mr President whether President Biden has the legal authority to implement the debt cancellation he proposed is really questionable he used a law called the heroes act drafted to give the president authority to provide student loan relief in times of war or National Emergency and specifically to provide relief to the large number of soldiers deployed to the Middle East in the wake of September 11th it was not intended to provide for widespread student loan forgiveness in a time of peace in low unemployment the president himself raised questions about his authority to forgive student loans in a 2021 town hall meeting the former Democrat Speaker of the House stated plainly plainly that the president didn't have this Authority in between bullying from the far left and the prospect of gaining votes in the 22 elect 2022 elections the president went ahead anyway and now now taxpayers will be saddled with close to an additional trillion dollars in debt on top of the other Reckless spending by the bind Administration and the democrat congress Mr President it's not just Republicans who have raised serious concerns about the president's student loan plans so has the Washington Post and at least one scholar at the left of center Brookings Institution and the nonpartisan committee for responsible federal budget where as I said earlier the president's own treasury treasury secretary once served and the list goes on the president's student loan giveaway is yet another disastrous economic plan coming from the Biden Administration and Mr President if it goes into effect it will be the American taxpayers who once again will be paying the price Mr President I yield the floor
